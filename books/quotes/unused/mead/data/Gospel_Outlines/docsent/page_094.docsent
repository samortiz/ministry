   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I get.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In essence, in his prayer he was asking God to thank him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because of self-righteousness, he was saying, I am not like other people.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nearly all the religious people are self-righteous; so are moral people.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nearly all the immoral, sinful people have a humble feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The results of self-righteousness and self-abasing The one who humbled himself was justified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Humbling oneself is not a virtue but a confession which affords God a chance to grant His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The self-righteous one was condemned, because self-righteousness shuts off God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ has accomplished redemption.</S>
