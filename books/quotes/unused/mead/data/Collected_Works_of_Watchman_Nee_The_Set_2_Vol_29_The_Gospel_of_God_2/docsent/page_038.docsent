   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUFFETING THE BODY TO PLEASE THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another passage which some misinterpret as referring to perdition actually refers to the losing of the kingdom and the losing of the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 9:23-27 says, "And I do all things for the sake of the gospel that I may become a fellow partaker of it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Run in this way, that you may lay hold.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And everyone who contends, exercises self-control in all things; they then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I therefore run in this way, not as though without a clear aim; I box in this way, not as though beating the air; but I buffet my body and make it my slave, lest perhaps having preached to others, I myself may become disapproved."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul feared that, having preached to others, he himself might be disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here Paul was saying that he could also be disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is the meaning of being disapproved here?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And of what is one being disapproved?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In these messages, we have emphasized the fact that in reading the Bible, one should pay attention to the context.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here we must also consider the context.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 24 Paul likens himself to one who is running in a race in which only one will get the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the problem here is not a matter of salvation, but a matter of receiving the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul is talking about how a saved one can receive the prize; he is not talking about how an unsaved one can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only the ones who are saved, who have believed in the Lord Jesus, who are reborn, and who have become the children of God are qualified to enter the race.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only the children of God can run in the race and pursue the prize that God intends for us to gain.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If someone is not a child of God, he will not be qualified even to enter the race.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nowhere does the Bible say that salvation is gained by our running the race.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible never says that if someone is able to run, he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If that were so, then very few could be saved, and salvation would be dependent on works.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible says that the prize comes from the running; God has placed us on a racecourse for us to run the race.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is the prize?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 25 says, "And everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; they then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here it says that the prize is a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have mentioned that the crown signifies glory and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the word "disapproved" does not refer to the losing of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word "disapproved" means to fail to receive the crown and the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If Paul could be disapproved, then we all have the possibility of being disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If Paul had the possibility of losing his prize and losing his crown, then each one of us also has the possibility of losing the prize and the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 26 indicates the reason for being disapproved: "I therefore run in this way, not as though without a clear aim; I box in this way, not as though beating the air."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul had a purpose and a direction.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was not beating the air.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His goal and direction were what he said in 2 Corinthians 5, that he was ambitious to be well-pleasing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whether he would live or die on this earth, his desire was to please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How did he run in the race?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He did not run in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He had a definite direction and a definite goal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was not beating the air.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He did not simply do whatever others told him to do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nor did he do something simply because the need was there.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If he were to work according to the need, he would have to run day and night, for the need was too great.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are not for the work, but for pleasing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we want to receive the prize, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"But I buffet my body and make it my slave."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many would place their own bodies above the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many would place their own bodies above the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But Paul said that he subjected his body; he was able to control it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul could control the lust of his body, the excessive demands of his body, and the desires of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He did not let his body get on top.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He said that he buffeted his body and made it his slave.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whether or not a Christian can please the Lord depends upon whether he can control his body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many people cannot control their own bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever a little stimulus comes to their body, all kinds of sins result.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must see that all those who cannot control their own bodies will lose their prize and their crown.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although they can preach the gospel to others, they themselves will be disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We believers are saved once and for all and will never lose our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But when the Lord Jesus returns in His glory to rule the earth, He will not give crowns to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the new heaven and new earth, although every saved one will receive the same glory, when the Lord Jesus comes to rule on this earth for a thousand years, some will lose their prize, their authority, and their glory.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some will not be able to enter the kingdom and will not be able to receive a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord's word is very clear concerning the matters of salvation and eternal life: both are totally of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Moreover, whether or not one can enter into the kingdom of the heavens depends upon his works.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have just seen that we have to do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Here we see that we have to buffet our own body.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We may do many works outwardly, but as long as we do not restrict our body, we will not be allowed into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the Bible there seems to be a fixed number of crowns.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Revelation 3:11 says, "I come quickly; hold fast what you have that no one take your crown."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some who do not understand the Bible do not know the difference between a reward and a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Neither do they know the difference between the crown and God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They think that salvation can be taken away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The word "take" here does not refer to salvation but to the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>One can be saved yet still lose the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There was a very sensational headline in the news recently.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A certain king of a certain country had lost his crown.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If a saved one does not hold fast to what he has, if he does not keep the words of endurance of the Lord Jesus, and if he forsakes the name of the Lord Jesus, he will lose his crown some day.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you are loose, and if you do not hold fast, you will lose your crown.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Someone else might take away your crown from you.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Revelation 2:10 has a word similar to this: "Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Here it does not say give life, but give the crown of life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Life is obtained through faith; it is not obtained through faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If a person does not have faith, he cannot have life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But if a person is unfaithful after he has life, he will lose the crown of life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Hence, if a Christian does not have good works after being saved, though he will not lose life, he will nevertheless lose the crown.</S>
