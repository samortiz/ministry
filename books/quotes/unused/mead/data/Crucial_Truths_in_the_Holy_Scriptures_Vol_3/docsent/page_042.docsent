   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A wife is bound for so long a time as her husband lives 1 Cor 7:39 .</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the apostle Paul spoke this word, he must have been single.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do not know if he ever married.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At this time he thought it best if widows do not remarry but remain single as he was in order to concentrate on serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If they could not, they could remarry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is better to remarry than to force oneself to remain single.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First Corinthians was written early in his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When he wrote 1 Timothy in his later years, his manner of speaking about this matter changed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He must have observed that it was difficult for young widows, who could be easily tempted by Satan, to remain single.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, at that time he wanted younger widows to marry, bear children, and keep house to give no opportunity for Satan to tempt them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, he also commanded that widows be sixty years old before the church enrolled them for assistance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Younger widows were to be refused because the church could not know whether she would remain single as a widow in need of assistance.</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must pay particular attention to the Lord s word no longer two.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This corresponds to a man and a woman being joined together to be a complete person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since two are joined as one, they should not be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to the Lord s word, this yoking is God s work; it is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, man may not separate them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>People today have no problem with divorce, but the Lord says, No!</S>

   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Marriage is one; if it becomes two through divorce, there is confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, unless a man s wife commits adultery, he may not divorce her and marry another.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If he divorces his wife and marries another for any matter other than adultery, he breaks the oneness of marriage and commits adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Everyone who divorces his wife, except for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries her who has been divorced commits adultery Matt 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If a wife commits adultery, she is an adulteress.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If she does not commit adultery but her husband divorces her, forcing her to marry another, he causes her to commit adultery since she may not marry again while he is living.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If she marries again, she breaks the oneness of marriage, commits adultery, and becomes an adulteress.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Whoever marries her also breaks the oneness of marriage and therefore commits adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is something that must not be done.</S>

   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If they do, they break the oneness of marriage and commit adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This breaks God s ordination and destroys what God has yoked.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God does not approve of this.</S>
