<h1 class="title">THE MYSTERY OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:4-5, 9; Col. 1:25-27; 2:2</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A HIDDEN MYSTERY</h2>
<p>The purpose of the universe and the purpose for which all things were created are indeed a mystery, which mankind cannot understand. The purpose of man&rsquo;s existence and the meaning of human life are also a mystery, which philosophers have failed to understand.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that all things were created by God. He created all things with a purpose and intention. However, this purpose and intention have been hidden in Him (Eph. 3:9) and were not made known to man. Hence, the purpose and intention of God in His creating the universe are a mystery that is hidden in Him.</p>
<p>Although man can perceive the existence and the power of the Creator by the things that He made (Rom. 1:20), man cannot understand the purpose and intention of the Creator. By studying the structure of his physical body, man can realize how wonderfully God created man, but man cannot understand the meaning of his existence. Ungodly people, who are far away from God, cannot understand the purpose of God&rsquo;s creation, and even those who fear Him and are close to Him are not clear concerning the purpose of creation. This is a mystery that has been hidden in God and was not made known to men in other generations (Eph. 3:5).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF THE MYSTERY</h2>
<p>However, in the New Testament age God has revealed this mystery to us in spirit (v. 5). This mystery is no longer hidden; it has been manifested. The purpose of creation and the meaning of human life are no longer a hidden mystery; they are a revelation that has been manifested. The heavenly veil has been opened. God has opened Himself to us; He has shown us the mystery that was hidden in Him so that we may know the purpose of His creation and understand the meaning of human life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERY OF GOD BEING CHRIST</h2>
<p>Christ is the mystery that has been hidden in God. Christ is also the purpose that has been hidden in God. God created the universe for Christ, and He created mankind for Christ. Christ is the purpose of creation and also the meaning of human life. Without Christ, creation has no purpose, and human life has no meaning. Without Christ, creation is without a center, and human life is vanity. Hence, in order to know the purpose of creation and to understand the meaning of human life, we must know Christ, and in order to apprehend the center of creation and to have reality in our human life, we must obtain Christ. When we know and obtain Christ, we will understand and obtain human life and all things, because &ldquo;Christ is all and in all&rdquo; (Col. 3:11). Christ is the content of all things, the reality in all things, and the answer to all things. Without Christ all is vanity and problematic. Christ is the mystery of God. God is a mystery, and the revelation of this mystery is Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST IN US</h2>
<p>Christ, the mystery of God, is now in us, the believers. He is God&rsquo;s purpose and intention. God caused Christ to enter into us so that Christ can be our life, the purpose of our human existence, and the meaning of our human life. Christ is not merely in God; He is also in us. He is not merely God&rsquo;s life and purpose; He is also our life and our purpose. Christ is the mystery hidden in God, and He is also the mystery hidden in us.</p>
<p>God created the universe and all things, including mankind, so that Christ could enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life and so that Christ would be the center of the universe and of all things. Before Christ came, God did not reveal His intention to man. However, now that Christ has become the Spirit to enter into us and to dwell in us, we not only know God&rsquo;s purpose in creating all things; we can also live in this purpose. By entering into us, Christ causes us to be people who are in God&rsquo;s purpose, and by living in us, He enables us to live in God&rsquo;s purpose. Christ is God&rsquo;s mystery, purpose, and center; hence, when He enters into us, God&rsquo;s mystery, purpose, and center also enter into us. As a result, we are no longer people without a purpose in our human life or without a center in our living. Christ is in us to be not only our life but also our purpose and our center. When we let Christ live in us and when we live by Him, we become people in God&rsquo;s purpose. This is glorious!</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST IN US BEING A MYSTERY</h2>
<p>Although Christ as God&rsquo;s mystery has been revealed to us, Christ in us is still a mystery to the people in the world. Our holiness, patience, and love are Christ in us. He is also the power that enables us to live out these virtues. This has been revealed to us, but it is mysterious to those in the world. The Christ who dwells in the believers is the power that enables the church to testify for the Lord and the courage that enables the church to suffer persecution. This is clear to the believers but a mystery to the world. The Christ who lives in us makes us glorious before God but mysterious before men. Christ in us is now a glorious mystery, but He will be a glorious manifestation in the future.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
