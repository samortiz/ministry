<h2 class="head2">K'un-ming, Yunnan Province</h2><p>After the first air raid in K'un-ming, most of the citizens were dispersed to the villages. They return to the city at night. A few days ago the city was quite deserted. But it is now gradually coming back to life. Mrs. Nee (Watchman's mother) and Mrs. Nee (Watchman's wife) left for Hong Kong on the twenty-second of last month. I heard that Brother Lin Yau-huei from Kweilin is being relocated and is applying to come back to K'un-ming. Last Lord's Day we had the eighth baptism in K'un-ming (with six brothers and nine sisters). The lease for the meeting hall is up. Because of the turmoil, we do not intend to rent any place for the moment; instead, we will conduct the meetings in the brothers' and sisters' homes. The prayer and gospel meeting on Wednesday night is held at Mrs. Yin's house at the following address: [omitted]. The Bible study meeting or the meeting for testimony and edification on Friday and the bread-breaking meeting on the Lord's Day are held at Brother Hwang Tsung's house. A small number of brothers and sisters have moved into the country. Everyone is preserved and safe. I have been staying at home to do some literature work, to have some spiritual time with the Lord, and to engage in some personal preaching and counseling.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />K. H. Weigh, evening, October 10</p><h2 class="head2">Hong Kong</h2><p>Mrs. Tseng is still in Hong Kong. Sister Ro-chen is still in Macao, and her letter said that she is engaged in personal work. Brother Ma Mu and his wife are staying in Macao. The senior Mrs. Nee and Sisters Yu Shu-jen and Rachel Lee arrived in Hong Kong from K'un-ming on September 29. Brother Stephen Kaung completed his work in Swatow and returned to Hong Kong. The address of the meeting in Hong Kong changed on August 1 to [omitted]. News of the churches and correspondence can be sent to P. O. Box 1664. The work here is being carried on as usual. On the Lord's Day morning we have the gospel meeting, and the opportunity is great. The number in attendance is also high. Unless the Spirit does His own work, no one can repent and turn to the Lord. From October 3 to 8 there will be a special gospel meeting at the meeting hall for the women. The senior Mrs. Nee and Sisters Rachel Lee and Yu Shu-jen will be responsible for them. We intend to rent a sign in the busiest section of Hong Kong to be used for a gospel billboard. We intend to put Scripture verses made of neon lights on it so that the pedestrians and those on the ferries can see it. May the Lord lead us. Thank the Lord that we have prepared quite a bit for this work. But we pray that the Lord will bless this so that it will glorify His own name. Please pray for all these matters. Peace to you in the Lord!</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Ho Nai-yee, October 5, 1938</p><h2 class="head2">Manila</h2><p>I have not corresponded with you for a long time, partly because both my wife and I have been very busy and partly because we do not know where you are. A few days ago we received a copy of The Open Door, and figured that you would be in Chungking by now. Enclosed please find X dollars for you, for the Lord's workers in central and west China, and for brothers and sisters in need. Please distribute it on our behalf. Our whole family is well, thank the Lord! Brother Simon Meek travels often to different parts of the Philippines for evangelism. Today he is leaving again and will not return for a few weeks. The Lord willing, one worker, Brother Wu, will come to Manila from Chuanchow soon to join Brother Meek in his work. We hope that Brother Witness Lee can come also, because this place needs workers like Brother Lee to come and edify the believers. Please bring this matter to prayer before the Father. Greetings to you and to the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Lin En-hung, September 7</p><h2 class="head2">Yung-Ping, Malaysia</h2><p>Thank the Lord that the church in Yung-Ping rented a meeting hall on April 1. There are about thirty brothers and sisters, of which about one-third are baptized. The work here has witnessed the Lord's blessing. On the Lord's Day we have a gospel meeting at ten o'clock. In the afternoon we have the bread-breaking meeting at two o'clock. On Thursday we have a prayer meeting. I sent X dollars on the twenty-first of this month. It is to be used for the expense of The Open Door and for helping the saints in difficulty.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Cheng Kwang-ju, September 23</p>
