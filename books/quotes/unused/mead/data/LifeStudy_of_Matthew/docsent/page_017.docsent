   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Y. Zerubbabel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ezra 5:1 and 2 say that Zerubbabel was one of the leaders who returned to Jerusalem from the captivity at Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that he was a leader in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was also a leader in the rebuilding of God s temple Zech 4:7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without this return from captivity, it would have been impossible for Christ to be born at Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Old Testament definitely predicted that Christ, as the descendant of David, would be born in Bethlehem Matt 2:4-6; Micah 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose none of the people of Israel had returned to Judah, and the time came for Christ to be born at Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No one would have been there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we can understand why God commanded the captives to return.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s commandment that the captives return was not only for the rebuilding of the temple but also the preparation for Christ to be born in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is exactly the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some may ask, What is the difference between remaining at Babylon and returning to Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Isn t it the same, as long as we worship God and walk in the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It may be all right with you, but it is not all right with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ needs some people to bring Him to Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You may worship God and you may walk in the spirit in Babylon, but be assured that Christ could never be born into humanity through you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This requires a specific place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You must return from Babylon to Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the time came for the Lord Jesus to be born, some Israelites, descendants of the returned captives, were waiting in Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At that time, Joseph and Mary were not in Babylon; they were in Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For Christ to come to earth, some of His captured people had to return.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For His second coming, Christ also needs some of His captured people to return from their captivity to the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Z. Jacob Begetting Joseph</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The genealogy here says, Jacob begot Joseph v. 16 , but Luke 3:23 says, Joseph, the son of Heli.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whose son was Joseph?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Luke s record says as was supposed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A literal translation would be as to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that Joseph was not actually the son of Heli, but was reckoned as his son according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Joseph was the son-in-law of Heli, Mary s father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This might have been a case according to Numbers 27:1-8 and 36:1-12, in which a regulation was made by God that if any parents had only daughters as heirs, their inheritance should go to the daughters; the daughters then must marry a man of their own tribe in order to keep their inheritance within that tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we did not have Matthew chapter one we may wonder why such a record exists.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we see that this is not merely the record of a certain regulation; it is a matter related to Christ, because the virgin daughter who brought forth Christ was such a case.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We believe that Mary s parents had no sons and that she inherited her parent s heritage and married Joseph, a man of the same tribe, the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even the regulation in Numbers 27 and 36 is related to the genealogy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Either directly or indirectly the whole Bible is a record of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>AA.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Joseph the Husband of Mary,</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>of Whom Jesus Was Born</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At this point, the record of this genealogy does not say Joseph begot Jesus, as mentioned of all the foregoing persons; it says, Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus v. 16 . Jesus was born of Mary, not of Joseph, since it was prophesied that Christ would be the seed of a woman and born of a virgin Gen 3:15; Isa 7:14 . Christ could not have been born of Joseph, because Joseph was a man and a descendant of Jeconiah, of whose descendants none could inherit the throne of David Jer 22:28-30 . If Christ had been born of Joseph, he would have been excluded from the throne of David.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, Mary was a virgin Luke 1:27 and a descendant of David Luke 1:31-32 , the right person of whom Christ should be born.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The marriage of Joseph with Mary brought him into relationship with Christ and united into one the two lines of Christ s genealogy for the bringing forth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we need to examine the chart p.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>52 which shows that the generation of Christ begins from God and continues until it reaches Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first name is God, and the last name is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It proceeds from God to Adam, from Adam to Abraham, from Abraham through Isaac and Jacob and on to David.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After David, it is divided into two lines, the first running from Nathan to Mary and the second from Solomon to Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eventually, in God s sovereignty, these two lines are brought together by the marriage of Mary to Joseph to bring forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we spend time to consider this chart, we shall realize how wonderful is God s sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All marriages are under God s sovereignty, especially marriages related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From God to David the genealogy was one line, and from David to Jesus it was two lines; yet these two lines were united through the marriage of Joseph and Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Jesus who was brought forth by Mary fulfills the prophecies: the prophecy concerning the seed of woman Gen 3:15 ; the prophecy of a virgin bringing forth a son Isa 7:14 ; the prophecy of Abraham having a seed who would bring blessing to all the nations Gen 22:18 ; the prophecy to Isaac and Jacob, which was the same as the prophecy made to Abraham Gen 26:4; 28:14 ; the prophecy made to Judah that Judah would be the royal tribe Gen 49:10 ; and the prophecy made to David 2 Sam 7:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although the birth of Jesus fulfilled many prophecies in the Old Testament, He was not the descendant of Jeconiah.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Seemingly, the descendants of Jeconiah were still in the royal line.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But according to God s sovereignty, Mary, the mother of Jesus, married Joseph, a descendant of Jeconiah, who seemed to be in the line of the royal family.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Apparently, Jesus was the descendant of Jeconiah; actually, He was not.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He was the descendant of David.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only God can arrange such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Praise Him!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you consider your history, the history of your salvation, you will see that the principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do not think that the marriage of Joseph and Mary was an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It was no accident; rather it was planned by the sovereign hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Likewise, your association with Christ your salvation was not an accident; it also was planned by the divine hand.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sometimes I have thanked the Lord and said to Him, I am so happy that You did not put me on earth in 20 B.C., but in the twentieth century.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You put me on this earth in a place where the missionaries came with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>One day I was born of a Christian mother.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Later, I was given the opportunity to hear the gospel, and I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This was no accident.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Neither was your association with Christ an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God carefully planned it all.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God has arranged all this for little people like us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is not an insignificant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When we enter eternity, we may be very surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We may shout, Praise the Lord!</S>
