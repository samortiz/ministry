   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT AS THE LIFE SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some Christians view the ministry of the Spirit primarily as a ministry of the Spirit as power.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They expect that when they speak in the power of the Spirit, a large number of people will be gained for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But the ministry of the Spirit in 2 Corinthians 3 is a ministry of the Spirit as life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My ground for saying this is found in verse 6, where Paul says that God made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, not of letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here Paul does not say that the Spirit gives power, performs miracles, or imparts gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He declares that the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Elsewhere in this chapter the Spirit is also related to life, not to power, gifts, or miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This understanding of the Spirit as the life supply is confirmed by Paul s word in Philippians 1:19: For I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this verse Paul does not speak of the bountiful power or the bountiful ability.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, he speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I emphasize this point because many Christians have a mistaken concept of the Spirit and think of the Spirit mainly as a source of power, ability, or impact.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, some groups stress the matter of what is called being slain in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One woman was especially well known in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Is that the Spirit as the life supply?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Certainly not.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not long after I began to minister in this country in 1962, I was invited to speak to a Christian group in San Diego.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some of the people there encouraged me to go to a certain place in Texas where many miraculous things were supposedly happening.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The claim was made that, in a miraculous way, someone s teeth had been filled with gold and that others attending the meeting even smelled the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, when I questioned them, they were not able to confirm that report.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, I told them that if such a thing actually happened, it would be reported in the newspapers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I went on to say that if our God wanted to fill our teeth, why would He simply not recover them in a proper way instead of using gold?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our God certainly would never heal someone s teeth by filling them with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not listen to such false reports.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 2 Corinthians Paul does not speak of gifts or miracles, but he does say that the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1 Corinthians Paul mentions tongue-speaking, for example, with the intention of limiting this practice in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But in 2 Corinthians he does not say a word about speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The emphasis in this book is on the Spirit as the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The ministry of the new covenant is a matter of the Spirit as the supply inwardly and of righteousness as God s expression outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE MINISTRY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 2 Corinthians 3:8 Paul speaks of the ministry of the Spirit, and in verse 9, of the ministry of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may understand what the ministry of the Spirit is, but what is the ministry of righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do you know what Paul means by this?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Years ago, I could not understand what Paul meant by the ministry of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I thought that by the ministry of righteousness he meant the ministry of justification, since in this chapter there seems to be a comparison between condemnation and justification, which is the opposite of condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But instead of justification, Paul here speaks of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If he had said that the new covenant ministry was a ministry of justification, it would be easy to understand his meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We would immediately see that the ministry of the law was to condemn: that is the ministry of condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the new covenant ministry is to justify people: this is the ministry of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since Paul in 2 Corinthians 3 says that the new covenant ministry is a ministry of righteousness, not a ministry of justification, we must try to understand his meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be sure, it is a very significant matter that the ministry of the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we would understand what the ministry of righteousness is, we must first have a proper understanding of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Righteousness is a matter of being right.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we have the Spirit living, moving, and acting within us in a way that is real and substantial, we are automatically right with God, with others, and with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This understanding of righteousness is correct, but it is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, we must go on to see something further regarding righteousness.</S>
