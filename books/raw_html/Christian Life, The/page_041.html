<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Death of Christ Coming to His Believers<br>through His Redemption</H2><P>The death of Christ comes to His believers through His redemption, and all His believers have been redeemed that they may enjoy the salvation of His life (Rom. 5:10; 2 Cor. 5:14-15). Christ accomplished redemption on the cross. His death was a redeeming death. A positive, wonderful, good, and excellent death has come to us. If we reject this death, we will suffer the negative death in Adam.</P><P>The purpose of Christ's death is not that we may go to heaven. Even the heavens have been redeemed by Christ's death. Colossians 1:20 says that Christ's death has reconciled all things, including the things in the heavens. Satan's rebellion contaminated also the heavens, so even the heavens needed to be reconciled to God. Reconciliation is for the enemy, so all the created things, including the heavens, were enemies to God. Through His redeeming death, Christ reconciled all things to Himself. All His believers have been redeemed that they may enjoy the salvation of His life. Adam's death brought us into death. Christ's death, however, brought us into life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE DEATH OF CHRIST BEING THE REDEEMING<br>AND LIFE-RELEASING AND LIFE-IMPARTING DEATH</H2><P>The death of Christ is the redeeming and life-releasing and life-imparting death. The redeeming death is on the negative side. The life-releasing and life-imparting death is on the positive side. Hence, Christ's death is all-inclusive.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. On the Negative Side</H2><P>The redeeming death of Christ is on the negative side.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Dealing with Sin</H2><P>Christ's death dealt with sin. There are three aspects to His dealing with sin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. To Put Away Sin in Our Nature</H2><P>Christ dealt with sin in His death to put away sin in our nature (Heb. 9:26; Rom. 8:3b). Men are sinners because sin is in their nature. A fruit tree does not learn how to bring forth fruits. It brings forth fruits spontaneously out of its nature. Similarly, men always lie because sin is in their nature. There is not a trade school teaching people how to lie. Parents may warn their children not to lie, but the children lie spontaneously in many ways. Children do not learn to lie. They were born to lie because sin is within them.</P><P>Hebrews 9:26 says that Christ "has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself." This refers to the putting away of sin in our nature. Then Romans 8:3 says that Christ, in His death on the cross, "condemned sin in the flesh." When Christ became flesh, according to Romans 8:3, He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He did not have the sin of the flesh (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15). But our flesh is the flesh of sin. Our flesh is constituted with sin. It is a sinful flesh. Through Christ's crucifixion in the flesh, God condemned sin, which was brought by Satan into man's flesh, into man's nature.</P>
