   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PORTRAIT OF THE KINGDOM A. The Israel of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Having Defeated God s Enemy</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we shall consider the portrait of the kingdom in Exodus 18.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we have indicated, the kingdom comes in after God s enemy, Amalek, which typifies the flesh, has been defeated 17:13-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The New Testament reveals that the kingdom comes when God s chosen people have defeated His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before the kingdom is presented in Exodus 18, God s enemy within us, typified by Amalek, is defeated in chapter seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. The Gentiles Coming to Praise God</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>and Worship Him</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible also indicates that when the kingdom comes as a result of the defeat of God s enemy, the Gentiles who are seeking God will come to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These Gentiles are represented by Jethro 18:1, 5, 10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jethro, Moses father-in-law, was a priest of Midian.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Judges 6:3, the Midianites were close to the Amalekites.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Midianites and the Amalekites were somewhat mixed together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the Amalekites were defeated, certain of the Midianites came to God s people in a very godly way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jethro was a priest not of idols, but of the true God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He praised God, worshipped God, and offered sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, Jethro represents the Gentiles who turn to God and become seekers of God in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>C. The Church Participating in the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the kingdom comes, the church participates in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In fact, the church will be the ruling authority in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In chapter eighteen the church is represented by Zipporah, the wife of Moses secured by him during his rejection by Israel 2:13-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A number of Bible students realize that Zipporah typifies the Gentile church gained by Christ during the time of His rejection by the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even today Christ is still rejected by the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>During this period of rejection, Christ gains the Gentile church, taken out from the Gentile world, just as Moses gained a Gentile wife.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus far in chapter eighteen we have three main points: the defeat of the enemy, the coming of the Gentiles to worship God, and the church represented by Zipporah.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Putting these points together, we have a picture of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some may disagree with the claim that the kingdom is portrayed in chapter eighteen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, we are not going too far when we make this claim.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If Paul had not told us that the Passover was a portrait of Christ, who would have had the boldness to say this?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The apostle Paul took the lead to allegorize the book of Exodus when he told us that Christ is our Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, the manna and the smitten rock are also types of Christ, and the water from the rock is a type of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have also pointed out that in chapter seventeen Amalek signifies the flesh, Moses signifies the ascended Christ interceding for us, and Joshua typifies the indwelling Spirit fighting for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With all this as the background, it is proper to say that Jethro and Zipporah in chapter eighteen also have a typical significance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Are Jethro and Zipporah merely historical figures?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Certainly not.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To say this is to fail to realize that Exodus is a book of pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As Pharaoh represents Satan and Egypt represents the world, so Jethro signifies the Gentiles, and Zipporah, the Gentile church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the principle that all the items in Exodus are figures, the matters in chapter eighteen should not be considered as exceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We know that chapter eighteen portrays the kingdom because here we see that after God s people had defeated His enemy, the godly Gentiles turned to God s people to praise God, worship Him, and offer sacrifice to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We also see that the Gentile church is prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When these three things all happen together, there is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may apply the picture of Exodus 18 to our situation as Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We know from our experience that when our flesh is defeated, the unbelievers will turn to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is good that all the churches are actively preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, if we live in the flesh and fail to defeat Amalek, we may labor a great deal in preaching the gospel, but not many unbelievers will turn.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if we first defeat and subdue our flesh and then go forth to contact people and preach the gospel to them, Jethro will come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that the unbelievers will turn this way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we preach the gospel by the living Spirit through the operating cross, killing the flesh, people will turn to us wherever we go.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, the church, signified by Zipporah, will become prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, the proper gospel preaching must be the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the words of Matthew 24:14, the gospel of the kingdom must be preached to the whole inhabited earth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The gospel must be the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we live in the flesh, others will not turn to God through us, no matter how hard we work in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must be those who defeat Amalek.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then Jethro, representing the Gentiles, will turn to God through us, and the church will become prevailing.</S>
