   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>It is difficult to explain this matter adequately in doctrine, but in our experience it is really so.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the first stage of my Christian life, whenever I prayed, according to the general concept, I prayed to the Lord in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But after some time, it seemed that the Lord who is in heaven had come into me and dwelled in me.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I did not know at that time whether He was in heaven listening to me or indwelling me and praying within me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course, it could be said that it was the Holy Spirit in me who was helping me to pray Rom 8:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But actually this Holy Spirit who is in me helping me to pray is also the Lord who is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the One who prays within me is the One who listens to me in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The two are identical.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 8, on the one hand, says that the Lord is in heaven today v. 34 . But on the other hand, it also says that He is in us v. 10 . This is not only true today concerning the Lord who has already become the Spirit; even while He was in the flesh, it was also true.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that time He told Nicodemus that He was the One who "descended out of heaven" and "who is in heaven" John 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So when He prayed in John 17, He was on earth, and at the same time He was in heaven; He was the One who prayed on earth, and at the same time He was also the One who listened to the prayer in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The electricity in the lights in the meeting hall is on one hand in the meeting hall; on the other hand it is also in the generator; it is in both places.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These are not two different electricities, but one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the end in the power plant electricity is generated, while at the end in the meeting hall it illuminates.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thank the Lord, He also has two ends: at the end in heaven He is the Father, and at the end on the earth He is the Son; at the end in heaven He is the One who listens to the prayer, and at the end on earth He is the One who prays.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is both the One who prays on earth and the One who listens in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, Hebrews 1:8-9 says, "Of the Son he saith...O God...thy God...."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First it says, "Of the Son he saith...O God."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means the Son is God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But later it says "thy God."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is rather difficult to explain!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since the Son is called "O God," why does it also say "thy God"?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to our mental understanding, this simply means "God's God."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Based upon this concept, it is no wonder that not long ago I received a book saying that this passage speaks of two Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, it is not speaking here of two Gods, but of one God from different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From the aspect of the Son being God, He is God; therefore, it says "O God."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And from the aspect of the Son being man, God is His God; therefore, it says "thy God."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must see the various aspects of our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On one hand, He is God, and on the other hand, He is also man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As God, He is God; as man, God is His God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On one hand, He is the One who prays, and on the other hand, He is also the One who listens to the prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is both.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Triune God the Father, Son, and Spirit has the aspect of being three-in-one and also the aspect of being one-in-three.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the three-in-one, He is "I," as the one-in-three, He is "us."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From the aspect of the three-in-one, "the Word was God"; from the aspect of the one-in-three, "the Word was with God" John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From the aspect of the three-in-one, "the Lord is the Spirit"; from the aspect of the one-in-three, it is "the Spirit of the Lord" 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From the aspect of the three-in-one, the Son and the Father are one John 10:30; 14:7-11 ; from the aspect of the one-in-three, the Son is with the Father 1:1-2 , the Son shares the glory with the Father 17:5 , the Son is the beloved of the Father v. 24 , the Son has become one with the Father vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>11, 21-22 , and the Son takes the same action with the Father 14:23 .</S>
