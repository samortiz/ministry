   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE TWO BEING FORMED INTO AN ARMY 1 Scripture Reading: Num 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The picture portrayed in Numbers chapter one shows us the entire New Testament, from the incarnation of the Triune God to be a man, living and dwelling among men, to the consummation of the incarnation, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To see the incarnation of the Triune God in Numbers 1 is difficult, because we do not have such a concept.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we would see the incarnation of the Triune God in this chapter, we need to consider the matter of the tabernacle with the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Within the tabernacle was the ark, and within the ark was the law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The law is called "the testimony" 17:4, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The law is a testimony of God because it testifies, shows us, God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, it is actually God who is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, here we do not have God merely in Himself but God in an ark made of acacia wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This ark, being one entity of two elements, wood and gold, typifies Christ in His humanity with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word incarnation is not in Numbers chapter one, but the picture is here.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this picture of the tabernacle with the ark, we see the Triune God incarnated to be a man living among men.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The tabernacle was built with forty-eight boards.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, the number forty-eight is composed of six multiplied by eight, which signifies man six in resurrection eight .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second, forty-eight is composed of twelve multiplied by four, which signifies the Triune God contained in the number twelve, composed of three multiplied by four in His creature four .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, this picture shows the Triune God incarnated to be a man living among men.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here we see the Triune God, we see man, and we see the Triune God dwelling among men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The picture of the New Jerusalem in Numbers 1 involves the encampment of the twelve tribes of Israel around the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The New Jerusalem has twelve gates, three gates on each of the four sides, with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel on them Rev 21:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Numbers, the twelve tribes were arranged into an array, which shows us a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this array, three tribes, each tribe being an army, were encamped on each of the four sides of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the east, toward the sunrise, was the camp of Judah, composed of the armies of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun Num 2:2-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the west, at the rear, was the camp of Ephraim, composed of the armies of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin 2:18-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the south was the camp of Reuben, composed of the armies of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad 2:10-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the north was the camp of Dan, composed of the armies of Dan, Asher, and Naphtali 2:25-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This encamping of the twelve tribes is a picture of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now we can realize how Numbers 1 affords us a picture of the New Testament from the incarnation to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is actually a summary of the history of the church, which began with the incarnation and will consummate with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In type, the history of Israel from Numbers through Malachi, which includes things that are both very good and encouraging and very poor and discouraging, portrays the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the picture in Numbers, God is in the center; that is, God is in the ark, in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is no longer just in the heavens; He is also on the earth, in a man who is His embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This man who is the embodiment of God is Jesus Christ Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a man is constituted with two elements, a golden element and a wooden element.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is a "gold-wood" man, a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now this wonderful One, the Triune God incarnated to be embodied as a man, has been expanded, increased, and enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In His expansion and enlargement, Christ has become the tabernacle, God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As such a tabernacle, He is enterable.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When God was in Christ only, no one could enter into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without Christ's expansion, no one could enter into God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But now, in His expansion into a tabernacle, Christ is not only God's dwelling place but also the place where we can enter into God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today we can enter into God, taking Christ as our life that He may be the meaning of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As He is our life to be the meaning of life to us, He is our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We live Him, express Him, show Him, in every aspect and in every direction.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then He spontaneously becomes our center.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, Christ today is our meaning of life, our testimony, and our center.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ, the embodiment of God, has been enlarged into a habitation in which God dwells and into which we enter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this enlarged Body of Christ, God has a dwelling place, and we have a place where we can enter into God, meet with God, and even be mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This God had no intention to come down, to be incarnated at Bethlehem, and then remain stationary.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For almost two thousand years this dear One has been moving.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today He is here with us, moving.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In His moving, He is the Leader.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is the unique Leader, for He alone is qualified to lead.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ is our Leader, our way, and our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we have Christ, we have leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we follow Christ, we follow our Leader.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we follow Him directly, we become a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The leadership is with Him; the leadership is He.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ is not only our Leader but also the way we take today.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our way is Christ, and our goal also is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Bringing Christ to a certain place should be honored.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But if we bring something other than Christ, that thing should be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Eventually, the picture in Numbers shows us God and His chosen people mingled together as one entity to conquer the enemy on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The enemy utilizes and usurps the entire earth, which God created for Himself and His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>How can God regain the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God will not regain the earth directly, by Himself as the mighty God, the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the New Testament economy, God would never do this by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He had to be incarnated to become a man, Christ, and this Christ has to be ministered to sinners to make them all the enlargement of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As a result, there is on earth the mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man that God may move on earth and regain it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This move began from Jerusalem as the center, passed through Judea and Samaria, progressed to the uttermost part of the earth, and is here today.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now we are part of this, part of the Triune God incarnated to be a man, living among men to have Himself increased into His chosen people, causing all of them to be mingled with the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is God's work of the new creation within the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The ultimate consummation of this work will be the New Jerusalem, which is the processed Triune God mingled with the transformed tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is Numbers chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Having such a picture before us, let us now begin to consider how God's people are formed into an army.</S>
