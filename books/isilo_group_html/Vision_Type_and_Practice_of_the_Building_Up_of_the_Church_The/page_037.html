<h1 class="title">THE TYPE OF THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
AS SEEN IN THE TABERNACLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 26:31-35; Heb. 9:2-5; 10:19-20; Matt. 27:50-51</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to consider the way to build up the church according to the type of the tabernacle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING AND THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</h2>
<p>The tabernacle was divided into three parts: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. Each part of the tabernacle has its crucial points. In the outer court there were bronze pieces of furniture, such as the bronze altar, the bronze laver, and the pillars and sockets of bronze upon which were the linen hangings. These were the basic pieces of furniture in the outer court. In the outer court there were also the silver rods, the silver hooks, and the fine white linen hangings. Thus, everything in the outer court was either of bronze, silver, or fine white linen (Exo. 38:1-20).</p>
<p>After the outer court there was the Holy Place. All the boards in the Holy Place had two heavy sockets of silver (36:20-30). This means that the experiences of the Holy Place begin with redemption and have redemption as the base. But most of the pieces of furniture in the Holy Place were not of silver. The striking feature of the Holy Place was gold. Although the sockets of the standing boards were of silver, the boards were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold and had gold rings. The boards were joined by bars of acacia wood overlaid with gold that passed through the gold rings. Hence, in the Holy Place everything looked golden (v. 34). Moreover, the three pieces of furniture in the Holy Place&mdash;the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar&mdash;were of gold (37:10-28). There was gold everywhere one looked in the Holy Place. Gold overlaying acacia wood was the main constituent and feature in the Holy Place.</p>
<p>According to typology, gold signifies God&rsquo;s divine nature, which is God Himself, and wood signifies the human nature, humanity. Hence, acacia wood overlaid with gold signifies God mingled with man, or the divine element mingled with the human element. This dual-natured entity of gold and wood does not exist until we enter the Holy Place.</p>
<p>The most prominent symbols and types of the mingling of God and man are the standing boards, the table of the bread of the Presence, and the incense altar in the Holy Place of the tabernacle. These pieces of furniture were gold without, but they were wood within; they were wood, but they looked like gold. Each of these pieces of furniture had two natures, gold and wood. God&rsquo;s children need to see that only by experiencing the mingling of God with man is building up possible.</p>
<p>The significance of wood overlaid with gold is the same as the significance of the oil poured upon the stone in Genesis 28:18. Oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit and, hence, God as well, and the stone symbolizes man. After Jacob poured oil upon the stone, he called the name of that place Bethel (v. 19). Then he made a vow, saying, &ldquo;If God will be with me...this stone, which I have set up as a pillar, will be God&rsquo;s house&rdquo; (vv. 20, 22). Jacob vowed that the stone upon which the oil was poured would become God&rsquo;s house, His temple, His dwelling place. This corresponds to the significance of wood overlaid with gold, which is for man to be built up into God&rsquo;s tabernacle, His dwelling place.</p>
<p>If we are to be built up together in the church, we must experience oil being poured upon the stone and experience wood being overlaid with gold, that is, the mingling of God with man. If we are merely convicted and judged under God&rsquo;s light, confess our sins and are forgiven by God, receive the work of redemption and the washing, and deal with our conduct to become blameless before God and man, then we have experienced only a preparatory work; we have not yet entered into genuine building up. We must touch the mingling of God with man and become a board of wood overlaid with gold, in order to have the genuine building up. This means that being joined and built up with others depend on the divine nature of God.</p>
<p>The standing boards in the tabernacle were joined by means of the gold. If the boards were made of only wood without gold rings, they could not have been joined by the bars. The boards could be joined together because of the gold. The boards were overlaid with gold, the bars were overlaid with gold, and the boards had rings of gold as holders for the bars to pass through and thus join the boards together (Exo. 36:31-34). This shows that although the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place requires that we be built up together, we are joined together through God. We cannot be joined in our humanity. We can only be joined to become one building in divinity and with divinity as our linking factor.</p>
<p>The oneness of the church, the linking of the church, is altogether not in man but in God. No matter how blameless we are by being judged and convicted under the light, being cleansed, forgiven, and redeemed, being pleasing to God and justified by Him, and even dealing with our conduct, without divinity we will still be separate. We will not be joined, for we cannot be joined in our humanity. It is not until we move on to experience the mingling of divinity with humanity that the God we are mingled with can join us together.</p>
<p>For example, although the lamps in a room are separate, they are joined into one by means of the electric current within them. In the same principle, no matter how blameless we may be, we are still separate individuals. We can be built together only because we are in God. This is wood overlaid with gold. We cannot neglect this. Our individual effort is useless in the building. Building happens spontaneously when we live in God and are mingled with Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Type, and Practice of the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 37</div><br></body></html>
