   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 33: the parable of the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the entire Bible leaven signifies evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a principle in the Bible that cannot be overturned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>See Exo 12:15, 19-20; 13:6-8; Lev 2:4-5, 11; 6:17; 10:12; Deut 16:3-4; Amos 4:4-5.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the New Testament three kinds of leaven are referred to.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first kind is the teaching of the Pharisees Matt 16:12 , which stressed the outward greatness of ceremonies and rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who keep rituals are proud of such greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The second kind of leaven is the teaching of the Sadducees, who did not believe in the supernatural.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Sadducees were like today's modernists, those who rebel against the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The third kind is the leaven of Herod Mark 8:15 , referring to those who are worldly, who love political activities, and who persecute the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Leaven refers to teachings or doctrines Matt 16:12 ; it also refers to conduct or morality 1 Cor 5:6-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The two are related.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First there is the improper doctrine, and then there is the improper conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Bible woman represents religious organization.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are four women in the Bible whose names are not mentioned: Revelation 12, 17, 19, and Zechariah 5.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They all represent religious organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The woman here refers particularly to the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In a broader sense, she refers to those who preach or invent heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Three measures is the ordinary quantity needed for making meals cf.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Gen 18:6; 1 Sam 1:24 ; one ephah equals three measures Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>6:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The woman in Zechariah 5:7 is the woman in Revelation 17, which is the Roman Catholic Church and which will eventually move to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Meal, for making the meal offering, signifies Christ as food to His people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Three measures of meal signifies the manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The number one is the number of God, and the number three is the number of God's manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By combining the two together, it means that the Roman Catholic Church has mixed leaven with the pure food supply given by Christ to His people, so that the whole lump was leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the future the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Church will be joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church becomes prosperous through its heresies, such as the social gospel and modern beliefs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hear the Lord's calling: "Come out from their midst and be separated" 2 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Again, "Come out of her, My people, that you do not participate in her sins and that you do not receive her plagues" Rev 18:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today there is leaven everywhere, and it can be contacted most easily.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, we must reject 1 the outward greatness and 2 the inward heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verses 34-35: Apart from parables the Lord spoke nothing to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because the Jews had rejected the Lord, the Lord spoke to them in parables not as clear as when He spoke in plain words so that they could hear but could not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 35 shows that the word of Psalm 78:2 is thus fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 36: "Then, leaving the crowds, He went into the house.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And His disciples came to Him, saying, Make the parable of the tares of the field clear to us."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here, "leaving" should be rendered "sending away."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verses 1 through 35 are by the seashore, while verses 36 through 52 are in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The "house" here does not refer to Israel; it refers to the church because the disciples were in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, the seven great parables may be divided into two large categories: 1 the sowing, the tares, the mustard seed, and the leaven; and 2 the treasure, the pearl, and the net.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord first explained the parable of the tares because, as the first parable of the kingdom of the heavens, it is the most important and the broadest in scope.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If one understands this parable, he can understand the others see verse 51, which says that the disciples understood all these things .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The parables spoken inside the house are more precious and intimate, because in speaking to His own people or close friends, He could surely speak in a deeper and more advanced way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 44:"The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden past participle in the field, which a man found and hid past tense , and in his joy goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field" the tense in the second half of the verse is changed to the present .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The parables of the tares and the treasure are the most important and the richest in mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Bible expositors interpret this parable mainly in the following ways.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The first kind of interpretation is that the treasure signifies Christ and the field signifies the gospel, and therefore Christ is hidden in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The man represents the sinner who forsakes all to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If so, we may ask: 1 Since the gospel is for manifesting Christ, how can it be hiding Christ instead?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>2 Where does the Bible refer to the field as the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>3 What can a sinner buy?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>4 Is Christ a piece of merchandise that one has to pay a price for?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>5 Since He was found, why was He covered again?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is altogether contrary to the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>6 How is He covered?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>7 If the gospel can be bought, can it be the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The second kind of interpretation is that the field refers to the Bible, the treasure signifies salvation, and the man is the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Salvation is hidden in the Bible, and when man finds salvation he forsakes everything to get it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We may ask: 1 Does the Bible hide salvation or make it manifest?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>2 Is salvation found by man or is it preached to man?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>3 Does one have to pay the price to understand the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>4 How much must one pay to buy a Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>5 Can one definitely obtain Christ after he buys a Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>6 After he has gained Christ, why does he hide Him again?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Is he afraid that Christ might be discovered by others?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The third kind of interpretation is that the field signifies the world, the treasure signifies the church, and the man signifies Christ, who found the church and gave up everything to obtain her.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We may ask: 1 When the Lord was on the earth, where and when did He discover the church?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Or does it refer to the glory of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>2 When the Lord was on the earth, when did the church manifest her glory?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The fourth kind of interpretation is that the treasure refers to sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, 1 when the Lord was on this earth, sinners were everywhere, and thus there was no need to find them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>2 After He found the sinners, why would He hide them again?</S>
