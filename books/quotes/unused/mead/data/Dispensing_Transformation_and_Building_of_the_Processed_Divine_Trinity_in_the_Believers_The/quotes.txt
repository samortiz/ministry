[1]  CHAPTER ONE THE DISPENSING OF THE PROCESSED DIVINE TRINITY IN THE BELIEVERS 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:3; Titus 3:5; John 3:16; 2 Pet 1:4b; 2 Cor 5:17; Rom 5:10; John 1:12-13; 1 Cor 15:22; Rom 12:5; 2 Cor 4:16b; Rom 12:2a; 8:2, 4-6 OUTLINE Through regeneration 1 Pet 1:3; Titus 3:5b: God the Father dispenses His divine life and holy nature into the believers John 3:16; 2 Pet 1:4b.
[2]  In this conference we definitely have a burden to focus on the unique, highest, deepest, most mysterious, and most glorious subject in the Holy Scriptures, that is, God's highest purpose concerning man.
[3]  In God's relationship with man we can see that God has a heart's desire and a purpose; that is, God wants to make Himself man and to make man God that the two God and man may become altogether the same.
[4]  On the other hand, man is man, yet God wants to make man the same as He is, of the same kind and the same likeness as He is in life and in nature, except that we human beings have no share in His person.
[5]  THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY RESULTING IN OUR BECOMING THE EXPRESSION OF GOD
[6]  It is in this way that God dispenses Himself into us.
[7]  Although this time you have come to attend this conference for only two days, I hope that you will gain God unlimitedly so that when you return to your home what you will show people is not what messages you have heard but a definite growth of Christ in you and an increase of God in you.
[8]  CHAPTER TWO THE DISPENSING OF THE PROCESSED DIVINE TRINITY IN THE BELIEVERS 2 Scripture Reading: Eph 1:7, 10-11, 13-14; 4:30 OUTLINE In redemption Eph 1:7: God the Son dispenses His rich life element into the believers' inward parts.
[9]  God's highest purpose is attained through the unlimited dispensing of the processed and consummated Triune God.
[10]  He is the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit Matt 28:19 .
[11]  In His dispensing, as the Father He regenerates us by dispensing His divine life and holy nature into us.
[12]  When God the Father gives us the Son, He gives us, He dispenses into us, His divine life that we may be regenerated and become children of God.
[13]  THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY IN THE BELIEVERS IN REDEMPTION
[14]  Following God the Father's dispensing, there are Christ's dispensing and the Spirit's dispensing.
[15]  CHAPTER THREE THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE PROCESSED DIVINE TRINITY IN THE BELIEVERS Scripture Reading: Rom 12:2a; Titus 3:5b; 2 Cor 5:17; Eph 4:22-24; 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 8:29; 1 John 3:2; 1 Cor 3:12; Gen 2:9, 16-17 OUTLINE The dispensing of God renews the believers; the renewing of God issues in transformation Rom 12:2a: The dispensing for renewing continues the dispensing for regeneration Titus 3:5b.
[16]  For the believers to shed their old creation and be transformed into God's new creation to put off the man of the old creation and to put on the man of the new creation 2 Cor 5:17; Eph 4:22-24.
[17]  The transformation of God carries out a work in the believers to change their essence with the rich life element of Christ 2 Cor 3:18a: From the believers' spirit to every part of their inward being Rom 12:2a.
[18]  The principle of God in the transformation of the believers is not that they would forsake evil and follow good but that they would be delivered from good and evil and follow His divine life: At the very outset, the divine revelation in the Bible presents the tree of life and the tree of good and evil, indicating these two principles Gen 2:9, 16-17.
[19]  God the Father dispenses His life and nature into us through regeneration and renewing.
[20]  Now we are waiting for the redemption of our body, that is, for the spreading of God's essence into our body that our body of humiliation may be permeated with His element so that we will be exactly the same as God and will completely become God from the inside to the outside.
[21]  If you read these few verses you will prostrate yourself and bow your head to worship the Lord, saying, "O God, yes, we can never share in Your Godhead to become an object for people to worship; but we thank You that in Your highest purpose, by the dispensing in regeneration, renewing, redemption, and sealing, You are transforming us to build Yourself into us that we may become exactly the same as You are, within and without, that we may become God.
[22]  CHAPTER FOUR THE BUILDING OF THE PROCESSED DIVINE TRINITY IN THE BELIEVERS Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4-6; John 14:23; Eph 3:17; 4:15-16; Col 2:19; 1 Cor 3:12; Rev 4:2-3; 21:18a, 19a, 11 OUTLINE The Triune God's transformation in the believers is His building in the believers not merely His making the believers the precious materials for the building of the church: Through the transformation of the believers, the Triune God builds Himself into the believers and with their transformed new man constitutes the Body of Christ.
[23]  The Triune God is the life and reality of the Body, and the believers are the frame and expression of the Body.
[24]  John 14:23 speaks of God the Father and God the Son coming to those who love Him and making an abode in them, and Ephesians 3:17 speaks of Christ making His home in the hearts of the believers, who have been strengthened through the Spirit both refer to this divine and mysterious building.
[25]  By these two natures and two lives God mingles Himself with man in order that His divine life may be lived out through humanity among men, and in order that His redeemed may have His divinity and in His divinity may live out the likeness of God through the resurrected and uplifted humanity.
