<h1 class="title">A WORD OF CAUTION CONCERNING<br />
AMBITION, PRIDE, AND CHARACTER</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we present ourselves to You. We need Your timely help. Examine, enlighten, and expose us. Show us where we are. We need to see You and know Your heart and Your way in Your economy. Lord, we also need Your forgiveness and Your cleansing. Because we are still living in the old creation, we are contaminated by our natural life, strength, way, and wisdom. Lord, we confess that we are still very natural and in darkness. Forgive us and cleanse us of all this with Your precious blood. We look unto You for a transparent fellowship so that nothing remains hidden or covered. Expose our situation and condition. Lord, we ask for Your mercy and grace. We humble ourselves before You. Defeat the power of darkness and the evil one. Leave no ground for him. We stand with You. Lord, we trust in You for the completion of Your word and Your work on us, in us, and among us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO BEWARE OF AMBITION AND PRIDE</h2>
<p>Humanly speaking, in any group or society people like to be above others. In other words, people like to be special or uncommon. Workers hope to be promoted in their jobs. We all like to be different. Because this tendency or habit is constituted into our being, we may unconsciously and subconsciously bring it into the church life. This word is a necessary inoculation.</p>
<p>In Matthew 23:8 the Lord told His disciples, &ldquo;Do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.&rdquo; In verse 10 He said, &ldquo;Neither be called instructors, because One is your Instructor, the Christ.&rdquo; In Mark 10:37 James and John said to the Lord, &ldquo;Grant to us to sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory.&rdquo; They wanted to be above others, to be different from the other disciples. After hearing this request, the Lord taught His disciples, &ldquo;You know that those who are esteemed as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. But it is not so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be the slave of all&rdquo; (vv. 42-44). Although organized Christianity neglected this crucial word of the Lord, in the 1800s the Brethren paid attention to the Lord&rsquo;s word. Based upon the Lord&rsquo;s teaching in Matthew 23:8, they did away with the clergy and only called one another brothers. Because of this, others began to call them the Brethren.</p>
<p>We should not allow an attitude to come into the church life that the elders are above others. This is ugly. There is no rank in the church. The brothers who are the leading ones should consider themselves to be lower than the other saints. They do not rule others; rather, they are slaves and stewards who serve the church. In Luke 22:25-27 the Lord said, &ldquo;The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called benefactors. But you shall not be so; but let the greatest among you become like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves. For who is greater, the one who reclines at table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am in your midst as the one who serves.&rdquo; The churches should not have an atmosphere in which the elders are considered to be greater than the other saints. It is absolutely wrong to think that it is a glory to be an elder. To think this way is a sign that we are not walking according to the spirit. The elders need to help their wives to realize that they are not higher than the other sisters. The wife of an elder is the wife of a slave.</p>
<p>To be regarded as being higher than others in the church according to the secular way is unseemly. When others try to elevate me, I ask them to consider me as only a brother. We should never presume that we are anything. It is a shame if the concept of hierarchical rank or an atmosphere of ambition is brought into the church life. This concept is not justified in the New Testament. The Lord rejected it, and the apostle Paul also depreciated it. If the leading brothers in a locality consider themselves to be higher than others, assume that they are the authority in their locality, rule others, and make themselves different from the other saints, the church in that locality is sick with a dangerous cancer. Our desire to be higher than others may kill the church.</p>
<p>After the Lord fed five thousand with five loaves and two fish in John 6, the people wanted to make Him King (vv. 14-15). However, He would not allow them to enthrone Him, and He immediately withdrew alone to the mountain. Anyone else in His position would probably seize the opportunity to be crowned, believing it to be something of God since it was initiated by others. The next day, after the Lord returned, He told the crowd, &ldquo;I am the bread of life&rdquo; (v. 35). He claimed not to be a great king but a small piece of food. He came not to rule us but to feed and nourish us. We need to have the same humble attitude.</p>
<p>If we do not take this word seriously, one day we will realize our mistake, because our considering ourselves higher than others will damage the church. To be higher than others does not minister life to them. We can exercise our so-called authority only to subdue others temporarily. Those whom we subdue will be our strongest opposers in the future. This is not the way to build the church; rather, it makes us a cancer to the church. Making ourselves higher than others is a sowing, and one day we will reap what we sow. There is no exception to this God-ordained principle (Gal. 6:7). If we receive this word, it will be a great rescue to us.</p>
<p>Concerning the elders not giving the other saints the impression that they consider themselves higher than others, what matters is the elders&rsquo; attitude. Our attitude is basic. For instance, although we should discipline our children, love must be our attitude toward them. The outward things, such as where the elders sit and how much they function in the meetings, do not matter as much as their inward attitude. If our attitude is wrong, whatever we do or say will mean nothing. If a brother is inwardly proud, the other saints will not believe that he is humble even if he says something like, &ldquo;I humble myself before you all.&rdquo; Others will know if a brother is inwardly humble, regardless of what he does or says. Much depends on our attitude.</p>
<p>Paul writes to the Corinthians, &ldquo;I, when I came to you, brothers, came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom...I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling&rdquo; (1 Cor. 2:1, 3). Because Paul did not make himself great, some foolish ones belittled him and said that they preferred Cephas or Apollos (1:12). The name Paul means &ldquo;small.&rdquo; The philosophizing Greek believers despised Paul as a little man without much wisdom. Paul was actually well-educated and very wise, but he did not act arrogantly. Instead, he made himself small.</p>
