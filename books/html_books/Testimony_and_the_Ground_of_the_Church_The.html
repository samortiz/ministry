<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>The church is the eternal purpose of God and the goal of God&rsquo;s work in time. Therefore, we must know the church in order to understand God&rsquo;s plan and work in the universe. The church has a content and function in reality, and it also has an outward appearance and ground in practicality. These two aspects, one inward and the other outward, match each other and are indispensable. According to its content in reality, the church is a mystery that requires a heavenly revelation from God. However, due to the church&rsquo;s degradation in the last two thousand years, the outward expression of the church in practicality has been changed beyond recognition. As a result, people either are ignorant of or filled with misunderstanding concerning the church. Thus, there is a great need for spiritual insight.</p>
<p>During a conference in Taipei in 1957, Witness Lee released numerous messages concerning the testimony and the ground of the church to explain the inward and outward aspects of the church in great detail. Although more than a decade passed before their publication in 1971, these messages are a precious, comprehensive, and systematic guide to those who have a heart to know the church. May Christ, the Head of the church, bless this book and lead His people all over the earth to recover the testimony and the ground of the church to hasten His return!</p><h1 class="title">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:16-19; Eph. 1:22-23; 3:9-11, 21; 4:11-12; 5:25-27; 1 Tim. 3:15-16</h1>
<p>Matthew 16:16-19 says, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered...upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; In these verses we need to pay attention to the Lord&rsquo;s speaking, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; The building up of the church by the Lord, or we may say, the church that is being built up by the Lord, is related to two matters. On the one hand, there are the gates of Hades, and on the other hand, there are the keys of the kingdom of the heavens. Keys and gates are closely related; however, in this passage the gates are related to Hades, and the keys are related to the kingdom of the heavens. This is to say that the church being built by the Lord is very much related to Hades and to the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:22-23 says, &ldquo;He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; Please note that the Lord is the Head over all things for the sake of the church.</p>
<p>Ephesians 3:9-11 says, &ldquo;To enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; These verses show that the church has been brought into existence according to the eternal purpose that God made in Christ.</p>
<p>Ephesians 3:21 says, &ldquo;To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations forever and ever. Amen.&rdquo; This verse shows us that the glorification of God in the church is a matter unto all the generations forever and ever.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-12 says, &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; Ephesians 5:25-27 says, &ldquo;Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First Timothy 3:15-16 says, &ldquo;The house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh.&rdquo; All these verses show the importance of the church before God, which is the subject we want to cover in this conference. Now I would like to give an opening word.</p>
<p>Over the past thirty years, whenever we brought up the matter of the church, we faced some difficulties for several reasons. First, Satan hates this matter very much. Satan knows that the church will have a devastating impact on him. God&rsquo;s great purpose in establishing and building up the church is to deal with His enemy, Satan, through the church. Those who understand the Bible know that without the church, God cannot eliminate Satan because He will not deal with Satan directly. The church is the means and the instrument through which God will deal with Satan. Therefore, Satan hates the church very much. He is not afraid of tens of thousands of individual believers, but he is afraid of the built-up church. Even if there were tens of thousands of individual believers, none of them would be able to deal with Satan. The only thing that can bruise Satan and deal a death blow to him is the church. Therefore, for two thousand years Satan&rsquo;s work to destroy the church has been the focus of his work on the earth. Therefore, whenever we discuss the matter of the church, we also sense Satan&rsquo;s efforts to make trouble, disturb, undermine, and attack.</p>
<p>Second, many of God&rsquo;s children feel that the church is not a matter of personal concern to them; consequently, they do not feel a need to speak concerning it. A good number of devout believers think that they need only to be spiritual, holy, and victorious over sin, the world, and the flesh. They think that it is enough to overcome and to have a spiritual, holy, and godly living. They think that they should pay attention to spirituality, holiness, piety, and victorious living, which are matters of personal concern to them in their daily life. But they do not consider that the church is related at all to their spiritual life. Moreover, they think that it is better to avoid talking about the church, because it is too complex, too high, too broad, and too involved. Whenever we speak of the church, those who do not pursue or care for the Lord do not respond, but even those who pursue the Lord and have a heart for Him pay attention only to their personal spirituality and neglect the church as a corporate matter. This phenomenon is a result of either man&rsquo;s insufficient seeing or Satan&rsquo;s spiritual deception.</p>
<p>We need to realize that a person is saved in order to become a living stone for the building up of the church. God saves so many sinners so that they can be materials for the building up of the church. God wants believers to be spiritual, holy, and victorious so that they might become glorious and shining materials for the building up of the church. God has no intention for Christians to be individually spiritual or independently holy because He wants to gain the church as a corporate entity, not millions of individual believers, from the human race. He does not want many individual members; He wants one Body. He gains members in order to gain a Body. He does not just want millions of living stones; He wants to build the living stones into a spiritual house, which is the church (1 Pet. 2:5). We need to see that God&rsquo;s work on us, the saved ones, is to build each one of us into His spiritual house. At the end of the Bible we do not see individuals in the presence of God; we see the New Jerusalem built up and manifested. Today God is doing a building work. While He is building up individuals, He is building up the church even more. His building up of individuals, in fact, is for the building up of the church. Christians lack the revelation of God concerning the church, because they do not have a clear revelation, a far-sighted view, and because they are under Satan&rsquo;s blinding veils (2 Cor. 4:3-4). Satan uses spirituality, holiness, and victorious living as blinding veils to cause many who love the Lord to be near-sighted, to have a narrow view. They see only a little about being spiritual, holy, and victorious; they do not see the crucial matter&mdash;the church. In their near-sightedness, they see only individuals; they do not see the church, which is much higher. We need to beware of good things and spiritual things, including even a holy, victorious life, because these things can be used by Satan to blind us, causing us to have a limited rather than an ultimate view, a partial instead of a complete view. A considerable number of people in Christianity are pursuing spirituality, holiness, and victory, but very few really care for the church, know the church, and pursue after the church.</p>
<p>There is another problem with many who zealously serve the Lord; they value their work more than the church. Whenever we speak of the church, they have a certain attitude and say, &ldquo;As long as we preach the gospel, save souls, minister the word of God, edify people, and lead them to love the Lord, that is good enough. Do not bring up the matter of the church. Whenever this matter is brought up, it is difficult to avoid different views and different opinions, and it is also hard to avoid contention, debate, and strife. This matter is too complicated; it is better not to talk about it.&rdquo; We have met many people who serve God but avoid this issue. If we speak of preaching the gospel and holding evangelistic meetings, they are very interested. If we speak of revival meetings or meetings for spiritual edification, they fully agree. If we speak of having a Bible-study class or other Christian endeavors, they also say Amen. But as soon as we raise the issue of the church, they lower their heads and contract their brows, saying, &ldquo;This is troublesome; this is too complicated. It is better not to speak concerning this. If we speak of other topics, we can still be polite and at peace with one another. But if we speak concerning the church, we have no way to be together. This is a matter that stirs up contention; it makes everyone uncomfortable. Therefore, it is better not to speak of it.&rdquo; Other people say, &ldquo;The matter of the church is too vague. The church is universal, transcendent, and in eternity; hence, it is impossible for those of us who are in time to touch it and speak concerning it. Let us speak of the work, which is more personal and practical to us.&rdquo; Brothers and sisters, we need to see that this substitutes what is good for what is best; it substitutes a half-way station for the final destination. God does not want just a work; God wants to gain the church. All work is for the church. However, due to Satan&rsquo;s blinding, Christians consider the work and the procedure as the ultimate goal, neglecting the matter of the church. They even intentionally avoid touching it.</p>
<p>Recently, I had some contact with a brother who very much loved the Lord and who had this view. He came especially to seek me out and say, &ldquo;Brother, I would like to have some serious fellowship with you concerning a certain matter. I have a desire to do some gospel work and form a fellowship group with the saved ones, but I do not want this fellowship group to belong to any &lsquo;church.&rsquo;&rdquo; When I heard that, I could not help but open up my heart and say, &ldquo;Preaching the gospel to save souls is really precious, and it is something we should do. But I cannot agree with your desire to form those who are saved into a fellowship group that is apart from the church and has no relation to the church. I disagree because God saves people for the building up of the church. You think that saving souls is the final step, but for God this is only the first step. The building up of the church is the ultimate goal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, just as Satan uses spirituality as a veil, he can also use the work as a veil. Strictly speaking, God has no intention to establish any work. In the Bible we cannot find the work having a great place. In the Bible there are no evangelistic societies, revival meetings, or fellowship groups. In the Bible there is only the church. In the Scriptures the workers&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers&mdash;did not consider themselves as separate units; rather, they were all serving the church and serving for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>We all need to receive mercy to see that the church is the only thing that matters. It is not our spirituality, holiness, or overcoming that matters, but the building up of the church. It is not the work, evangelism, spiritual endeavors, or Bible study that matters, but the building up of the church. I am not belittling these matters. I absolutely agree that a saved person should pursue spirituality, holiness, and victory; this is a definite need and should not be despised in any way. But spirituality, holiness, and victory are not the goal; they are the procedure for reaching the goal, which is the building up of the church. Being spiritual is for the building up of the church, being holy is for the building up of the church, and being victorious is for the building up of the church. All these matters are for the building up of the church. I also agree that those who love the Lord should preach the gospel, save souls, and work for the Lord. How good it would be if we could lead sinners to be saved, and how glorious it would be if we could help believers grow. We must remember, however, that all these matters are not the goal but the procedures for reaching the goal. If we regard these procedures as the goal, then we are near-sighted and veiled by the enemy. By the mercy of God, our seeing must match God&rsquo;s view.</p>
<p>Almost all of the Epistles in the New Testament were written to churches. Even those written to individuals such as Timothy and Titus were related to the administration of the church. It is hard to find an Epistle that was written to an individual that was purely for an individual. Every Epistle was written either to a certain church or to a certain individual for a certain church or churches. The work of God is for the church, and the word of God is also for the church. If there were no churches, in the eyes of God nothing would have meaning; everything would be empty. May the Lord give us grace to see this!</p>
<p>Concerning the church, many brothers and sisters also refer to another problem, saying, &ldquo;It is true that the church is higher than everything. It is higher than being spiritual, higher than being holy, higher than being victorious, higher than preaching the gospel, higher than saving souls, higher than edifying the saints, and higher than any other kind of work, but this matter is very complex. It is not easy to make it understandable. Talking about the church only wastes our effort and asks for trouble.&rdquo; I admit that this is really true. However, brothers and sisters, should avoiding problems be the attitude of those who serve the Lord? Should we avoid a certain matter simply because it is difficult? The question is not whether it is difficult; the question is whether it is necessary, whether it is important. If this is God&rsquo;s desire, then we should pay attention to it and deal with it even though it is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters also say, &ldquo;Without bringing up the matter of the church, everyone can work together in love, but once the matter of the church is brought up, everyone becomes contentious and the one accord is gone.&rdquo; Then I must ask, &ldquo;What kind of one accord is this?&rdquo; Forgive me for saying a strong word. This kind of one accord is one accord in discord; that is, it is agreeing to disagree; it is a one accord that is outward, not inward. In other words, it is a false one accord. If there were genuine one accord, we would not be afraid to speak concerning this matter; even more, we would not avoid this matter simply because it is difficult and might stir up problems. Here we need to ask, &ldquo;What does God want to gain in this age? Does He merely want to gain individuals? Does He merely want to gain people who are spiritual? Does He merely want to have a work? Or does He want to gain the church?&rdquo; Our eyes must be opened to see this one fact: The work that God is doing in this age is to build up the church.</p>
<p>In Matthew 16 the Lord said that as the Christ, the Son of God, He was for the building of the church. The church He is building, on one hand, deals with Hades, whose gates cannot prevail against it, and on the other hand, the church brings in the kingdom of the heavens, whose keys, whose authority, depend upon it.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1 shows us that God subjected all things under the feet of the Lord, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church. If it were not for the church and if there were no need for the church, then the Lord would not need to be Head over all things. The Lord is Head over all things in order to gain the church as His Body, His corporate vessel, to express His fullness.</p>
<p>Ephesians 3 tells us that God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, which is also the economy of the mystery that was hidden in Him throughout the ages, is to gain the church so that His wisdom might be manifested through it. Therefore, the church will glorify God throughout all the generations forever and ever.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4 says that the gifts given by the Lord, whether apostles, prophets, evangelists, or shepherds and teachers, are all for the building up of the Body of Christ, which is the church.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5 says that the Lord gave Himself up for the church. We often think that the Lord gave Himself up for us as individuals, because we usually consider only individuals, not the church. We need to see that even though the Bible speaks of &ldquo;the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20), it also speaks of Christ, who &ldquo;loved the church and gave Himself up for her&rdquo; (Eph. 5:25). He gave Himself up not only for us individually but even more for the church. He gave Himself up for us individually so that we could become the church. He loves us because He loves the church. He wants to gain us because He wants to gain the church. Therefore, He loved the church and gave Himself up for the church, cleansing the church so that the church might be sanctified and become a glorious church. This is the reason He cherishes, nourishes, sympathizes with, and cares for the church. Ephesians 5 refers to all of these points. Do we have this kind of feeling? Are we so considerate of the church? Do we cherish the church this much? It seems that we often care more about perfecting our own spirituality than about caring for and preserving the church. We care for our work and sacrifice the church. How contrary this is to the Lord&rsquo;s desire!</p>
<p>First Timothy 3:15-16 reveals that the church is the pillar and base of the truth. The great mystery of God being manifested in the flesh is altogether entrusted to and rests upon the church.</p>
<p>All these Scriptures show us that the church is an exceedingly great matter. As Christians, we should not pay attention only to individuals, to the work, to spirituality, or to holiness but neglect the matter of the church. If we do not allow God to gain the church in us with the function of the church, then we will delay God&rsquo;s purpose and become a great hindrance to Him. We need to see that it has always been God&rsquo;s intention to have the church. Only the church can accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose, meet God&rsquo;s need, deal with God&rsquo;s enemy, and express God Himself, thereby satisfying God&rsquo;s desire. With these matters, individuals do not have much standing or much usefulness. Everyone who has truly been enlightened and has truly received grace will be able to say Amen.</p>
<p>Today we can find many people who love the Lord, meet many people who pursue spirituality, and come in contact with many people who zealously work for the Lord, but it is not easy to find people who pay attention to the church and have the consciousness of the church. Today it is not easy to meet people who care for the church and who are for the church. Perhaps some may say, &ldquo;Even though we do not declare that we are for the church, we are for the church as long as we work for the Lord and pursue spirituality.&rdquo; No, this is still not sufficient to gain the church. Others have even said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, we will attain to the same objective but with different methods; in the end we both are for the church.&rdquo; But brothers and sisters, my question is this: Is the result of our work individualistic, independent, or is it from the Body, from coordination? We must receive God&rsquo;s mercy to see that today in Christianity there are many who pay attention to spirituality and work, yet they are scattered. There are very few who really see the church, have the consciousness of the church, and are in the coordination of the church.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are going to spend ten days or more to specifically look at the matter of the church. We cannot possibly look at all the aspects of the church; we can look at only the two most important aspects concerning the church&mdash;the testimony of the church and the ground of the church. The testimony of the church is the real content and the real function of the church. The ground of the church is the outward appearance and the position of the church in practicality. These two aspects&mdash;one inward as the content and the function and the other outward as the appearance and the position&mdash;match each other, and both are indispensable. Having only an inward testimony without the outward ground is insufficient; having only the outward ground without the inward testimony is also insufficient. This is comparable to the Ark in the Old Testament, which had an inward reality and the tabernacle as its outward match; neither could function properly without the other. In this book we will look at the inward reality of the church and its outward match, that is, the inward testimony and the outward ground. First, we will look at the testimony of the church.</p><h1 class="series">SECTION ONE</h1>
<h1 class="series">THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL DESIRE&mdash;<br />
TO EXPRESS HIMSELF IN THE SON</h1>
<p>Concerning the testimony of the church, we must start with God&rsquo;s eternal desire. What is God&rsquo;s desire in eternity? What is the goal of His desire? If we carefully read the entire Bible, we will come to a conclusion: God&rsquo;s desire, God&rsquo;s purpose, from eternity to eternity is to express Himself in His Son.</p>
<p>Those who know God all realize that there is something mysterious about God; that is, He is always hidden. This is why atheists often ask, &ldquo;You say that God exists, but where is He? Is He visible?&rdquo; I often refute them by using an illustration, asking, &ldquo;Is there such a thing as electricity? If you say that there is, can you see it? Where is it? What does it look like? Can you say that something is nonexistent simply because you cannot see it? Is this logical?&rdquo; In the same way, God surely exists, but He is invisible. He is invisible, yet He surely exists. This really is a mystery. This is a characteristic of God; He likes to hide Himself.</p>
<p>However, God also likes to manifest Himself. This is even more amazing. The most hidden thing in this meeting hall is electricity, but electricity is also the most manifested thing. The electricity is invisible, but the meeting hall is full of electric light. This is a perfect illustration. The most hidden One in the universe is God, but at the same time, God also is the most manifested One. Although God is invisible, when we observe the phenomena in the universe, we can see proof of God&rsquo;s existence everywhere.</p>
<p>Here is an amazing thing. In the beginning of the Bible we see only God&rsquo;s speaking: &ldquo;He spoke, and it was; / He commanded, and it stood&rdquo; (Psa. 33:9). God spoke, but He did not manifest Himself. At the end of the Bible, however, a city is manifested; this city is the New Jerusalem. At the end God will not need to speak. God will be the light in the city, His Son will be the lamp, and the city will be His shining forth. God as the light in His Son as the lamp will shine forth through the city. Therefore, the glory of the city is the glory of God, and the shining of the city is the shining of God, just as the shining of the light bulb is the shining of electricity. At that time, since there will be God&rsquo;s shining, God&rsquo;s expression, there will not be a need for Him to speak.</p>
<p>This shows us a principle that when there is a need for God&rsquo;s work, there is more of God&rsquo;s speaking; and when more of God&rsquo;s work is manifested, there is more of God&rsquo;s expression. God&rsquo;s speaking can be seen in the beginning of Genesis, but not His expression. God&rsquo;s expression, however, can be seen at the end of Revelation because He has gained a vessel to express Himself. In the beginning, however, God did not have such a vessel. From eternity to eternity the desire of God is to express Himself so that He, as the hidden God, may be completely expressed through a vessel. This vessel fully depends upon His Son. God intends to express Himself in His Son and through His Son.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE MEANING OF BEING THE SON</h2>
<p>We need to see that God&rsquo;s desire is to have sons. God&rsquo;s work in the universe is a story of gaining many sons. In John 1 and 3 we can see God&rsquo;s Son, His only begotten Son. But in Romans 8 the only begotten Son has become the firstborn Son. Since Christ is the firstborn Son of God, then there must be more sons than just the Son; there must be other sons. Hebrews 2:10 speaks of God leading many sons into glory. These many sons are a corporate son, a corporate body composed of many sons.</p>
<p>John 12:24 speaks of a grain of wheat which denotes the only begotten Son of God. This grain of wheat was sown into the ground, and it grew to become many grains, that is, many sons. Originally, it was a grain of wheat, which was the only begotten Son, but it becomes many grains, that is, many sons. Originally, there was just the Son; now this Son has become many sons, a corporate body composed of many sons. Therefore, in John 20:17, the Lord said, &ldquo;My Father and your Father.&rdquo; Just as He is the Son of God, we also are sons of God. This is God&rsquo;s intention in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Son Being the One<br />
Who Expresses the Father</h2>
<p>In the Bible a son expresses or declares the father. John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; This shows that the Lord Jesus, as the Son of God, expresses God. All of us, including sisters, are sons of God. Therefore, we all should express God. We can illustrate what it means to express God as sons of God by looking at Brother Huang. Let me ask, &ldquo;Is Brother Huang&rsquo;s father a black man?&rdquo; Even if none of us have seen Brother Huang&rsquo;s father, I think we all would say that his father is definitely not black. We can know this simply by looking at Brother Huang&rsquo;s face. The son always expresses the father. When we see the son, it is not hard to imagine what the father looks like. In the same way, we express God as sons of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Son Being the Image of God</h2>
<p>The Son manifests the Father because the Son is the image of the Father. The Chinese refer to a person who does not honor his father as being &ldquo;non-alike,&rdquo; that is, a person who is not like his father. This implies that anyone who is not like his father dishonors his father. A man honors his father by being like his father; only a man who is like his father can be considered a dutiful son. A son should look like his father and behave like his father because a son is the expression of the father.</p>
<p>The Son is the image of the Father (Col. 1:15); this is true not only with the only begotten Son but also with the many sons. Romans 8 tells us that God chose us and predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son. God did this so that we would express Him with His Son. I hope that God&rsquo;s children would see the New Testament concept that a son is the expression of the father because a son is the image of the father.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Son Being<br />
the Effulgence of God&rsquo;s Glory and<br />
the Impress of His Substance</h2>
<p>The Son expresses God not only because He is the image of God but also because He is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of His substance (Heb. 1:3). From eternity to eternity God&rsquo;s desire is to express Himself. God expresses Himself through His nature which is in His Son. This enables His Son to express Him. Originally, His Son was the only begotten Son, but now His Son is identified with many sons, a corporate body composed of sons. He has put His very nature into these sons (2 Pet. 1:4), and these sons have become His expression. When there was merely the only begotten Son, there was not such a thing as the church, but when many sons were produced, the church was also produced. Furthermore, these many sons are not scattered but joined together; they are not individual sons but a corporate son. This corporate son is the church. Therefore, the church is His expression&mdash;the effulgence of His glory and the impress of His substance. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may fully see that God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to gain a corporate Body composed of many sons for His expression, which is the church.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE STEPS IN GOD&rsquo;S EXPRESSION</h2>
<p>Since God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to be expressed, all of the work that He has been doing throughout the ages has been for the fulfillment of His purpose; they are the steps in His expression of Himself in men and among men. This line is recorded from the beginning of Genesis to the end of Revelation. The stories from Adam to the New Jerusalem all show how God manifests Himself. We can only briefly look at this line of God&rsquo;s expression throughout the ages.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. In Adam</h2>
<p>The first step of God&rsquo;s expression is seen in Adam. Whenever we read the story of Adam, we must remember that his story reveals God&rsquo;s desire to be expressed through him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Making Man in His Own Image<br />
and in His Likeness</h2>
<p>Why did God make man? Why did He make Adam? The record in Genesis 1 clearly reveals that God&rsquo;s intention in making man was for man to be in His image. God made man in His own image and in His likeness; the man He made was His image and likeness (Gen. 1:26-27). In the universe the man on earth is in the image of God.</p>
<p>We have previously said that the making of man according to God&rsquo;s image is like a person being photographed. If Brother Huang&rsquo;s photograph is taken, the photograph will surely be an image of him. He could print thousands and thousands of copies, distribute them to cities all over the globe, and publish them in many newspapers and magazines; consequently, his image would be seen all over the earth. Similarly, when God made man, He made man in His own image. Therefore, we can say that man was a photograph of God. God also wanted man to be fruitful and multiply to fill all the earth; in this way the image of God, His photograph, would fill the earth.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s action clearly implies that He wanted to be expressed through man. Although Adam had only the image and likeness of God outwardly, in principle he expressed God. Although man did not have the life and nature of God, he still expressed God and manifested the story of God in part. Look at Adam. He was so thoughtful, wise, loving, and capable in his decisions. All of these characteristics showed forth something concerning God and expressed God in part.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Forming a Spirit in Adam</h2>
<p>In His making of Adam, God did not put His own life and nature into him, but He formed a spirit in Adam so that Adam would be able not only to contact God but also to receive God (Gen. 2:7; Job 33:4; Zech. 12:1). Contacting God may involve merely communicating with God, but receiving God involves God coming into man. Not only does God want man to contact Him; He also wants man to receive Him.</p>
<p>The Bible is clear in its revelation concerning this matter. After God made Adam, He placed Adam in front of the tree of life. This clearly indicates that He wanted Adam to eat the fruit of the tree of life. This is a symbolic picture. Gradually, the Bible shows that the source of life is God (Psa. 36:9). Therefore, we may also say that life is God. Moreover, to eat is to receive. We all have eaten some food and received it into us. Therefore, symbolically, when God put Adam in front of the tree of life, He wanted Adam to eat Him as food, that is, to receive Him as life. If Adam had received God, he would have received God&rsquo;s life and nature. Thus, he would not only have been like God outwardly, in outward form; he would also have been like God inwardly, in content, in nature. Even though Adam did not receive the life of God at that time, this was God&rsquo;s desire. God wanted Adam to receive Him so that he could be like God both outwardly and inwardly in order to express Him. In our reading of the Word, we need to see God&rsquo;s thought. When God made man, His thought from the very beginning was to express Himself in man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. In the Patriarchs</h2>
<p>After Adam, the Bible shows the generations of the patriarchs, including Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in whom the expression of God can also be seen. We do not have the time to look at them in much detail, but two matters concerning them are important.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Through Their Actions of Faith</h2>
<p>The faith and actions of the patriarchs, or rather, their actions due to their faith, all expressed God (Heb. 11:4-21; 12:1). They were people who trusted in God. Through their faith they were brought into a relationship with God. Furthermore, their actions were affected and changed due to their faith. The effects and changes in their actions were expressions of God. While the people around them walked according to the manner of the world and expressed the world, the walk and living of the patriarchs through their faith in God manifested a different condition and manner. Their condition and manner enabled others to know God more and understand God more, that is, to see God to a certain extent. Their actions of faith can be considered as an expression of God.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Through Their Characteristics</h2>
<p>Each of the patriarchs bore some characteristics that expressed God. For example, Abel characteristically testified to the people that God condemns sin and cannot accept sinful men without redemption, because He is holy and righteous (Gen. 4:4). In the garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword guarded the way to the tree of life (3:24) to prevent sinful man from contacting God in a loose and casual manner, like Cain. Man also cannot please God by his own works, like Cain. A sinner can draw near to God only through the way of redemption established by God. According to His holiness and righteousness, God requires sinners to have a sense of guilt and to look to a sacrifice as a substitute in order to be accepted by Him. In this special matter, Abel declared God to us. Through Abel&rsquo;s characteristic living, God was able to express Himself.</p>
<p>Enoch lived in an age in which people lived by themselves, completely without God. At the end of Genesis 4 men had already put God completely aside. They were able to invent culture by themselves and to create a godless living for themselves; thus, they were able to live without trusting in God. However, the result of a culture and living without God is death. Therefore, Genesis 5 is a record full of death. It speaks of many men who lived a number of years and then died. The Chinese language uses four words to describe the events in the course of a human life: <em>birth, age, disease,</em> and <em>death.</em> But when Genesis speaks of a man&rsquo;s life, it uses only three words: <em>lived, begot,</em> and <em>died.</em> It only says that someone lived for a number of years, begot children, and died, because they all lived a life without God. These men, who lived by themselves without God in a self-made, godless culture, all ended in death. But at this time, Enoch, who lived by God, walked with God, and needed God moment by moment, did not live a life in this self-made, godless culture (5:22). Therefore, he was able to escape death and was taken by God without seeing death (v. 24). In this manner he manifested God, enabling us to see God.</p>
<p>When we look at Noah, we can see that during his time the people on the earth were worldly and living a godless life; the earth was filled with evil, violence, and unrighteousness. Therefore, God condemned that generation; He was not pleased with that evil generation. He determined to judge and destroy the age. But during this time, Noah lived in the presence of God and walked according to the will of God (6:8-9). Noah was an upright man, a righteous man, and he bore an anti-testimony in that age. He preached to the people, in effect, saying, &ldquo;God is righteous, and He will surely judge wickedness and destroy this world. Therefore, I cannot live according to this evil world; I want to walk with God by living and acting according to the righteousness of God.&rdquo; Noah&rsquo;s testimony declared that God is One who judges evil. Therefore, Noah was also an expression of God.</p>
<p>Let us look at Abraham next. At the time of Abraham, the earth was filled with idols and human rebellion. Men wanted to exercise authority for themselves, and they wanted to exalt themselves and put God aside. Therefore, they built the tower of Babel to make a name for themselves. At the tower of Babel, that is, at Babylon, men rejected God, choosing demons and idols instead; men rejected God and cared for themselves by exalting themselves. But then Abraham was called by God, and he left that place (15:6). Coming to the land of Canaan and standing on the heavenly position, he testified for God, indicating, &ldquo;This world of idols and this situation at Babel cannot be tolerated by God. God and idols cannot coexist. God will judge Babel. This is the reason I came out of Babel to stand in the land of Canaan, which is heavenly and separated. I stand on God&rsquo;s side, I trust God, and I take God as everything.&rdquo; By doing this he expressed the nature of God and manifested God to a great extent (17:1).</p>
<p>Now let us look at Isaac. The characteristic of Isaac is very simple. He showed forth only one thing: Anyone who is a son of God does not need to labor or strive for himself (Gen. 26:2-3). Everything has been prepared and accomplished by God the Father, everything is inherited, and everything is of grace. This makes known another aspect of God, and it manifests God to us.</p>
<p>Finally, let us look at Jacob next. Jacob&rsquo;s characteristic reveals that the self-struggling and natural ability of a person who belongs to God are against God. God wants to work Himself into those who belong to Him. God wanted to turn Jacob into Israel, to turn a crafty person, a supplanter, into a prince of God so that he would be filled with the element of God to become an expression of God (Gen. 32:28; 47:31). This is the story of Jacob.</p>
<p>If we consider the stories of the patriarchs and look at them collectively, we can see a very meaningful line. In the beginning of Genesis, there is a sinner who needed a sacrifice as his substitute, and at the end of Genesis, there is a natural person who has been completely transformed into Israel, a prince of God. The first expression of God in a person who belongs to Him is that God has judged sin and provided a sacrifice for sinners to draw near to Him. The final expression of God in a person who belongs to Him is that God has wrought Himself into him until he, like Jacob, becomes Israel, that is, he is no longer a crooked and crafty person but one who is filled with God. The ultimate goal of God in all those who belong to Him is to make every one of us a person who is filled with God to be His expression. The sum total of the stories of the patriarchs is a picture, a photograph, that manifests and expresses God so that we may know the characteristics of God. Everything that the Spirit of God wrought into them is for the expression of God.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Among the People of Israel</h2>
<p>After the patriarchs, God manifested Himself in man among the people of Israel. This was a great step in God&rsquo;s manifestation, and it contains numerous types and stories that express God. This step of manifestation occupies a great place in the Bible. Among the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, thirty-eight speak concerning this step in God&rsquo;s manifestation, showing the God who is among the people of Israel. We can only briefly mention the important points.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Through the Law, Ordinances, Rituals,<br />
and Regulations</h2>
<p>God first manifested Himself among the people of Israel through the law He gave with all of its supplementary ordinances, rituals, and regulations (Lev. 11:44-45). If we look at every article, every item, of these laws, ordinances, rituals, and regulations according to the letter, they are merely the letter (2 Cor. 3:6). However, if we have the revelation of the Holy Spirit, we can see God in them. We can see God&rsquo;s appearance in the law, and we can see God&rsquo;s likeness in the ordinances. Even the rituals and regulations explain God and express God; therefore, they are revelations of God.</p>
<p>It is not hard to understand that the laws and ordinances that God gave to the Israelites expressed God to them. For example, in our homes we have rules and regulations, such as when to get out of bed, when to turn off the lights, when to eat meals, when to pray, when to clean, and when to take care of personal matters. When we look at a rule, we know something concerning the person who makes the rule. If eight o&rsquo;clock is our time to get out of bed and ten o&rsquo;clock is our time to eat breakfast, then we are a group of lazy people who love to sleep. The laws and regulations that a person makes always reflect upon the one who makes the law. The laws and regulations enacted by a person are a revelation of the person. In like manner, if we carefully read each law and ordinance enacted by God in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, and Joshua, we definitely would bow our head and worship, saying, &ldquo;I have seen a God who is holy, righteous, upright, and full of light. I have seen a God who is great yet detailed and fine, a God who takes care of great things but who also does not neglect small matters. He is forbearing, patient, fair, and loving.&rdquo; O dear brothers and sisters, we should not merely read the laws and regulations; we need to see God in them because they are expressions of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Through the Tabernacle</h2>
<p>Among the people of Israel the tabernacle was a mysterious thing. When the tabernacle was raised up at the end of Exodus, a cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of God filled the tabernacle (Exo. 40:34-35). When people saw the tabernacle, they saw the glory of God. The glory of God is the expression of God. God Himself was expressed in the tabernacle. The tabernacle not only typifies the church but also signified the people of Israel. At that time, the whole congregation of the people of Israel was a tabernacle of God. God dwelt among them to express Himself. In addition to the tabernacle, there also was the Ark, which denotes Christ, and the altar, which denotes the cross. Through the cross and in Christ, God was able to dwell among the people of Israel. These are all types. But this is a principle: The tabernacle was a place where God was expressed. We do not have the time to read all the stories of the tabernacle, but readers of the Bible know that there are many items related to the tabernacle, and every item reveals the nature or character of God and expresses God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Through the Temple</h2>
<p>The temple came after the tabernacle. The temple is an enlarged tabernacle, a fixed and stable tabernacle. In principle the two are the same. When the building of the temple was completed, the glory of God also filled the temple (1 Kings 8:10-11). Like the tabernacle, the temple not only typifies the church but also signified the people of Israel. In God&rsquo;s view, all of the people of Israel were God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth at that time. This dwelling, however, was still through the altar and by the Ark; that is, God&rsquo;s expression among His people is through the cross and in Christ. Therefore, the temple was also an expression of God. It was an expression of God on a great scale.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Through the Priests, Judges, Kings, and Prophets</h2>
<p>Among the people of Israel, there were some with offices. First, there were priests, later there were judges, still later there were kings, and finally there were prophets (Deut. 33:8-10; Judg. 6:12; 1 Sam. 13:14; 1 Kings 17:18, 24; 2 Kings 4:9, 22). We do not have the time to speak concerning them in detail; however, there is a principle: In all of these offices, whether priests, judges, kings, or prophets, we can see the likeness of God to a certain extent. In the priests we see God&rsquo;s holiness, in the judges we see God&rsquo;s might, in the kings we see God&rsquo;s authority, and in the prophets we see God&rsquo;s wisdom and prudence. After we read the stories of these persons, we can see the manifestation of God to a certain degree. They expressed God. Some of them expressed God to such an extent that even when people saw them, they perceived that they were &ldquo;men of God.&rdquo; When people saw them, it was as if they saw God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Through All the Godly Men, the Men of God</h2>
<p>Among the people of Israel, there were also some godly men who lived in the presence of God. In the Bible they were called men of God. For example, in the title of Psalm 90 Moses is called &ldquo;the man of God.&rdquo; They were not only men but also men of God. They were not only men who belonged to God but also men who expressed God. God was seen in them and in their situations. When people saw them, they saw the appearance of God in them. Consider the three friends of Daniel. They were thrown into a fiery furnace by Nebuchadnezzar, yet the words they spoke and the attitude they expressed all conveyed the flavor of God. It is no wonder, therefore, that when they were in the fiery furnace, someone whose appearance was like the Son of God was with them; they really had the semblance of God (Dan. 3:25). The elderly Simeon in Luke 2:25 is another example. In him we can sense God, that is, he was in an atmosphere of God and had a certain flavor of God. Therefore, these men of God were men who expressed God.</p><h2 class="head2">D. In Christ</h2>
<p>The three steps in God&rsquo;s manifestations mentioned above are in the Old Testament. There are two great steps in God&rsquo;s manifestation in the New Testament. The first step is seen in Christ. We all know that Christ is the manifestation of God; He came to earth for the expression of God. This is a great event recorded in the New Testament, and we need to speak more concerning it.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Christ Being the Mystery of God</h2>
<p>The Bible tells us that Christ is the mystery of God (Col. 2:2). What is a mystery? It is something that exists yet cannot be understood, touched, seen, or searched out. If something really exists but is either not clear or understandable to man, it is called a mystery. In the universe God is a mystery. Does God exist? Yes, He exists, but what do we know about God? This matter is quite puzzling to man; hence, God is a mystery. Suppose I stood and did not speak anything. You would know that I have something to speak, but if I did not say anything, everyone would be puzzled and consider me a mystery. Having words but not speaking them makes me a mystery. However, once I speak all of these words, I am no longer a mystery. My words reveal the stories that are within me. Therefore, words are the revelation of a mystery. In the same way, the Word who was in the beginning with God revealed the stories of God (John 1:1). Therefore, this Word is the revelation of the mystery of God. Who is this Word? This Word is Christ. Christ is the mystery of God. Do you want to know the story of God? Do you want to know about God? Do you want to know what kind of God He is? All you need to do is look at Christ, because the story of God, that is, everything concerning God, is hidden in Christ. Christ declared all of the things of God. Therefore, we can know God only through Christ.</p>
<p>When he was preaching the gospel, a brother once said, &ldquo;Many people think that God is a very strict God who resembles one of the fierce-looking idols in the temples. People do not know the real story concerning God. But then Christ came; He was so compassionate that even lepers could approach and touch Him and even a sinning woman could avoid His condemnation (8:11). Through Christ people know the things concerning God, especially His great love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, I am using a shallow illustration. The story of God is too complex, too mysterious. If we read through the four Gospels, we would see many intricate matters concerning God. The records concerning Christ, the footsteps in His life, including His words, deeds, and manners, are all expressions of God. No one has ever seen God, but Christ has declared Him (1:18). The four Gospels are not merely a record concerning Christ; they are a detailed portrait of God. From the record in the Gospels concerning Christ, we know about God. Christ is the mystery of God, the story of God. Christ is not only our Savior but also God&rsquo;s expression. As God&rsquo;s expression, Christ has become our Savior. We need to know Christ thoroughly in order to understand the stories of God. Everything in the Gospels is nothing less than a portrait of God, an expression of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. All the Fullness of the Godhead<br />
Dwelling in Christ</h2>
<p>Christ could express God because all the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him (Col. 1:19; 2:9). All the content of God, all the fullness of the Godhead, all of God&rsquo;s substance is in Christ. Therefore, in order to know the content of God and to touch the fullness of the Godhead, we need to know Christ and gain Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Christ as the Only Begotten Son of God<br />
Being One with God&mdash;<br />
God Being Christ&rsquo;s Substance and<br />
Christ Being God&rsquo;s Expression,<br />
thus Christ Being the Temple of God</h2>
<p>Christ is the only begotten Son of God (John 1:18). As the only begotten Son, the life of God the Father is given to Him alone, and all that God is can be found in Him. As the only begotten Son of God, Christ is the unique expression of God. Let us not forget the meaning of being a son. A son is the expression of the father. All that God is can be seen in the Son. The Father and the Son are one (10:30). The substance of the Son is God, and the Son is God&rsquo;s expression (Heb. 1:3). Therefore, the Son was the temple of God on earth (John 2:19-21). In the Son and through the Son, God was expressed before men.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Christ Entering into Glory<br />
to Become God&rsquo;s Firstborn Son That God<br />
May Be Completely Expressed through Him</h2>
<p>Even though all the fullness of the Godhead was hidden in Christ when He was on the earth, He did not show forth the full measure of the glory of God. He completely entered into God&rsquo;s glory only after His death and resurrection. Before His resurrection, He briefly showed forth the glory of God during His transfiguration on the mountain (Luke 24:26). When He was transfigured, He entered into God&rsquo;s glory; in other words, God was glorified and shined out of Him. This may be likened to the shining of electricity. When a light switch is off, electricity is hidden, and there is no shining. However, when the switch is turned on, electricity shines out. When electricity is &ldquo;glorified,&rdquo; the entire meeting hall enters into &ldquo;glory.&rdquo; When people looked at Christ before His transfiguration, they saw only a Nazarene whose visage, whose form, was marred and who had no attractive form nor majesty (Isa. 52:14; 53:2). He was only thirty years old, but He may have appeared to be fifty years old. When He was on the Mount of Transfiguration, His appearance was briefly changed, and God was glorified and shined out from within Him. But this was only for a brief moment; He immediately appeared again as a man with a marred visage. Later He passed through death and resurrection and fully entered into God&rsquo;s glory. God was completely glorified and manifested through Him. The glory of God, which had been concealed within Him, was released, shined out, and manifested through His death and resurrection. In His resurrection He entered into the glory of God, and this glory was God&rsquo;s manifestation, just as electric light is the shining of the electricity, the manifestation of the electricity.</p>
<p>The resurrected Christ who entered into God&rsquo;s glory is a complete expression of God. Furthermore, in His resurrection He became the firstborn Son of God and was no longer merely the only begotten Son of God (Rom. 1:4; Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:4-5). When He was resurrected, He dispensed the life of God within Him into thousands and millions of those who believe into Him. As the one grain of wheat, He became many grains. The life of God within Him, as the one grain, was dispensed into many grains. In this way, the only begotten Son of God became the Firstborn among many brothers, the many sons of God, thus enabling God to have an enlarged expression (Rom. 8:29). This enlarged expression is the church.</p><h2 class="head2">E. In the Church</h2>
<p>There are two great steps in the manifestation of God in the New Testament: The first step is seen in Christ, and the second step is seen in the church. Christ is the expression of God, but the church also is an expression of God. This does not mean that the church expresses God more than Christ; rather, the church is an enlarged expression of God. Just as Christ expresses God, the church also expresses God. The principle of expression is the same, but the scope of the expression has been enlarged.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Church Being the Mystery of Christ</h2>
<p>In addition to saying that Christ is the mystery of God, the Bible also says that the church is the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4-6). Whereas Christ is the only begotten Son of God, the church is the many sons of God as the enlargement of Christ. The only begotten Son of God who has been enlarged is the church composed of the sons of God. In brief, the enlarged Christ is the church. All that is of Christ is in the church. Therefore, the church is the mystery of Christ.</p>
<p>Christ also is a mystery. For two thousand years people have talked and preached concerning Christ everywhere, but no one has seen Christ for nearly two thousand years. Christ is a mystery! Some may say that Christ does not exist, because we cannot see Him; however, this is not logical. There are many invisible things that exist. Electricity is one of them. We cannot see electricity, but we can see manifestations of electricity, such as light and heat. In the same way, Christians and the church are expressions of Christ. For nearly two thousand years no one has seen Christ, but people have seen the church. The mystery of Christ, the intricate matters of Christ, the story of Christ, is seen through the church. If we want to know Christ, we must look at the church. The church is the mystery of Christ and the expression of Christ, just as Christ is the mystery of God and the expression of God. Just as all that is of God is in Christ, all that is of Christ is in the church. For nearly four thousand years no one had ever seen God, but Christ revealed Him. In like manner, for nearly two thousand years no one has seen Christ, but the church has revealed Him. First Corinthians 14 says that whenever we meet together and people come among us, they can declare, &ldquo;Indeed God is among you&rdquo; (vv. 23-25). We have seen this situation often in our meetings. When God is sensed among us, it is Christ who is being sensed among us. Only the church can manifest the mystery of Christ and express the story of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Church Being the Body of Christ,<br />
the Fullness of Christ, the Surplus of Christ</h2>
<p>Just as Christ is the expression of God, the church is the expression of Christ. The church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ, the surplus of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). Christ is so full and so rich that He overflows with a surplus&mdash;the church. Someone told me that every male is missing a rib bone, because God took a rib out of Adam to build Eve. Although I have not studied medicine, I do not believe this. I do not believe that Adam had one less rib when a rib was taken from him to build Eve. If this were the case, Eve would have been Adam&rsquo;s depletion rather than his surplus. After a part of Adam was built into Eve, he remained whole without lacking a rib. In the same manner, after Christ overflowed with the church, He did not become something less. As the fullness of Christ, the church is the overflow of Christ. The church is His Body, His expression. Our body is also our expression. If we were disembodied souls, would people still be able to recognize us? Could they tell us apart? Could they see us? We appear before others through our body. Our body is our manifestation. Sometimes we see someone&rsquo;s shadow or see someone walking at a distance, but by his manner, we know who is coming. A person&rsquo;s body is his best manifestation. Similarly, as the Body of Christ, the church is the best manifestation of Christ. Christ expresses Himself in, by, and through the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Church Being the Many Sons of God<br />
United with God&mdash;God in Christ Being<br />
the Substance of the Church,<br />
and the Church in the Holy Spirit<br />
Being the Expression of God,<br />
thus the Church Being a Dwelling Place of God</h2>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ, and it is also the many sons of God joined to God to be one (Heb. 2:10-11). God in Christ is the substance of the church, and the church in the Holy Spirit is the expression of God. Thus, the church is a dwelling place of God (Eph. 2:20-21).</p>
<p>On the one hand, the church is the Body to Christ, and on the other hand, the church is the dwelling place to God. On the one hand, we are the many members of Christ, and on the other hand, we are the many sons of God. As the many members of Christ, we express Christ; as the many sons of God, we express God. Of course, these two matters&mdash;being the many members of Christ and being the many sons of God&mdash;are inseparable; they are the two sides of one matter. In regard to expressing Christ, the emphasis is on being the many members of Christ to be His one Body, and in regard to expressing God, the emphasis is on being the many sons of God to be His house. This house is the dwelling place of God, a place where God is expressed. Both a body and a dwelling are places in which one can rest and express himself. Therefore, both as the Body of Christ and as the house of God, the church is the place in which Christ and God can rest and find expression.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Church Composed of the Many Sons of God<br />
Entering into Glory for God<br />
to Have a Full Expression&mdash;<br />
the Manifestation of the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>The church, which is composed of the many sons of God (Heb. 2:10), will enter into the glory of God in the future, just as Christ the firstborn Son of God entered into glory. This will be the time of our rapture and transfiguration. When all of God&rsquo;s sons enter into God&rsquo;s glory and are completely transformed, God will gain a complete and full expression. This will be the manifestation of the New Jerusalem. At that time, God will be completely in Christ, and Christ will be completely in the New Jerusalem, that is, in the church. Thus, the church will completely express God in Christ. Revelation 21 says that God will be the light shining in the New Jerusalem while Christ will be the lamp of the light (vv. 11, 22-23). Moreover, the New Jerusalem with its surrounding, transparent wall will be like a great transparent lampshade. God as the light dwelling in Christ as the lamp will shine forth through Christ, and Christ in the New Jerusalem will shine forth through the New Jerusalem. Therefore the glory, the splendor, of the New Jerusalem is God who is being expressed. God in Christ is completely mingled with the church as one, and the church in Christ is completely transformed to be like God; at the same time, God in Christ completely shines out of the church and is expressed through the church. This is God&rsquo;s ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Therefore, from Adam to the New Jerusalem there is a line in the Bible showing that God wants to be mingled with man so that He may express Himself in man and through man. The final step of this line is with the church. The church is the ultimate, full expression of God, which is the goal of God&rsquo;s eternal desire.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH&rsquo;S FUNCTION&mdash;<br />
TO EXPRESS CHRIST<br />
AND TO TESTIFY OF CHRIST</h1>
<p>We have seen that God&rsquo;s eternal intention is to express Himself in Christ. Furthermore, the expression of God has been enlarged to be the church. The church has been produced because the only begotten Son of God, who expressed God, has been enlarged to become the many sons of God. Previously, the Son of God was God&rsquo;s only begotten Son, but now the only begotten Son has become a corporate son. Previously, the expression of God could be seen only in Christ, but now the expression of God has become a corporate expression. This corporate expression of God is the testimony of the church. If we know the expression of God, we will know the testimony of the church, the function of the church. Therefore, we need to see the function of the church in relation to Christ.</p>
<p>The function of the church is to express Christ, to testify of Christ. We have repeatedly said that God expresses Himself through Christ by putting Himself into Christ. In the same way, Christ puts Himself into the church to be expressed through the church. Therefore, the function of the church is to be Christ&rsquo;s expression. When the church expresses Christ, the church testifies of Christ in the universe. Therefore, the function of the church is to be a testimony expressing Christ.</p>
<p>On the evening before His death, the Lord Jesus told the disciples, &ldquo;When the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you..., the Spirit of reality,...He will testify concerning Me; and you testify also&rdquo; (John 15:26-27). The Lord meant that we should outwardly testify of the things that the Spirit has inwardly revealed to us concerning Him. When the Lord was about to ascend to the heavens after His resurrection, the disciples wanted to discuss several matters with Him, but He told them that these matters were of no concern to them. Instead, they were told to wait for the Holy Spirit to come upon them. The Holy Spirit would come to testify concerning the Lord. The Lord said, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses...unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; (Acts 1:8). We need to understand that this witnessing is carried out not only by preaching Christ in words but even more by people living out Christ. Moreover, the saved ones should live out Christ, not as individuals but as a corporate entity&mdash;the Body, which is the church. To live out Christ in this way is to express Christ, to testify of Christ. This is the function of the church concerning Christ. Now we will look at the testifying function of the church in detail.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE MEANING OF BEING A TESTIMONY&mdash;<br />
SPEAKING FORTH GOD,<br />
DECLARING GOD, AND EXPRESSING GOD</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, being God&rsquo;s testimony involves speaking forth God, declaring God, and expressing God. Even if no humans were serving in this manner, there would be some things or some words that would testify of Him. Whether there are certain words, certain matters, or certain individuals or groups of individuals, whoever or whatever speaks forth God, declares God, and expresses God is a testimony of God. This is the meaning of testimony in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. ADAM, THE PATRIARCHS, THE TABERNACLE,<br />
THE TEMPLE, THE PROPHETS,<br />
AND ALL THE MEN OF GOD IN THE OLD TESTAMENT<br />
BEING TESTIMONIES OF GOD</h2>
<p>We have already seen that Adam, the patriarchs, the tabernacle and the temple among the children of Israel, the prophets, and all the men of God in the Old Testament were expressions of God. Since they were expressions of God, they were also testimonies of God. Adam was a testimony of God, as was Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the positive persons and things among the children of Israel. Since these people and things expressed God to a lesser or greater degree, they were part of the testimony of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE LAW BEING THE TESTIMONY OF GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Law Being Called &ldquo;the Testimony&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In Exodus 25:16, 21, and 40:20 the word <em>testimony</em> is translated as &ldquo;law&rdquo; in the Chinese Union Version. God told Moses to put the law into the Ark, but the Hebrew word used in these verses is actually the word for <em>testimony.</em> This shows that in God&rsquo;s eyes the law was His testimony. Therefore, He called the law &ldquo;the testimony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the context of Psalms 19:7, 78:5, and 119:2 <em>testimony</em> and <em>testimonies</em> also denote the law. In these verses the law is also called &ldquo;the testimony&rdquo; or &ldquo;testimonies.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Tablets of the Law Being Called<br />
&ldquo;the Tablets of the Testimony&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The law&mdash;the Ten Commandments&mdash;was written on two tablets. In Exodus 31:18 the Chinese Union Version speaks of &ldquo;the two tablets of the law,&rdquo; but the Hebrew text actually refers to &ldquo;the two tablets of the testimony.&rdquo; Since the law is the testimony, the two tablets on which the law was written were called &ldquo;the tablets of the testimony.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Ark Being Called<br />
&ldquo;the Ark of the Testimony&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The Ark in Exodus 40:21 of the Chinese Union Version is called &ldquo;the Ark of the Law,&rdquo; but it is actually &ldquo;the Ark of the Testimony&rdquo; according to the Hebrew text. This is because the law of God was in the Ark. Since the law was the testimony, the Ark was called &ldquo;the Ark of the Testimony.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Law Being a Testimony of God<br />
in That It Reveals the Attributes of God and Explains the Kind of God He Is</h2>
<p>The law is a testimony of God because the law reveals the attributes of God and explains the kind of God He is. When we read the law, the Ten Commandments, we see that the God who enacted the law is so holy, full of light, loving, and righteous. The Ten Commandments show us the attributes of God, enabling us to know God&rsquo;s nature. Since the law explains God and reveals His attributes, it is a testimony of God.</p>
<p>If a person is wasteful and unruly, he will surely make laws that are lax and wild. If a person is serious and righteous, he will make laws that are strict and just. When we look at a law, we can know the kind of person who enacted it, because a law always shows the character of the law-giver. In the same way, the laws of the Old Testament are holy, full of light, compassionate, and righteous because this is the character of the God who enacted them. Since the law testifies of God, the law is the testimony of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Every Requirement on Man,<br />
according to What God Is, Being a Law to Man</h2>
<p>Although the law is the testimony of God, it is still a law to man. The law consists of all the requirements that God places upon man according to what He is. On one hand, these requirements are a testimony of God, revealing what God is, and on the other hand, they are a law to man, requiring man to do certain things. For example, God is a jealous God; thus, He commands man to not make idols and to not worship idols (20:3-5). Because God is also absolutely loving and pure, He commands man to not kill and to not commit adultery (vv. 13-14). Furthermore, God is absolutely true and honest; for this reason, He commands man to not testify with false testimony, that is, to not lie (v. 16). Therefore, on one hand, these laws declare what kind of God He is, and on the other hand, they require man to conduct himself according to what God is. Since these laws are the explanation of God, they are a testimony of God; since they place requirements on man, they are the law to man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Only God Himself Being Able to Satisfy<br />
the Requirements of the Law, Which Are for Man to Have the Divine Attributes and Be Like God</h2>
<p>The law requires man to have the divine attributes and be like God. Therefore, the Scriptures say, &ldquo;I am Jehovah your God. Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy&rdquo; (Lev. 11:44). God requires man to be like Him. This is the law. In this respect, however, there is no way for man to fulfill the requirements of the law. Indeed, man has absolutely no power to keep the law of God; only God Himself can keep the law and fulfill the law. This is because the law of God requires man to have the divine attributes and be like God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Man Being Able to Spontaneously Fulfill<br />
the Requirements of the Law,<br />
If He Touches God and What God Is,<br />
but Attempting to Keep the Law<br />
Because of the Requirements of the Law<br />
Being in Vain</h2>
<p>Some may ask why God would give such requirements if it is impossible for man to meet the requirements of the law. God gave these requirements for three reasons. First, they show us the kind of God He is. Second, we will see that we have absolutely no power and no way to fulfill the requirements. We are unable to fulfill the requirements of God, and there is no way we can fulfill them by ourselves; only He can fulfill them, and only He has a way to fulfill them. With man this is impossible, but with God it is possible. Only He can meet His requirements. This points to the third reason. He wants to be received into us, and by contacting and touching Him, we allow Him to fulfill His requirements within us and through us.</p>
<p>The requirements of the law of God compel man to receive God. If man could fulfill the requirements of God, man would have no need to trust in God and no need to receive the Lord as Savior. Since man cannot meet the requirements of the law, however, he needs to seek refuge in God and receive God. When God comes into man and becomes the power of life within man and which passes through man, He meets the requirements of His law. Romans 8:4 speaks of the Spirit of life fulfilling the righteous requirement of the law in those who walk according to the spirit.</p>
<p>Therefore, the reality, the substance, of the law is God Himself. If a person touches God Himself, if he touches God&rsquo;s being, then he is able to spontaneously fulfill the requirements of the law of God. However, if a man wants to keep the ordinances of the law merely because of the requirements of the law, his efforts will be in vain.</p>
<p>The Old Testament saints who wrote the Psalms were godly men who lived in God&rsquo;s presence. As such, they touched God and God&rsquo;s being and, therefore, spontaneously lived according to the law. It was easy for them to keep the law because they touched the reality, the substance, of the law, which is God Himself. Others, however, did not live in God&rsquo;s presence, and, in New Testament terminology, they were not in fellowship with God. They tried instead to keep the law by their own effort. Since God gave them commandments and requirements, they felt that they could fulfill them. They accepted God&rsquo;s requirements and tried to keep them as laws, but they could not. On the contrary, they broke every law. If anyone tries to keep the law as a set of regulations apart from God, his efforts will be to no avail. If a person has seen that the law is a testimony of God and that the reality of the law is God Himself and if he contacts God often, touching God Himself and living before God, it will result in an ability to fulfill the requirements of the law. This applies especially to those who are in the New Testament age. Although we are not under the law, if we live in God, we will spontaneously fulfill the requirements of the law, because the law is a testimony of God, and the reality, the substance, of the law is God Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE ENTIRE BIBLE<br />
BEING THE TESTIMONY OF GOD</h2>
<p>Just as the law is the word of God, the entire Bible is the word of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. As the Testimony of Christ,<br />
the Bible also Being the Testimony of God</h2>
<p>In John 5:39 the Lord said that the Scriptures testify concerning Him. Since the Scriptures are a testimony of Christ, they are also a testimony of God. If we really touch the spiritual meaning in the Bible when we read it, we cannot help but see Christ. Furthermore, once we see Christ, we cannot help but see God, because the entire Bible is a testimony of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. As the Word of God, the Bible Revealing What God Is and Therefore Being the Testimony of God</h2>
<p>All Scripture is a testimony of God because all Scripture is the word of God, revealing the kind of God He is. Just as the law reveals God, the Scriptures fully reveal God. Therefore, the Scriptures are the real and full testimony of God. The reality, the substance, of the Scriptures is God Himself, just as it is with the law.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. One Needing to Touch God to Be Able<br />
to Touch the Reality of the Scriptures;<br />
Otherwise, the Scriptures Being<br />
Dead Letters or Vain Doctrines</h2>
<p>When a person comes to read the Bible, he needs to contact God to be able to touch the reality and the substance of the Bible. If he reads the Bible apart from God, the Bible will be either dead letters or vain doctrines to him. This is really true. If we do not read the Bible while touching God and being in God, the Bible will be merely dead letters or vain doctrines.</p>
<p>I talked to someone concerning the Gospel of John and told him that this book is too mysterious, that it speaks of the word of life, the Word that was from the beginning. He said to me, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, why do I not get anything meaningful out of the Gospel of John when I read it? When I read it, all I see are words like <em>us, you,</em> and <em>them.</em> When I read further, all I see are many phrases like <em>in Me, in You,</em> and <em>in Him,</em> and their plural forms like <em>in Us, in You,</em> and <em>in them.</em> What is so mysterious about these simple words?&rdquo; O brothers and sisters, the mystery is precisely in these simple words and phrases. The mystery lies in the various pronouns and also in the word <em>in.</em> When a person reads John 17 without touching God, he will find words such as &ldquo;You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us&rdquo; and &ldquo;I in them, and You in Me&rdquo; (vv. 21, 23). Thus, he may feel that these words are too shallow. But if he touches God, he will see the mystery. The Father is in His Son, and His Son is in us. Not only so, we are also in His Son, and the Son is also in the Father. These words tell us that God and man are completely united and have become one; therefore, they reveal the mystery in the universe.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, we need to touch God, meet God, and live in God; only then can we touch the reality and the substance of the Bible. Otherwise, we will feel that the Bible is tasteless, having only dead letters or vain doctrines. We have often said that some read the Bible and find only dead teachings, such as being humble, patient, meek, and peaceful. But can we really be humble? Can we be patient? Is it possible for us to be meek or peaceful? The more we try to be humble, the prouder we become; the more we try to be patient, the quicker we are provoked; the more we try to be peaceful, the more contentious we become; the more we try to be meek, the hotter is our temper. As a result, we see that such teachings are simply dead letters and vain doctrines which are completely useless. But when we contact God in the Scriptures, the reality of humility will be worked into us and the power of being meek will operate in us. We do not need to decide to be humble, nor do we need to determine to be meek. The reality of humility which causes us to be spontaneously humble is within us; the power which enables us to be spontaneously meek is within us. The Scriptures are living and real because God Himself is the reality of the Scriptures; the Scriptures testify of God. Those who have not touched God can touch only the letter in the Scriptures. At the most they can touch only the doctrines in the Scriptures, but they cannot meet the God of reality, concerning whom the Scriptures testify. We must see that the Bible does not consist of doctrines. Rather, the Bible is a testimony; it is the testimony of God, and God Himself is the reality of the Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">V. CHRIST BEING THE TESTIMONY OF GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. As the Living Word of God,<br />
Christ Revealing God and<br />
Being the Testimony of God in Reality</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:5 and 3:14 show us that Christ is the testimony, that is, the testimony of God. Christ is the testimony of God because He is the Word of the living God. Whereas the Bible is the written word of God, Christ is the living word of God. John 1:1 says that in the beginning was the Word and that the Word was God. One day the Word became flesh and tabernacled among men so that men were able to behold the glory of God. This Word is Christ, who is the declaration of God, the expression of God. Therefore, Christ is the testimony of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Man Not Being Able<br />
to Know God outside of Christ;<br />
Man Being Able to Touch God<br />
Only through Christ</h2>
<p>We have already spoken in the previous chapter concerning how Christ expresses God. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. When Christ lived on the earth, He lived out God. Hence, Christ is the living testimony of God. Apart from Christ, man can neither know God nor find God. God is in Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of God, the testimony of God.</p>
<p>John 14:6-11 shows us this matter. Philip said to the Lord Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us.&rdquo; The Lord was surprised and said to Philip, &ldquo;Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father&rdquo; (vv. 8-9). In other words, the Lord was saying, &ldquo;When I live before you, God is living before you; I am the living out of God.&rdquo; In verse 6 He said, &ldquo;No one comes to the Father except through Me.&rdquo; It is difficult to translate this sentence. This could be translated as, &ldquo;No one can reach the Father except through Me.&rdquo; This means that no one can contact God or touch God except through Him. In order for man to contact God, to touch God, and to reach God, he needs to do it through Christ and in Christ, because Christ is the embodiment of God, the testimony of God expressed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
BEING THE TESTIMONY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit is also the testimony of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Holy Spirit,<br />
as the Transfiguration of Christ<br />
through His Death, Resurrection,<br />
Ascension, and Descension,<br />
Declaring All the Things of Christ to Men<br />
and Glorifying Christ as the Testimony of Christ</h2>
<p>John 16:5-7 and 14:16-18 show us that after the Lord Jesus passed through death, resurrection, and ascension into the heavens, He would descend as the Spirit. Just as He is the incarnation of God, the Spirit is the transfiguration of Christ. God is in Christ, and Christ is in the Spirit. After His ascension, He came as the Spirit with all His elements. These elements include all that He is, all that He has, all that He has accomplished, and all that He has experienced; all of these elements are in the Spirit. Therefore, John 16:13-15 tells us that when the Spirit comes, He will declare Christ to us and glorify Christ. Furthermore, John 15:26 also says that when the Spirit comes, He will testify concerning Christ.</p>
<p>Let me give an illustration, even though it is not completely adequate. Sulfur is often present in the waters of a hot spring. The water is like the Spirit, and the sulfur in the water is like Christ in the Spirit. Before the sulfur was present in the water, there was no element of sulfur in it. But when sulfur is added to the spring water, the water has an element of sulfur in it. Thus, wherever the water flows, sulfur also flows. In like manner, the Spirit now contains all the elements of Christ. The various elements of Christ&mdash;all that He is, all that He has, all that He has accomplished, and all that He has experienced&mdash;are contained in the Spirit. For example, because He is God, He has the element of divinity; because He became a man, He has the element of humanity; because He passed through incarnation, He has the element of incarnation; and because He passed through death, He has the element of death; He resurrected and thus has the element of resurrection; He ascended and was exalted, so He also has the elements of ascension and exaltation. All of His elements are in the Spirit. When the Spirit with all these elements comes into us, the element of God comes, the element of uplifted humanity comes, and the elements of incarnation, death, resurrection, ascension, and exaltation all come into us. Therefore, we are united with God, and we have died, resurrected, ascended, and been exalted with Christ. This is similar to drinking a glass of grape juice. When we drink the juice, all of the elements of the juice come into us. It contains the element of grapes, the element of sugar, and various other elements. Once the juice comes into us, all of the elements in the juice come into us. In like manner, because the Spirit has all the elements of Christ, when the Spirit comes into us, He brings all the elements of Christ into us and testifies concerning Christ within us, letting us know the kind of person Christ is. When the Spirit comes into us and touches us within, we &ldquo;taste&rdquo; Christ. If there is sugar in water, we will taste the sweetness of sugar when our tongue touches the sugar in the water. In like manner, when the Spirit enters into us and touches us within, we feel glorious, holy, bright, and transcendent. What are these elements? They are Christ, because Christ is glorious, holy, bright, and transcendent. People may ask us, &ldquo;What kind of person is Christ?&rdquo; We can say, &ldquo;Although I cannot explain, I have tasted Him within me.&rdquo; People may ask, &ldquo;Where is Christ?&rdquo; We can say, &ldquo;Although I cannot show you, there is a taste within me. I have definitely touched Christ. But I do not need to go to heaven to touch Him; He came down from heaven and He touched me within in the Spirit.&rdquo; The Spirit, as Christ&rsquo;s transfiguration, reveals Him within us. Therefore, as the testimony of Christ, the Spirit glorifies Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Apart from the Holy Spirit,<br />
Man Being Unable to Know Christ;<br />
Man Needing to Be in the Holy Spirit to<br />
Be Able to Touch Christ</h2>
<p>Apart from the Holy Spirit, there is no way for man to know Christ. Man must be in the Holy Spirit to be able to touch Christ. First Corinthians 12:3 says, &ldquo;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Those of us who are saved truly have this experience. Often when we touch the Holy Spirit within through fellowship or prayer, we spontaneously say, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord! Jesus is the Lord of all!&rdquo; When we say this, we feel glorious, bright, sweet, and peaceful. This indicates that we have touched Christ in the Holy Spirit. Once we are in the Holy Spirit, we touch Christ, because the Holy Spirit is the transfiguration of Christ and the testimony of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. THE CHURCH<br />
BEING THE TESTIMONY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Christ is the testimony of God, and the Holy Spirit is the testimony of Christ. When the Holy Spirit brought Christ into the believers and constituted them as the church, the church became the testimony of Jesus. This is referred to in John 15:26-27; Acts 1:8; and Revelation 1:9; 2:13; 12:17; and 19:10. Before His death and after His resurrection, the Lord Jesus told the disciples that the Holy Spirit would come upon them and that they would be His witnesses. Since the Holy Spirit has wrought Christ into us, we should live out and express the Lord. This is to testify of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Church Being<br />
the Body of Christ,<br />
the Embodiment of Christ,<br />
and Therefore the Testimony of Christ</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 12:12 and Ephesians 4:12-13 show us that the church is the Body of Christ, the embodiment of Christ. Therefore, the church is the testimony of Christ. Nothing expresses a person and testifies of the person more than his body. Our body is our most expressive aspect of our being to other people. Similarly, the church, the Body of Christ, expresses and testifies of Christ the most. Without the church, the Body of Christ, no one can know Christ. Christ is a mystery; He is abstract. But with the church, He is no longer abstract; He is very real. Instead of being a mystery, He has an expression. The church is the testimony of Christ. This is very clear in the books of 1 Corinthians and Ephesians. If the condition of the church is right, when a person touches the church, he touches Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Church Testifying concerning Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head3">(1) As the One Who Contains<br />
All the Fullness of the Godhead and<br />
Is United with Man&mdash;John 1:1, 14; 1 John 4:2</h2>

<h2 class="head3">(3) As the One<br />

Overcome the World&mdash;John 17:14, 16</h2>
<h2 class="head3">(6) As the One Who Is<br />
Not Defiled by Idolatry&mdash;Matthew 4:9-10</h2>
<h2 class="head3">(7) As the One Who Has<br />
No Part in Satan&rsquo;s Kingdom&mdash;John 18:36</h2>
<h2 class="head3">(8) As the One<br />
Who Has Overcome Everything and<br />
Thereby Completely Expresses and Glorifies God&mdash;<br />
John 12:28; 17:1, 4</h2>
<p>The church testifies concerning Christ. Simply speaking, there are two important aspects of Christ. First, there is the aspect in relation to God. As the embodiment of God, Christ is absolutely related to God. Second, there is the aspect in relation to Satan. As the One who destroyed Satan, Christ is absolutely not related to Satan. Not long after he was created, the first Adam was corrupted by Satan; he was alienated from God on the one hand and united with Satan on the other hand. Due to the union of Satan with the first Adam, Satan brought in sin, death, the world, idols, and the authority of Satan, which is Satan&rsquo;s kingdom. These five items along with Satan himself constitute a total of six items. When the first Adam was cut off from God and united with Satan, he also was united with the items that belong to Satan. In the first Adam there was Satan, sin, death, the world, idols, and the authority of Satan, which is Satan&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>When Satan entered in Genesis 3, sin also entered. In chapter 4, death entered, and the world also entered. In chapter 5, death entered in a full way, and in chapter 6, the world was completely corrupted. Then in chapter 11, idols came in at Babel, as did the authority of Satan, Satan&rsquo;s kingdom. At that time, mankind was filled with Satan and the things of Satan; God and the things of God had no place within fallen human beings. Fallen man was separated from God and completely united with Satan.</p>
<p>When the Lord came to the earth, His situation was exactly the opposite. On the one hand, He was completely united with God. God was in Him, and He also brought God into man, causing God to be united with man. On the other hand, He was completely separated from Satan, and Satan had nothing in Him. Satan had no ground in Him at all. Concerning sin, He knew no sin and even was without sin. He was One who set Himself far apart from sin. Concerning death, He overcame death and could not be held by death. He did not have even the precursor of death, that is, weakness. He had no weakness of the body, nor weakness of the mind, nor weakness of the spirit. This is because in Him there was no death or even the shadow of death. He was One who transcended death. He is the resurrection and the life. Wherever He is, there is resurrection; wherever He is, there is life. Death had no ground in Him at all. He also did not have the world. The world could not defile Him, much less usurp Him. The world had no ground in Him; He was completely transcendent over the world. He was in the world but not of the world; He was in the world but not defiled by the world. Moreover, He did not have idols. Satan even placed the kingdoms of the world and their glory before Him, trying to entice Him to worship him, but He refused. Idols had no ground in Him at all. He also was not defiled by Satan&rsquo;s authority and had no part in Satan&rsquo;s kingdom. He was completely separated from the things of Satan. None of these things could be found in Him. Then through death and resurrection He brought man into God. He entered into glory, and He manifested God, completely expressing God. He was such a One.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Testimony of the Church<br />
Being to Live Out What Christ Is</h2>
<p>When the Holy Spirit wrought such a Christ into the church, the church lived out Christ. The church testifies that Christ is altogether the mingling of God and man. God is in man, and man lives in God. God is mingled with man, and man is also mingled with God. Sin, death, the world, idols, Satan&rsquo;s authority, his kingdom, and his own self, have no place in the church. This is the proper condition of the church. This was the situation of the early church in Acts chapters 2 through 4. The church was filled with God&rsquo;s presence; within it there was nothing of Satan, sin, death, the world, idols, or the authority and kingdom of Satan. Satan and everything of Satan had no place in the church. The early church was a complete and full testimony of Christ, manifesting Christ before the people and completely living out Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Church Carrying Out the Testimony<br />
by and with the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>John 15:26-27 shows us that the church carries out the testimony concerning Christ by and with the Holy Spirit. Human beings do not have this power. Only when the church gives ground to the Spirit, depends on the Spirit, follows the Spirit, and obeys the ruling of the Spirit can the Spirit testify concerning Christ in the church. Then by the Spirit, the church can also testify concerning Christ to the world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Testimony of the Church<br />
Being One and Corporate,<br />
Not Numerous and Scattered,<br />
Because It Is the Testimony of the Body</h2>
<p>The testimony of the church concerning Christ is one and corporate. Although there are millions of saints, their testimony is one. It is not that saved ones testify concerning Christ individually in a scattered manner; rather, all the saved ones are constituted into one Body and bear the testimony corporately. Therefore, their testimony is not divided but united; it is not many and scattered but one and corporate. At the time of Pentecost, even though three thousand and later five thousand were added to the church, they were still one. They moved and lived together as one. Their testimony was the testimony of the one Body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Through the Testimony of the Church, His Body,<br />
Christ Being Expressed before Men,<br />
Living before Men, and Testifying to Men concerning the Person of Christ</h2>
<p>Through the testimony of the church, His Body, Christ is expressed before men, lives before men, and testifies to men concerning Himself. John 13:35 and 17:21 and 23 show that it is easy for men to recognize Christ and to see the kind of person He is when the church testifies of Him, that is, when the church is completely one with Christ and when all the saints are completely one in Him. However, today men see contentions, jealousy, criticisms, and judging in the church instead of Christ because the church has lost its testimony and the presence of Christ. But whenever and wherever a group of Christians live in the Lord and are one with the Lord, having been delivered from individualism and living in the Body of Christ, loving one another and being one with one another, the presence of the Holy Spirit, the presence of Christ, and the presence of God will surely be among them. When we come into the midst of such ones and contact them, we would surely say, &ldquo;Christ is here! God is here!&rdquo; This is what it means to be a living testimony of Christ, an expression of Christ. This is the church&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us! If these were merely doctrines, then we would be too pitiful. If the Lord grants us His visitation, we will see that in the last days of this age among the Lord&rsquo;s children, the Lord&rsquo;s desire is to recover the church as a living testimony, as a testimony for the expression of Christ and of God, and as a testimony of the complete union of God with man. Not only are believers united to be one, but even more they are united with the Triune God to be one. If the church has such a oneness, people will be able to see Christ in the church. The church in such a condition is the expression of Christ, the testimony of Christ.</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, only when we are united with the Lord can we be united with the believers. If we are not living in the Lord and do not let the Lord live in us, then we have no way to be one. If we live in the Lord and let the Lord live in us, then we will all be united into one. When we all live in the Lord, we do not even need to be united, we are already one. When we live in the Lord, there will be a situation of oneness among us; this oneness is Christ and it is also God. Such a oneness is the expression of Christ, which is the testimony of Christ. This is the testimony of the church. May we again hear the Lord&rsquo;s speaking: &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem...and unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; (Acts 1:8); &ldquo;when the Comforter [that is, the Spirit] comes,...He will testify concerning Me; and you testify also&rdquo; (John 15:26-27).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRODUCTION, EXISTENCE, RELATIONSHIP,<br />
AND ISSUE OF THE TESTIMONY<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>The production, existence, relationship, and issue of the testimony of the church are shown in Matthew 16:13 through 17:8. The church is clearly spoken of in the Bible beginning in Matthew 16. Although many persons typify the church in the Old Testament, there was no mention of the church in plain words. The church was hidden in the Old Testament. It was not until the Lord Jesus came in the flesh and worked on earth for nearly three years that He revealed the church in plain words.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE PRODUCTION OF<br />
THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHURCH&mdash;<br />
BY KNOWING CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. As the Christ of God&mdash;<br />
the Anointed One of God</h2>
<p>In the region of Caesarea Philippi, the Lord asked His disciples, &ldquo;Who do men say that the Son of Man is?&rdquo; (Matt. 16:13). They answered that people spoke differently concerning Him, some saying that He was this person and others saying that He was that person. Then the Lord asked, &ldquo;But you, who do you say that I am?&rdquo; (v. 15). Peter, who was the disciple who usually rushed to speak, answered and said, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (v. 16). Although Peter often was the first to speak, he did not speak from himself this time; rather, God gave him a revelation which enabled him to see things incomprehensible to men. Because he received a revelation from the heavens, he said, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&rdquo; These words were tremendous! From the dawn of history many spiritual forefathers and prophets have spoken for God, yet none of them ever spoke such words. Peter&rsquo;s words were extraordinary and completely inconceivable to man. We cannot find such words in the entire Old Testament.</p>
<p>These two statements that Peter uttered are so extraordinary because they reveal the person and the work of the Lord Jesus. <em>Christ,</em> which is the title of the office of the Lord Jesus, declares His work in the universe. The Greek word for <em>Christ</em> means &ldquo;the anointed One.&rdquo; The Anointed of God is the One commissioned by God to do His work, the One sent by God to accomplish His will. Therefore, the title <em>Christ</em> speaks of all of the Lord&rsquo;s work in the universe.</p>
<p>What is the Lord&rsquo;s work in the universe? When we read through the entire Bible, we can see, without exception, that every item of God&rsquo;s work in the universe is committed to Christ and accomplished through Christ. Creation was accomplished by God in Christ; all things were created by God through Christ. Redemption was accomplished by Christ under God&rsquo;s commission; salvation is also carried out by Christ according to God&rsquo;s desire. Rather than carrying out the future judgment Himself or appointing an angel or archangel to carry it out, God has fully committed this to Christ. It is also God&rsquo;s desire that Christ would inherit all things in the future. In the past Christ was the Creator of all things. Presently He is the Upholder of all things. All things exist today because of Christ&rsquo;s upholding and bearing; all things cohere in Christ (Col. 1:17). In the future He will be the Heir, inheriting all things. All that God wants to do in the universe has been committed to Christ. Therefore, the statement &ldquo;You are the Christ&rdquo; means that &ldquo;You are the One anointed by God to do all the work God intends to do.&rdquo; The title <em>Christ</em> is very inclusive; it includes all the work of the Lord in the universe, and it speaks of the fact that the Lord is the One who accomplishes all the work of God in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. As the Son of the Living God&mdash;<br />
the One Who Expresses God</h2>
<p>In addition to saying, &ldquo;You are the Christ,&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;You are the Son of the living God.&rdquo; This statement refers to the person of the Lord. No doubt, the Lord was the anointed One of God, but who was He as the One anointed by God? No doubt, He was the One commissioned by God to carry out God&rsquo;s work, but who was He as the One commissioned by God? For example, we may appoint someone to be in charge of our bookroom, but what kind of person have we appointed? Is he a noble or a lowly person? This relates to his status. Thus, who was the Lord Jesus whom God anointed to accomplish all of His work? He is &ldquo;the Son of the living God.&rdquo; As the Son of God, He became the anointed One of God. As the Son of God, He received a commission from God to fulfill His will and carry out His work in the universe. Peter&rsquo;s two statements reveal two aspects concerning the Lord Jesus. One aspect concerns His work, and the other aspect concerns His person; one aspect shows what He does, and the other aspect shows who He is.</p>
<p>We should know the meaning of <em>the Son of God.</em> The Son of God is the One who expresses God. As the Son of God, the Lord expresses God. All the fullness of the Godhead was concealed in Him and expressed through Him. Apart from Him no one can touch God, and apart from Him no one can see God. God is in Him, and He is the expression of God. The One who is the expression of God is the One who was anointed and commissioned by God to accomplish His work.</p>
<p>Since He, as the Son of God who expresses God, was anointed by God to do His work in the universe, then everything He did surely expressed God and testified of God. In addition, the result of His work also expressed and testified of God. Therefore, when He was resurrected from the dead and dispensed His life into thousands and thousands of people, these multitudes of people became sons of God to express God. These sons of God became a corporate Body, which is the church as the corporate expression of God.</p>
<p>The meaning of the words spoken by Peter at this time is extremely deep and broad. On the surface they seem simple, but it takes the entire Bible to explain them. Before the birth of the Lord Jesus, an angel told Mary, &ldquo;The holy thing which is born will be called the Son of God&rdquo; (Luke 1:35). After the Lord was born, the angel told the shepherds, &ldquo;Today a Savior has been born to you...who is Christ the Lord&rdquo; (2:11). In the course of the birth of the Lord Jesus, these two names were revealed from the mouth of an angel. When the apostle John wrote concerning the things that occurred in the life of the Lord Jesus, he said, &ldquo;These have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God&rdquo; (John 20:31). These two titles, <em>Christ</em> and <em>the Son of God,</em> are the central meaning of the entire Bible. On the one hand, they speak of the Lord&rsquo;s work, and on the other hand, they speak of the Lord&rsquo;s person. He is the Son of God, the One who expressed God and who came to do the work of God. In all of the work that He accomplished there was a crystallized product, a central issue, an ultimate goal&mdash;the production of a group of sons for God who would become His Son&rsquo;s corporate Body, which is the church, so that He would have an enlarged expression, a full expression.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Peter spoke to the Lord in this way, the Lord immediately said to him, &ldquo;You are Peter,&rdquo; because <em>Peter</em> means &ldquo;a stone&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). The Lord was indicating that knowing Him was related to Peter&rsquo;s being a stone. In the beginning Adam was made out of clay. Every one of Adam&rsquo;s descendants is a piece of clay. As a descendant of Adam, Peter was a piece of clay, not a stone. But by knowing Christ in this way and by believing in Christ, he received the life of the Son of God. He received another element into him which caused him to be transformed. Whereas he was formerly a piece of clay, now he was transformed into a stone.</p>
<p>It is an amazing fact in the Bible that all of God&rsquo;s buildings, whether the holy temple, the holy city, or ultimately the New Jerusalem, are built with stones, not with bricks. In contrast, those who were against God, whether at Babel, Egypt, or elsewhere, always built with bricks, never with stones. Bricks are the result of human labor and earthen materials. According to the spiritual meaning in the Bible, bricks signify anything produced from man&rsquo;s natural being and with man&rsquo;s labor. This is the story of the tower of Babel, the two cities of Egypt, and the city of Babylon. Stones, however, signify things that have not been produced from human labor with human hands but from God&rsquo;s labor with God&rsquo;s hands. To this day, bricks are man-made, made by human labor; they are produced with natural materials plus human labor. Stones, however, are altogether made by God without the addition of any human labor. Before we were saved, we were all made from clay. We were earthy, and we were pieces of clay. Some may ask where this is spoken of in the Bible. There is a very clear biblical basis for this in Genesis 2:7, Romans 9:21, and 1 Corinthians 15:47. When we received the Lord, knowing Him as the Christ and the Son of God, we were redeemed and received His life. Another element was added into us, and we were transformed from a piece of clay into a piece of stone. Every saved person should hear the Lord speaking to him in his spirit, &ldquo;You are Peter; you are a stone. Previously you were Simon; now you are Peter. Formerly you were a piece of clay; now you are a stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to 1 Peter 2:5, these stones are living stones, because they have the life of God. Once there are living stones, the Lord can build the church. Therefore, the Lord immediately said, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). What is this rock? It is the Christ, the Son of the living God. Do you know the Christ? Do you know the Son of the living God? He is the rock. If you know Him, then you will be changed from a piece of clay into a stone. He is a huge rock, and we are small stones. You and I, as small stones transformed from clay, are the materials for Christ to build the church upon Himself as the large rock. Therefore, we must see how the church is produced. The church is produced through knowing Christ. The more we know Christ, the more the church is produced. Furthermore, when the church is produced, the testimony of the church is also produced. Therefore, the testimony of the church is also produced by knowing Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE EXISTENCE OF<br />
THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Living in Christ&mdash;Being Joined to Christ</h2>
<p>How does the church exist after being produced? Please note the words of the Lord: &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; The church being built upon this rock means that the church exists upon this rock. The church collapses as soon as it leaves this rock. Without a foundation, there is no way for a structure to exist. The producing of the church is out of Christ, and the existence of the church depends on Christ. Therefore, the testimony of the church is also completely dependent on Christ. To be dependent on Christ means to be joined to Christ, to hold Christ, and to live in Christ (Eph. 4:15; Col. 2:19). If the brothers and sisters daily are joined to Christ, hold Christ, and grow up into Christ in all things, the testimony of the church surely will be very strong. If the brothers and sisters are not living in Christ, not joined to Christ, and not holding Christ, the testimony of the church will be very weak. It will be like a lamp whose light is dying and is not brightly shining. Therefore, the existence of the testimony of the church depends completely upon the church being joined to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Receiving the Cross&mdash;Terminating the Self</h2>
<p>The existence of the testimony of the church also depends on receiving the cross, that is, on denying the self and taking up the cross, as spoken of in Matthew 16:24. To be joined to Christ is to allow the content of Christ to be expressed. Receiving the cross means that we allow the old creation, our self, to be terminated. Whether or not the testimony of a local church is strong depends on two points. First, are the brothers and sisters joined to Christ? Are they in Christ, do they live in Christ, and do they grow up into Christ in everything in their daily life? Second, are the brothers and sisters willing to let the cross do a work of terminating the desires of the flesh, their old creation, and their self? Do they have the mark of the cross upon them? Do they bear the cross daily? These two points determine whether the testimony of the church is strong or weak, bright or dim. Therefore, we must not merely pay attention to the truth concerning the testimony of the church. We must see that the existence of the testimony of the church in a locality altogether depends upon the believers&rsquo; being joined to Christ and receiving the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE RELATIONSHIP OF<br />
THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Let us look at the relationship of the testimony of the church. This relationship has many aspects.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. In Relation to Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Christ Being the Foundation as the Rock</h2>
<p>The first aspect of the testimony of the church is related to Christ. According to Matthew 16:18, the Lord will build the church upon Himself as the rock. Therefore, as the rock, He is the foundation of the church and also the base of the testimony of the church. Christ, the rock, is the foundation laid by God (1 Cor. 3:11), the One on whom people can believe (Rom. 9:33), and a &ldquo;living stone&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:4). He grows in those who believe into Him to be their everything so that they may be built up as the church. Therefore, He is not only the foundation of the life of the church; He is also the base of the living, the testimony, of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Church Being an Aggregate of Stones<br />
Built Together upon Christ</h2>
<p>While Christ is a rock, the church is an aggregate of stones built together upon Him. He is a living rock that grows in those who believe into Him and trust in Him. The church is an aggregate of living stones that grow up in Him and grow together because of Him. In this way they can be built together upon Him, being joined and knit together, to become a spiritual house, a dwelling place of God in spirit, which is the church (1 Pet. 2:5; Eph. 2:20-22; 4:16). This speaks not only of His relationship with the church in its life but also of His relationship with the church in its testimony.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. In Relation to the Gates of Hades</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord spoke of the gates of Hades immediately after saying, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; Whenever the heavens are mentioned, we are reminded of God, and whenever Hades is mentioned, we are reminded of the devil, Satan. The heavens are the dwelling place of God, whereas Hades is the realm of Satan. God&rsquo;s authority is in the heavens, and Satan&rsquo;s power is in Hades. Therefore, Hades refers to Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Gates of Hades Bringing<br />
the Church into Death and Holding It There</h2>
<p>When the Lord spoke of Hades, He mentioned the gates of Hades. What does this mean? The gates of Hades are for shutting and holding people in Hades. This can be compared to the gate of a prison. When a criminal is arrested and brought to the gate of the prison, an iron gate is opened to receive the criminal. When the gate is shut, it holds the criminal inside. Therefore, the gate of a prison receives a person into prison and then shuts him in and holds him in the prison. Similarly, the gates of Hades are for bringing the church into death and for shutting and holding the church in death.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Gates of Hades<br />
Being Plural, Indicating That<br />
Hades Affects the Church in Many Ways</h2>
<p><em>The gates of Hades</em> is plural. This means that Hades affects the church in many ways. Satan uses many different ways to bring the church into death. From the day the church came into being, the gates of Hades have been dealing with the church through various stratagems and in many ways. As soon as the Lord began to build the church on the day of Pentecost, the gates of Hades were shaken. These gates, however, began to actively try to drag the Lord&rsquo;s church into death, to shut it in death, and to hold it in death.</p>
<p>In the early stage of the church, the gates of Hades utilized the Jewish religion, the Roman Empire, and Greek culture, uniting these three great powers to affect the church. When the Lord Jesus was crucified, the sign put on the cross was written in three languages&mdash;Hebrew, Latin, and Greek (John 19:20). The presence of these three languages signifies that the Lord Jesus was crucified by the Jews, the Romans, and the Greeks. Moreover, after the Lord Jesus began to build the church, these three groups&mdash;the Jews, the Romans, and the Greeks&mdash;joined together to deal with the church. Do you know who opposed the church in the early days? It was the high priest of the Jewish religion. Who put the apostles into prison? It was the rulers of the Roman Empire. Those who read church history know how much the Roman Empire persecuted and ravaged the church. At the same time, Greek philosophy also caused a great disturbance to the church. The opposition from Jewish religion, the persecution of the Roman Empire, and the disturbance caused by Greek philosophy were all used by the gates of Hades to deal with the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. It Not Being Possible for the Church,<br />
Which Is in Resurrection<br />
and Which Overcomes Death,<br />
to Be Prevailed Against or Dealt With<br />
by the Gates of Hades</h2>
<p>However, the Lord said that the gates of Hades would not prevail against the church. The church is something in resurrection. People may try to hold the church in death, but the church will come out of death. The church is in resurrection and can overcome death. It is not possible for the church to be held, detained, by death. After the Lord Jesus was put in the tomb, people thought they had accomplished their job, yet He came out of the tomb in three days. It is the same with the church. Throughout the generations people have tried to put the church in death and hold it there, and seemingly some succeeded. But little did they know that the church would rise up again after a little while.</p>
<p>Hades does not have only one gate; it has many different kinds of gates. When Satan was not able to defeat the church through the persecution of the Roman Empire, he changed his tactics to welcome the church. This is the reason that the Roman Empire accepted Christianity as its state religion in the fourth century. This was a gate of Hades. Nevertheless, even though it seemed that the gate of Hades dragged the church into death, history tells us that after a period of time the church emerged from death, according to its true nature.</p>
<p>The things spoken of above are great matters. Now I would like to speak of some small matters. I believe that Hades has small gates as well as big gates. Hades utilizes not only big things but also small things to deal with us. It uses small things such as our family, our career, and our physical body to deal with us. When a person rises up for the testimony of the church, dealings immediately come to him from every direction. A while ago some brothers talked with me concerning the matter of serving the Lord full time. Some asked if it would be best to serve the Lord full time, and others asked if it would be preferable to serve the Lord while holding a job. My feeling was that regardless of the way that was taken, the gates of Hades would be waiting. If we serve without holding a job, the gates of Hades are waiting; if we serve while holding a job, the gates are also waiting. It is the same with marriage. Some say it is best not to be married. We need to be careful, however, because a few gates have been prepared to deal with the unmarried. Some say it is best to be married and have a family. We need to be careful as well with this because a number of gates have also been prepared to deal with the married. One gate is called the wife gate; another is called the son gate. Still another is called the daughter gate. These are all gates of Hades. Those with experience know what I am speaking of. Dear brothers and sisters, if we do not have the power of resurrection within us, the gates of Hades will press us until we have no way out. When we serve without a job, we may think that it is better to have a job. Yet it is possible to be held even more by a job. Before some were married, they thought that everything would be fine once they were married; they thought that they would be able to serve the Lord with peace of mind and have a good family to bear a good testimony for the Lord. After they were married, however, they sensed that there are more gates of Hades. While there may be only one gate holding us prior to marriage, there may be three or four gates trying to hold us after we are married. When we served the Lord alone, we felt lonely and hoped that the Lord would give us one or two co-workers for coordination. We thought that this would be wonderful. However, after being with a co-worker or a companion for a long period of time, we may run to our room, sighing and saying, &ldquo;I wish I had no co-workers. I wish I could be alone.&rdquo; Oh, dear brothers and sisters, there is no place without a gate of Hades, and there is nothing that is not a gate of Hades. Any place and anything can hold us in death. The question is not where we are outwardly but whether we are living inwardly. If our inner nature is resurrection, nothing can imprison us. Even if it seems that we are being imprisoned, we can rise up again. The church cannot be held by the gates of Hades.</p>
<p>Many people think that it would be wonderful for someone who serves the Lord to have a spiritual wife. But I can tell you that very often a wife can turn out to be a gate of Hades. John Wesley, a well-known figure in church history, was truly a powerful man. Two centuries ago he not only brought a revival to the churches in England but also a great turn to the English society. However, he had a very unreasonable wife who was a gate of Hades to him, a gate which always tried to hold him down. Sometimes she would even humiliate him publicly while he was preaching. Without the resurrection life, John Wesley would have been imprisoned in Hades in no time by his wife.</p>
<p>Satan tries his best to destroy the testimony of the church, to damage the testimony borne by the church for Christ. But praise the Lord, even though the church may have a dark age, may enter the tomb, and may seem to be shut in by the gates of Hades, after a while the church will come out again in resurrection. The church, built with living stones, has the resurrection power, the resurrection life, and the resurrection nature, which cannot be overcome by the gates of Hades. It may seem as if the church has fought many losing battles throughout the centuries, but the church is still here. Even though the church appears to be finished, the church is still here when everything else is finished. We may be defeated, but the gates of Hades cannot prevail against the church. We may be in desolation, but the church is still here.</p>
<p>Why is it impossible for the gates of Hades to prevail against the church? Why are the gates of Hades unable to successfully hold down the church? This is because the church is built upon a living rock, which is Christ, who is the Son of the living God, the Lord of resurrection, and the almighty Lord. The church built upon Christ can never be defeated by the gates of Hades. Therefore, the testimony of the church can never be destroyed by the gates of Hades.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Church Being Able<br />
to Overcome the Gates of Hades,<br />
Thus Releasing the Sinners Held by Them</h2>
<p>Since the church is built upon the resurrected and victorious Christ, it cannot be defeated by the gates of Hades. Instead, it is able to overcome the gates of Hades and release sinners held by them. For two thousand years, countless sinners who have been held by the gates of Hades have been released by the church. This is what the church does in preaching the gospel. Preaching the gospel frees sinners who have been captured by Hades and liberates the souls who are oppressed by Satan (Luke 4:18). This plunders the goods of Satan (Matt. 12:29). The church is able to do this because it is joined to the Christ who overcame Hades and Satan and because it bears the testimony of Christ&rsquo;s victory. It is impossible for the testimony of the church to be destroyed by the gates of Hades; the testimony of the church will always deal with and overcome the gates of Hades.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. In Relation to the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2>
<p>The testimony of the church is related not only to the gates of Hades but even more to the keys of the kingdom of the heavens. In Matthew 16:18-19, after the Lord said, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it,&rdquo; He went on to say, &ldquo;I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; The keys were given to Peter, but they were given to him as one who knew Christ and had become a living stone. Therefore, the keys were given to all who have become living stones through knowing Christ. In principle, all such persons have received the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Church Being Able to Bring In<br />
the Reign of the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens is the ruling of the heavens. This is absolutely related to the testimony of the church. Wherever there is the testimony of the church, there is the ruling of the heavens. When a group of brothers and sisters are joined to Christ, live in Christ, and receive the cross to deal with themselves, they have the power of resurrection and the gates of Hades cannot prevail against them. Moreover, they also have the authority of the reign of the heavens. The kingdom of the heavens manifests its ruling through them. They can bring in the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens. On the one hand, the church affects the gates of Hades, and on the other hand, it is related to the kingdom of the heavens. On the one hand, the church cannot be held down by the gates of Hades; on the other hand, the church opens the door for the kingdom of the heavens to come in. The church really is a great matter. Whenever and wherever there is a group of people standing in the position of the church and manifesting the reality of the church, that is, the testimony of the church, the gates of Hades will be affected, and the kingdom of the heavens will be involved.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Church Being Able to Bring People<br />
into the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2>
<p>What is the meaning of the keys of the kingdom of the heavens? The keys and the gate are closely related. A gate is for shutting; a key is for opening. Do you want to enter the kingdom of the heavens? Here is a key that can open the gate to the kingdom of the heavens. The church cannot be shut out by the gates of Hades, but the church has a key that can open the gate of the kingdom of the heavens and bring people into the kingdom of the heavens. Both of these matters depend upon the church and are made possible through the testimony of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. In Relation to the Cross</h2>
<p>The testimony of the church is also absolutely related to the cross. Wherever the testimony of the church is, there believers will surely receive and bear the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Cross Delivering the Church<br />
from the Things of Man in the Old Creation</h2>
<p>Without the cross, the church will never have a testimony. If a local church is full of the things of the old creation, it is a church without the testimony. Conversely, if a local church is willing to receive the dealing of the cross and terminate all the things of the old creation, it will be a strong church with a testimony. Therefore, when the Lord spoke of the building of the church, He immediately revealed the cross, telling us to take up, to receive, the cross.</p>
<p>There is a sequence to the Lord&rsquo;s word. First, He passed through the cross and accomplished the work of the cross. Now the church receives the cross from Him and bears the cross He accomplished. The cross that the church takes up is the accomplished cross of Christ. On the cross Christ terminated all the things of man, the natural things, the things of the old creation. The cross of Christ has already terminated all of these things; now the church needs to receive the cross, acknowledge the cross, and take up the cross. We must acknowledge that we cannot avoid the cross, because we have already passed through the cross. Rather, we have received the cross and must bear the cross. We cannot allow our flesh, our old man, and our natural life to have any place. The work of the cross has been accomplished; now we need to acknowledge it, receive it, bear it, and put it upon us. If such a situation exists among us, there is the testimony of the church. If such a situation exists among us, the gates of Hades cannot do anything. If such a situation exists among us, the keys of the kingdom of the heavens will be effective. However, if the believers avoid the cross rather than bear it and if they set their mind on the things of men rather than on the things of God, there will be no testimony of the church. Then the gates of Hades will prevail, and the keys of the kingdom of the heavens will be ineffective. The testimony of the church depends upon the dealing of the cross.</p>
<p>Therefore, while we are serving God, we must ask ourselves some fundamental questions. Do we have the cross upon us? Are we those who bear the cross? Christ has already accomplished the cross, but have we received it? Have we put it upon us? Are we bearing it daily? Do we refuse to give any place to our flesh and our mind? If this is the case, the testimony of the church will be shining brightly, the gates of Hades will be helpless, and the keys of the kingdom of the heavens will be powerful.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Cross Enabling the Church<br />
to Live Out the Riches of Christ</h2>
<p>Once the cross is received, resurrection is manifested. All of the things related to resurrection are part of the elements of Christ, the riches of Christ. All of the riches of resurrection will be manifested in the church because of the cross. Today the main reason we are short of spiritual riches in our meetings and in our service is that we have not sufficiently received the cross. Many brothers and sisters know that they should receive the cross. Knowing this is one thing, but experiencing the cross by truly putting ourselves under it and bearing it is another thing. We should always remember that the testimony of the church depends upon our receiving the cross. Only the cross can enable the things of the old creation to be terminated so that we can live out the riches of the resurrection of Christ. Only the cross can cause the church to have a testimony.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE ISSUE OF THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Bringing In the Kingdom of Christ&mdash;<br />
the Reign of Christ</h2>
<p>The issue of the testimony of the church is to bring in the kingdom of Christ, the reign of Christ</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Christ Being Glorified&mdash;God Being Expressed</h2>
<p>The issue of the testimony of the church is also to glorify Christ and to express God. In Matthew 16, after speaking of the building, the kingdom of Christ is spoken of in verse 28. Furthermore, verse 27 of chapter 16 and the first section of chapter 17 refer to the Lord Jesus&rsquo; transfiguration on the mountain. This was a miniature of the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation in His kingdom in the glory of God. When the Lord manifests the glory of God in His kingdom, God will have a full expression. When the church receives the cross, overcoming the gates of Hades and opening the entrance to the kingdom of the heavens to testify concerning Christ, the result will be the bringing in of the kingdom of the heavens and the glorification of Christ. In other words, Christ will be able to reign and to manifest God&rsquo;s glory so that God will have a full expression in Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE IMPORTANCE OF<br />
THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
FOR THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH BEING RELATED<br />
TO THREE PAIRS OF THINGS</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s words in Matthew 16 seem to be very simple, yet several things are very important. The most important is the Lord&rsquo;s mention of the church. In speaking of the church, the Lord also brought up the building of the church. He said, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; His speaking is related to the building of the church that He desires. In order to have the church, that is, to have the building of the church, He spoke of several related matters: (1) the gates of Hades, (2) the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, (3) Satan, (4) the cross, (5) the will of men, and (6) the will of God. [The Chinese Union Version translates Matthew 16:23: &ldquo;You are mindful of the will of men and not mindful of the will of God.&rdquo;] When the Lord spoke of these six matters, they were presented as three opposite pairs. The gates of Hades and the keys of the kingdom of the heavens are the opposite of each other. Just as Hades is versus the kingdom of the heavens, the gates of Hades are versus the keys of the kingdom of the heavens. This is the first pair. In the next pair, Satan and the cross are also the opposite of each other. Wherever the cross is, Satan has no place. Satan hates the cross and is also afraid of the cross. On the one hand, he wanted to put the Lord to death on the cross; on the other hand, he now fears the cross. This is because he knows that the cross is the place where he was dealt with, where he was finished off. So Satan and the cross are also a pair. Lastly, the will of men and the will of God are versus each other. Therefore, the six things spoken of by the Lord form three pairs.</p>
<p>These three pairs are revealed along with the building of the church; hence, they are related to the building of the church. The matter of the keys of the kingdom of the heavens dealing with the gates of Hades depends on the building of the church. The matter of the cross dealing with Satan depends on the building of the church. The matter of the will of God prevailing over the will of men also depends on the building of the church. All of these related matters depend on the building of the church. If the building of the church is successful, the gates of Hades will be defeated, and the keys of the kingdom of the heavens will be victorious. If the building of the church is successful, the cross will gain its place, and Satan will lose his ground. If the building of the church is successful, the will of men will be nullified, and the will of God will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The universe today is a story of things in opposition to each other. There is not harmony but contradiction and conflict in the universe. The gates of Hades are in conflict with the keys of the kingdom of the heavens; Satan is in conflict with the cross; and the will of men is in conflict with the will of God. All of these matters are related to the building of the church; they all hinge on the church being built by the Lord. If our eyes are opened, we will see that the building of the church is an exceedingly great matter in the universe. The end of Hades and the spread of the kingdom of the heavens depend on the building of the church. Whether Satan can carry out his work, or whether the cross can accomplish its goal, whether the will of men can be renounced, or whether the will of God can be fulfilled all depend on the building of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH BEING A WARFARE</h2>
<p>The building of the church is a matter of warfare. It is a conflict between two kingdoms and two wills. On one side, there is Hades, which is the kingdom of Satan, and on the other side, there is the kingdom of the heavens, which is the kingdom of God. On one side, the will of men is ruling and reigning; on the other side, the will of God is gaining ground and being fulfilled. The battle between these two kingdoms and between these two wills is tied to the building of the church. The building of the church is altogether related to this warfare.</p>
<p>Regrettably, in the church today almost none of the believers know of this spiritual warfare; this is due to weakness in life, lack of spiritual strength, and insufficient clarity in the light of the truth. Many think that preaching the gospel is simply preaching the gospel, that ministering the word is simply ministering the word, and that edifying the believers is simply edifying the believers. But when we do these things, we are not simply doing a work; we also are engaging in a warfare. This is because the entire matter of the building of the church on earth is a warfare. Please read the record in the first few chapters of Acts. As soon as the Lord began to build the church on the day of Pentecost, warfare began. If we compare the words in Matthew 16:18-19 with the record in Acts chapters 2 through 4, we can see that the words in Matthew were fulfilled in Acts. In Acts the Lord built the church upon Himself as the rock. As the Son of God, He died, resurrected, ascended to the right hand of God, and was made Lord and Christ by God. Therefore, He is the trustworthy rock established by God. At Pentecost, through the Holy Spirit who was given to men, He transformed men of clay into living stones, and He built these stones upon Himself as the rock. Where is this One who is the rock? He is in the heavens. As the rock in the heavens, He is the foundation of the building of the church. He is building the church upon Himself as the foundation in the heavens. This building began from the day of Pentecost, and once the building began, Hades was shaken. In Acts chapters 2 through 4 we can see that Hades was shaken. The gates of Hades were opened. Hades, however, actively attacked the church in order to drag the church that was being built by Christ into death. But since the church had the keys of the kingdom of the heavens and thus had authority, it was able to bind what was bound in the heavens and loose what was loosed in the heavens. The church had authority, and the church fought and won the victory.</p>
<p>Today when people speak of preaching the gospel, they like to refer to the situation at the time of Pentecost. However, they do not see that on the day of Pentecost there was not only the preaching of the gospel but also the fighting of a spiritual warfare. There was a battle between the gates of Hades and the keys of the kingdom of the heavens. The cause of this battle was the building of the church. At the coming of Pentecost, living stones were produced, and they were built on the rock which is in the heavens. As soon as this building began, Hades started to attack the church. However, the church was full of the authority of the kingdom of the heavens, and it was able to overcome the attacks of Hades. It is a pity that this authority has been lost in the church today! The church is weak and pitiful in gospel preaching. Sometimes the church uses worldly methods, such as advertisements, promotions, and propaganda, and even uses material wealth, position, education, and other ways to entice people into receiving the gospel. In this way the church has become mean and base. This kind of situation proves that the church has fallen into the hand of the gates of Hades. Hence, when the church preaches the gospel, Hades is not moved. It seems as if there is no opposition from Satan and no spiritual battle in the church in such a pitiful condition. Since the church has lost her authority and her heavenly nature, she also has lost the power of her testimony.</p>
<p>However, if the condition of the church is proper, the gates of Hades will be shaken whenever the gospel is preached. Even if Hades will not open its gates, the church can shake it until the gates are opened. Whenever the church works for the Lord, the gates of Hades are shaken. This is an unalterable principle. From Acts 7 we see spiritual warfare wherever the footsteps of the preaching of the gospel reached. Wherever a church was raised up, the gates of Hades were shaken. In the entire record of the book of Acts, wherever a church was raised up, Satan was there to oppose, but he was also shaken.</p>
<p>Every child of God must see that the church is a matter involving two kingdoms. It involves Hades and the kingdom of the heavens, Satan and God, Satan and the cross, and the will of men and the will of God. The building of the church is a matter of warfare. The building of the church deals with and defeats Satan, Satan&rsquo;s kingdom, Hades, and the gates of Hades. The building of the church also brings in the kingdom of God and the authority of the kingdom of the heavens. This brings people under the rule of God and accomplishes the will of God.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy upon us! In these last days we cannot have merely empty talk concerning the ground of the church. The ground of the church depends on the testimony of the church. If the church loses her testimony, she loses her ground. Moreover, the testimony of the church depends on her being heavenly and living out Christ. Whenever the church loses her heavenly position and does not live out Christ, the church loses her testimony and authority, thereby falling into the hand of the gates of Hades.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING A GREAT MATTER</h2>
<p>The church is a great thing, and the building of the church is also a great and important matter. The entire New Testament concerns the church, the building of the church, and matters related to the building of the church. The entire New Testament is needed in order to explain the gates of Hades, Satan, and the will of men, and the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, the cross, and the will of God. We need to read through the New Testament to know what it means for the gates of Hades to deal with the church, to know what it means for Satan to hinder men from receiving the cross, and to know what it means for the will of men to be against the will of God. We need to read the New Testament thoroughly in order to understand the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, to know what it means to bring in the authority of the kingdom of the heavens, and to know what it means to place people under the rule of the kingdom of the heavens. We also need to read the New Testament thoroughly to know that there are three wills in the universe&mdash;the will of God, the will of men, and the will of Satan. When the will of men stands on Satan&rsquo;s side, there is no way for the will of God to be carried out. When the will of men stands on God&rsquo;s side, the will of Satan is defeated. These three things can be found in these few simple sentences in Matthew 16. The Lord said to Peter, &ldquo;Get behind Me, Satan!...for you are mindful of the will of men and not mindful of the will of God&rdquo; (Chinese Union Version). All three parties&mdash;Satan, men, and God&mdash;are here. The will of God, the will of men, and the trouble-making of Satan are present. The Lord spoke of these three matters because He had just spoken of the church and the building of the church, and the building of the church is related to these three matters. The building of the church determines whether men&rsquo;s will is standing with God&rsquo;s will or Satan&rsquo;s will, whether men&rsquo;s will is in subjection to God or in captivity to Satan. All of these points are manifested through the building of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING A SEVERE TEST</h2>
<p>O brothers, the church is a great test, and the building of the church is a strict standard of measure! Many children of God are full of zeal for the Lord but are not under God&rsquo;s will. Many servants of the Lord work diligently but are not in the will of God. This judgment can be made because they pay attention only to their work and neglect the church; they expand their work but are short of the building. Thus, their volumes of work do not pass the test of the building of the church.</p>
<p>We must see that all our work must be for the building up of the Body of Christ, which is the church. <em>Building</em> is an exceedingly great word in the Scriptures. Through all the ages and in all the generations God has been doing a work of building. His charge to preach the gospel is for the building, and His instructions to edify the believers are also for the building. Furthermore, He gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, and some as shepherds and teachers for the building, that is, for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ. But it is a pity that today many of those who fervently serve the Lord are not building up the church; instead, they are tearing it down. Today much of the work of preaching the gospel and even some of the work of edifying the believers is not building the church but damaging and tearing it down.</p>
<p>Therefore, the matter of building the church is a severe test to every one of us who serves the Lord. We do not need to exert great effort to examine our work and service. All we need to do is consider the church and use it as a test, a check, to find out whether the nature of our living, our work, and our service is related to building the church or tearing it down instead. Brothers and sisters, if we put the church aside, we may consider many works, such as preaching the gospel, saving souls, and edifying the believers, to be praiseworthy. But if we consider the church as a measure to test our works, we will immediately see that many of these works concern only the will of men rather than the will of God. Such works are still under the hand of Satan, and they are even used by Satan to damage the will of God, that is, to damage the building of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE NEED OF BEING BUILT</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16:18, <em>build</em> and <em>church</em> are important words: &ldquo;You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; In addition, 1 Peter 2:4-5 says, &ldquo;Coming to Him, a living stone,... you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house.&rdquo; These words speak of the importance of building.</p>
<p>As saved ones, we all admit that once we were clay but that we have become stones because of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. However, it is not enough simply to be stones; we still need to be built. No doubt, we are living stones, but a question remains: &ldquo;Have we been built?&rdquo; This is a serious question. If we have been built, then we, as stones, cannot be independent. Instead, we need to be dealt with and joined together with other stones.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we must ask ourselves, &ldquo;Have I been built? Am I connected with others? Am I in coordination with others? Or am I a stone, independent and isolated?&rdquo; Although someone may be a gem, a diamond that is exceedingly beautiful and very precious, he still may be all alone, in isolation, and not built with others. This is not what a Christian should be. The real meaning of being a Christian lies not only in beauty but even more in building. Building is first; beauty is second. There are many brothers and sisters who still have not been built with others, who still prefer to be individually spiritual, pursuing the Lord independently, working alone, preaching alone, and being alone. I do not know how many among the children of God have a consciousness of togetherness, a consciousness of coordination, saying, &ldquo;It is not enough that I am individually spiritual; the brothers and sisters must also be spiritual with me. I am not happy, nor do I feel beautiful when I am the only one who is spiritual. There is beauty only when the brothers, the sisters, and I are spiritual together. It is not enough to preach well by myself. Rather, the situation is good and effective only when I serve God together with my co-workers, my brothers and sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the meetings are always the same, the atmosphere is the same, the condition is the same, and the result is the same, a brother may think that everything would be marvelous if only he were the one speaking. This is a pitiful situation. Since this brother is not the speaker, however, he may have a different feeling and may even criticize, saying, &ldquo;Not many have come to the meeting, the atmosphere is depressing, and some even fall asleep.&rdquo; This is an individualistic feeling, a selfish feeling, a pitiful feeling. Although this brother is serving together with others, he has not been built together with them. If our service is like this, it cannot shake the gates of Hades, and we should not expect such messages to be effective and powerful. Our preaching will not be able to rescue the people who are being held in Hades, and our preaching will not be able to release sinners, nor even release believers. We, thus, will have no way to open the gates of the heavenly kingdom and usher people into the kingdom of the heavens to be under its ruling. Look at our flesh! Look at our selfishness! Look at our peculiarity! Look at our individualism! Look at our independence! Look at our self-justification and condemnation of others! All of these conditions prove that we have not been released but are still being held by the gates of Hades. Consequently, we will have no way to release others from the gates of Hades, much less lead them to be under the ruling of the heavens.</p>
<p>I feel that the Lord has burdened me to stress the matter of the building of the church. Brothers and sisters, have we been built? Are we individualistic, or are we coordinated together with the saints? Our strong points, our good qualities, do not count; the only thing that counts is being built with others. Certainly believers who lust after sinful things and love the world have no way to be built with others. But sadly, even the so-called spiritual believers who are spiritually peculiar, spiritually special, or super-spiritual have no way to be built with others. Satan, being crafty, really knows how to work. If he cannot hold someone back, he will push him forward; if he cannot cause someone to fall short, he will cause him to reach beyond. Hence, today in the church and in the service, it is not easy to see built-up believers and real coordination.</p>
<p>Sometimes I find a group of brothers and sisters who study the Bible together, and in the atmosphere among them I sense that each one cares only about his own studies. On the one hand, it is good that each one is studying well, but on the other hand, if a person has been built, dealt with, and is in coordination, he will have a different concept. It is not a matter of whether I study well but a matter of whether I study well with the brothers and sisters. It is not a matter of everything being fine as long as I study the Bible well, as long as I am spiritual, and as long as I can pray. No, rather it should be that the brothers and sisters and I study the Bible together, are spiritual together, pray together, and serve together. Brothers and sisters, when the saints around us are not serving properly, do we feel a heavy burden? If we do, our situation is right. If we do not, we have not yet been built up nor dealt with by the cross; thus, the gates of Hades cannot be shaken nor can the gates of the kingdom of the heavens be opened through us. Although we serve and work, we are serving and working according to our own will. We are caring for our own will rather than God&rsquo;s will. Therefore, Satan has nothing to fear in us, nor can God accomplish anything through us.</p>
<p>However, if we have been built, the situation is different. The degree of our being built determines the measure of the nature, testimony, and element of the church in us. Only the part of us that has been built is the church. Whatever has not been built is not the church. We should never think that because we are saved, we are the church. Stones are not necessarily a house. Independent stones are merely stones, not a house. Only stones which have been built together are a house. We must ask ourselves, &ldquo;Have I been built or not? Am I individualistic or corporate? Have I been dealt with, or am I still the same? Have I been broken, or am I still whole? Am I in coordination with others, or am I eccentric and in isolation?&rdquo; If there is no building, there is no church. If there is no building, there are only individual Christians who are saved, but there is no church. Without building, there are only individual stones, but there is no house. To have the house, that is, to have the church, there must be building. Without building, there is no testimony of the church; without the testimony of the church, there is no ground of the church.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, in these last days God intends to recover this matter. God wants to recover not only the ground and the testimony of the church but also the building of the church. Whoever receives grace and mercy will bow his head and say, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me, and have mercy also on my brothers and sisters. Build in us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must see that to be saved is one thing, but to be built is another. To be called by the Lord is one thing, but to be built by Him is another. To be placed in the Lord&rsquo;s hand is one thing, but to be willing to be broken in His hand is another. To be brothers together is one thing, but to be built with one another, to be built together, is another. For all to serve together is one thing, but for all to be coordinated is another. We need to be broken, dealt with, and delivered from our seclusion. We must see to such an extent that we cannot live, be a Christian, serve God, manage the church, preach the gospel, or edify the saints by ourself. We must see to such an extent that we need others in every step of our actions and in every aspect of our living. Without others, we should be paralyzed. Without others, it should be hard for us to walk even one inch. We need to realize this to such an extent in order to be built with others.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s situation is not like this. Instead, we seemingly say, &ldquo;It would be easier if there were no brothers and sisters; then I would be able to display all my abilities. It will be more convenient for me when everyone else is gone, and I am doing everything. The brothers and sisters are either a nuisance or a hindrance to me.&rdquo; I am afraid that some of the brothers and sisters often have this kind of feeling. They feel that it is pleasant to pray alone, wonderful to read the Word alone, convenient to serve the Lord alone, and enjoyable to preach the gospel alone. They also feel that it is troublesome to have the church life because the brothers are annoying and the sisters are burdensome. There are stumbling stones in front and entanglements behind. Do you have this kind of feeling? If you do, you must realize that you are a person without mercy bestowed on you. You are a natural person, and you have not yet received a revelation. You have not yet seen the light, and you have not yet been delivered from your self. A person who has been dealt with, who truly knows the testimony of the church, can no longer be individualistic and secluded. He cannot go on without the brothers and sisters. He cannot work without coordination. He cannot even be a Christian without being together with other Christians. This is not a doctrine. One day the Lord will bring you to such a point and open your eyes to see that you need to be built.</p>
<p>A brother once asked me, &ldquo;The teaching of the Lord Jesus on the mountain is &lsquo;when you pray, shut your door.&rsquo; Whenever I shut the door, I can pray for two hours, but whenever I kneel down with the brothers, I cannot pray two sentences. Why is this?&rdquo; The only reason for this is because he was used to being independent and secluded. He never depended on others. He lacked dependence in his spiritual life. He did not feel a need for his fellow members. He could be independent, pray by himself, and even read the Scriptures by himself.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, forgive me for speaking of my own experiences. Many times when I knelt down to pray, I longed to seek out a few brothers to pray with me after praying only a few sentences. Sometimes I needed a number of brothers and sisters to pray with me in order for the burden within me to be discharged. I could not do it alone. Sometimes I could not understand a chapter of the Bible, no matter how much time I spent reading it. Then I realized that I had to seek out some brothers. It was not enough to find one brother; I had to find several brothers to study together. Amazingly, I was able to understand what I read in a short period of time when I studied with the brothers.</p>
<p>If we really know the church, we will see that the church is a built-up entity, not merely something put together. The church is not put together with many believers, all of whom are in their original condition. Rather, the church is built with believers who have been dealt with and broken. Without building, there are stones, but there is no house. Without building, there are believers, but there is no church. Without building, the testimony, the ground, the warfare, and the victory are not possible. Without building, there is no defeat of Satan, nor is there the ruling of the heavens. Therefore, the building of the church is crucial to the testimony of the church. To have the testimony of the church, there must be the building of the church. And to have the building of the church, we need to be built. May the Lord have mercy on us!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NATURE OF THE TESTIMONY<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>At the end of this section, we need to consider the nature of the testimony of the church. What is the nature of the testimony of the church? According to biblical revelation, the nature of the testimony of the church consists of at least six important items.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. BEING OF REVELATION</h2>
<p>First, the nature of the testimony of the church is of revelation; it is not natural nor idealistic nor of human thought. This is clearly declared by the Lord in Matthew 16:17, where He used the word <em>revealed</em>. The testimony of the church is altogether related to revelation. After a person is saved and begins to love and be zealous for the Lord, he does not have much revelation. Instead, he thinks that he only needs to improve himself a little, to be a little more zealous and a little more spiritual, and to preach the gospel and work for the Lord a little more. All of these thoughts are natural. One day, however, the Spirit of God will open his eyes and give him a revelation, showing him that God does not want his zeal nor his labor nor his spirituality. Instead, he will see that God wants to do a building work in him. God wants to build him; God wants to obtain the church. God wants to have a testimony of the church. God wants the believers to be broken, dealt with, and built up so that they become coordinated as one Body to be one church, one testimony. This is a matter of revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. BEING OF RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Second, according to Ephesians 2:6, the nature of the testimony of the church is also of resurrection. Everything natural must be put off; everything must enter into resurrection. This requires us to be tested and to pass through death. Many tests eventually lead to death. For example, a brother who really loves the Lord and is very talented, full of zeal and of vigor, may desire to serve the church. But his natural talent, zeal, and vigor cannot be brought into the testimony of the church. Sooner or later this brother must pass through a test and through death. His talent, zeal, and power all need to be tested by being put into death. Then whatever comes out of death will be in resurrection, and only what is in resurrection can be built and be in coordination. In our natural being we cannot be in coordination with others. Only what is in resurrection can be coordinated. Consequently, only that which is of resurrection is the Body, only that which is of resurrection is the church, and only that which is of resurrection is the testimony.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. BEING OF THE NEW CREATION</h2>
<p>Third, Ephesians 2:15 shows us that the nature of the testimony of the church is of the new creation, not of the old creation. This also requires stripping and breaking. Our natural being is of the old creation, and only that which is in resurrection is of the new creation. All that is of the old creation belongs to Adam; only that which is of the new creation belongs to Christ. Actually, that which is of the old creation is Adam, and that which is of the new creation is Christ. The church does not belong to Adam. It is not in Adam, and it is not Adam. Rather, the church belongs to Christ. It is in Christ, and it is even Christ Himself. Therefore, in the testimony of the church there is nothing of the old creation of Adam; there are only the things of the new creation of Christ. In the testimony of the church, the things of the old creation must pass through the process of death and resurrection so that all the things of Adam can become the things of Christ, because only that which is of resurrection and of Christ is the new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. BEING SPIRITUAL</h2>
<p>Fourth, the nature of the testimony of the church is spiritual. This is seen in Ephesians 2:18. The church is constituted with the Holy Spirit in the spirit of the believers; thus, there is no element of the flesh. Therefore, the testimony of the church is spiritual. No element of the flesh can be mixed with it. Once there is an element of the flesh, the testimony of the church is damaged and will be lost. The testimony of the church must be absolutely spiritual. Whenever we live in the spirit, we have the testimony of the church. Whenever we live according to the flesh, we lose the testimony of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. BEING HEAVENLY</h2>
<p>Fifth, Ephesians 2:6 shows that the nature of the testimony of the church is heavenly. This is the proper position. Although the church is on the earth, it is something heavenly. The nature of the church is heavenly because her source is not on earth but in the heavens. The church does not come out of the earth but out of the heavens. Her foundation is in heaven. Whenever the church becomes earthly and has an earthly condition, the nature of the church is changed, and the testimony of the church is lost. This is because the church is altogether heavenly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. BEING ETERNAL</h2>
<p>Sixth, the nature of the testimony of the church is eternal. Ephesians 3:11 says that God&rsquo;s purpose for the church is an eternal purpose, a purpose made in eternity. Therefore, we know that the church is something eternal. Anything temporary is not the church. Anything that is here one day and gone the next day is not the church. Anything that can be removed, altered, wiped out, or voided is not the church. Since the nature of the church is eternal, whatever is of the church cannot be altered, removed, or wiped out; it remains forever. Only what is eternal can be the church, and only what is eternal can be the testimony of the church. Therefore, like the church itself, the testimony of the church is eternal.</p>
<p>These six items show the nature of the church, and they are also the nature of the testimony of the church. These six items are a severe test to the church and to the testimony of the church. Whatever fails to pass the test of these six items is not the church nor the testimony of the church. Anything that can be counted as the church and as the testimony of the church must be of revelation, of resurrection, of the new creation and spiritual, heavenly, and eternal. These six items are linked together. Whatever is of revelation is surely of resurrection; whatever is of resurrection is of the new creation; whatever is of the new creation is spiritual; whatever is spiritual is heavenly; and whatever is heavenly is eternal. All these items require that we receive the breaking of the cross. Our natural man and our flesh must be dealt with; our whole being must be broken. When the cross has done its sufficient work, spiritual revelation will come, the things of resurrection will come forth, the things of the new creation will be manifested, and there will be a spiritual, heavenly, and eternal element. This is the church; this is also the testimony of the church. Therefore, this is the nature of the testimony of the church.</p><h1 class="series">SECTION TWO</h1>
<h1 class="series">THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="msg">SECTION TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>Now we will begin to consider the matter of the ground of the church. The testimony of the church is the content of the church, and the ground of the church is the outward appearance of the church. Everything created by God has two aspects: an inward aspect and an outward aspect. Everything has content and appearance. We cannot find anything that has only one aspect. It is impossible for something to exist with only one of these aspects. This is a great law, an important principle, in the universe.</p>
<p>Similarly, the church has two aspects, both content and appearance. We often lean toward one aspect, however, when we speak concerning the church. Either we pay too much attention to its inward aspect, its content, or we pay too much attention to its outward aspect, its appearance. But the truth in the Scriptures is balanced. Just as the Bible shows us the content of the church, it also shows us the appearance of the church. The content of the church is the testimony of the church. We have already seen that the content, the testimony, of the church is to express Christ. The appearance of the church includes many points that are related to the matter of the ground.</p>
<p>We must admit that those who love and pursue the Lord do not have much problem with the content of the church, but they have many problems related to the ground of the church. Throughout the ages among those who love the Lord, the problems that have arisen concerning the church were seldom related to the content or the testimony of the church; rather, almost all of them have been related to the outward appearance or the ground of the church. If the children of God could properly deal with the ground of the church, there would be almost no problems related to the church. We want to look at the matter of the ground of the church during this conference in the hope that we can help God&rsquo;s children on this point.</p>
<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ONENESS OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>From the outset we need to affirm one thing: God is uniquely one, and therefore almost all things in the universe are also single, pure, and one in substance. The universe is not two but one because its source&mdash;the God who created it&mdash;is one. This is the case with the universe and even more so with the church. Essentially, the church is not dual and surely not plural but one. The production of the church is one, the nature of the church is one, the existence of the church is one, and all other aspects of the church are one. In brief, we can say that everything related to the church is intrinsically one. Since this is a principle, we can infer that the ground of the church is also one, not many. We must hold fast to this principle. There is no justification for the church having many grounds. Since the source of the church is one and the nature of the church is one, the ground of the church must be one. Whoever thinks that there can be more than one ground for the church is wrong in principle. Since the church is uniquely one, there cannot be more than one ground of the church. We must affirm this from the very beginning.</p>
<p>When we open our eyes and look around, however, we see that the church has numerous grounds. According to the statistics, there were more than fifteen hundred different grounds by 1914. This is according to the statistics of over forty years or nearly half a century. Half a century ago the church which is uniquely one already had more than fifteen hundred grounds; today we believe that there are even more. There is no need to look at another time or another place; simply look at where we are at the present time and the present place. Do we see many different grounds of the church? Surprisingly, the one ground of the church has been divided into many different grounds. According to proper reasoning, no one who is fair and just could come to the conclusion that this is right. It is logical to conclude that since the church is one, the ground of the church also must be one. But today&rsquo;s situation is not in agreement with this principle. Incredibly, the church has multiple grounds; the one church has many grounds. This is not reasonable.</p>
<p>What is the proper ground of the church? The church should have only one ground; this is a definite principle. An intelligent person does not need to find the biblical revelation. By simply inferring from the principle, he definitely should say that the church has only one ground. God does not do things contrary to His principles. Therefore, if we look into the Bible, the matter becomes even clearer. The church is a matter of being one, not two. If we carefully read the Bible, we will see that the church is described as being one whenever it is mentioned. The church is simply one. Therefore, the ground of the church also should be one.</p>
<p>Of the many grounds that exist today, is any one of them right? What is the right ground; what is the proper ground of the church? This is what we hope to make clear as we consider the matter of the ground of the church. As we consider the ground of the church, the first thing we need to see is the oneness of the church, which is what we ordinarily refer to as the unity of the church. Strictly speaking, the oneness of the church does not depend upon the church being united but on the church being one. Since the church is one, it has an inherent oneness. The church does not need uniting; the church is simply one. The church has an inherent quality called oneness.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE ESSENCE OF THE ONENESS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being the Spirit Himself</h2>
<p>What is this oneness? In Ephesians 4:3, this oneness is called &ldquo;the oneness of the Spirit.&rdquo; What is the oneness of the Spirit? The oneness of the Spirit is just the Spirit Himself. The Spirit is the very oneness, the essence of the oneness. The Spirit is one. This one Spirit is in you, in him, and in me; He is in millions of us who are saved. It is not enough to say that the Spirit in us is the same. The Spirit in every one of us is the one and the same Spirit. The Spirit in you is the Spirit in me, and the Spirit in me is also the Spirit in you. The Spirit in millions of us who are saved is the one Spirit, not simply the same kind of Spirit but the same one Spirit.</p>
<p>There may be some newly saved brothers and sisters who doubt this, saying, &ldquo;How could the Spirit in so many of us be only one? To say that the Spirit is the same may be easy, but to say that the Spirit is one is really hard to understand. How could the Spirit who is in you, who is in me, and who is in so many others be only one?&rdquo; We can use a simple illustration to answer this question. Look at all the electric lamps in a meeting hall. If we turn on the switch, electricity flows into all the lamps. Those who understand electricity know that the electricity in all the lamps is only one; it is not only the same kind but the same one. The electric current flowing in the many lamps is one and the same. Not only so, when evening comes, thousands upon thousands of lights throughout the city of Taipei all share the one and same electricity; all have the same one electric current.</p>
<p>It is the same with the Spirit&rsquo;s entering into the saved ones, whether in ancient times or modern times, in China or elsewhere. Every saved one has the Spirit within him, and this Spirit in all of us is one and the same&mdash;the one Spirit. This Spirit is the oneness among us. The Spirit within the church is the oneness within the church. This is like the electricity within light bulbs being the oneness in and among the light bulbs. They are in unity because they are one. There is a oneness within them. Brothers and sisters, I believe that we can understand this now. You have the Spirit in you, I have the Spirit in me, and someone else has the Spirit in him; all the saved ones throughout the ages in all places have the Spirit in them. This Spirit is the oneness of the church. Therefore, when we meet a brother and realize that he is a brother, there is a response within us&mdash;we simply love him, we delight in him, and we desire to be near him. He also responds in the same way. Even though we did not know each other previously, it is as if we are old acquaintances when we meet. Immediately, something leaps within each of us, as if deep is calling unto deep&mdash;the Spirit deep within us responds to the Spirit deep within him. This response from the deepest part of our being is the oneness, that is, the oneness of the Spirit, which is the oneness of the church.</p>
<p>I would like to say a few more words. In the example we gave earlier, one brother met another brother, and the two had not previously known each other. Once they found that they were brothers in the Lord, they responded to each other and were drawn to each other; they were really warm and loving toward each other. However, if they have an extended conversation, they may get into trouble, because if they continue to talk, one will naturally ask, &ldquo;Brother, what church do you belong to?&rdquo; When a question concerning the church is asked, their faces will immediately turn cold. If the conversation continues, one will ask further, &ldquo;What are the beliefs of your church? What is your attitude in regard to the Holy Spirit?&rdquo; The other one may answer, &ldquo;With regard to the Holy Spirit, we shake whenever we pray.&rdquo; When the one who asked the question hears this, his face will not only turn cold but also stiff, and he may say, &ldquo;Oh, this is too much! God is a God of peace, and He wants us to be peaceful and quiet. Peacefulness is the work of the Holy Spirit, but shaking cannot be the work of the Holy Spirit. I cannot tolerate anyone who shakes while praying.&rdquo; Brothers and sisters, do we see this? When the two brothers first met, they immediately touched the oneness of the Spirit. They both have the Spirit within them. Despite the fact that one is for quietness and the other enjoys shaking, both of them have the Spirit. When they met, because the Spirit leaped within them, leaping in this one and in the other as well, they responded to each other. Although they are two, the Spirit in them is one in actuality. However, instead of caring for the leaping and the responding of the Spirit within them, they soon can only argue with one another. This is disastrous! One is occupied with the thought of shaking, and the other is filled with the thought of quietness. When one hears about shaking, he becomes upset and feels that it is unbearable. When the other hears about being quiet, he feels deadened, thinking that the Spirit is not present in this kind of quietness. In this way they will fight against each other in their mind. Their spirits echo each other, but their minds are in conflict with one another. It seems as if the oneness of the Spirit is missing; it has leaked out through the conflict in their minds. Their mind, their thought, has overcome their spirit, and as a result, the two no longer want to see each other. Moreover, they dislike praying together, because one cannot pray when the other is shaking, and one is impatient when the other is waiting quietly.</p>
 <p>This shows that the oneness of the Christians has encountered a problem. What is the problem? The problem is with intellect, reasonings, practices, and opinions. But even considering all of these things, God has put the Spirit of God, once for all, into the depths of the being of every saved one. This Spirit of God within us is our oneness. As the saved ones, we all have the Spirit of God in us; therefore, we have the oneness. However, because of differences in our flesh, in our disposition, in our desires and preferences, in our views and opinions, and in our judgments and decisions, the oneness is damaged, and it seems as if we have lost the oneness. In reality, however, the oneness cannot be lost. It has merely suffered a setback; it is hidden and withdrawn because it has been conquered by our self. This means that our soul-life, preferences, emotions, thoughts, opinions, views, ideas, and judgments have overcome the Spirit and suppressed the oneness in us. Thus, our oneness has been damaged and seems to be lost. In actuality, the oneness is still present because this oneness, which is the Spirit Himself, can never be lost.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being Oneness, Not Unity</h2>
<p>The oneness of the Spirit is simply one; that is, it is not related to being united together. This oneness does not need to be united together; it is simply one. If we disregard our thoughts and care only for our spirit and the response in our spirit, then there will be a situation of oneness among us. If Christians care for the spirit in them instead of caring for their outward thoughts, then a situation of oneness will be manifested in the church. This is not a matter of uniting together through human effort; rather, it is a living out of the oneness of the Spirit among the believers.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE REALITY OF ONENESS</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 4:3 the apostle not only speaks of the oneness of the Spirit, but he goes on to speak of seven &ldquo;ones&rdquo; in verses 4 through 6. If we carefully study these seven &ldquo;ones,&rdquo; we can see that they are divided into one group of four and another group of three.</p>
<p>In the Bible the number seven signifies completion. The seven &ldquo;ones&rdquo; of the church spoken of here convey, to a large extent, the meaning of completion. These &ldquo;ones&rdquo; are sufficiently complete; there is no need to have any other &ldquo;ones.&rdquo; If the church has these seven &ldquo;ones,&rdquo; the oneness of the church is sufficiently complete. In the Bible the number seven is sometimes divided into six and one, but mainly it is divided into four and three. Four is the number for the creatures, while three is the number for the Creator because God is the Triune God. The number for the church in this age is seven. In Revelation we see seven churches; furthermore, these seven churches are divided into two groups, the first three being in one group and the last four being in another. The church is a &ldquo;seven,&rdquo; which is derived from the creatures plus the Creator, that is, man plus God. This is the church. The church is an entity of God being added into man, that is, three added to four. Man alone on earth cannot be the church, nor can God alone in heaven be the church. One day God came down from heaven to the earth and added Himself into men; thus, the church was brought forth. Three was added to four to form seven; that is, God was added into man to produce the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. One Body, One Spirit, One Lord, and One God</h2>
<p>Four of the seven ones of the church are mainly on the side of God, and the other three are mainly on the side of man. I am not dividing them absolutely; I only want to show the seven fundamental items of the oneness of the church. The first four basic items are counted backward from the end of verse 6. Let us read the section from verses 4 through 6, which says, &ldquo;One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.&rdquo; We should first pay attention to the way the verse speaks concerning God. It says that God is the Father of all. He is your Father, and He is my Father; He is the Father of all of the believers. He is the source of life; we are all out of Him and begotten of Him. Not only so, He is over, above, all of us. He is also through all of us. He bored through all of us, going through you to me, and then from me to someone else. He connects all of us by going through us. Without Him, we would all be separated; with Him, we are all connected. This may be likened to the electric current flowing in light bulbs. When the electric current is absent, the light bulbs in the building are separated, but when electricity flows into the light bulbs, all the light bulbs are connected. Instantly, electricity flows through one bulb to another bulb. Before I can finish saying the word <em>flows,</em> the electric current has already flowed through the bulbs. Before I can say another word, it has returned. This electricity continuously flows through the bulbs and thereby connects them. Not only so, the electricity also dwells in them and fills them. This shows that our one God and Father, as the source, not only is through all of us but also dwells in all of us, filling us, saturating us, and completely mingling Himself with us. He is such a God.</p>
<p>How does this God go through us? How does He fill us? How does He mingle Himself with us? We all know that God put Himself into the Son. To God, this Son is the Son, but to us, He is the Lord. God put all of Himself into the Son, and the Son came to be our Lord that we may believe in Him and receive Him. He passed through death and resurrection and entered into the Spirit. The Spirit descended from heaven with the Son and the Father. Therefore, at this time, all three persons of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are in the Spirit. When we repent to the Father and receive the Son as our Lord, the Spirit enters into us. When this Spirit enters into us, the Son is brought into us; moreover, when the Son is brought into us, the Father who is in the Son is also brought into us. Thus, when the Triune God enters into us who have received Him, there is a oneness within us. This oneness is the Triune God. We become one Body because we have this oneness within us. Thus, this is a story with four layers: the Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in the Body. Therefore, this portion in Ephesians first speaks of one Body, then one Spirit, then one Lord, who is the Son, and then one Father, who is God. If we speak in reverse, the order would be the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and the Body. These four items are related to God. Of these four, the Body is also related to us.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire in this universe is to work out this four-layer story. These four layers are a mystery. If someone were to ask me what the Bible speaks of, I would tell that person that it speaks of the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and the Body. In the first chapter of Genesis there is God, the Father of all lights and the source of life. In the New Testament this Father is in the Son; everything of the Father is in the Son. At the end of the Gospels the Son is in the Spirit. Then at the beginning of Acts this Spirit has entered into thousands of people so that the Triune God is within them. As a result of this mysterious oneness, they became a mysterious Body. Since that time, this Body has begun to be transformed and to grow, and it will keep growing until it becomes the New Jerusalem at the end of the Bible. The New Jerusalem is the Body. In this Body there is the Spirit, in this Spirit there is the Son, and in this Son there is the Father. The entire Bible speaks of these four layers&mdash;the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and the Body. The Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in the Body. This is the entire Bible. I believe that all the readers of the Bible should see this thoroughly. The God who is spoken of in the Bible involves these four layers. The Father is at the center, then there is the Son and the Spirit, and finally there is the Body. These four, which form a set, a group, are the mystery of the universe.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the church is one because the Triune God is within it. This is a series, a group: one Father, one Son, one Spirit, entering into one Body. The Body is one; the Spirit is one; the Son, the Lord, is one; and the Father, God, is also one. This God is the Father of all, who is over all, through all, and in all, being mingled completely with those who are saved as one entity. This is a fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s prayer in John 17. The Triune God and the church, which has been saved by grace, are completely joined together and completely one. This is one group.</p><h2 class="head2">B. One Hope, One Faith, and One Baptism</h2>
<p>In addition, there are three other &ldquo;ones&rdquo;&mdash;one hope, one faith, and one baptism. Hope is for the future. As those who have been saved by grace, those who are the church, we may have different opinions, yet we share the same hope. For example, consider the previous example of the two brothers: one is a shaking brother, and the other is a quiet brother; one disapproves of quietness, and the other disagrees with shaking. Obviously, these two have widely divergent opinions. The Spirit in them is one and the same&mdash;this is not a problem. However, they have two outward expressions&mdash;this is a great problem. The quiet one, however, may ask the shaking one, &ldquo;Brother, even though you shake and shake, where will you be in the end?&rdquo; The shaking one would answer, &ldquo;One day I will be in glory.&rdquo; On the other hand, the shaking one may ask the quiet one, &ldquo;Brother, you are quiet all the time, but where will you be in the end?&rdquo; Surely the quiet one would also say, &ldquo;I will be in glory.&rdquo; This is the one hope they share. No one who is saved is without this hope of glory. A brother expressed it really well when he said, &ldquo;Our future is the same, so our journey today must also be the same.&rdquo; Thank the Lord, we really have the same one future, the same one hope. Throughout the generations, Christians in various denominations have had many differences in doctrines, yet they have one and the same hope. If someone is different in the matter of the one hope, he must not be saved nor a member of the church nor a brother of ours.</p>
<p>There is also one faith. This faith is our belief, not an idea, opinion, or understanding. Sometimes two brothers who do not know each other meet and discover that they are mutually brothers in Christ, and they speak of spiritual matters. For example, when they speak of baptism, one brother may say, &ldquo;I believe that baptism by immersion is right.&rdquo; The other brother may say, &ldquo;I do not believe that it is necessary to be immersed; sprinkling with water is sufficient.&rdquo; Here are two different beliefs, two kinds of faith. But is this really faith? These are not matters of faith; rather, they are opinions or views. What is faith? Only that which we must believe in order to be saved can be called faith. We can be saved even if we do not believe in sprinkling or if we do not believe in immersion. Therefore, things such as this cannot be counted as faith.</p>
<p>Sometimes brothers come together and speak concerning the matter of rapture. One may say, &ldquo;I believe in the rapture before the great tribulation,&rdquo; and another may say, &ldquo;I believe in the rapture after the great tribulation.&rdquo; It appears that these two brothers differ in their faith, but actually, this is not a difference in faith. Whether one is pre-tribulation or post-tribulation is of no consequence. If we do not believe in a post-tribulation rapture, we still can be saved. Likewise, if we do not believe in a pre-tribulation rapture, we also can be saved. We cannot be saved to a greater degree by believing in a pre-tribulation rapture, neither can we be saved to a lesser degree by believing in a post-tribulation rapture. We may believe differently, but we are both saved just the same. Please remember, belief that is unrelated to salvation cannot be counted as faith. What then can be counted as faith? The only thing that can be counted as faith is what we must believe in order to be saved; it is the things that, if not believed, will keep us from being saved. This is what is called the one faith. The one faith is not related to beliefs that are according to our opinions or views; it is the faith, the belief, that brings in salvation.</p>
<p>Sometimes the sisters may speak regarding head covering. One sister may say, &ldquo;I really believe in wearing a head covering. Since we are sisters, we should cover our head.&rdquo; Another sister may say, &ldquo;I do not believe in it. Head covering was an ancient custom in Corinth; I do not believe it is a commandment from God.&rdquo; Here, again, we see two different beliefs. One believes in head covering, and the other does not believe in head covering. However, such beliefs cannot be counted as the faith. They are opinions and not the faith. One believes in head covering and is saved; the other does not believe in head covering and also is saved. One is not saved to a greater degree by believing in head covering, nor is one saved to a lesser degree by not believing in head covering. These beliefs cannot be counted as the faith, the one faith.</p>
<p>Do not misunderstand me. I am not saying that there are no truths related to baptism, rapture, and head covering. There are indeed truths related to these matters. However, we need to remember that beliefs related to views and opinions concerning the truth are not the same as beliefs related to the faith. Views and opinions concerning the truth are views and opinions and should not be counted as items of the faith. One of the seven ones of the church is called &ldquo;one faith.&rdquo; The faith associated with the one faith causes us to be saved. This is the faith in which we believe in the Son of God as our Savior, the faith in which we receive the Lord Jesus into us. He is the Son of God anointed to be our Lord. God put Himself into His Son and made Him our Lord. God not only conveyed His Son to us through His Spirit by preaching but also by transmitting Him. We receive Him when we say, for example, &ldquo;Amen, You are the Son of God, the Savior appointed by God, and the Lord of all set up by God. God is in You, and You are my Lord. I receive You from my heart.&rdquo; When we receive Him in this way, we believe in Him. This is the belief of the one faith. Every genuine Christian has the one faith, regardless of whether he shakes or is quiet. Anyone without such faith is not saved; anyone without such faith is not our brother or our sister. Those who have such faith are our brothers and sisters. A sister may not believe in head covering, but she has faith. A brother may not believe in baptism by immersion, but he still has faith. Another may not believe in a pre-tribulation rapture or even in a post-tribulation rapture, but he still has faith. Dear brothers and sisters, I absolutely believe that each one of us has faith in us. We all have this faith. This faith is the one faith of the seven ones of the church.</p>
<p>Sometime ago in a certain place I met a very dear brother. He came to our meetings to listen to messages because he genuinely enjoyed the fellowship with us. When he observed that we all prayed at the same time during the meeting, he asked, &ldquo;Brother Lee, where did the practice of praying at the same time originate?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;It probably came from the Spirit. After 1935, sometimes when we would meet, there was a certain kind of atmosphere and everyone would spontaneously pray at the same time.&rdquo; He nodded his head and said, &ldquo;No doubt this came from the charismatic movement, the Pentecostal movement.&rdquo; Then he shook his head and said, &ldquo;This is really regrettable! Really regrettable! I thought that your meetings were the best, but I never would have imagined that there could be such a bad thing as everyone praying at the same time. The presence of this practice among you is really a stain.&rdquo; After I listened to his words, I dared not say anything, nor could I. Within me, however, I said, &ldquo;We feel that it is all right to pray at the same time, and you feel that it is not all right. Either way, it does not matter. But if we dispute over this matter, with one considering it as a defect, and the other considering it as a good thing, this will become troublesome to us, and we will have a problem with one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must know the one faith that is indispensable to the church. Our oneness must be based on this one faith, not on opinions concerning the truth. God is in His Son, His Son is in the Spirit, and the Spirit comes into every one of us, making us one Body. One God, one Lord, one Spirit, and one Body&mdash;this is the one faith. Is God one? Yes! Is the Lord one? Yes! Is the Spirit one? Yes! Is the Body one? Yes! Is this one God in us? Yes! Is this one Lord in us? Yes! Is this one Spirit in us? Yes! Are we in the one Body? Yes! We all have these items, and we all believe these items. This is the one faith. Concerning outward practices, one may be in favor of praying one by one and another favors everyone praying at the same time. The first may consider everyone praying at the same time as a stain, but the second may consider it a glory. This is something in addition to the faith. As children of God, we must see that we should require people to have only the one faith; we should not consider other opinions, views, or ideas as fundamental beliefs. Whether we pray while standing or pray while kneeling down, whether we pray at the same time or pray one by one, whether we pray silently or pray loudly, whether we pray with still hands and feet or pray with our whole body shaking&mdash;everything is all right, and nothing is unacceptable. Let me ask, brothers and sisters, should we count all these different opinions as fundamental beliefs of our one faith? Can we ask everyone to be the same in these matters? This is absolutely impossible. Therefore, we should not include these matters in the fundamental faith. The fundamental faith does not concern these matters. The fundamental faith is concerned with the one Father being in the Son, the one Son being in the Spirit, and the one Spirit being in all of us, making us the one Body. One Father, one Lord, one Spirit, and one Body&mdash;this is the one faith.</p>
 <p>Oh, dear brothers and sisters, if the children of God would disregard all the outward matters and see that only the one faith is absolutely necessary, we would be clear regarding the ground of the church. There would not be an immersion sect or a sprinkling sect, a pre-tribulation sect or a post-tribulation sect. All the differences would be gone, and only the one faith would remain. It does not matter if we are for immersion and others are for sprinkling, or if we are for pre-tribulation and others are for post-tribulation; we all have the one faith&mdash;we all believe that the Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in us, making us the one Body. Because we all have this one faith, we are all in the one Body, which is the church.</p>
<p>Finally, there is another &ldquo;one&rdquo;&mdash;one baptism. What is this one baptism? Does it refer to baptism by immersion or baptism by sprinkling? Actually, it refers to neither immersion nor sprinkling. This one baptism denotes baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus. In baptism we confess that all we are and all we have are accursed and that all that we deserve is condemnation and death. Through baptism we died, we were buried, and we have been resurrected together with the Lord. Thus, from now on the Lord Jesus as our life is living out through us. This is genuine baptism, and this the one baptism. On this point all the children of God are the same. If we speak of baptism only as an outward practice, however, it will become a troublesome matter.</p>
<p>I would like to tell you some of the practices of baptism so that we will understand that there is a great variety of practices concerning it. There is baptism by sprinkling, and there is also baptism by immersion. Regarding baptism by immersion, there are further details. There is face-down baptism, and there is also face-up baptism. There is baptism with one immersion, and there is baptism with three immersions: once in the name of the Father, once in the name of the Son, and once in the name of the Spirit&mdash;as if only this way will count. Such disputes actually exist. Someone asked another person, &ldquo;What kind of baptism did you have?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I had face-up baptism.&rdquo; The first person said, &ldquo;This does not count. According to John 19:30, in His crucifixion the Lord Jesus bowed His head and delivered up His spirit. Since our baptism signifies that we died with Christ, we should bow our head and be face down.&rdquo; Furthermore, there are those who argue, saying, &ldquo;Brother, in what kind of water were you baptized? Was it artificial water or natural water?&rdquo; They consider baptism in the meeting hall as something unacceptable. They say, &ldquo;Look at the examples in the Bible. In the case of the Lord Jesus, He was baptized in natural water. And in the case of Philip, he baptized others in natural water.&rdquo; However, some over-spiritualize the matter of baptism. The Salvation Army is such an example. Those in the Salvation Army simply wave a banner over people&rsquo;s head and consider that as baptism. The Quakers, who spiritualize things even more, do not want anything outward, so they only receive a spiritual baptism. They want only a spiritual reality, not physical water, not even a banner. The children of God have serious disputes concerning the matter of baptism, and as a consequence, we have been divided.</p>
<p>The one baptism spoken of in the Bible, however, is one, just as there is the one faith. By faith we believe into Christ and are in union with Christ. In baptism we acknowledge that we have been terminated and that we have died and been buried. After baptism, everything involves Christ being our life. When we believe in this way, the Triune God comes into us. When we are baptized in this way, the old creation in us is terminated. In addition, we also have the hope of glory. Therefore, these three&mdash;one faith, one baptism, and one hope&mdash;form another group.</p>
 <p>Therefore, the first group that constitutes the reality of the oneness of the church consists of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God; the second group consists of one hope, one faith, and one baptism. In reverse order, they are one God, one Lord, one Spirit, and one Body, and then one faith, one baptism, and one hope. The one Body is the main item of the first group, and the one hope is the main item of the second group. Combining these two main items, we have one Body with one hope. The church is one Body today with one hope in the future. The one Body comes out of the entering in of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The one hope is obtained through faith and baptism. The Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Spirit, and the Spirit comes into us, causing us to believe and to be baptized. After we believe and receive the Triune God, having been baptized into Him, the Father, the Son, the Spirit are all in us, making us one mystical Body with one hope of glory. Therefore, through one faith and one baptism we have received one God, one Lord, and one Spirit so that we are one Body with one hope. These seven &ldquo;ones&rdquo;&mdash;one God, one Lord, one Spirit, one Body, one faith, one baptism, and one hope&mdash;are the reality of the oneness of the church, the base of the oneness of the church.</p>
<p>Thank and praise the Lord, we have these seven &ldquo;ones.&rdquo; Whoever does not have these seven items is not a brother in the church; whoever has something more than these seven items is a member of a sect. If we have only these seven items, we are persons living in the church. Anything less is a problem, and anything more also causes trouble. We can have only these seven &ldquo;ones&rdquo;&mdash;one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. Thank and praise the Lord, we have these seven &ldquo;ones.&rdquo; We should not drop any of them, nor should we add anything to them. We should keep only these seven &ldquo;ones.&rdquo; If we do, there will be no divisions; instead, we will have the oneness of the church and the ground of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE INDIVISIBILITY OF THE ONENESS</h2>
<p>Since we have looked at the essence and the reality of the oneness of the church, we need to look at the indivisibility of the oneness of the church. In the New Testament there are many portions which emphatically speak of the church being one, which cannot and should not be divided. Since the nature of the church is one, the church cannot be divided. Any reason for division is improper. No reason can be used as a basis for dividing the church. We have clearly seen in the previous sections that the church is one; her nature, that is, the Triune God, is one&mdash;the Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in the Body. Therefore, the Body is one and cannot be divided. Just as God is one, the church also is one. Just as God cannot be divided, the church cannot be divided. We must hold fast to this firm principle.</p>
<p>For two thousand years no one has been able to give a good justification for the division of the church. There is no such reason in the Bible. The church is one; the nature of the church is one. The content of the church is the unique God Himself. Therefore, no matter what reason a person uses to divide the church, it is an offense to God, and it is condemned by God. No matter how good, how lofty, and how logical the reason, division is not permitted by God. It is God who says that the church cannot be divided, because it is one.</p>
<p>However, for two thousand years, Satan has continually used man&rsquo;s flesh in relation to the church to oppose God and to act contrary to God. God says that the church is one, but men insist on making the church many. God says that the church cannot be divided, yet Satan is determined to divide the church through the flesh of men. We can look at the situation on the earth today and see the extent to which the church has been divided. Not only is there an Eastern Orthodox Greek Church and a Western Roman Catholic Church, there are also Protestant churches. We have already indicated that according to statistics in 1914 there were more than fifteen hundred sects among Protestant churches. We may not accept this figure, but what is the present situation in Taipei? We have no idea how many &ldquo;churches&rdquo; there are in the East Gate district alone. In this district there is a Baptist Church, there is a Presbyterian Church, and not far away there is a Lutheran Church and a Methodist Church. There are a great variety of &ldquo;churches,&rdquo; which is actually like a &ldquo;church&rdquo; marketplace.</p>
<p>A church in a given locality is the expression of the universal church in that locality. Therefore, there should be only one church in a given locality just as there is only one church in the whole universe. The church in the universe is one, so the church in a locality should also be one. Today, however, the church has been divided by men. This is man&rsquo;s greatest offense to God. We know that the church is the Body of Christ and the dwelling place of God; it has a particular function before God. However, if a body is cut up, it is finished; if a dwelling place or a house is taken apart, it is also completely useless. The church today has been cut up, and no one knows into how many pieces it has been cut. This is a divided situation altogether. Can anyone justify this? Everyone must condemn it! Everyone must, according to God&rsquo;s Word, say, &ldquo;This is from Satan!&rdquo; Satan is damaging the dwelling place of God. Satan is damaging the Body of Christ. If a body is a little sick, it may not be important, but if it is cut up and dismembered, it is finished. The reason the church has lost its power and its authority on the earth is because the church is divided. Wherever there is division, there is no blessing of God; wherever there is division, there is no presence of God. Conversely, wherever there is oneness, there is the blessing of God; wherever there is oneness, there is the presence of God.</p>
<p>I must repeat that the gospel preaching in today&rsquo;s Christianity is so pitiful because the church is divided. If the church was in oneness, without division, if it was a testimony of oneness, the dwelling place of God and the Body of Christ, in which there is one Spirit, in whom is the one Son, in whom is the one Father, that is, in which the entire Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;dwells, then the gospel preaching of the church would be altogether different. It would be full of power and authority and the presence of God, and there would be absolutely no need to use any worldly means to entice people. The apostle Peter said to the lame man, &ldquo;Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene rise up and walk.&rdquo; Then the man instantly arose and began to walk and leap, praising God (Acts 3:6-8). This is the gospel, this is the power of the gospel, and this is the authority of the gospel. However, today the church has lost this authority because the church is divided. Without the Lord&rsquo;s presence, power, and authority, the church has to resort to pitiful methods and use material benefits to bring in false believers when it preaches the gospel. What a pitiful situation! The church has fallen into such a state because it is divided. Once the church is divided, it is no longer the church.</p>
<p>People frequently ask us, &ldquo;Why do you say that others are not the church?&rdquo; Actually, we never say this. We absolutely admit that everyone who is saved belongs to the church. We acknowledge that they are children of God, our brothers in the Lord, members of the Body of Christ, and constituents of the church. However, I must ask, &ldquo;Do you think the place where they are standing is the ground of the church? Do you think their ground is the ground of the church? No doubt they belong to the church, but they do not stand on the ground of the church. They belong to the church, but they are not on the ground of the church. This is similar to someone who is a member of a household but who no longer lives in the house. Look at the various denominations and groups in today&rsquo;s Christianity. Is their situation the situation of the church? Do they have the ground of the church? Do they have the nature of the church? Do they have the content of the church? Anyone who is fair and reasonable would shake his head and say, &ldquo;No, they do not have the ground of the church, the nature of the church, or the content of the church.&rdquo; We acknowledge that many of those who are in the denominations and organizations belong to the church. The <em>persons</em> are right, but their <em>ground</em> is wrong. They are right persons in wrong places. They have lost the nature of the church, the content of the church, the testimony of the church, and the ground of the church because of their place. These things were lost because of division. Once the church is divided, it is no longer the church. Once there is division, there is no church. The church must not be divided.</p>
<p>How did people divide the church? The Bible anticipated and spoke of this long ago; it predicted different ways that people would divide the church. Even though the church has been divided into nearly two thousand groups throughout the past two thousand years, the Bible describes eight sources of division.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Dividing on the Basis of Spiritual Giants</h2>
<p>Looking to spiritual giants is the first basis for dividing the church (1 Cor. 1:12-15; 4:6). This is not something new; it is an ancient matter which existed even in the first century. Some of the Corinthian believers who were for Paul said, &ldquo;We are of Paul; we were saved through Paul&rsquo;s gospel preaching.&rdquo; Another group said, &ldquo;We are of Apollos. We follow him because he is so good in expounding the Scriptures.&rdquo; Still another group, speaking of Peter, said, &ldquo;We are of Cephas. He is the number one apostle, so we are for him.&rdquo; This shows men in their flesh uplifting spiritual giants. Paul truly helped people to be saved, Apollos surely was good in expounding the Scriptures, and Cephas was really the leading apostle. However, for the Corinthian believers to uplift them and belong to them, and thereby to separate themselves from others was to act in their flesh; this is not allowed by God.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s Christianity, however, people actually consider this kind of division as being a glorious matter. Someone may say, &ldquo;I am a Lutheran,&rdquo; which means, &ldquo;I belong to Luther.&rdquo; Another may say, &ldquo;I am a Wesleyan. I belong to Wesley.&rdquo; We should not belong to Luther or Wesley because we consider them to be spiritual giants. Was Wesley crucified for us? Were we baptized in the name of Luther? This is what Paul asked the Corinthians when he said, &ldquo;Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?&rdquo; (1:13). Paul really knew how to speak. In chapter 3 he told the Corinthians that he belonged to them. He said, &ldquo;Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas...; all are yours&rdquo; (v. 22). The Corinthians said, &ldquo;I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ&rdquo; (1:12). Paul turned it around and challenged them, seeming to say, &ldquo;Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas&mdash;all are yours. It is not that you are ours; rather, it is that we are yours.&rdquo; Today people say, &ldquo;I am of Luther&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Wesley,&rdquo; but I believe if Luther and Wesley were alive today, they also would say, &ldquo;I, Luther, belong to you,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I, Wesley, belong to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, we should never uplift any spiritual giant. In his Epistle Paul strongly rebuked the Corinthians concerning this matter. He seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Why do you esteem me beyond what has been written in the Scriptures? You are proud, yet you use me as your ground. You highly appreciate me but look down on Apollos; this is altogether of the flesh and according to the manner of men in the world. People in the world exalt men and form parties. But these things should not be in the church. In the church only Christ is the Head, all the glory should go to Him, and all the people should belong to Him. If this was our situation, there would be no division in the church.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Dividing on the Basis of the Person<br />
Who Is the Instrumentality of Our Salvation</h2>
<p>The Scriptures also speak of dividing the church by taking the instrumentality, that is, the source, of our salvation as the one to whom we should belong. Among the children of God, many will not say that they belong to someone, but there is still a general atmosphere of paying attention to the person who preached the gospel to them or who baptized them. This is also not allowed by God (1 Cor. 3:4-8, 21-23). I believe that some of the Corinthian believers said, &ldquo;I am of Paul&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Apollos,&rdquo; because they were either saved through Paul or edified by Apollos. Since they were saved through Paul and edified by Apollos, they considered the instrumentality of their salvation or the instrumentality of their edification as a basis for their loyalty. Today many are like this. One says, &ldquo;I was saved through So-and-so and therefore I should belong to So-and-so.&rdquo; Another says, &ldquo;Because I was saved in such-and-such a denomination, I should belong to it.&rdquo; Still another says, &ldquo;Because I was perfected by such-and-such a mission, I should belong to it.&rdquo; God is not pleased with this. May we forget who led us to salvation, and may we also forget who baptized us. May we see that there is only one Christ, who is our Savior and who was crucified for us, and that we were baptized into His name and belong to Him. We should bear only the name of Jesus, and we should say, &ldquo;I am saved by Christ,&rdquo; nothing more.</p>
 <p>I can still remember hearing someone rebuking another, saying, &ldquo;Were you not saved in such-and-such a denomination? Why do you not belong to it now? You are an ungrateful person; you are a person who drinks the water but forgets its source; you are a person who forgets his origin.&rdquo; This sounds very reasonable, but who is our source? And where is our origin? Our source is Christ, and our origin is in heaven. Only a fleshly person would count those who are saved through him as his own. Only a fleshly person would require those who are saved through him to belong to his &ldquo;church.&rdquo; Dear brothers and sisters, we need to be rescued in this matter. Neither the instrumentality of salvation nor the instrumentality of edification can be the basis of where or to whom we belong. We must be &ldquo;ungrateful&rdquo; ones; we must be ones who &ldquo;forget their source,&rdquo; because God is not pleased that we belong to any person or any organization, and He is not pleased that any person or organization would bring people to himself or itself. The instruments used by God&mdash;all the Lord&rsquo;s workers, all the works, and all the missions&mdash;must turn those who are saved and edified through them over to God Himself and to His church. All those who come to work in Taipei, after saving and edifying some people, should pass them to the church in Taipei. This is the proper way. I should not keep those who were saved through me, and you should not keep those who are saved through you. Look at today&rsquo;s situation. Those who are saved through the Presbyterian Church belong to the Presbyterian Church, those who are saved through the Baptist Church belong to the Baptist Church, and those who are saved through whatever denomination belong to that same denomination. This practice, which divides the church, is absolutely condemned by God.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us! We should not belong to anyone, and we do not want anyone to belong to us. We should belong only to our Lord Christ, to God Himself, to His church on earth. In whatever place we are saved, we belong to the church in that place. After Paul saved some people in Corinth, he gave them over to the church in Corinth. After Apollos edified the saints in Corinth, he turned them over to the church in Corinth. Peter, that is, Cephas, worked in Corinth and gained fruit; afterward, he gave the fruit of his labor to the church in Corinth. These three servants, who were used greatly by God, did not set up their own &ldquo;church&rdquo; in Corinth. Rather, they all participated in the building up of the church in Corinth, the one local church in Corinth. It was the pitiful Corinthian believers who divided Paul, Apollos, and Cephas. This is exceedingly foolish. Paul absolutely did not agree with this. He told the believers in Corinth, &ldquo;You say that you belong to me, Paul; but actually I, Paul, belong to you. As an apostle and a servant of God, I am for you; I do not ask that you be for me. You are not mine; rather, I am yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to see clearly that the early apostles worked for God in different places, but they all gave the fruit of their labor to the church in that place. Those in Corinth gave their fruit to the church in Corinth, and those in Ephesus gave their fruit to the church in Ephesus. Wherever they worked, they turned their fruit over to that place. Today&rsquo;s situation is different: those who are saved are kept by those who save them. One keeps those whom he saves, and another keeps those whom he saves. When a person who belongs to a denominational church is not kept securely and joins another group, then that group is accused of sheep stealing. But where do the sheep belong? Whose sheep are they? The sheep belong to heaven; they belong to the Lord Jesus Christ. No man or organization can reckon the sheep as his own or its own. Today&rsquo;s Christianity is truly pitiful; it is so pitiful that there are even fights over souls. This is too shameful! We should never have a share in something that divides the church like this.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Dividing Because &ldquo;I Am of Christ&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The third way of dividing the church is to consider oneself as being of Christ in order to separate from others (1 Cor. 1:12-13). In the church in Corinth, there was another group of people who said, &ldquo;It is wrong for you to be of Paul, to be of Apollos, or to be of Cephas. We are not of any one of them. We are of Christ.&rdquo; Actually, it is also wrong to use Christ as a label to separate from others. The fact that we belong to Christ is right, but if we use this fact to label ourselves and separate ourselves from others, we are of the flesh. Some may say, &ldquo;You are all sectarian; you all are in denominations. I am outside of denominations; I am nondenominational and extradenominational.&rdquo; Even this kind of speaking is fleshly. It is improper to use spiritual facts to label oneself and thus separate from others. No matter how good a matter may be, it should not be used as a factor to separate from other children of God. The church absolutely should not be divided. Every division should be condemned, no matter the type or the reason.</p>
 <h2 class="head2">D. Dividing Because of<br />
Differences in Doctrinal Views</h2>
<p>The fourth kind of division is because of differences in doctrinal views. For example, the Baptist Church believes in baptism by immersion, and the Presbyterian Church believes in the administration of the church by the elders. There is nothing wrong with such beliefs. Baptism by immersion is not wrong, and the elders&rsquo; management of church affairs is not wrong either. But it is wrong to separate from others because of these beliefs. I believe that it is proper for God&rsquo;s children to be baptized by immersion, and I also admit it is right for elders to take care of the administration of the church. But it is neither right nor permissible in the Bible to separate from others because of these matters.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Doctrinal Views Not to Be Considered<br />
as the Basic Faith</h2>
<p>We must be very clear concerning this one thing: We should not consider mere doctrinal views as the fundamental Christian faith. The fundamental faith of Christians is the one faith, which we have already considered, that is, believing that God is in the Lord, the Lord is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in the Body. This series is the mystery of the universe; it is also the mystery of the union of God with man. In this mystery there is not only God nor simply man but God and man joined together as one. But how did this God enter into man? It is through the one faith. When we believe in Him and receive Him, He enters into us. Having one faith, we still need one baptism. In baptism we absolutely confess, saying, &ldquo;All that I am and all that I have should be terminated and has been terminated. I am baptized in the name of the Lord, and now I belong to the Lord. I died and have been buried with the Lord; I also have been resurrected with Him. Now He is in me as my everything, and He lives Himself out through me.&rdquo; This is the one baptism. In faith we are joined to Him, and in baptism we are terminated in Him. Furthermore, there is one hope, which is the hope that we will be in glory one day. The first four items&mdash;one God, one Lord, one Spirit, and one Body&mdash;form a group, which is the main structure. The latter three&mdash;one faith, one baptism, and one hope&mdash;form another group, a subordinate group. We can have a part in one God, one Lord, one Spirit, and one Body by one faith and one baptism. By the one faith He enters into us, and by one baptism we are terminated in Him and He lives out through us. In this way we are in one Body. Moreover, we also have one hope of entering into glory. These seven ones are the fundamental faith of a Christian; they are also the faith of our salvation. This faith is absolutely necessary. If we lack this, we are not saved. If we lack this, we do not have God. If we lack this, we do not have the Lord. If we lack this, we do not have the Spirit in us and, therefore, are not a part of the Body but are outside of the Body. However, once we have this faith, we have God, we have the Lord, we have the Spirit, and we are in the Body. This faith is common to us all; we all share this faith within. This faith is unique, and it is simple and basic.</p>
<p>However, because of our peculiar mind, we all have different views concerning many matters in the Bible. We absolutely believe that all Scripture is God-breathed, that the Bible is the Word of God, that every verse, every sentence, and every word are divinely inspired. We have no problem with this. Nevertheless, when we read the Bible, I see baptism by immersion, but another sees baptism by sprinkling. Both of us believe in the Bible, but after reading the Bible, he thanks the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for showing me that baptism by sprinkling is right,&rdquo; and I pray, &ldquo;Lord, praise and thank You for giving me the light to see that baptism by immersion is the proper way.&rdquo; We both praise the Lord, but afterward when we come together, we argue with one another. I say, &ldquo;Brother, it is really right to be baptized by immersion. When the Lord Jesus was baptized, did He not go into the Jordan River? And when Philip baptized the eunuch, did they not go into the water? If baptism was by sprinkling, why did they need to go into the water? Brother, it is very clear, and there can be no argument.&rdquo; Yet he might say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t rush! Let me talk to you. If baptism were by immersion, why doesn&rsquo;t the Bible say that the Lord was immersed in the Jordan River? Since the Bible does not say this, clearly this baptism was not immersion. In ancient times the sandals worn by the Jews were very simple and could be easily removed. After they removed their sandals, John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus went down into the river and stood in the shallow part. Then John simply sprinkled some water on the Lord Jesus and baptized Him. I also have seen a picture from an ancient time that shows the Lord Jesus being baptized by John. It shows two men standing in shallow water with John sprinkling water upon the head of Jesus. Therefore, baptism is surely by sprinkling.&rdquo; Have you seen this? In my opinion, baptism by immersion is based on the Bible. In his opinion, baptism by sprinkling is also based on the Bible. Both are sincere believers of the Bible, both quote the Bible, and both have the common faith, but on the matter of baptism there is no oneness.</p>
<p>Let me give another example concerning the matter of the Lord&rsquo;s Day and the Sabbath Day. Those who believe in the Sabbath Day fully believe in the Bible, and those who believe in the Lord&rsquo;s Day believe even more in the Bible. Both groups of people believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God and that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. They both believe that the Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in the Body. They have no problem in these matters. However, one who believes in the Lord&rsquo;s Day finds proof in the Bible and says, &ldquo;The apostles definitely commanded the believers to set aside material offerings on the first day of the week. The believers also met together to break bread on the first day of the week. Therefore, in the New Testament age the Lord&rsquo;s Day should be kept.&rdquo; But a brother who believes in keeping the Sabbath, says, &ldquo;No! Can the word of God be annulled? In the Old Testament God clearly commanded His people to keep the Sabbath. If this commandment can be annulled, then dishonoring our father and mother would be acceptable, and stealing would not be a sin. Is this sensible? How can nine out of the Ten Commandments be kept, but another one be annulled? Look at the Lord Jesus. He would go into the synagogues on the Sabbath while He was on earth. Look at the apostles in Acts. They also would go into the synagogues on the Sabbath. This shows that the Sabbath has not been annulled in the New Testament.&rdquo; Both brothers are very confident in their speaking, and they feel that they have proof from the Bible. Even though both sincerely believe in the Bible, ultimately they cannot be one.</p>
<p>Therefore, if everyone pays attention to such matters and considers them as the faith, then the church will be in a poor situation and divided into sects. Yet in today&rsquo;s Christianity this poor situation actually exists. This is because in addition to the one faith, believers consider their doctrinal views, whether right or wrong, to be a part of the faith. We absolutely must not consider doctrinal opinions as part of the basic faith. The basic faith is uniquely one, but there can be many doctrinal opinions.</p><h2 class="head3">2. To Practice Differently Based on Doctrine<br />
and to Be Divided from Others<br />
Being a Fleshly Act</h2>
<p>Human mentality is strange. In the church there are people with all sorts of strange thoughts; furthermore, they all base their thoughts on the Bible. They can find many &ldquo;doctrines&rdquo; from the Bible as grounds for their strange suggestions. When I was young, I met a group of Christians who said that the church should not love the world. Based on this conviction, they decided that any brother who came to their meetings must have his head shaved and should wear shoes made only of cloth. If someone wore leather shoes and had enough hair to be parted in the middle, they would push him out of the door. Moreover, they also decided that the sisters could not wear a long gown popular in modern China. Instead, they could wear only blouses with skirts or with long pants. If a sister was not dressed in this way, she would be accused of loving the world and would be forbidden from coming into their midst. In the beginning I was quite touched by them, but gradually I felt that this was not right. According to their decisions, a good number of Christians could no longer meet with them. This illustrates how Christians can have strange thoughts. Some people find many doctrines in the Bible and use them as a basis for dividing from others. I would like to say a strong word: All of these activities are of the flesh! The church cannot be divided. Those who do not have a shaved head can come, and those whose hair is shaved can come also. Those who wear cloth shoes can come, and those who wear leather shoes can come also. Those who wear Western style suits can come, and those who wear Chinese style clothes can come also. Everyone can come. The church absolutely cannot be divided. We should ask only whether a person has the one faith, whether he has the Spirit within, whether he has the Lord, and whether he has God; all other things should not matter.</p>
 <p>Let me give you another example. In northern China there once was a group of believers who were very zealous, who loved the Lord very much, and who were very much blessed. When they sang hymns in the meetings, they would sway their bodies and clap their hands simultaneously. Sometimes people who came into their meeting would leave after sitting for a short period of time. If one was asked why he left, he would say, &ldquo;I cannot stand the swaying.&rdquo; Sometimes one of the swaying ones would go to a place that had quiet meetings, and he would leave after sitting for less than five minutes. If he was asked why he left, he would say, &ldquo;I cannot bear it. The meeting is too rigid and quiet.&rdquo; What should we do? Do the swaying brothers have the one faith? They do. Do the quiet brothers have the one faith? They do as well. However, because of insignificant matters such as swaying and being quiet, these groups of brothers cannot be one, even though they have the one faith. Should these matters be counted as the faith? Should these matters be used as a basis for being one or for being divided? Absolutely not! These things are altogether human opinions, human views. If we use such things as a basis for doing something unconventional and unorthodox, and thereby separate ourselves from others, this is a fleshly act which is absolutely not pleasing to God. In Galatians 5:20 the Greek word for <em>sects</em>means &ldquo;heresies,&rdquo; referring to schools of opinion. This means that people use doctrines or opinions to form sects; that is, they divide from others because of different practices based on a certain doctrine. Verse 19 says that sects are a work of the flesh, an action by the flesh; hence, it is condemned by God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Scriptures Requiring Us<br />
to Receive Those Who Eat Only Vegetables<br />
and Those Who Observe Days</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, even such matters as eating only vegetables and observing days must not be used as a basis for dividing the church. Romans 14:1-6 shows that it is all right to eat vegetables and to observe days, and that it is also all right to not eat vegetables and to not observe days. He who eats and he who observes, eats and observes to the Lord. Likewise, he who does not eat and he who does not observe, does not eat and does not observe to the Lord. He who eats and he who observes should not despise him who does not eat and him who does not observe. Likewise, he who does not eat and he who does not observe should not judge him who eats and him who observes. The former should not reject the latter, nor should the latter refuse the former, because both the former and the latter have been received by the Lord. We all have been received by the Lord, so we should receive one another. We should not say that we cannot take it, nor should we say that we cannot bear it. We need to bear it even if it is unbearable, unless we do not want to be Christians. If we want to be Christians, we cannot avoid meeting some peculiar brothers. But no matter how peculiar a brother may be, we still need to bear him and cannot be separated from him.</p>
<p>The church really is a mystery; it is a great matter. Countless numbers of peculiar people have been saved throughout the ages, and they are all our brothers and sisters. They all belong to the church. We need to receive them, and we cannot be divided from them. Even those who preach the word have idiosyncrasies. Some of the preachers stand straight&mdash;even perfectly straight&mdash;when they preach, without moving their body at all. But they are full of power to move people. Many people admire preachers who are so dignified and proper, considering them to be true servants of God. But other preachers leap and jump and cry and shout when they preach. Once I saw a brother preaching the gospel, and it was truly &ldquo;exciting.&rdquo; While he was preaching, he would jump around on the platform and then suddenly jump off the platform. That was truly difficult for me to take. Nonetheless, hundreds and thousands were saved through him. What can we say? Our God is so great and so mysterious that we simply cannot limit Him. Perhaps we prefer preachers who behave properly. When we see a man with well-mannered preaching, we may praise him highly, thinking that this kind of behavior is befitting to a servant of God. If we see someone leaping and jumping while preaching, we might say that he is crazy and does not look like a servant of God. Therefore, we may not listen to his preaching. However, those who prefer action may approve of him, saying that this kind of preaching can stir up people and touch their feelings. For them, well-mannered preaching is rigid and dead, and it instantly puts people to sleep. Therefore, it is intolerable. Nevertheless, all of these things should be tolerable to us. We all need to be broken. We must remember that the oneness of the church needs only the one faith. Having one God, one Lord, one Spirit, and one Body is sufficient. We cannot make other demands on our brothers. A brother may jump and swing, but does he not have God? Does he not have the Lord? Does he not have the Spirit? Is he not a member of the Body? He has God, the Lord, and the Spirit! And he is a member of the Body! We must acknowledge that he is a brother. We need to bear the cross; there is nothing else that matters. In like manner, there is no problem in being well-mannered and quiet; one should not be condemned for being &ldquo;deadened.&rdquo; We all need forbearance with one another.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Scriptures Allowing Us to Have<br />
Doctrinal Differences but Not Permitting Us to Be Sectarian, Divisive, because of Such Differences</h2>
<p>Many of the divisions of the church exist only because of different views that the believers have concerning the truth. Certainly, the truth is absolute, but the Scriptures allow for different doctrinal views. However, the Scriptures absolutely do not permit us to divide over our different doctrinal views. First Corinthians 1:10-13 and Titus 3:10 show that to be sectarian, to be divisive, is absolutely condemned by the Bible. The Bible allows us to keep this day or to keep that day, but the Bible does not permit us to divide over our different concepts concerning the keeping of days. We may have a different view concerning the truth, but we cannot be divided from others because of our view. We must bear with those whose views are different from ours. Even if we feel that it is proper to be baptized by immersion and to be quiet, we should bear with those who are for sprinkling and swaying. The church should not be divided because of these things. These things are not the basic faith; these are simply our views concerning the truth. To be the children of God, to keep the oneness of the church, we need to tolerate these things. Our heart should be enlarged; it has to be as large as the heart of God. God does not require us to have the same doctrinal concepts; God requires us only to have the one faith. What we do is acceptable, whether it is done one way or another way, as long as we have the one faith. This is the oneness of the church. We should never divide from others over doctrines. The Bible absolutely does not permit us to be divided because of doctrines, even the best doctrines.</p>
<p>Of course, this does not mean that there is not an accurate understanding regarding a particular matter. There is an accurate understanding of the truth regarding baptism, regarding the Lord&rsquo;s Day, and even regarding all other matters. Concerning these matters, the apostles have given us complete and precise teachings. But while they were accurate and serious in teaching, they were tolerant and broad in attitude and practice, not requiring uniformity. On these matters, even when the believers practiced differently from what the apostles taught, the apostles said they must be allowed to practice in their way. But the apostles absolutely would not allow for the formation of sects and divisions related to these matters. They absolutely insisted that the church could not be divided. Today we also must insist on this matter. Truth involves accuracy, but many different views concerning the truth must be tolerated. There should not be any division because of different views regarding the truth. We absolutely must avoid division. The church is a undividable entity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Dividing Because of Racial Differences</h2>
<p>There are also divisions because of racial differences. In 1 Corinthians 12:13 the apostle says, &ldquo;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks...&rdquo; According to their natural life, these two races cannot be one. The Greeks absolutely could not be one with the Jews, and the Jews considered Gentiles as swine and dogs. The differences between them were very serious. But once they came into the church, they could not be divided because of these differences. Today we should not be divided into a white church, a black church, or a yellow church. These divisions are unacceptable. In Christ, these distinctions in the flesh have been annulled. Of course, when different races of people meet together in a church, they have different backgrounds, customs, dispositions, languages, and thoughts and concepts. This is not an easy matter; this is a severe test for people. Nevertheless, the Lord does not permit division. Even divisions because of racial differences are not acceptable.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Dividing Because of Differences in Nationality</h2>
<p>Another great source of division is related to differences in nationalities. The Episcopalian Church in England is called the Anglican Church, the Church of England. There is also a Chinese Christian Church in China. These are examples of divisions according to nationalities. Divisions by races are not permitted by the Lord, and divisions by nationalities also are not permitted. They are unacceptable (1 Cor. 12:13). This is of the world and of man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Dividing Because of Differences in Social Rank</h2>
<p>Another unacceptable basis for division is divisions that come from differences in social rank (1 Cor. 12:13). In the church, both slaves and freemen are brothers and should not be divided. In the early days, slaves had no position in society and no protection of the law. A master, once he bought a slave, could kill the slave at will and not be held accountable before the law. Therefore, distinctions in status were very great. But in the church there can be no such distinctions. In the church there are no distinctions based on social rank. We cannot associate only with highly educated ones because we are highly educated. We cannot do this. It is a beautiful thing when one who is highly educated can sit together with an illiterate brother. The life of Christ is in both; hence, there should be no distinctions of social ranks.</p>
<p>Over twenty years ago in Shanghai there was a &ldquo;church of the rickshaw pullers,&rdquo; a &ldquo;church&rdquo; for those who pulled rickshaws. All the rickshaw pullers who were saved worshipped there. This is really wrong. There is no such distinction in the church. Those who ride the rickshaws and those who pull the rickshaws are brothers alike; hence, it is wrong to be divided because of social rank.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Dividing Because of <br />
Spiritual Weakness or Mistakes</h2>
<p>The last kind of division is division because of certain spiritual weaknesses or mistakes. This also is wrong. Of the seven epistles written to the churches in chapters 2 and 3 of the book of Revelation, at least five of them contain rebukes regarding mistakes and weaknesses of the churches, but the Lord did not tell the believers to leave these churches. Rather, the Lord called for overcomers in the churches who would supply and help others so that the churches would be revived.</p>
<p>In summary, there is no basis in the entire New Testament for anyone to divide the church. The church should not be divided. These things should not be only doctrines to us. We need to consider whether or not we have a situation that causes us to be divided from the children of God. God&rsquo;s children have been divided, and while we do not bear the responsibility for this, we must ask, Is there a divisive situation among us? Do we have opinions or proposals which cause us to be separated from others? We must remember that any reason for division is wrong. We cannot justify any division. We should condemn all divisions among the children of God. We need to realize that it is sufficient for a person, through one faith and one baptism, to be joined to the Lord and God, and to be part of the church, which is the one Body, by the Spirit. We do not need anything more than this, but anything less than this is insufficient. If we have this, we have the oneness of the church and are in the oneness of the church. All that we require is the oneness of the church. With the oneness of the church, we should let go of all our differences; we should not let any difference be a reason for division. May the Lord give us grace!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>We now will look at the fellowship of the church. The fellowship of the church is a great matter in the Bible and something that we hear people speak of frequently. Fellowship can mean many things, such as mutual dealings, mutual supply, mutual prayer, and mutual love; however, these things do not fully express the meaning of fellowship. What is the real meaning of fellowship? We can temporarily use a term related to electricity to illustrate this matter and make its meaning more understandable. Fellowship is a mutual flow. The electricity in light bulbs flows continuously. Before I finish my sentence, the electricity in one bulb has gone into another bulb and the electricity in that bulb has gone into another bulb. The electricity in these light bulbs flows unceasingly. In like manner, the Spirit, who is the life and the Lord within (these three are one&mdash;the Lord is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the life), flows without interruption in all of us who are saved. Furthermore, this flow is mutual; it flows from me to you, from you to him, from him to yet another, and then back to me. This is spiritual fellowship, and this is the flow of the life in the Lord. This is the true meaning of fellowship.</p>
<p>In reality, this fellowship, this flow, is the Lord within us. The Lord within us is this fellowship. With light bulbs, the flow among them is the electricity in them. In like manner, the fellowship among the saints is the issue of the Lord within them. Whenever we allow the Lord to operate in us, we will definitely want to fellowship with the brothers and sisters. However, if we do not pray for three days, do not allow the Lord to flow in us, and do not allow Him to operate in us, then we certainly will not want to fellowship with the brothers and sisters. Once our fellowship with the Lord is broken, we try to avoid the brothers and sisters when we see them. When we see the brothers and sisters coming toward us, we turn away to avoid them. If this is our case, the fellowship is not in us. Actually, it is not that there is no fellowship but only that the fellowship has stopped, since we are not letting the Lord flow. If we are in fellowship with the Lord and the Lord is flowing in us, when we see the brothers and sisters, we want to shake their hands and speak a word with them. Sometimes as two people are shaking hands, their spirits seem to connect and there truly is a flow. This flow is the Lord Himself; it is the flow of the Lord among us. This is an exceedingly marvelous thing among Christians. If there are some unsaved friends among us, I believe that they will not be able to understand the meaning of this. Whenever Christians meet, there is a resonance within; this is because we have a living Lord within us. This is the mystery of Christians and the mystery of the church as well. Within Christians the living Lord is flowing. This flowing is the fellowship of the church, and it is based upon the Lord&rsquo;s life within Christians.</p>
<p>In our body, blood flows; this flow of blood is called circulation. This circulation is very fast and courses continuously through our body. In like manner, the life within Christians is circulating and flowing continuously among us. This life is not with only one individual Christian, but it is common to all Christians. The life that is flowing among Christians is the fellowship of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. ACCORDING TO THE REALITY OF ONENESS</h2>
<p>Since the fellowship of the church is based upon the life in the Christians, it is based also upon the reality of the oneness in us. The reality of our oneness has four main factors: one God, one Lord, one Spirit, and one Body (Eph. 4:3-6). Why do we have fellowship? We have fellowship because we are all in one Body. In this one Body there is one Spirit, in this one Spirit there is one Lord, and in this one Lord there is one God. Because these are all one, there is a unique oneness and also one fellowship. This oneness is the oneness of the church, and this fellowship is the fellowship of the church.</p>
 <p>The oneness of the church is not the same as the oneness of the Triune God, a oneness which is inseparable and complete, but it is a oneness with the Triune God (John 17:21-23). Such a oneness is the basis of the fellowship of the church. Because there is such a oneness, there is the fellowship of the church. The fellowship of the church arises from this oneness, and it is based upon this oneness. This oneness is not merely a uniting together of all Christians into one entity but also the mingling of all the Christians with the Triune God into one entity. This great oneness in the universe is a mysterious oneness, the oneness of God mingled with man. Because of the reality of this oneness, fellowship is produced.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. BEING A FELLOWSHIP OF ONENESS,<br />
NOT A FELLOWSHIP OF BEING DIVIDED YET UNITED NOR A FELLOWSHIP OF BEING INDEPENDENT<br />
YET IN MUTUAL CONTACT</h2>
<p>The fellowship of the church is the fellowship of oneness; it is not a fellowship of being divided yet united. However, the general condition among the Christians today is that they are completely divided into this &ldquo;church,&rdquo; that &ldquo;church,&rdquo; and numerous other &ldquo;churches,&rdquo; all of which are firmly entrenched. However, on certain occasions they all come together and say, &ldquo;Because we are all in the Lord, we should be in unity. Come, let us be united.&rdquo; In this way things such as a so-called &ldquo;federation&rdquo; of Christian churches are produced.</p>
<p>Approximately thirty years ago an old pastor and I talked about the church being divided. He said, &ldquo;It is better for the church to be divided. If there were no divisions, if there was only one church in our locality, then there would be only one lampstand, which would not have enough light to illuminate even the street or alley where it is located. I think that it is the good intention of the Lord for His children to have differences in opinion and to be divided into many groups so that there can be many &lsquo;churches.&rsquo; Does this not increase the number of lampstands?&rdquo; Then he asked me, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you seen that we have thirteen lampstands in this locality?&rdquo; He was referring to the fact that there were thirteen denominational churches in the city. He went on to say, &ldquo;This is the great wisdom of God to rapidly spread the church. The more the church is divided, the more she spreads. In this way, there will be lamps on all the streets and alleys, and the lamps will increase in number. Isn&rsquo;t this wonderful?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Wrong! This is absolutely wrong! According to the Bible, the church is one. In a locality the church should not be divided into many small lamps; rather, the church should be one great lampstand shining over the entire city. In this way the church will be powerful, spiritual, and heavenly.&rdquo; Furthermore, I said, &ldquo;Consider the moon. Is it divided into many moons? When the moon appears, it illuminates the whole earth. It does not need to be divided to shine over the whole earth. In like manner, a church does not need to be divided in order for it to shine in a locality, and it should not be divided.&rdquo; Although I said this, he did not agree and said that I was prejudiced.</p>
<p>Later he said very happily to me, &ldquo;Your view has now been realized. We are now united together. I recently attended a united meeting of the churches in the city.&rdquo; When I heard this, I asked him, &ldquo;Pastor, why do you need to be united and joined together? Does this not prove that you were divided?&rdquo; He did not like to hear me say this, but he could not argue with the fact. He said, &ldquo;Oh, didn&rsquo;t I tell you that it is also good to be divided? Actually, we were not divided. Look, aren&rsquo;t we now united?&rdquo; I then asked him, &ldquo;Are you truly united? Are you truly joined together? If you are truly united, then you would not divide again. You recently had a united meeting, but now that it is over, everyone is returning to his own church, just as divided as before. Isn&rsquo;t it paradoxical that you are divided yet united and united yet divided?&rdquo;</p>
<p>O brothers and sisters, please remember that this is not the fellowship of the church spoken of in the Bible. The fellowship of the church spoken of in the Bible is a fellowship in oneness with no divisions; it is only one. Acts 2:42 says that at the time of Pentecost, the multitude of believers &ldquo;continued steadfastly in the...fellowship of the apostles.&rdquo; The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship of the church. The fellowship in which they continued steadfastly was a fellowship that was completely one, not a divided-yet-united fellowship like the unity practiced in Christianity today. All of the unity in today&rsquo;s Christianity is an abnormal condition. It is a halfway method used by man to amend unacceptable divisions in the church. The fact that the church is divided is already a great mistake. Using this method of unity to amend the divisions is not an approved means according to the Bible. The Bible says that the church is absolutely one, that it cannot be divided, and that it does not need to be reunited. Division is absolutely not allowed in the Bible. To be divided and then united, to be united yet still remain divided, to be divided and united at the same time, is absolutely disapproved in the Bible.</p>
 <p>In addition, the fellowship of the church is not a fellowship of being independent but still having mutual contact. I saw this also when I was young. There were approximately fifteen pastors of different denominations who took turns sharing their pulpits. This week one would go and preach in another&rsquo;s chapel, and the next week another would preach in a different chapel. Thus, they could say, &ldquo;Look, we are in contact and fellowship with one another.&rdquo; This kind of situation exists in today&rsquo;s Christianity. A pastor may be invited to preach in a church service, and in turn, another pastor may be invited to lead a conference. Then everyone can say, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we loving one other? Aren&rsquo;t we having fellowship?&rdquo; Yes, there is a little fellowship; we dare not say absolutely that this is not fellowship. However, we must see that we need to be thorough and absolute in everything. One is one, and two is two. If we would fellowship, we should be one; if we would be one, we should not be divided. We cannot establish our own sect while maintaining some contact with one another, nor can we maintain some contact with one another and still seek to establish our own sect. This is a halfway method; it is black yet white, white yet black.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, the church can be compared to a large family system in China that is absolutely not divisible. No matter how many generations are living together, regardless of how they quarrel and contend, they cannot separate. However, today&rsquo;s Christianity is somewhat like the small family system of the Western world in which the members separate from each other whenever there is a little difference. Although there is much contention and much division, outwardly they appear polite and still maintain contact with one another. This is not the fellowship of the church. The fellowship of the church is absolutely in oneness with no division; it is one without having the need of being united.</p>
<p>Today there are too many sects, divisions, each of which is doing its own thing. Christians all know that it is wrong, that it should not be this way, and that it is shameful even to discuss it, yet they are unwilling to give up their own things (Phil. 2:21). Instead, they maintain some contact with one another as a way of compromise, a way of disguise. To a certain degree, this involves the bribing of the conscience. The Lord&rsquo;s Word tells us that the church is one, that it cannot be divided, and that there is no reason for division. Once we speak of the fellowship of the church, there must be the absolute oneness. We cannot deal with the situation in a perfunctory manner by applying merely a limited amount of mutual contact as an outward gesture. In order to speak concerning the fellowship of the church, we must thoroughly deal with division and sectarianism, thoroughly rejecting all divisions and sects. If we cannot reject divisions, then strictly speaking, the fellowship of the church is already damaged. Even if we could have some fellowship, it would not be sufficient to be called the fellowship of the church. The fellowship of the church must be thorough and without any division.</p><h2 class="head1">III. BEING THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BODY,<br />
NOT THE FELLOWSHIP OF A &ldquo;LOCALITY&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Although the fellowship of the church is manifested in every locality among Christians, it should not be of a local nature; rather, it should be universal. It should not be only a &ldquo;local&rdquo; fellowship; it must also be the fellowship of the Body. It is not sufficient for us to be in one accord without sects or divisions in a locality. Simply because we have fellowship among ourselves in this locality does not mean that we do not need to care for the brothers in other localities. If this were the case, then we are only a &ldquo;local sect.&rdquo; Therefore, we must extend our local fellowship to the whole Body of Christ, which is the universal church.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 10:16-17 says, &ldquo;The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ? Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body.&rdquo; This shows that the bread we break at the Lord&rsquo;s table denotes the fellowship of the church, the Body. This bread includes everyone who belongs to Christ and who has the life of Christ throughout the ages and in every place; it does not merely include those who are saved in a particular locality. If it only included the saved ones in a locality, then the bread would denote only a local fellowship. This kind of fellowship is not according to the Bible. Our fellowship must include all those who belong to Christ and who have the life of Christ throughout the ages and in every place. Only then does the bread denote the fellowship of the church, the Body of Christ. This is the fellowship ordained in the Scriptures. According to the Bible, every local church in its respective locality is a representative of the entire Body of Christ. Therefore, the fellowship in every local church should be not only local but also of the Body. Only the fellowship that is both local and also of the Body is the fellowship of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. BEING OF LIFE</h2>
<p>In the beginning we said that the fellowship of the church is the flow of the Lord&rsquo;s life in all the Christians. Therefore, the fellowship of the church comes out of the Lord&rsquo;s life (1 John 1:2-3). Because the Lord gave all of us His life, the fellowship of the church is within all of us. When we live in the Lord&rsquo;s life, we are living in the fellowship of the church. The more we live in the Lord&rsquo;s life, the more the fellowship of the church becomes manifested through us. This is altogether a matter of life and not a matter of any method or regulation. Therefore, as the fellowship of the church comes out of the Lord&rsquo;s life, it should take the Lord&rsquo;s life as its basis, instead of any practice or regulation as its guideline.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. BEING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>This fellowship of the church not only comes out of the life of the Lord, it is also of the Holy Spirit of God (2 Cor. 13:14). Furthermore, the Holy Spirit is this fellowship. Wherever the Holy Spirit is, there is fellowship. Wherever the Holy Spirit can freely operate, this fellowship is manifested (Phil. 2:1). When the saints walk according to the Holy Spirit and live in the Holy Spirit, spontaneously there is fellowship. Therefore, the obstacle to fellowship is man&rsquo;s flesh and self. If we are willing to deal with our flesh and our self, then we will spontaneously live in the fellowship of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. CONDITIONS FOR BEING<br />
REMOVED FROM THE FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Having the Sin Spoken of in 1 Corinthians 5</h2>
<p>Concerning the fellowship of the church, a few points need to be made concerning the conditions by which a saint should be removed from the fellowship of the church. The Bible tells us that some saints should not remain in the fellowship of the church and must be removed from this fellowship. There are two categories related to such ones. One category includes saints who have committed obvious sins. They sin to such an extent that they are filthy and put the Lord&rsquo;s name to shame, like the case spoken of in 1 Corinthians 5. Thus, the church has no recourse but to cast them out, that is, to remove them from the fellowship of the church. Therefore, the sin spoken of in 1 Corinthian 5 is the first condition for a saint to be removed from the fellowship of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Going beyond the Teaching of Christ</h2>
<p>Another category of people who should be removed from the fellowship of the church includes those who go beyond the teaching of Christ. These people are like those in today&rsquo;s unbelieving sects, the so-called modernists. They are Christians in name, who have mixed themselves among Christians, but who do not believe that Christ is God, that Christ is the Word who became flesh, that Christ died shedding His blood to redeem us from sin, or that Christ resurrected from the dead. They do not believe in the deity of Christ or the redemptive work of Christ. This kind of unbelief goes beyond the teaching of Christ; it is heresy to the uttermost. The Bible tells us not to have any dealings with them, not even to greet them, because they are antichrists (2 John 7-11). Hence, the church cannot have fellowship with such persons. Going beyond the teaching of Christ is a condition for being removed from the fellowship of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Any Other Failure, Weakness, Mistake,<br />
or Wrong Doctrinal View<br />
Not Being Sufficient to Constitute<br />
a Condition for Being Removed</h2>
<p>The two conditions above are the only ones for which a person should be removed from the fellowship of the church. One is for committing a sin which is dreadfully filthy and that shames the name of the Lord; the other is for going beyond the teaching of Christ. Only these two categories can cause a person to lose the fellowship of the church and be removed by the church. Other than these two categories, all other failures, weaknesses, mistakes, or wrong doctrinal views cannot constitute a condition for being removed from the fellowship of the church.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians, although the apostle definitely told the church in Corinth to remove the person who committed the sin described in chapter 5, he did not tell them to remove those who were sectarian (1:11-12; 3:1-4), the one who went to law against another brother (6:1-8), or those who did not believe in the resurrection of the dead (15:12). These persons committed very serious mistakes, but the apostle did not say that they should be removed from the church. The apostle only admonished, taught, and corrected these persons. Therefore, we can see that other than sin which openly shames the name of the Lord and beliefs that offend the person and work of the Lord, we must have forbearance for all other failures, weaknesses, mistakes, and wrong doctrinal views. If some brothers or sisters have weaknesses in their behavior or hold wrong doctrinal views, we cannot remove them for such a reason; rather, we must forebear, admonish, and correct them in love. The fellowship of the church is a tremendous thing. We must endeavor to forebear to the uttermost, not removing someone quickly for a little mistake or for being a little different. That is not right.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. BASED UPON THE FELLOWSHIP IN ONENESS</h2>
<p>Since we have looked at the oneness of the church and the fellowship of the church, we now need to look at the ground of the church. What is the ground of the church? Many people have been saved and have formed a church, but on what ground should the church stand? What ground should the church take? According to the Bible, the ground of the church is based on the fellowship of the church in oneness. The fellowship of the church in oneness is the ground of the church. When all those who have been saved come together, not having any division but being fully in oneness and fellowshipping in mutuality, then this oneness, this fellowship, is the ground of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. To Lose the Oneness, the Fellowship,<br />
of the Church Being to Lose<br />
the Ground of the Church</h2>
<p>Therefore, to lose the oneness, the fellowship, of the church is to lose the ground of the church. Please consider, if the oneness of the church is lost, would the ground of the church still exist? The sects and denominations today have lost the oneness of the church with their divisive condition and have also lost the ground of the church. Logically, all Christians in the city of Taipei should be one. This oneness enables all to have mutual fellowship, and it is this fellowship in oneness that is the ground of the church in Taipei. However, this is not today&rsquo;s situation. Rather, today&rsquo;s situation involves division into numerous sects and denominations. Because of division, the oneness of the church and the fellowship of this oneness have been lost. Hence, the ground of the church is gone. Many denominations today have their respective ground, but none of them are the ground of the church; rather, their ground is the ground of a sect or denomination. The ground of the church was originally based upon the church&rsquo;s one fellowship, which is not divided. But what is the situation today? The oneness has been damaged, and the fellowship in oneness has been lost; many sects and denominations have arisen with each standing on a different ground. The Baptist denomination has its ground, the Presbyterian denomination has its ground, the Lutheran denomination has its ground, and the Holiness denomination has its ground. Each denomination has its own ground, but none of them is the ground of the church. There is only one ground for the church, and that is the fellowship of the church in oneness. There is only one church, and the fellowship of the church is one. The church is one, and the fellowship of the church is also one. Only the fellowship of the church that is according to this oneness is the ground of the church. Once the oneness of the church has been damaged, the oneness of the fellowship of the church has been lost, and the ground of the church has also been lost.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Any Ground outside of<br />
the Fellowship in Oneness Not Being<br />
the Ground of the Church</h2>
<p>As the ground of the church is based upon the fellowship of the church in oneness, any ground outside of this fellowship in oneness is not the ground of the church. This is natural. Any ground that is not based on the fellowship of the church in oneness, but rather on an interpretation of the truth or on a method of administration or on anything else, cannot be regarded as the ground of the church. Consequently, the ground of today&rsquo;s sects and denominations is not the ground of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE FELLOWSHIP OF ONENESS BEING UNIVERSAL<br />
BUT EXPRESSED IN LOCALITIES</h2>
<p>This fellowship of the church in oneness is universal, but it is manifested in every locality. This is the same as the church itself. There is only one church in the universe, but in time and in space it is manifested in locality after locality. In like manner, the fellowship of the church in oneness is universal, yet it is expressed in locality after locality.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. In Every Locality There Being<br />
Only One Fellowship, One Ground</h2>
<p>Therefore, the church in every locality should have only one fellowship and one ground. This should be the case in London, New York, and Taipei. Regardless of the locality, the church should have only one fellowship, one ground. I believe that this is easily understood not only by Christians but also by unbelievers. On many occasions when I was preaching to those who were hearing the gospel for the first time, they would ask a question which I could not answer. They asked, &ldquo;Do Christians preach the same one Jesus?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Of course, He is the same.&rdquo; Then they asked, &ldquo;Do the Presbyterians preach one Jesus and the Baptists preach another Jesus?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;We all preach the same Jesus.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;Since the same Jesus is being preached, why are Christians divided into so many denominations?&rdquo; When they asked me this, I had no word as an answer. Therefore, even unbelievers know that the divided situation in Christianity is wrong. Today in Taipei it almost seems as if there is a &ldquo;church&rdquo; every few feet. As a result, the ground of the church is altogether in a state of confusion.</p>
<p>In the early days, regardless of the locality, there was only one church. In Jerusalem there was one church (Acts 8:1), in Antioch there was one church (13:1), and in Corinth there was one church (1 Cor. 1:2). In every place there was only one church (Rev. 1:11). Even in places such as Jerusalem and Corinth, where the cities were large and the believers many (Acts 21:17-21; 18:8-10), the church was still one. In addition, since the number of believers was large in Jerusalem, they met in many houses (2:46), but they were still one church; they were not divided into many churches. This is because in one locality there can be only one church, just as there can be only one church in the universe. Since the church in the universe is not divided, the church in each locality should not be divided. Therefore, in one locality there should be only one church and there should be only one fellowship of the church and one ground of the church.</p>
<p>Every saved person with proper reasoning would acknowledge that since all believers are members of the church, there should be only one ground, there should be only one fellowship, and there should be only one church. This is the proper way. But what is the situation today? Incredibly, in one locality there are so many churches! There are so many grounds! There are so many fellowships! This situation is not only one of separation, of division, but also of confusion. This is exceedingly wrong. Every saved person must condemn such a mistake! He must hate this division and oppose this confusion! We must all desire the oneness of the church. God&rsquo;s desire is for the church to be in oneness, and we must also desire that the church be in oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Fellowship in Each Locality<br />
Needing Also to Be Universal</h2>
<p>Although the fellowship of the church in oneness is manifested in each locality respectively, it is not of a local nature but of a universal nature; it is a fellowship that includes all the believers on the whole earth. If the fellowship of Christians in a certain locality is independent and of a local nature, it is a local sect. This should not be the case. The fellowship of the church has a universal nature even though it is local. Only in this way is it truly the fellowship of the church, and only this kind of fellowship of the church is the ground of the church. Therefore, the ground of the church is the local expression of the church&rsquo;s universal fellowship in oneness. Although this fellowship is expressed in a locality, it is universal in nature; it is one locally and one universally as well. This universal fellowship in oneness, which is expressed in a locality, is the ground of the church. Speaking simply, the ground of the church is the manifestation of the church&rsquo;s universal oneness in a locality. To say it more simply, the ground of the church is the oneness of the church. Whenever we are divided, we have lost the oneness of the church, and we have lost the ground of the church. Whether our division involves a split from the local church or a split from the universal church, both cause us to lose the ground of the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE MATTER OF SECTS</h1>
<p>Now we need to look at the matter of sects. If we want to have a thorough knowledge concerning the ground of the church, we also must have a clear understanding of the matter of sects. This is a matter that is very closely related to the ground of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE</h2>
<p>In considering the matter of sects, we need to start with God&rsquo;s desire. If we carefully read through the New Testament under God&rsquo;s enlightening, we will clearly see that the eternal desire of God in the universe is to gain a church among men who have God Himself and thereby become a place for His dwelling and a means for His expression. Using words that are understandable to us, we can say that God wants to gain a church to be His Body. A person dwells in his body and expresses himself through his body. For instance, while I stand and speak a message, I am dwelling in my body, and I am also expressing myself through my body. In like manner, the Triune God also dwells in His Body in the universe and expresses Himself through His Body. This Body is the church which He has chosen and regenerated. He selected a group of people out of the descendants of Adam, out of thousands upon thousands of people, from the east and from the west, from every tribe, tongue, people, and nation. In the Son and the Spirit, He entered into these chosen ones and regenerated them to make them His Body for His expression in the universe.</p>
<p>Let me use electricity again as an illustration. Electricity is invisible. But the light bulbs allow electricity to flow through and thereby shine forth light. Hence, electricity is manifested. Figuratively speaking, we may say that the light bulbs collectively are the body of electricity. Electricity dwells in the light bulbs, and the light bulbs become the expression of electricity. When we see these light bulbs, we see electricity shining forth and being expressed. In like manner, God wants to gain a church in the universe. His intention is for the church to be His Body as a corporate vessel to express Him. At the conclusion of the Bible, we see this corporate vessel consummated, expressed, as the New Jerusalem. In this city, through this corporate vessel, God is able to completely express Himself.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to gain a church in the universe, represented by the New Jerusalem, as a corporate vessel to express Himself. God accomplishes His eternal purpose by coming into time, especially in the New Testament age, and by going to various localities through His Spirit to raise up groups of people who believe in His Son and to build these people into local churches. In Jerusalem He built a local church, and also at Antioch He built a local church. He went to Ephesus and built a local church there, and He also built a local church in Corinth. In the New Testament age God is building up local churches. The universal church may be likened to a hen, and a local church may be likened to a chick. Every local church is a miniature of the universal church. Although a local church is small in size, it is exactly the same as the universal church in nature and principle. God wants every local church to be a miniature and a representation of His universal church so that in various places He may have a vessel to express Himself.</p>
<p>Look at the early churches. Every church was like this, whether it was the church in Jerusalem, the church in Antioch, or a church in another place. Every local church was a miniature representing the universal church, expressing Christ and God, in that place and at that time. This is what God wants to do in the New Testament age. Anyone who knows the Scriptures cannot deny this matter. This is God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire and God&rsquo;s purpose. God saves sinners in order to gain people as material for the building of the local churches. God edifies the saints in order to build the saved ones into the church.</p>
<p>We have all seen how people build a stone house. First they hew stones from the mountain and transport them to the site to prepare them as materials for building. Then the craftsman comes and deals severely with the stones, getting rid of all the corners and rough spots which cannot be joined with other stones. If any stone still cannot be used, the craftsman will knock off some more here and there so that it can be built to become part of the house. In like manner, God first saves people through the gospel and brings them into the church as material for the building up of the church; then He edifies the saints to build them up as His dwelling place. The Bible says that we are living stones, being built up into a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5). For God to build us, He also needs to edify us and deal with us with a severe hand until we can be built. In the New Testament age God is doing this work of building in every place with the result that He gains a church in each locality to be His dwelling place for His rest and to be the Body of Christ for the expression of Christ. This is God&rsquo;s intention on earth; this is what God wants to do today. This is very clear in the New Testament; everyone who knows the Scriptures would acknowledge this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE DIVISION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>However, the Bible also shows that Satan is not happy and intends to spoil God&rsquo;s work. This can be confirmed by church history. God wants to build up the church in one locality after another; therefore, Satan comes to destroy and divide the church in one locality after another. What we see today is not the church in oneness but Christianity in division. There are so many sects and denominations. In the early days were there this many sects and denominations in Jerusalem? If we could ask Peter, &ldquo;Where is the Episcopalian Church? Where is the Seventh-day Adventist Church? Where is the Presbyterian Church? Where is the Lutheran Church?&rdquo; Peter would say, &ldquo;Where did these &lsquo;churches&rsquo; come from? There are no such &lsquo;churches&rsquo; in Jerusalem. In Jerusalem we have only the church of Christ Jesus.&rdquo; There were a multitude of saved ones in Jerusalem&mdash;three thousand were saved in one day, another five thousand were saved in another day, and many more were being saved continually. There might have been thousands upon thousands of people who were saved. Nevertheless, the only church in Jerusalem was &ldquo;the church which was in Jerusalem,&rdquo; which is spoken of in Acts 8:1 in the singular. This proves that in the early days there was only one church in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Just as there was only one church in Jerusalem, there was also only one church in Antioch, there was also only one church in Ephesus, and even though the believers were divided into four parties in Corinth, there was also only one church in Corinth. In 1 Corinthians 1:2 Paul addressed them as &ldquo;the church...in Corinth,&rdquo; which is still singular in number; it was still one church. Therefore, the Scriptures show one locality with one church. Every church in a locality is a representation of the Body of Christ in that locality which expresses Christ in that locality. Today&rsquo;s situation, however, is confused. Whenever the church is spoken of, people ask, &ldquo;To what church do you belong?&rdquo; The church has been divided. Today on the earth the church we see is no longer in oneness. Instead, the church is divided, and it has been divided beyond recognition!</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DIVISION</h2>
<p>Of course, everyone has to admit that the situation of the division in the church today is absolutely wrong. But we need to ask, &ldquo;Who is responsible for this division?&rdquo; Among the many sects and denominations, who should bear the responsibility of division? Which one is wrong? Which one is right? How do we determine this?</p>
<p>I would use an illustration which perhaps will make this matter clearer. A school requires students to assemble at the gymnasium. The gymnasium is the place for them to meet and the right ground for their assembly. But when the time of assembly comes, a group of students gathers in the dormitory, another group gathers in a classroom, a third group gathers in the auditorium, and a fourth group gathers in the dining hall. Thus, they are separated and divided. The remaining students, perhaps only a small number, meet at the gymnasium according to the school&rsquo;s regulation. Apparently, this small group of students is divided from all the other students. Originally, all of them should be together, but now they are divided: some are in the dormitory, some are in the classroom, some are in the auditorium, some are in the dining hall, and the remaining ones are in the gymnasium. They are definitely divided. But who should bear the responsibility for this division? Should the group of students assembling in the gymnasium bear the responsibility for this division? They should not bear this responsibility because the gymnasium is the place that the school set for the students to assemble; it is the right ground for the students&rsquo; assembly. Every proper student, every obedient student, every student who follows the rule, must assemble at the gymnasium. If all the students were obedient, if all of them followed the instructions and came to the gymnasium to assemble, then there would be no division. But now they are divided, and on the surface even those students at the gymnasium are divided from the others. But who should bear the responsibility for the division? The students assembled in the dormitory, in the classroom, in the auditorium, and in the dining hall must bear the responsibility for this division, but the students in the gymnasium are not responsible for this division.</p>
 <p>Twenty years ago an elderly brother invited me to a dinner, and almost everyone at the dinner was a leader of various denominations. At that time I was already speaking for the Lord. On one hand, the elderly ones were happy that a young man was rising up to serve the Lord, and they could not say that it was not a good thing. But on the other hand, something concerning me annoyed them; that is, I was always divided from others and unwilling to be united with them. In their view, it seemed that I spoke concerning oneness, saying that the church should not be divided, but I was always divided from others instead of being united with them. They were quite unhappy with me. Therefore, they saw an opportunity that day and wanted to confront me with this issue.</p>
<p>Not long after we sat down to eat, one of them began to question me regarding this matter. I said, &ldquo;Very well, today is a good opportunity for us to clear up this matter. Let us be clear concerning the responsibility for division.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;This is very good.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I truly understand your thought. In your consideration, I say that the church should be one, yet I am not one with others; I say that the church should not be divided, yet I take the lead to be divided from others. Therefore, you do not approve of what I am doing.&rdquo; When I said this, all of the elderly men nodded their heads and said, &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; Then I asked, &ldquo;In the early days when some of the believers in Corinth said, &lsquo;I am of Paul, I am of Apollos, I am of Cephas, and I am of Christ,&rsquo; they were condemned and reproved by the apostle. Is this not right?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;Right.&rdquo; Then I said, &ldquo;Since this is the case, can you ask me to belong to the Presbyterian Church? Can you ask me to belong to the Baptist Church? Can you ask me to belong to the Chinese Christian Church?&rdquo; They all said, &ldquo;No, no.&rdquo; Then I asked them, &ldquo;Then where do I belong?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;We do not want you to belong to any place.&rdquo; Then I said, &ldquo;But you need to put me somewhere. You cannot let me be a wandering Christian! Where are you going to put me?&rdquo; They could not answer me. Then I continued, asking, &ldquo;When the Lord grants me mercy and moves me by His grace, can I refrain from preaching the gospel?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;Definitely, you must preach the gospel.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;What do I do when people are saved through this gospel preaching? Should I send the people who are saved through my gospel preaching to this denomination or that denomination? Is it logical to send others to these places when I myself would not go there?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;No, no; you cannot do this.&rdquo; So I asked, &ldquo;Then where should I send these people?&rdquo; Again they could not answer me. I said, &ldquo;Since I cannot send them to any place, should I refrain from meeting with them?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;You should not refrain from meeting with them. You should definitely meet with them.&rdquo; &ldquo;But where should we meet?&rdquo; I asked. Again they would not answer, and they could not answer. I was not arguing doctrine with those elderly men; I was clearing up this matter with them. I said, &ldquo;Eventually, what will happen? We will need to rent a place and have meetings together. We will be like those students who assembled in the gymnasium, and we could say to others, &lsquo;Brothers, do not go to the dormitory nor the auditorium nor any other place. Let us go to the gymnasium. Do not be the Baptist Church, do not be the Presbyterian Church, do not be the Chinese Christian Church, and do not remain in any denomination. We must forsake all the sects and denominations. Let us all come to the ground of the church.&rsquo; Even though you say that we are divided from the others, we must investigate: Who should really bear the responsibility of this division?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I continued, &ldquo;Today, as elderly ones, you are here. I ask that you consent to one thing. If you go back and eliminate all of the differences, all the sects&mdash;the Presbyterian Church, Baptist Church, and Chinese Christian Church&mdash;then I will go back and ask the brothers to close the doors of the place where we are meeting, and if the brothers do not agree to this, I will be the first to leave them.&rdquo; The elderly men all said, &ldquo;We cannot do this. We simply cannot do this.&rdquo; At that moment, even as a young man, I became stern. I said to the elderly man who took the lead to challenge me, &ldquo;Since you cannot do this, what else can you say? Since you cannot do this, you are accountable for this division, not me. The responsibility for division must be borne by you, not by me. You took a group of people and formed the Presbyterian Church, and some of you took another group of people and set up a Baptist Church, and still others took another group and formed the Chinese Christian Church. Since you took different groups of people and formed separate, unbreakable organizations, where should the young people go? If we go to the Baptist Church, we will be divided from the Presbyterian Church; if we go to the Presbyterian Church, we will be divided from the Baptist Church; and if we go to the Chinese Christian Church, we will be separated from both the Presbyterian Church and the Baptist Church. What should we do? You may say, &lsquo;Even if you do not go to the Baptist Church, the Presbyterian Church, or the Chinese Christian Church, you still are divided from us.&rsquo; But who is responsible for this? After all, where does the Lord want us to be one? Does He want us to go to the Presbyterian Church and be one there? The more we go to the Presbyterian Church to be one, the more we are divided. Should we go to the Baptist Church to be one? The Baptist Church is also on a ground of division. If we go there, we are divided and not in oneness. Is there oneness if we go to the Chinese Christian Church? It also is on a divided ground. When we go there, we are not one but divided.&rdquo; After I spoke these words, none of the elderly men said anything again.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the oneness of the church is a matter of the ground. Therefore, we must see the ground clearly. The place for the school to assemble is at the gymnasium. We should not go to the auditorium, even though there are many students there. When we go there, we are not being united but divided because the ground is wrong. In like manner, the groups of students who are assembled in the dormitory, in the classroom, and in the dining hall are all wrong; therefore, everyone has to give up his own ground and assemble on the ground designated by the school. All the Christians need to forsake the ground of denominations, the ground of sects, and come together on the ground of the church, which is the ground of oneness.</p>
<p>In recent years people have often questioned us, asking, &ldquo;Why do you say that only you are the church, but others are not?&rdquo; We tell them, &ldquo;No Christians would be so foolish as to say that only they are the church, but others are not. It is foolish for anyone to say this, and it is naive and simple for anyone to believe this kind of saying. We acknowledge that those in various sects and denominations, even those in the Roman Catholic Church, are in the church as long as they are saved. We have never said that only we are the church. However, we would say this: Our feeling is that we are standing on the ground of the church. This we have said; we have not only said this, but we have strongly emphasized this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today the many grounds of the church are wrong. We can clearly see that there is the ground of the Presbyterian Church, the ground of the Baptist Church, the ground of the Methodist Church, the ground of the Lutheran Church, and many other grounds of many other groups. Even though we are separate from them, we should not think that this is wrong. We need to determine who is responsible for this division and also the ground for this division. Since we are on the proper ground, we are not responsible for the division.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE NEED FOR DISCERNMENT</h2>
<p>We must discern what ground is the ground of division and what ground is the ground of oneness, what ground is right and what ground is wrong. If we have a clear discernment, we should forsake any ground that is wrong and return to the one ground, the right ground. If we love the Lord with a pure heart, we will be delivered from being on the wrong ground and freed from the responsibility for any division.</p>
<p>Today as God&rsquo;s children, we should not say, &ldquo;As long as I believe in the Lord and love the Lord, it is good enough.&rdquo; Once we believe in the Lord, we become living stones and are members of the Body. As such, we cannot be independent Christians. Rather, we need to be Christians in the church in coordination with all the brothers and sisters. But the church today has been divided into many different sects and denominations. Originally, there was only one church, the unique church, so that the moment a person was saved, he was in this church. It was very simple, but today it is complicated. Before our eyes, there is the Catholic Church, and there are also different Protestant sects and denominations. Now when we are saved, to which church should we belong? On one hand, it is impossible for us not to be a Christian, and as a Christian, we need to be in the church and cannot be alone. On the other hand, the church has been divided into many different groups. To which one should we belong? Brothers and sisters, we cannot be ambiguous and indifferent in this matter. Since we desire to be those who follow God, who please God, and who walk on the earth according to God&rsquo;s will, we must pay attention to this matter and exercise careful discernment.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, how can we not be discerning? From a larger view, can we admit that being Catholic is right? Are we willing to be Catholic? I believe that every one of the brothers and sisters would say, &ldquo;I do not want to be a Catholic.&rdquo; Why do you not want to be a Catholic? Do Catholics not say that they are the church? If we say that the Catholic Church is wrong, then I would ask, which church is right? Are the Protestant churches right? There are many Protestant churches before our eyes. Are they right? We cannot be careless, nor can we speak according to our desire, saying, &ldquo;This place suits my taste. The preaching is not bad, and the brothers and sisters are very warm when we shake hands. Moreover, I have acquaintances here. Therefore, I will simply stay here.&rdquo; Perhaps someone would say, &ldquo;This place gives me no opportunity to show my talent. No one asks me to preach or to take the lead. I am going to another place where I can be active.&rdquo; Anyone who fears God and seeks the Lord with a pure heart knows that these attitudes are wrong and these intentions are a mistake. The church is not a place to suit our taste, much less a place to show our talents or to become leaders. The church is the house of God, the dwelling place of God, the Body of Christ, the place where God finds rest, and the place where Christ is expressed. If we want to please God and be those who care for with God&rsquo;s will in this age, we need to have a clear discernment so that we may see what kind of church is the right church. Originally, the church was one, but subsequently it was divided. Previously, the church was not in confusion, but later it fell into a state of confusion. What is before us today is no longer the unique church. Instead, there are different kinds and forms of &ldquo;churches.&rdquo; Since we are saved and know that God desires to gain the church, and since we are destined to serve God in the church, we should be clear concerning the church that God desires. Dear brothers and sisters, concerning this matter, we must have a careful consideration and clear discernment. In this message the Lord is giving us a measuring stick of truth to measure the so-called churches. The Lord is giving us a measure according to the Scriptures which can be used to measure the Catholic Church, the Protestant churches, and even our meetings. Any group that conforms to this measure, any group that is according to the Word of God, is acceptable to God, and any group that does not conform to this measure is rejected by God. This is the unequivocal truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE CONSTITUTION OF A SECT</h2>
<p>Previously we have seen that the church being unique and one is an unalterable principle. No one should divide the church; to divide the church is wrong. According to the Scriptures, the mistake of dividing the church is identified as being &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; or &ldquo;factious.&rdquo; Speaking bluntly, it is being schismatic, divisive; speaking nicely, it is sectarian, factious. However, today God&rsquo;s children have some knowledge of this, and even the term <em>sectarian</em> is a condemning word. If we say to someone today, &ldquo;Your group of Christians is sectarian,&rdquo; he would immediately feel condemned. This is true because in reality they are sectarian.</p>
<p>To be sectarian means to be schismatic, divisive. It is to be divided into sects and denominations. To be sectarian means to not be one. The church is one. There is one Body with one Spirit, one Lord, and one God; furthermore, there is one faith, one baptism, and one hope. Altogether there are seven ones. All that the church has is one, not two. Everything of the church is one; the church should never be made into something that is not one. But today the church is no longer one; rather, it has been divided into many sects, many divisions. The church is one and cannot be divided; once it is divided, there are sects, divisions.</p>
<p>How is a sect constituted? What makes a group a sect? There are conditions which constitute a sect. When a group is according to these conditions, it is a sect. This is as certain as any written articles of law.</p>
<p>According to the truth and the facts, six possible conditions constitute a sect; any one of these conditions will constitute a group as a sect. Now we need to look at these six conditions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Having a Special Name</h2>
<p>The first condition which constitutes a sect is having a special name. The church, whether universal or in a locality, is a unique entity. We know that anything that is unique does not need a special name. The moon, for example, is unique and does not need any other designation. The moon is the moon; it does not need to be called by another name. In like manner, the church is the church; therefore, it does not need a special name as its designation. Once it has a special name, it becomes a sect. Since a name denotes a realm, a circle, a special name places a group of believers within the circle of that name, thereby separating them from other believers. Look at the situation of division in today&rsquo;s Christianity. The most obvious thing is having special names. Some of the &ldquo;churches&rdquo; are named after individuals, such as the Lutherans and Wesleyans. Some are named after countries, such as the Anglican (Episcopalian) Church and the Chinese Christian Church. Some are named after a belief, such as the Justification-by-faith Church and the Holiness Church. Some are named by their system of administration, such as the Presbyterian Church and the Congregational Church. Some take their names from their rituals, such as the Baptists. These many different names are used to separate different groups of believers and encircle them in various special groups, thus dividing the church. Therefore, each of these groups are a sect.</p>
<p>We should never treat the matter of a name lightly. The name is a great matter. We believe in the Lord and are saved by calling on His name (Rom. 10:13). We are also baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus (Acts 19:5) and into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19). When Paul asked the Corinthians why they said they were of him, he asked, &ldquo;Were you baptized into the name of Paul?&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:13); his meaning was, &ldquo;Into whose name were you baptized; to whom do you belong?&rdquo; Since they were baptized into the name of Christ, they should belong only to Christ, not to Paul.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when Christians meet, we gather into the name of the Lord (Matt. 18:20). This is the meaning in the original language. We should meet in the name of the Lord, not in any other name.</p>
<p>Before the Lord Jesus&rsquo; departure from the world, He prayed for us, saying, &ldquo;Holy Father, keep them in Your name, which You have given to Me, that they may be one even as We are&rdquo; (John 17:11b). The words of the Lord show clearly that the oneness of the church is in the Father&rsquo;s name, which was given to the Lord. Therefore, whenever Christians have another name besides the Lord&rsquo;s name, they divide the church. But look at the signs on the street indicating this Christian church and that Christian church. It seems that simply having the name of Christ is not sufficient, but that there is a need to add other names. These additional names are all special designations. Having any one of these names constitutes a condition of being a sect, and any group of Christians in such a condition makes itself a sect.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Having Special Articles of Belief</h2>
<p>The second condition which constitutes a sect is having special articles of belief. We have been saved and become a part of the church because of the &ldquo;one faith,&rdquo; the fundamental faith, spoken of in Ephesians 4:5. The apostle Peter said that this is the equally precious faith allotted to each one of us (2 Pet. 1:1). Everyone who is saved has this precious faith. However, in addition to the &ldquo;one faith,&rdquo; the fundamental faith, Christians today have added many other articles of belief, such as baptism by immersion, baptism by sprinkling, keeping the Sabbath, keeping the Lord&rsquo;s Day, pre-tribulation rapture, and post-tribulation rapture. These additional beliefs to the &ldquo;one faith&rdquo; are special creeds. Almost every denomination in today&rsquo;s Christianity has its own creed. For instance, the creed of the Anglican Church has an article that says, &ldquo;I believe in the Holy Catholic Church.&rdquo; This really is a special belief that is not common to all the saved ones. You believe in the Holy Catholic Church, but I do not. You cannot be saved to a greater degree by believing in the Holy Catholic Church, nor can I be saved to a lesser degree by not believing in the Holy Catholic Church. But there is a faith which both you and I have, which you and I have in common, which is indispensable to every saved one, and without which we cannot be saved. This is the faith which is called the &ldquo;one faith.&rdquo; Besides this faith, there should not be any other faith. Otherwise, the brothers who believe in baptism by immersion will say, &ldquo;We believe in being immersed,&rdquo; and the brothers who believe in baptism by sprinkling will say, &ldquo;You believe, but we do not.&rdquo; In this way problems will arise and divisions will begin. Therefore, special articles of belief absolutely must not be brought in, because once they are brought in, they will cause believers to be divided. Some of the views represented by these kinds of special beliefs might be right and biblical, but none of them should be considered a condition for the fellowship of believers. If we make any of these beliefs a condition for the fellowship of the believers, it will become a special belief that divides the believers. Therefore, whenever believers focus on these special beliefs, they become a sect. In order to renounce sectarianism, we must have only the &ldquo;one faith&rdquo; and not care for anything else.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Having a Special Fellowship</h2>
<p>The third condition which constitutes a sect is having a special fellowship. What is a special fellowship? It is a fellowship outside of the fellowship of the church. Everyone who is saved and has the life of Christ is in the church; therefore, they can take part in the fellowship of the church. If a Christian group considers that a person who is saved and has the life of Christ must also believe in a certain article of belief in order to be qualified to take part in the fellowship, then this is a special fellowship outside of the fellowship of the church.</p>
<p>When I was a child, the pastor of a certain denomination would stand up and declare, when they were about to have the holy communion, &ldquo;Those who are not members of this church, please leave.&rdquo; When they were about to take the holy communion, to have their &ldquo;holy fellowship,&rdquo; there was a separation. Those who are members of their congregation could take part, and those who were not members could not take part. This is a special fellowship.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters believe in the pre-tribulation rapture of the believers and do not receive those who believe in post-tribulation rapture. Their receiving is according to their special belief. They will not receive those who do not believe in their special belief. Receiving based on a special belief is a special fellowship.</p>
<p>If a person wants to join the Seventh-day Adventists, he must acknowledge the Sabbath day; otherwise, they will say, &ldquo;We cannot receive you. As Seventh-day Adventists, we cannot receive someone who believes in keeping the first day of the week. If you believe in keeping the first day of the week and want to join us, you must change your belief. You must believe in keeping the seventh day.&rdquo; If a person wants to join their church, he must acknowledge that he believes in keeping the Sabbath. Only when he acknowledges this will he be received by them and counted as one of their members. This is a special fellowship. This kind of special fellowship does not receive all whom God has received, and it does not receive all who believe in Christ as Christ has received them (cf. Rom. 14:1, 3; 15:7). Hence, it is contrary to God&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>The Baptists are also like this. If you want to be a member of the Baptist Church, you need to believe in baptism by immersion. Otherwise, they may acknowledge that you are a Christian, but they will not recognize you as a member of the Baptist Church. This is a special fellowship. Once there is a special fellowship, there is division; thus, a circle, a sect, is formed.</p>
<p>Today every sect and denomination in Christianity have special names, special beliefs, and special fellowship. Therefore, they are all sects. They are sects even if they have only one of these three conditions; they do not need to have all of these three special things. Based on these three special things, it is very easy to see, beyond any doubt, that the denominations in today&rsquo;s Christianity are sects.</p>
<p>In addition to these denominations, there are other scattered small groups&mdash;the so-called nondenominational Christians who have left various denominations. Some of them meet in homes, and some meet in other places. They say, &ldquo;We have no special name, no special beliefs, and no special fellowship, so you cannot say that we are a sect. We are nondenominational, we are general, and we acknowledge all the children of God.&rdquo; However, this is not enough. We still need to measure them by the following three conditions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Having a Fellowship<br />
That Is Isolated and Not Universal</h2>
<p>We first must see whether their fellowship is isolated, rather than universal. If their fellowship is isolated and not universal, they are a sect. This is because the church is one in the universe, the fellowship of the church is one, and its expression in a locality is also one. People cannot say, &ldquo;We do not have a special name, a special belief, or a special fellowship. We are simply a group of believers meeting and serving the Lord here. We do not care about the believers in other places, nor do we have fellowship with the churches in other places.&rdquo; If this is the case, they are a local sect. Although they have no special name and no special belief, they are isolated and have no fellowship with the churches in other localities. Therefore, they are a sect. There is only one church on the earth. Regardless of time or place, there is only one church. Although the church is manifested individually in various localities, the church in each locality is not isolated; rather, it has fellowship with churches in different places which constitute the universal church. Therefore, if a group has a fellowship that is isolated and not universal, a fellowship that is limited only to believers in its locality and does not extend to the churches in other localities, then this group is a sect.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Having a Separate Administration<br />
in the Same Locality</h2>
<p>We also need to look at whether there are separate administrations in the same locality. Some groups have nothing special, having no special name, no special belief, and no special fellowship. They seem to be nondenominational, but their administration is separate from other nondenominational groups in the same locality. They do not meet together as one with other nondenominational groups in the same locality. For example, in Taipei there may be three small groups, none of which have a special name, special belief, or special fellowship, but the three groups have separate administrations and are independent of each other. This is also sectarianism. According to the Scriptures, a locality can have only one church, and in a church there can be only one group of elders which represent one administration. The Bible says that the apostles appointed elders in <em>every church</em> (Acts 14:23), and it also says that the apostle charged Titus to appoint elders in <em>every city</em> (Titus 1:5). This shows that the elders in a church are the elders in a city, and the elders in a city are also the elders in a church. The apostle did not charge Titus to appoint elders in every street. If he had, we would need to admit that there could be a church on a street. Rather, the apostle charged Titus to appoint elders in every <em>city.</em> Therefore, in a city there can be only one group of elders, and there can be only one administration of the church; there cannot be two or more groups of elders, and there cannot be two or more separate administrations of the church. Although the church in a certain locality may meet separately in many places because of a large number of believers, the administration should still be one.</p>
<p>Today in Taipei it is incredible that people refer to elders of a church on a particular street. This way of speaking shows that the church is divided in its administration. This division in administration is even more a division in actuality, a division in substance, a division in essence. Therefore, even more it is a sect. Some may not have a special name, a special belief, or a special fellowship, but if they have an independent administration, a separate administration, a special administration, they are a sect.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Having a Background of Belonging<br />
to an Organization</h2>
<p>Another point we need to check is whether they have some background of Christian organization. The church in any locality must be a pure local church and should not belong to any Christian organization. Although a local church should have fellowship in Christ with the churches in other localities, it should not have an organizational relationship with any Christian organization. Once it has an organizational relationship with a certain Christian organization, it has the background of that organization and becomes a sect. On the surface, a congregation may appear to have no special name, no special belief, and no special fellowship. Furthermore, they may be the only ones meeting in a place and have no separate administration. Thus, it seems that there is not a problem. However, after checking further, we may discover that there is a thread behind it, an organizational relationship, an organizational background with a certain Christian organization. Although their posture seems nonsectarian, the Christian background that it is involved with is really a sect. Even though it may not hang out a signboard, it may belong to a certain denomination far away in a foreign land. This group may say, &ldquo;We have no special name, no special belief, no special fellowship, and no special administration, and we are the only ones meeting in this locality,&rdquo; but we would say, &ldquo;You are linked to a sect; hence, you are a sect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The six items above are conditions which constitute a sect. Any one of these is enough to constitute a group as a sect. Since any one of these items causes the Body of Christ to be divided, any one of them causes believers to become a sect. If we use this measuring rod to measure various Christian bodies, we will see that almost all of them have these conditions and, thus, have been constituted as sects. These numerous sects cause the large circle of the church to have many small circles within it, and they divide the church. But within the large circle of the church there is still a group of people who are only inside the large circle, rather than in one of the small circles. Every group that is both in the large circle and a small circle is a sect because this causes the church to be divided. Any group that is only in the large circle and not in any small circle is not divided and is not a sect. Perhaps the brothers in a small circle might say to us, &ldquo;You are divided from us.&rdquo; We admit that we are divided from them, but we are not responsible for the division because they have placed a circle of division upon themselves. If they are willing to eliminate their small circle, then we would not be divided. Therefore, although there is division between them and us, the division is with them, not with us. This is like the previous example of the assembling together of the students. Since the gymnasium is the designated place for assembly, only the ones who go to the auditorium are in division; those who go to the gymnasium are not in division.</p>
<p>Let me speak a little more on this. Let us draw a large circle representing Taipei. Suppose some missionaries of the Presbyterian Church come and preach the gospel in Taipei, and some people are saved. Naturally speaking, these saved ones belong only to the church in Taipei. They are only within the circle of the church in Taipei. But the Presbyterian missionaries will not only impart salvation to them but also put them into a small circle&mdash;&ldquo;the Presbyterian Church.&rdquo; Thus, even though they did not divide themselves and are only a group of believers, they are within two circles. Later brothers from the Holiness Church may also come to Taipei. They will preach the gospel, and some people will be saved. Naturally speaking, these saved ones also belong only to the church in Taipei. They and the previous group of saved ones are all together in the circle of the church in Taipei. But regrettably the brothers from the Holiness Church also put them into a small circle&mdash;&ldquo;the Holiness Church.&rdquo; Then after another period of time, the brothers from the Baptist Church will come. They will also preach the gospel, and people will be saved. These saved ones also belong to the church in Taipei, and it should be sufficient that they are within the circle of the church in Taipei. But the brothers from the Baptist Church also place them into a small circle&mdash;&ldquo;the Baptist Church.&rdquo; Later some nondenominational brothers also come. They preach the gospel in Taipei and save some people. In what small circle should they place these saved ones? Of course, it is wrong to put them into any of the small circles. Eventually, they may let these saved ones remain in the large circle of the church in Taipei. Now the situation of the church in Taipei is divided. But it is obvious that the responsibility of this division is not with these saved brothers but with the brothers who drew all of the small circles.</p>
<p>Let me give another illustration. We can still use a large circle to represent Taipei. The Presbyterian missionaries are the first to come. They preach the gospel and people are saved. They say, &ldquo;Because these are brothers in Taipei, they are the church in Taipei. Let us not add the name of Presbyterian to them; it is sufficient that they are in the circle of the church in Taipei.&rdquo; Then the brothers from the Holiness Church come and preach the gospel, and a group of people are saved. These brothers also see that those who are saved in Taipei belong to the church in Taipei and should not belong to the Holiness Church. They realize there is no need to give them another name, no need to add another small circle on them. When those from the Baptist Church come, preach the gospel, and lead some to salvation, they also say, &ldquo;Those who are saved in Taipei should be turned over to the church in Taipei and should not be considered as members of the Baptist Church.&rdquo; Even though three groups of people come to preach the gospel, those who are saved through them are not divided but are simply in the large circle of the church in Taipei. If another group of brothers, who are without any denomination, also comes to Taipei and leads some to salvation, and says, &ldquo;Since we are in Taipei now, we are brothers in Taipei,&rdquo; they will join the previous three groups of brothers to be the church in Taipei. Thus, even though they come to Taipei at different times, they are not divided; rather, they are one. If this were the case, this would be a beautiful situation!</p>
<p>In fact, however, this is not the case. Today in Taipei the believers are divided. Most of them are in a two-layer association instead of a one-layer association. Instead of being only in the large circle of the church, most of them are in the large circle of the church and also in the small circle of a denomination. Originally, we were all worldly people, perishing in the world, but one day the Lord saved us from the world into the church; now we are people in the large circle of the church. Paul is here, Martin Luther is here, you are here, and I am here. All of us are in this one-layer association. But difficulties arise because some feel that one layer is not enough. A group of people adds the Presbyterian Church as a layer, another group adds the Baptist Church as a layer, and still others add another kind of &ldquo;church&rdquo; as a layer. Thus, they have an association of two layers, a circle of two layers. Originally, it was sufficient simply to have a one-layer association, a one-layer circle; it was enough to belong to the church. However, now they feel that it is not enough simply to belong to the church; they want also to belong to the &ldquo;Presbyterian Church,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Baptist Church,&rdquo; or other kinds of &ldquo;churches.&rdquo; In this way, when another layer of &ldquo;church&rdquo; is added, a small circle is formed, division occurs immediately, and a sect is produced.</p>
<p>Once a brother met another believer. After talking briefly, they found out that they were both Christians and rejoiced together. But in talking further, one believer asked the other, &ldquo;In which church are you?&rdquo; This question was hard for the brother to answer. He really could not say which church. He said, &ldquo;It is very difficult to describe the church where I am. It is the church that Paul is in, the one that Peter is in, the one that the reformer Martin Luther is in, the one that you are in, and the one in which I am. This is the church I am in.&rdquo; When the other person heard this, because he thought that the brother was joking, he said, &ldquo;How could there be such a church? How could you and I be in the same church, since you and I have never met before?&rdquo; The brother said, &ldquo;Yes, you are in the same church I am in, but I am not in the same church you are in.&rdquo; The first brother was only in the church, that is, only in one layer of association. The other believer, however, was in the church and also in a denomination, and therefore, he was in two layers of association; this is not right.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the brothers from all the denominations bring only the gospel, bring only the Savior, and bring only the Bible here, without their different denominations, and if, after leading some people to salvation, they give these saved ones to the church and do not set up their own denominations, then it will be simple, and there will not be any problem at all. But in actuality, bringing in something additional creates difficulty. In addition to bringing the Savior and the Bible, they also bring different sects and denominations. The result is division which causes the church to be in utter confusion.</p>
<p>As God&rsquo;s children, what should we do under this kind of situation? We should be wise and in the light. We must see that even though the church has been divided and sects have been produced, we must be those who belong only to the church, not to any sect. It is best that these sects were removed, but if they are so deeply rooted that they cannot be removed, then we need to jump out of these small circles of the sects. This is to be freed from sects, to be freed from denominations.</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, herein lies the difficulty we have encountered among the children of God throughout all these years. We absolutely cannot acknowledge that divisions are right, and we absolutely cannot acknowledge that it is right for a person to be in divisions, in denominations. We must keep speaking according to God&rsquo;s word, saying that everyone who sympathizes with God&rsquo;s heart must leave the sects and stand on the pure ground of the church. It would be best if all the sects and denominations could get rid of their own congregation; this would make the matter much easier. But, in fact, their different congregations are so deeply rooted, there is no way to get rid of them. Therefore, we can only hope that God&rsquo;s children would care for God&rsquo;s desire and come out of the sects and denominations. Because of this, we have incurred the displeasure of others, and we have been accused of sheep stealing. Dear brothers and sisters, we should be clear by looking at this picture of the large circle and the small circles. We are not stealing sheep; rather, we are bringing sheep back. The sheep have been stolen by the sects; now we are bringing them back. God&rsquo;s children must clearly see that, as Christians, we can only be in one place&mdash;the church; we cannot be in the denominations, in the sects. Christians should be only in one circle, not in two circles; they should have a one-layer association, not a two-layer association.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone may say, &ldquo;I was saved in the Presbyterian Church, and it was the Presbyterians who preached the gospel and led me to salvation. Therefore, should I not belong to the Presbyterian Church?&rdquo; I have already said that even if the apostle Paul preached the gospel to you, you should still not say that you belong to Paul. You should not take the instrument of your salvation as the basis for where you belong. You should thank God and the brothers from the Presbyterian Church for bringing you the gospel, the Savior, and the Bible. But you should say to them, &ldquo;I am sorry, but you should not have given me the Presbyterian Church.&rdquo; Forgive me for using this small illustration: It is right for parents with tuberculosis to give life to a child, but it would not be right for them to give their disease to the child. The child should say to the parent, &ldquo;I am grateful that you have given me life and have raised me, but I do not want the disease you have given me.&rdquo; The brothers from the Western world crossed the wide ocean to bring us the gospel, the Savior, and the Bible, and they also transmitted the life of Christ to us through the Holy Spirit. For this we should be sincerely grateful to them. But they brought something extra, that is, they also brought different denominations and sects, which we cannot accept. We must respectfully say that, on the one hand, we are grateful to them, but on the other hand, we should rid ourselves of the improper things. As saved ones, we are people in the church; we cannot become people of the denominations. We can belong only to the church and not to any denomination. We should be only in a one-layer association, not in a two-layer association. To be in the two-layer association damages the church of God and frustrates God&rsquo;s purpose. Therefore, we must be delivered out of the second layer, the second circle, to serve God together with those who are standing on the pure ground of the church.</p>
<p>This is the reason we cannot remain in any denomination but rather need to meet separately. We should never think that we are simply one more group of Christians meeting together among many existing Christian groups. Perhaps because you feel that this place is better, more spiritual, and more edifying, you come here to join us. This attitude is not adequate. We still need to see why we have another meeting. We need to see why we are not in the Catholic Church nor in any of the Protestant denominations. We need to see that we have another meeting because the other congregations are sects, divisions, and two-layer associations which frustrate God&rsquo;s purpose and damage the church of God. Therefore, we need to be delivered thoroughly and come back to the pure ground of the church, not belonging to this sect or that denomination but belonging only to the church and being people who are only in the church.</p>
<p>Let me say again that we should not shut our eyes and be Christians in a foolish way, going to any gathering indiscriminately and considering it as the church as long as there is a leading of the Holy Spirit. We should not be like this! We should be people in the light, people with a clear mind. We need to truly know what is the church, what is a sect, and what is being divisive. We need to clearly discern and carefully consider. We need to leave the things that are not right and come back to the things that are right!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP<br />
BETWEEN THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH<br />
AND THE LOCAL CHURCH</h1>
<p>We have repeatedly said that the church is one. She is not only one in number but also one in nature. Therefore, everything concerning the church is one, not two, whether it is her source, fellowship, or ground. When she is two, she is divided, but once there is division, a sect is formed. Once there is division, regardless of the reason&mdash;even the best, most spiritual, most honorable reason&mdash;it is still a sect. No matter how good the reason, motive, or purpose, it is a sect as long as it is a division. This is because the church is absolutely one and cannot be two; her nature, ground, and testimony are all one. We have seen this very clearly.</p>
<p>However, a question remains. In many portions in the Bible, when the church is spoken of, it is singular in number, referring to the single, unique church, the one church. But in the Bible there are also other portions which use the word <em>churches.</em> Since the church is one, why does the Bible also use <em>churches</em>? In other words, why does the Bible speak of one church and many churches? Why does it speak of the church, the one church, and also speak of churches? If we read the Bible carefully, we would see that in the universe there is only one church, which is the Body of Christ. Ephesians 1:22-23 speaks of Christ being the Head and the church being the Body. This church is altogether universal; it is uniquely one because there cannot be two Bodies, much less many Bodies. Therefore, in the universe the church is one, not many. But we know that the universe contains the elements of time and space. The word <em>universe</em> denotes past and present, local and abroad. Past and present are a matter of time; local and abroad are a matter of space. Time plus space equals the universe. In the universe there is only one church. However, in its manifestation in the time and space of the universe, there is one church in each locality, and therefore there are many churches. Hence, when the Bible speaks of the church in a certain place, it uses the singular noun <em>church</em>. Some examples include the <em>church</em> in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1), the <em>church</em> in Antioch (13:1), the <em>church</em> in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2), and the <em>church</em> in Ephesus (Rev. 2:1). As long as a locality, a city, is a unit of people&rsquo;s gathering and living together, then the church manifested there is also a single unit&mdash;one church. But when the Bible speaks of the church in a province such as Asia, it says &ldquo;the <em>churches</em> of Asia&rdquo; (1 Cor. 16:19). There were many churches in the province of Asia because there were many cities, such as Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea (Rev. 1:4, 11). Other examples are Macedonia and Galatia. Because these were also provinces, the churches therein were referred to as the <em>churches</em> of Macedonia (2 Cor. 8:1) and the <em>churches</em> of Galatia (Gal. 1:2) respectively.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the universe, from the universal aspect, the church is uniquely one, but from the local aspect, there are many churches since there are many localities. However, this is not to say that there are many kinds of churches. There is only one kind of church. In nature, principle, and element, the church is altogether of one kind, not of many kinds; only according to geography, according to locality, are there many churches. There is a church in this locality, and there is a church in that locality. There is a church in this city, and there is a church in that city. Each locality has a local church. Because there are different localities, there are many churches. But in nature, principle, and constituent, the churches are one and the same. We need to see that in the universe the church is uniquely one; there are not two churches, much less many churches. However, in the manifestation of the church locally, there are many churches because there are different localities. The churches are still one, however, in nature, principle, and constituent. Moreover, in each locality there can be only one church, not many churches.</p>
<p>Since Jerusalem was a large city and had such a large number of saved ones meeting separately in so many homes, some think that there must have been many churches in Jerusalem, that is, that the church there must have been plural in number. No! The Bible clearly records that there was only one church in Jerusalem; the church was singular in number. A city is a unit of people&rsquo;s gathering and living together, and the church manifested in such a city should also be a single unit. Consider some of the large cities in the world today, such as New York City, which has a population of almost ten million, and Tokyo, which has a population of approximately eight million. These cities may be huge in size and large in population, but they still cannot be divided. Each city has one government, not two, because it is a unit of people&rsquo;s gathering and living together. A certain locality may be a town with only thirty thousand people or even three thousand people. Although the population of such a place is small and its size is also small, it still has its own administration because it is a unit of people&rsquo;s gathering and living together. In principle, the church is like this. The church is composed of people who live in communities, who gather and live together in locality after locality in separate units. Thus, the church naturally is divided into separate units. But in a city, in a locality, there can be only one church. The church has to take a city, a locality, as its boundary regardless of its size. Large cities, large localities, have large churches, and small cities, small localities, have small churches. In a city, in a locality, there can be only one church. Let me say again, although Jerusalem was large in size and large in population, there was only one church in it, not many churches. If there could be many churches in a city, in a locality, it would be a terrible situation because the church would be in confusion and division. If there were many churches in a city, in a locality, instead of speaking of &ldquo;the church in Jerusalem,&rdquo; &ldquo;the church in Antioch,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the church in Corinth,&rdquo; the Bible would have referred to &ldquo;the churches in Jerusalem,&rdquo; &ldquo;the churches in Antioch,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the churches in Corinth.&rdquo; If there were many churches in a city and the word <em>church</em> in the singular still was used, it might refer to the church on such-and-such street, the church on such-and-such road, and the church in such-and-such alley. Then it would be like today&rsquo;s abnormal situation. In Taipei sometimes people point and say, &ldquo;That is the church on North Chungshan Road,&rdquo; or &ldquo;That is the church on East Hoping Road.&rdquo; We must remember that there can be only one church in a city, in a locality. There is no such a thing as the church on a street. A street is not qualified to be a unit for establishing a church, just as it is not qualified to be a unit for setting up an administration. Only a locality, whether it is a town or a city, can serve as a unit of administration, as a unit for the church. If we read the Bible carefully, we can find churches only in a province; we cannot find churches in a city. In a city, in a locality, there was only one church. It is not right for the unit of the church to be larger than a city, a locality; it is also wrong for the unit of the church to be smaller than a city, a locality.</p>
<p>We have seen in the previous chapters that the eternal heart&rsquo;s desire of God is to gain a group of people in the universe, comprising all the saved ones in the past and present, local and abroad, to constitute the Body of His Son, which is the church symbolized by the New Jerusalem. This Body is a vessel to express His Son. As His Son is being expressed through the Body, God Himself is also being expressed in His Son. This is the heart&rsquo;s desire of God in eternity, the goal God intends to reach in the universe. How does God accomplish this matter? How does He carry this out on earth? The New Testament shows that He is doing it by raising up a church in each locality. He first raised up the church in Jerusalem, and then He raised up a church in many other cities, including Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, and Rome. God wants the church in each locality to be a miniature, a small-scale representation, of His universal church so that all the local churches are the same as the universal church in nature and principle, just as small chicks are similar to the large hen. These local churches represent the universal church in their respective places, and they express Christ and serve as the testimony of Christ according to the principle of the universal church. Therefore, every local church is a lampstand in its locality, shining forth Christ. In Ephesus, we cannot see two or more lampstands; we can see only one lampstand because there was only one church in Ephesus. In one city, in one locality, there is only one church. Among the seven cities of the province of Asia, for example, each city had a church, so there were seven churches, seven lampstands. These seven lampstands were independent of the others; they were not unified to become one lampstand. In every city, in every locality, there was only one church; in every city, in every locality, there was only one lampstand. This is very clear. God has established this because He wants to set up a testimony, a lampstand, a church, in every locality</p>
<p>In this way we clearly see that the church has a universal aspect and a local aspect. The universal aspect is with respect to the church in its entirety, and the local aspect is with respect to the church in its manifestation. There can be many churches manifested locally, but in each locality there can be only one church as the testimony and representation of the unique universal church. Since there is only one church in the universe, there should also be only one manifestation and representation of the church in each locality. Now we will look briefly at the mutual relations between these two aspects of the church&mdash;the universal church and the local church.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH BEING THE SUM TOTAL<br />
OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES</h2>
<p>Let us first speak concerning the universal church. The universal church is the sum total of all the local churches. If we add up all the local churches of the past and the present, local and abroad, this would equal the universal church. If we subtract all the local churches one after the other, there would be no universal church. What is the universal church? Actually, it is the local church, except that it is not only one local church; it is all the local churches. When we add up all the local churches, the total is the universal church. This universal church is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. EVERY LOCAL CHURCH BEING THE EXPRESSION<br />
OF THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH IN A LOCALITY</h2>
<p>In the New Testament age God wants to establish the church in every place to express His eternal intention. God&rsquo;s desire is that every local church would represent the Body of Christ to testify on behalf of Christ in their respective localities. Therefore, every local church is the expression of the universal church in that locality. Therefore, the church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1), the church in Antioch (13:1), the church in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2), and the church in any other locality are part of the universal church. The church in a locality is a small expression of the universal church in a particular locality. It not only represents the universal church, but it is also part of the universal church. It is the universal church being expressed in a locality at a particular time. It is a part of the universal church which appears in time in a locality. Every local church is part of the expression of the universal church at a particular time in a given locality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE NATURE AND PRINCIPLE<br />
OF THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH BEING<br />
THE NATURE AND PRINCIPLE OF THE LOCAL CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Nature of the Church in the Universe Being of God and<br />
the Nature of the Church in Every Locality<br />
Also Being of God</h2>
<p>The nature and principle of the universal church are the nature and principle of the local church. Just as the nature of the entire universal church is of God, the nature of the local church in every locality is also of God. Therefore, the universal church is called &ldquo;the church of God&rdquo; (1 Cor. 10:32), and the local church is also called &ldquo;the church of God&rdquo; (1:2).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Church Being Uniquely One <br />
in the Universe and in Every Locality</h2>
<p>Just as the church is uniquely one in the universe, it is also uniquely one in each locality. The principle of the church is oneness. In the universe the church is one, and in each locality the church is also one. If there are two or more churches in Taipei, there is a problem, just as there would be a problem if there were two or more city administrations in Taipei. In one locality there can be only one church, not two or more churches. Look at the seven localities spoken of in Revelation 1:11. There were exactly seven churches. There was one locality and one church; there was not one locality with two churches. This is because in the universe the principle of the church is one, not two, and in a locality the principle of the church is also one, not two.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Local Church Being<br />
a Miniature of the Universal Church</h2>
<p>The local church is a miniature of the universal church. The situation of the universal church is the situation of the local church because the local church is a miniature of the universal church. The universal church expresses Christ, and the local church also expresses Christ, except on a smaller scale. Every local church is a representative of the universal church, representing the universal church in its locality by living out the proper life of the Body of Christ and thus expressing Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Universal Church and the Local Church<br />
Being the Body of Christ<br />
and the Dwelling Place of God</h2>
<p>The universal church is the Body of Christ for the expression of Christ and the dwelling place of God for the expression of God (Eph. 1:22-23; 2:20-22). Just as the universal church has these two aspects, the local church also has these two aspects: it is the Body to Christ and the dwelling place of God (Rom. 12:4-5; 1 Tim. 3:15). Both a body and a dwelling place are where man resides and where man expresses himself. First, a body is where a person lives. In 2 Corinthians 5:6 Paul says that &ldquo;we are at home in the body.&rdquo; When a loved one passes away, we say that he is gone, that he has left us. His body is still here, but his person has left. This is the reason we say that the body is where a person lives. Second, a house, a home, is also where a person lives. A body and a house are not only places where a man lives but also where a man expresses himself. When we look at a person&rsquo;s body, we know the person. We almost always know a person by his face and his appearance. Moreover, to know a person, we only need to look at his home, the house in which he lives. If his home is very clean, we know that he is a clean person. If his home is messy, we know that he is a messy person. When his home is beautifully decorated, we know that he is a person who appreciates beauty. And if his home is ugly, we know that he has no sense of beauty. A person&rsquo;s home is a depiction of the person himself. A house where a Japanese family lives will have certain Japanese features and a distinct Japanese flavor. If the same house is occupied by some Europeans, it will have certain European features and a distinct European flavor after a few months. If some Chinese move into the same house, when one comes to the door after half a year, he will immediately sense Chinese features and a Chinese flavor. A person&rsquo;s home, a person&rsquo;s dwelling, is a place where he manifests himself. It is the same with the church as the Body of Christ and the dwelling place of God in the universe and also in every locality. Every local church is the Body of Christ for expressing Christ, and it is also the dwelling place of God for expressing God. First Corinthians 14:25 says that when the church meets together and someone comes into their midst, he will worship, declaring, &ldquo;Indeed God is among you.&rdquo; This is the proper situation of the church. Both the universal church and the local church should be like this. If a local church has lost its function as the Body with respect to Christ and lost its usefulness as the dwelling place with respect to God, it surely has problems and difficulties.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE LOCAL CHURCH BEING<br />
THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH IN PRACTICALITY</h2>
<p>The local church is the universal church in practicality because the local church is the reality of the universal church. If there were no local church, we would not know where to find the universal church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Universal Church Being Built<br />
through the Building of the Local Church</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s word here refers to the building of the universal church. The Lord wants to build the church in the universe upon Himself as the rock, but His building is done through the local church. If the Lord did not build the local church, He would have no place to start His building of the universal church. We must consider this: if there is no building of the local church, how can there be the building of the universal church? If we put aside the local church, there would be no universal church. Therefore, the local church is the reality and the practicality of the universal church. Even the Lord&rsquo;s building of the universal church is gained through His building of the local church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Local Church Being Necessary<br />
for Carrying Out the Administration<br />
of the Universal Church</h2>
<p>After the Lord said that He would build the universal church in Matthew 16, He said that if a problem between believers could not be resolved, then they should tell it to the church (18:17). The church spoken of by the Lord here surely refers to the local church. Otherwise, where would the believers go? We need to believe that since there is a church to which we can go and tell our problems, then it must be the church in a locality.</p>
<p>What the Lord spoke of in Matthew 18 is obviously a matter of the administration in the church. If we have a problem that we cannot solve, we may tell it to one or two others; if the two or three of us still cannot solve it, then we should tell it to the church. This clearly shows that this is a matter of local administration. Therefore, matters related to administration and government or matters related to edification or leading must all be done locally. Otherwise, there would be no way for these matters to be carried out. Therefore, there must be a local church so that it is possible for the universal church to carry out its administration.</p>
<p>What the Lord said in Matthew 18 also shows the kind of gathering that can be considered as a local church. If there are only two or three believers in a locality, they are qualified to be a local church as long as they are meeting in the Lord&rsquo;s name. However, if there are more believers in that place, it is not right for only two or three people, who are meeting in the Lord&rsquo;s name, to say that they are the church. Even though the Lord said that two or three may be gathered into His name (v. 20), this does not mean that such a gathering is the church. The Lord indicated that these two or three, who are meeting in His name, are not the church, because when they have a problem they still must tell it to the church (vv. 16-17). If two or three meeting on such-and-such street can be considered a church, whenever there are two or three meeting on a street or in an alley, they also can become a church. If this were the case, imagine the extent of the confusion of the church. Furthermore, this would easily give the flesh a place to hide. As soon as one is unhappy with some other brothers or has an argument with the brothers, he could separate himself at will from the brothers and set up his own &ldquo;church.&rdquo; This would require no breaking of the cross. In the church no one can separate himself from other brothers and sisters simply because of differences in opinion, desire, and views. This absolutely should not happen. If every brother or sister was willing to accept the Lord&rsquo;s dealings and not be divided from others, the situation of the church surely would not be like the confused situation today. In any given locality there would be only one church, only one fellowship, instead of many sects and denominations. We need to see that the manifestation of the church takes the locality as its sphere, as its ground. In a locality there can be only one church. When we are freed from the division of the sects, we need to recover the oneness of the church in a locality. It is not enough that we are freed from the division of the sects; we still need to stand on the ground of the local church, representing the universal church and manifesting the proper living of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH BEING ABSTRACT<br />
AND THE LOCAL CHURCH BEING REAL AND TANGIBLE<br />
TO THE WORKERS AND BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The universal church is abstract; the local church is real and tangible. If there were no local church but only the universal church, not only would the workers for the Lord be unable to touch the church, but the believers also would not be able to touch it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Workers&rsquo; Work Being Carried Out<br />
in the Local Church</h2>
<p>Anyone who works for the Lord should be working for the local churches. Today many people think that working for the Lord means to build the universal church, but how is it possible for them to build the universal church? How can the universal church be built without touching the local church? Look at the apostles in the early church: they all worked in local churches, and their work was all for the local church. The Epistles they wrote were written to local churches. Even Ephesians, the Epistle which speaks of the universal church, was written to the local church in Ephesus. The local church is the object of the work of those who work for the Lord. If there were no local churches, the Lord&rsquo;s workers would not know where to start their work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Believers&rsquo; Corporate Life<br />
and Service in Coordination<br />
Being Realized Also in the Local Churches</h2>
<p>The believers&rsquo; corporate life and service in coordination are also realized in the local churches. We know that the believers cannot be alone. The Christian life is not like the life of the butterfly; it is like the life of the bee. Butterflies are individualistic, but bees are always in companies. The Christian life is a corporate life, the life of the Body. Christians cannot be alone, because they all have the same life. As saved ones, we all have the same one life, and this life requires us to be together, to be a corporate body, and to not be individualistic. Every saved one, without being taught, seeks out the brothers and loves to come to the meetings; this is a sure fact unless he has became cold, backslidden, or fallen. The life within a Christian is a life of the Body. Therefore, the living of a Christian is a corporate living. Christian service is also a service in coordination. But here a question arises. Where can we have this corporate living and this coordinated service? Is it in the universal church? It is not possible to touch them there. We must be in the local church! If we are in Tainan, we can experience them in the church in Tainan. If we are in Taipei, we can experience them in the church in Taipei. This is very clear.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. TOUCHING THE LOCAL CHURCHES BEING<br />
THE ONLY WAY TO TOUCH THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH</h2>
<p>We can touch the universal church only by touching the local church. If we do not live in the local church, we would not be able to live in the universal church. If we do not serve in coordination in the local church, we cannot serve in coordination in the universal church. If we stay away from the local church, we stay away from the universal church. Some people frequently speak of the universal church, but I would like to ask them, &ldquo;Where is the universal church? Have you ever touched it? Do you have a way to touch it?&rdquo; If we want to touch the universal church, we have no other way but to touch the local church. Once we stay away from the local church, we immediately stay away from the universal church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
LOCAL CHURCHES</h1>
<p>Now let us look briefly at the relationship between one local church and another local church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE ADMINISTRATION IN EACH LOCALITY<br />
BEING LOCAL AND BEING INDEPENDENT&mdash;<br />
THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATION</h2>
<p>The administration of every local church is local; it is independent in each locality. This is the local administration. This principle absolutely must not be violated.</p>
<p>The administration in each locality should be independent because the Bible shows that the apostles&rsquo; appointment of elders in every church is equal to their appointment of elders in every city (Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5). Elders administrate the church; they are administrators of the church. Therefore, a local church having its own eldership indicates that each local church is independent in administration. A church in each locality having local elders indicates that the church in each locality has a local administration</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE ONE FELLOWSHIP<br />
AMONG ALL THE LOCALITIES BEING UNIVERSAL&mdash;<br />
THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>Although the administration of the church in each locality is independent, the fellowship of the church in each locality is not independent but universal. It is one among all the localities because it is the fellowship of the Body. This is signified by the bread we break at the Lord&rsquo;s table. The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ? Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread&rdquo; (1 Cor. 10:16-17). The administration of the church is carried out locally; the fellowship of the church is one in the Body. Suppose the church in Taipei says, &ldquo;We have no relationship with the church in Tainan, so we do not fellowship with them.&rdquo; This would be a terrible thing because the church in Taipei would immediately become a local sect. Suppose the church in Tainan says, &ldquo;We do not like the church in Taichung; neither do we like the church in Taipei. We do not like the church in any place, nor care about any of them, nor fellowship with them. We care only about the church in Tainan.&rdquo; This would be a local sect in Tainan. While the administration of the church in each locality is independent, the fellowship should not be independent but rather be universal and of the Body. Not only do we need to have fellowship with churches in different localities in Taiwan, but we also need to have fellowship with churches in all localities around the globe. The churches all over the earth constitute the one Body of Christ; therefore, their fellowship should be one and the same. The administration of the church is local, but its fellowship is of the Body; the administration is independent, but the fellowship is in oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. ALL THE CHURCHES<br />
LIVING DIRECTLY BEFORE THE LORD<br />
AND BEING RESPONSIBLE DIRECTLY<br />
TO CHRIST, THE HEAD, NOT FORMING A FEDERATION<br />
OR HAVING A HEAD CHURCH</h2>
<p>The churches in all localities should live directly before the Lord, and each is responsible directly to Christ, the Head. They absolutely should not form a federation, and even more, they should not have a head church. This is to say that there should not be any organization above the local church. Otherwise, the organization on top becomes the head of the church underneath it, thus usurping the headship of Christ. Look at the seven churches in Revelation 1:11-20. They were seven independent lampstands, independent churches, each living before the Lord who was walking in their midst. They did not unite to form a federation; neither did they have a head church directing other churches. If there is a head church, it would not be necessary for the elders to inquire of Christ, the Head, when a local church has some problems or must take care of certain administrative matters. Nor would the elders need to pray or seek the will of the Lord; they could simply seek advice from the head church. Even if they sought the Lord&rsquo;s will, it would not count, because when the head church gave an order or made a resolution, they would need to keep it and abide by it. We must remember that a head church usurps the headship of Christ. Having a head church is presumptuous, overstepping, with regard to Christ, the Head; it is very offensive to the Lord. This is the great sin committed by Christianity today. The local church should be the highest church, and it should also be the lowest church. There is no church higher than the local church, and there is no church lower than the local church. The local church is the unique church; there is no higher-level church, and there is also no lower-level church. Rather, there is one locality with one church, and each church lives directly before the Lord. When there are problems, difficulties, or administrative matters, the church must pray to Christ, look to the Head, wait for the direction from the Head, and remain responsible to the Head. This is a very important matter. We are not contending merely concerning a matter of organization or system but concerning the headship of Christ and the authority of the Holy Spirit. Once there is a head church, it replaces Christ and annuls the Holy Spirit. When a lower church must obey a higher church, there is no more room for Christ, and there is no authority of the Holy Spirit. This is not permissible. This is acceptable in worldly organizations, but it is absolutely unacceptable in the churches. The churches are local units on the same level; they do not have a vertical organization. In the early days, the seven churches in Asia were living individually and directly before the Lord. There were seven churches, and there were also seven lampstands. Christ, the Head, was walking in their midst, and each of the churches was directly responsible to Him. Christ did not deal with the seven churches generally; He did not write one epistle to the seven churches, listing all the seven names of the localities together. Rather, Christ, as the Head, wrote seven epistles to seven churches, dealing with them one by one. Ephesus was Ephesus, and Smyrna was Smyrna; each one was responsible directly to Him, and He dealt with each one directly. Therefore, the church absolutely should not have any kind of organization such as a federation or a head church.</p>
<p>Several years ago when I was in Taichung, I met a newly saved brother. He gladly told me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, in a week I am going to the head church in Taipei.&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;Brother, we do not have a head church; we do not have such a thing as a head church or a subsidiary church.&rdquo; The church in Taipei is not the head church, nor is the church in Taichung a subsidiary church. No church is the head of another, and no church is the subsidiary of another. The church in Taipei is simply the church in Taipei, and the church in Taichung is simply the church in Taichung; there is no distinction with one being the head church and the other being a subsidiary church. The churches in all the localities live directly before the Lord. Although the church in Taipei is large, it is not the head church, nor is it a higher church. The large church in Taipei and the small church in Panchiao are on exactly equal standing; neither is higher nor lower than the other. The church in Panchiao cannot control the church in Taipei; neither can the church in Taipei control the church in Panchiao. Every local church lives directly before the Lord and under the ruling of the Holy Spirit. In spiritual matters the churches should help one another, lead one another, and fellowship with one another; however, this is spiritual, not formal or administrative. It is not organizational; rather, it is altogether spiritual. If we feel that something is of the Lord and it is the Lord&rsquo;s leading, we may receive the help from the church in another locality. But if we feel that something is not the will of the Lord, we may refuse it. This refusing does not mean that we are divided or sectarian. Today we may refuse the help from another church in a certain matter, but next month we may accept the help from the same church in another matter. Since we feel that such a help is right and from the Lord, we accept it. Therefore, the relationship among the churches in all the localities is spiritual and in the nature of fellowship; it is neither administrative nor organizational.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. ALL THE CHURCHES BEING THE SAME<br />
IN THEIR ACTIONS</h2>
<p>On one hand, the Bible says that the local churches do not have any relationship according to administrative organization; that is, there is no head church or federation, and every church carries out its administration locally. On the other hand, the Bible says that the churches in all the localities should be the same in their actions. First Corinthians, which was written by the apostle Paul to the church in Corinth, was addressed not only to the saints in Corinth but also to all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place (1:2). Although every one of the seven epistles to the seven churches was written to a particular church individually, the end of the epistle indicates that each epistle is also the speaking of the Holy Spirit to the churches (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). After all, the churches are one. Although the administration of the church is independent, the nature of the church is still one, and the fellowship of the church is also one. Although the local churches should not be united in an organizational way, in principle they are one; even more, they are the same in nature, and they are one in the fellowship. In the matter of bearing the testimony of the Lord, it should not be that a church in one locality has one expression, and the church in another locality has another expression. Although the churches should not form an organizational union, they should be the same in fellowship, in nature, and in principle. When the apostle gave direction to a particular church concerning a certain matter, he said, &ldquo;So I direct in all the churches&rdquo; (1 Cor. 7:17). The apostle never directed the churches in two different ways. Just as he charged the church in one locality to make offerings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, he charged all the churches in the same way (16:1-2). If a local church does not have a certain custom, all the churches should not have that custom (11:16). If a local church does not have a certain practice, all the churches should not have that practice (14:33b-34). Every local church should imitate the churches and follow their example in the Lord (1 Thes. 2:14).</p>
<p>The Bible shows that, on the one hand, the administration of the church is independent, and on the other hand, that the fellowship of the church is one. The churches must not have a federation or a head church, but the churches should be the same in their actions. It seems as if the churches are independent yet one, one yet independent. This is because in administration, in managing, in leading, and in edifying, it is quite convenient for the churches to be independent in their local administration. However, because the nature, the principle, and the fellowship of the church are all one, the churches must be the same in their actions.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy upon us in order that we may know these matters clearly and practice them properly so that we may not fall into sectarianism. Every local church must stand on the ground of oneness, without any condition of division, any element of division, or any situation of division. Instead, we should be in a situation of oneness to maintain the testimony of the Body of Christ. At the same time, each local church is one and in fellowship with the churches in all the localities that maintain such a testimony.</p><h1 class="series">SECTION THREE</h1>
<h1 class="series">THE DEGRADATION AND<br />
THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>Whenever we speak of the testimony and the ground of the church, we need to look at the history of the church and the actual condition of the church today. Everyone who truly desires to know the church must look at it not only from the standpoint of the Word of God and the light of God but also from the history of the church and the actual condition of the church. Only when we have looked at all these aspects can we have a complete and thorough view of the church. Therefore, we need to spend some time to look at the degradation and the recovery of the church, that is, to look at the history and the present condition of the church.</p>
<p>Before we look at the degradation and the recovery of the church, we need to consider the original condition of the church. Only after we understand the original condition of the church can we know how the church has degraded and deviated, and only then can we know the matters that have been recovered and corrected and even what matters still need to be recovered and corrected.</p>
<p>I need to say a few words here. Today when matters such as man&rsquo;s salvation and the pursuit of spirituality are spoken of among most Christians, most people quickly respond because they feel that these matters are related to them personally. But when the matter of the church is brought up, they feel that it is not related to them personally. As long as they are saved and spiritual, it is good enough for them, and it seems unnecessary to be concerned regarding the church. There are also some who think that the matter of the church can never be made clear because it is too troublesome and too complicated. But brothers and sisters, if we know the word of God, we can clearly see that the goal of God is to obtain the church. God saves people for the church, and God edifies people for the church. In the age of the church everything God does is for the church. God&rsquo;s desire is to gain a church in each locality in this age so that He may express Himself through the church. We should not remain in our own feeling; rather, we must enter into God&rsquo;s feeling. Our feeling may be that it is sufficient to be saved and spiritual, but God&rsquo;s feeling is related to the church. Man&rsquo;s salvation is a procedure and so is man&rsquo;s spirituality; only the church is the goal of God. If we only pay attention to the procedure and neglect the goal, we will be &ldquo;halfway&rdquo; people. If we pay attention only to matters that we feel are closely related to us and do not care for God&rsquo;s intention to focus on God&rsquo;s goal, we are somewhat lacking as the children of God. Everyone who understands God&rsquo;s heart cares for God&rsquo;s desire. A fundamental principle for being a Christian is to seek God&rsquo;s heart in everything and to obey God&rsquo;s will. Since this is the case, we cannot be loose in the matter of the church; we cannot simply ignore it. We need to ask: What is God&rsquo;s intention concerning the church? What is God&rsquo;s purpose for the church? This is very reasonable. Therefore, brothers and sisters, I beg you to not consider that this matter is unrelated to you. As Christians, we cannot be alone; we must be in the church and serve the Lord together with all the saints. After we are saved and become Christians, we are confronted with the matter of the church, and we must deal with it properly.</p>
<p>The church is still a mystery, even though it is a matter involving revelation. However, in the past two thousand years the church has passed through many places, many people, and even the hands of many people so that it has become something exceedingly complicated, confused, and divided. Under the present circumstances, in order to know this mystery, something with such a long history and with such a broad sphere, we cannot be clear if we look at it only in a simple and brief way. We need a strong desire and a willingness to make an effort; we also need a pure and simple heart and a sober and careful mind. Finally, we need patience to study it point by point.</p>
<p>In the foregoing chapters we looked at some of the points spoken of in the Word of God concerning the church. We looked at God&rsquo;s desire concerning the church, specifically how God desires the church to be the Body of Christ as a vessel to express Him. We looked at how God is working in this age to build up churches in locality after locality. We also saw how the church is an entity of oneness, how the ground of the church is related to oneness, and how everything sectarian results in the loss of the ground of the church. We saw that the ground of oneness rests on the locality of place, that whatever is greater than a locality loses the ground of the church, and that whatever is smaller than a locality also loses the ground of the church. We briefly covered these important points. Now we need to look at the original condition of the church and then look at the degradation and recovery of the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ORIGINAL CONDITION OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>Concerning the original condition of the church, we cannot possibly cover everything; rather, we can look only at some important points related to the testimony and the ground of the church so that through them we can know the church, including her principle, her constitution, and her ground. According to these aspects, we need to look at seven points briefly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE BELIEVERS BEING IN MUTUAL COORDINATION<br />
AND SERVING TOGETHER WITHOUT HIERARCHY</h2>
<p>One of the characteristics of the original church was that there was no hierarchy among the saved ones. They were all members one of another, coordinating mutually and serving together. There are three sub-points related to this.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Believers All Being Brothers<br />
without Distinctions in Rank</h2>
<p>First, all the saved ones are brothers without any distinctions in rank. When the Lord was on the earth, He told the disciples clearly, &ldquo;The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you [that is, in the church]; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave&rdquo; (Matt. 20:25-27; 23:8-11). Do you want to be high? Then you need to be low. Do you want to be great? Then you need to be little. All the believers are brothers on the same level; there are no distinctions involving some who are higher and some who are lower.</p>
<p>Today we often discover that brothers and sisters like having distinctions in rank very much. Originally the elders in the church were not a distinctive group; they were merely saints who were responsible for the administration and the leading of the church. The term <em>elder</em> emphasizes that the elders are saints who are more mature spiritually; it is not a title of a particular rank in the church. However, in recent years some brothers and sisters have frequently used <em>elder</em> as a title, such as &ldquo;Elder Liu&rdquo; or &ldquo;Elder Chang,&rdquo; in their correspondence and conversation. This is altogether a concept of rank which completely contradicts the condition of the original church. I dearly hope that among us there are those who really are elders, who love the church of God, shepherd the flock of God, and who lead the brothers and sisters. But we must not use <em>elder</em> as a title to address anyone. To do so is altogether related to the human concept of class distinctions, and it should never be brought into the church.</p>
<p>The aged apostle John, who was the last of the original group of apostles, was approximately ninety-five or ninety-six years old when he wrote the book of Revelation. At that time the apostle Paul had been gone for about thirty years. Therefore, John was the oldest apostle. Furthermore, he had actually been an elder in a local church. Since he was approaching the age of one hundred, he could be considered the most senior among the Christians at that time, not only in one locality but even in all the localities. However, when he wrote the epistles to the seven churches, he still said, &ldquo;I John, your <em>brother</em>&rdquo; (1:9). Therefore, we must always see this one thing: one of the characteristics of the original church is that all the saints were brothers, without any concept of hierarchy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Believers Being Members<br />
of the Body of Christ, Coordinating Equally<br />
and Each Fulfilling His Function</h2>
<p>Second, all the believers are members of the Body of Christ; as such, they coordinate with each other on an equal level, and each of them fulfills his particular function. This is shown very clearly in Romans 12:4-5, 1 Corinthians 12:12-27, and Ephesians 4:16. Without exception, every saved one is a member of the Body of Christ. Since all the saved ones are members of the Body, no one is without a function. If a person is saved but has no function in the church, surely he must be a degraded Christian, a brother who is in trouble. As long as a person is saved, he is a member with a particular function in the church and should serve the Lord in coordination with all the saints. In our physical body even the smallest member is useful. Similarly, the smallest brothers and sisters in the church, even those who are newly saved, also have a useful portion.</p>
<p>In addition, the coordination of every member is also on equal standing in the church as the Body of Christ. In the coordination, although there is an order in position, this is not rank. For example, in the human body the eyes are in a higher position, and the nose is in a lower position; however, this is absolutely not a matter of higher or lower rank but merely the order in the arrangement of functions. If the nose were placed above the eyes, how ugly it would be and how inconvenient! In the original church the coordination was beautiful, and it was so fitting with everyone keeping his place, not making any distinctions in rank and being in mutual coordination as members.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Believers All Being Priests to God,<br />
Without an Intermediary Class<br />
or Distinctions between Clergy and Laity</h2>
<p>Third, all the believers are priests to God. In the Old Testament, among the people of Israel there was a group who served as priests, and the rest of the Israelites were common people. At that time there was a so-called intermediary class among the people of God. But in the New Testament, in the church, there is no longer such an intermediary class; rather, all the believers are priests to God, without any distinctions between the so-called clergy and laity.</p>
<p>The normal condition is for all the people of God to be priests to Him. It is abnormal if only a small number of the people of God serve as priests, but the majority are merely common people. The Bible shows that originally everyone could offer to God without a need for others to serve as a priest for him. When Abel offered sacrifices, did someone act as a priest for him? When Noah offered sacrifices, was there someone acting as his priest? When Abraham offered sacrifices, did someone act as his priest? When Isaac and Jacob offered sacrifices, did they have others serving as priests? When the people of Israel kept the feast of the Passover, every house offered a sacrifice. Did others serve as priests for them? None of them had a priest! As a rule, everyone who received God&rsquo;s grace was a priest before Him, and they could all approach God directly and serve God directly. They began to have priests after they failed because of worshipping the golden calf at the foot of Mount Sinai. From that time onward, God separated a tribe&mdash;the Levites&mdash;out of the children of Israel; furthermore, even out of the Levites, He separated the house of Aaron to be the priests. From that time on, the children of Israel could no longer approach God directly; instead, they needed priests to handle the service of God in their place. When the children of Israel wanted to offer sacrifices, they could not do it themselves; they needed to find a priest to do it for them. When they wanted to inquire of God, they could not do it themselves; instead, they needed to ask the priests to do it on their behalf. Thus, among the children of Israel, there were two separate groups of people: a class of priests and a class of common people. The priestly class became the intermediary between the children of Israel and God. This situation was abnormal; it was a deviation.</p>
<p>In the New Testament age, God wants all His chosen and saved people to be His priests (1 Pet. 2:5, 9). The Lord bought us with His own blood to be priests to God (Rev. 1:5-6; 5:9-10). Therefore, the saved ones are priests to God, and as such, we can all draw near to God directly, serve God directly, and offer spiritual sacrifices to God directly. This was the situation involving service to God in the original church. All were brothers, all were members one of another, and all were priests. A saved person was a member and a priest, fulfilling his function and serving. Therefore, the original church was living and strong. This was the first characteristic of the original church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. COMPLETELY SEPARATED FROM THE WORLD&mdash;<br />
IN THE WORLD YET NOT OF THE WORLD</h2>
<p>Another marked feature of the early church was that it was completely separated from the world; it was in the world but not of the world, just as the Lord said in John 17:14-17 and 18:36. This separation from the world was not merely a matter of not loving the things of the world; even more, it was a matter of not being mixed with the world and thereby being completely separated from the world.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. COMPLETELY FORSAKING IDOLS</h2>
<p>The original church also completely forsook idols. Whereas idols are adversaries of God, the church is the testimony of God. If the church has idols, the nature of the church has been changed. This is a certain fact. From Acts 15:29 we can see that the original church forsook idols in a very thorough way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. COMPLETELY ALLOWING GOD TO SPEAK</h2>
<p>Completely allowing God to speak was another important characteristic of the early church. In the original church there was no human opinion and no human system; instead, the believers completely allowed the Spirit to speak through the Scriptures. They allowed the Holy Scriptures of God to have their position, and they also allowed the Holy Spirit of God to have His position. Because at that time the New Testament books were not yet completed, they frequently read the Old Testament (Acts 17:11). Whenever they faced important issues, they would make decisions according to the Old Testament (15:15-16). At the same time, the Holy Spirit was present with them. Therefore, their original condition involved their completely allowing God to speak. The church as the expression of Christ is the place where God expresses Himself. If the church does not allow Christ to speak, the church is no longer the church. The early church was not like this; rather, it completely allowed God to express His mind.</p><h2 class="head1">V. EACH LOCALITY HAVING ONLY ONE EXPRESSION&mdash;<br />
ONE CHURCH, ONE FELLOWSHIP, ONE GROUND</h2>
<p>The original church also had another notable feature; there was only one expression in each locality. This means that there was only one church in each locality. It was one in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1), one in Antioch (13:1), one in Ephesus (Rev. 2:1), and one in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2). It was one in every locality (Rev. 1:11). Every locality had only one church, one fellowship, and one ground. In other words, in a locality there was only one group of Christians; there were not two groups of Christians, and even more, there were not numerous groups of Christians. It was not like the situation today, for example, where in Taipei alone, there are countless groups of Christians. Originally, one locality had only one group of Christians, one church. This principle is very strict; that is, in one locality there should be only one church.</p>
<p>This principle of &ldquo;one locality, one church&rdquo; prohibits God&rsquo;s children from being divided. If we are in Jerusalem, we need to be in the church in that city since there is only one church in Jerusalem; we cannot be separated from it. If we are going to Antioch, we should not be separated from the church there. We can also use the names of the cities today as illustrations. If all of us keep the principle of &ldquo;one locality, one church,&rdquo; when a brother comes to Taipei, he is a brother in the church in Taipei; when he goes to Tainan, he is a brother in the church in Tainan; when he goes to Taichung, he is a brother in the church in Taichung. Wherever this brother goes, he cannot start a second church. If the church does not take &ldquo;one locality, one church&rdquo; as its principle or take the locality as its jurisdiction and ground, there surely will be division and confusion. For example, there is a church in Taipei. What would happen if another group of brothers came and called themselves a church because they considered that it was sufficient for two or three to meet together in one accord? And what if, after a period of time, other brothers also came here and met together, calling themselves a church? If this were the case, the church would be in confusion. Moreover, forming a church would become too easy; anyone could set up a church at will.</p>
<p>The churches were not like this in the early days. There was one church in each locality. After Paul went to Corinth and many were saved through his gospel preaching, he established the church in Corinth, not &ldquo;the church of Paul.&rdquo; After Apollos went to Corinth and did some work there, preaching the word and helping many people, he did not set up &ldquo;the church of Apollos&rdquo;; instead, he turned the people whom he helped over to the church in Corinth. Later Cephas went and worked there, but he also gave the results of his work to the church in Corinth instead of setting up &ldquo;the church of Cephas.&rdquo; No matter who went to Corinth and regardless of what labor they did, they all gave the fruit of their work to the church in Corinth. Furthermore, when saints went to Corinth, whether they were from Rome, Ephesus, or Jerusalem, they considered themselves to be brothers in the church in Corinth. In the locality of Corinth, there was only one church. The church in that locality had only one expression, one ground, and one fellowship. In this way all the divisions were annulled. It was not like the situation today. After a group of Christians comes to Taipei, they set up their kind of &ldquo;church&rdquo;; when another group comes, they set up their kind of &ldquo;church&rdquo;; and when yet another group comes, they also set up their kind of &ldquo;church.&rdquo; Consequently, when people look at the church in Taipei, they can only see this kind of &ldquo;church&rdquo; and that kind of &ldquo;church&rdquo;; thus, in Taipei the church is in a state of confusion.</p>
<p>I think that when brothers, who were not acquainted with each other, met in the early church in Jerusalem, one would ask, &ldquo;Are you a brother?&rdquo; The other would reply, &ldquo;Yes, I am. Praise the Lord!&rdquo; After that, there were no further questions. Surely they did not ask, &ldquo;Which church do you go to?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Which denomination do you belong to?&rdquo; This would not have happened. But what about today? When two Christians meet in a public place and realize that they are believers in the Lord, the next question is almost always, &ldquo;To which church do you belong?&rdquo; In the early days there was no need for such a question, because in those days there was only one church in each locality; it was enough simply to ask whether one was a brother. But today the church has been divided. There are too many &ldquo;churches&rdquo;; there is a &ldquo;church&rdquo; on a street, a &ldquo;church&rdquo; in an alley, a &ldquo;church&rdquo; in a house, and a &ldquo;church&rdquo; in a school dormitory. Today the church is divided, and the &ldquo;churches&rdquo; are so numerous that it is hard to tell which is the real church.</p>
<p>I remember a story from more than twenty years ago. Some brothers and I were resting in the city of Hangchow, and we often took a walk in the afternoon. Gradually, I noticed that many streets had stores with the name &ldquo;Chang Hsiao-chuan.&rdquo; Chang Hsiao-chuan was a seller of scissors, and the scissors of Hangchow were very famous, especially scissors made by Chang Hsiao-chuan. Although there were many stores with the name &ldquo;Chang Hsiao-chuan,&rdquo; there were some slight differences: one was called &ldquo;The Original Chang Hsiao-chuan,&rdquo; another was called &ldquo;The Genuine Chang Hsiao-chuan,&rdquo; still another was called &ldquo;The Truly Genuine Chang Hsiao-chuan,&rdquo; and yet another was called &ldquo;The Uniquely One Chang Hsiao-chuan.&rdquo; Although they all called themselves &ldquo;Chang Hsiao-chuan,&rdquo; they were different kinds of &ldquo;Chang Hsiao-chuan.&rdquo; At first I did not understand, but then I learned that everyone wanted this brand because the &ldquo;Chang Hsiao-chuan&rdquo; brand was very famous; therefore, many merchants were claiming to be the true Chang Hsiao-chuan. Regardless of their claims, however, we could not tell which one was true.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, this is the situation of the church today. There is even a denomination that is called &ldquo;The True Church of Jesus.&rdquo; This means that all the other &ldquo;churches&rdquo; are false, and only their &ldquo;church&rdquo; is true. This is similar to the &ldquo;Genuine Chang Hsiao-chuan&rdquo; of Hangchow. Today when we walk out of the meeting hall in Taipei, we can see the &ldquo;Presbyterian Christian Church at East Gate,&rdquo; then there is the &ldquo;Baptist Church,&rdquo; and a little farther on there is the &ldquo;Lutheran Church&rdquo; and &ldquo;The True Church of Jesus.&rdquo; This situation is similar to Hangchow, where &ldquo;Chang Hsiao-chuan&rdquo; stores could be found everywhere. However, there was no need for the early church to designate itself as such-and-such &ldquo;church,&rdquo; much less designate itself as &ldquo;the true church.&rdquo; The church was simply the church, and it was one in each locality: in Jerusalem it was one, in Antioch it was one, in Ephesus it was one, and in Corinth it was also one. Wherever it was, the church was one, not two. This was the proper situation; therefore, there was no confusion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE CHURCHES BEING ONE IN FELLOWSHIP,<br />
BUT EACH BEING INDEPENDENT IN ADMINISTRATION<br />
AND THERE BEING NO HEAD CHURCH OR FEDERATION</h2>
<p>Originally, although the fellowship among the churches was one, they were independent of each other in administration; there was no head church or any federation among them. In principle, a local church should live directly before Christ and honor Christ as the Head. If there is a head church, then the head church would become the authority over the sub-churches. The higher church would rule over the lower church, and the lower church would obey the higher church, disregarding the headship of Christ and the authority of the Holy Spirit. This is most offensive to the Lord, and the Lord absolutely would not allow it. In the early days there was one church in one city, and each church lived before the Lord, just as the seven local churches in the book of Revelation were represented by seven individual lampstands (1:11, 20). The lampstand in the tabernacle of the Old Testament was a single lampstand with seven branches. But in Revelation the lampstands, which represent the seven churches, are seven in number: one locality, one lampstand; seven localities, seven lampstands, each standing alone. They did not form a union; rather, they were all directly responsible to Christ, the Head. This principle is crucial.</p>
<p>Originally, the local church was the highest, and it was also the lowest; the local church was the greatest, and it was also the least. No church was higher than the local church, and no church was lower than the local church. No church was greater than the local church, and no church was less than the local church. The church is expressed in a locality; therefore, the church in a locality is the church. Other than the church in a locality, there is no other church. The church is expressed in locality after locality as the local churches. This situation prevents division, retains the headship of Christ, and allows the Holy Spirit to have the authority.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. LETTING CHRIST BE THE HEAD AND<br />
LETTING THE HOLY SPIRIT HAVE THE AUTHORITY</h2>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ, and Christ is the Head of the church (Col. 1:18; Eph. 4:15), reigning in the church through the Holy Spirit (Acts 13:2; 15:28). It was this way in the early church. There was neither human opinion nor human authority. The believers let Christ be the Head in all things, and they let the Holy Spirit rule in all. They honored Christ as the Head and obeyed the authority of the Holy Spirit; this was the supreme characteristic of the original church.</p>
<p>How beautiful was the situation in the early church! All the saved ones were brothers, members, and priests, serving the Lord together in coordination. At the same time, they were separated from the world, they forsook idols, and they allowed God to speak in their midst. Furthermore, there was only one church in each locality, and although there was fellowship among the churches, the churches did not form a federation; instead, they lived directly under the authority of Christ, the Head, and obeyed the leading of the Holy Spirit. As a result, they spontaneously allowed Christ to be the Head and allowed the Holy Spirit to exercise His authority. This was the situation in the early church. By reading the Acts, we can see that this was the situation of the church. Regrettably, this kind of situation did not last long; after a short time, the church gradually became degraded and lost its original condition.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE DEGRADATION OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>Now we need to briefly look at the degradation of the church, which is also the history of the church, by checking its history against the seven points spoken of in the previous chapter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. HAVING HIERARCHY</h2>
<p>The first item of the degradation of the church is having hierarchy. This occurred as early as the beginning of the second century. At that time there was an elder in the church in Rome whose name was Clement. In his epistle he clearly referred to the matter of bringing the Judaic priestly system into the church. According to the view of some of the saints, it was not fitting that all the believers would serve the Lord in coordination on the same standing. In their opinion it would be better to have a group of priests who could replace the saints in the service to God, just as in the Old Testament. There was such a proposal shortly after A.D. 100.</p>
<p>At approximately the same time another person named Ignatius wrongly interpreted the words in Acts 20:17-28. There the apostle clearly said that the overseers were elders. <em>Elder</em> denotes the person, and <em>overseer</em> denotes the service; these two terms are two designations for the same person. Ignatius, however, thought that the overseers, spoken of in Acts 20:17-28, were higher than the elders; he taught that elders were for a locality but that overseers were not limited to one locality. Thus, from that time on in Christianity, the saints who were designated by these two terms were divided into two classes. Later <em>overseer</em> was translated as <em>bishop,</em> meaning that elders should administrate a church in a locality, whereas bishops should rule over churches in various localities or at least churches in a district. Above these bishops there were archbishops. Thus, ranks came into existence in the church.</p>
<p>Around the middle of the third century, Cyprian, the archbishop of Carthage in northern Africa, strongly promoted the idea that the church should be organized with upper and lower levels, upper and lower ranks. This proposal greatly helped to produce organized Christianity.</p>
<p>In the fourth century, when the Church of Rome was formed, there were various distinctions in rank, such as bishops, archbishops, and cardinals. Finally, in the fifth century, the highest rank, the pope, was produced. All of these ranks constitute a priestly system, an intermediary class, in the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Since that time, a small group of persons among the Christians have become an intermediary class. Those who belong to such a class are responsible exclusively for the service of God, and the rest of the believers are fully excused from it. This is the situation of the Roman Catholic Church today. Among them, some not only belong to different ranks but also wear different costumes. It seems that the clergy should be holy, and the rest, the laity, may be worldly. This kind of hierarchy and intermediary system damages the Body of Christ, causing many members of the Body of Christ to become useless.</p>
<p>Later, in addition to the Roman Catholic Church there was also the Eastern Orthodox Church (Greek Orthodox Church). Besides these, there was the Nestorian sect (which spread to China and was known as the &ldquo;Ching Religion&rdquo;). Both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Nestorians have an intermediary class with bishops, archbishops, and patriarchs. Therefore, at around A.D. 400, except for a small number of Christians who were pure in heart, the majority of Christians, whether in the Roman Catholic Church, the Greek Orthodox Church, or the Nestorians, were fully involved with an intermediary class. Thus, believers were no longer brothers on equal standing, nor were they members; even more, they were not serving together as priests of God. The church became degraded, the service in the church was crippled, and the members of the Body of Christ became useless. Therefore, the first characteristic of the original church was completely lost.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. BEING IN UNION WITH THE WORLD</h2>
<p>The second item of the degradation of the church is being in union with the world. In A.D. 313 the Roman Emperor Constantine accepted the Christian religion, thereby bringing the church into union with the Roman Empire, that is, with the world. Before that time the Roman Empire had persecuted the church and was absolutely in opposition to it. But when Constantine accepted the Christian religion, the attitude of the Roman government toward the church changed from one of opposition to one of welcoming. As a result, the church was brought into a union with the Roman Empire and thereby became completely of the world.</p>
<p>In A.D. 380 the Roman Emperor Theodosius I formally established the Christian religion as the imperial religion of Rome by a royal decree. In this way the church was brought into an even deeper union with the world.</p>
<p>The Eastern Orthodox Church also kept its union with the world and did not break away from the power of the world.</p>
<p>Even the Nestorians, although their union with the world was not as strong as that of the Roman Catholic Church and the Greek Orthodox Church, frequently depended on the power of the world; thus, it also did not break away from the world&rsquo;s power.</p>
<p>At this time, the church not only brought in hierarchy but was also fully mixed with the world. At the time of the apostles, the church was like a boat on the sea, and the sea water could not get into the boat. But soon, even though the boat was on the sea, the sea was also in the boat. Sea water forced its way into the boat, signifying that the world had invaded the church. In this way, the church was submerged in the world, and her nature was completely changed.</p><h2 class="head1">III. HAVING IDOLS</h2>
<p>In the degradation of the church the third item is the bringing in of idols. This is an even more serious matter. In its degradation, the church was filled with all kinds of idols; this can be seen in the Roman Catholic Church. Someone told us that the most beautiful, most attractive, and most expensive idols are in the Roman Catholic Church. The Eastern Orthodox Church is the same.</p>
<p>In 1940 while I was living in Shanghai, a brother brought me to tour a cathedral of the White Russians, who are part of the Eastern Orthodox Church. When I went in and looked, I saw so many idols of all kinds. It was a day of worship, and there was a table with many candles at the entrance. As the White Russians arrived, each one bought a candle and lit it. After entering the cathedral, they selected an idol, placed the candle before it, and knelt down. After a while, a priest came out, wearing a priestly garment, holding a censer and chanting. When he shook the censer, the smoke of the incense was scattered and rose upward. At a certain time the people below the pulpit joined the priest in chanting, and they were all bowing down to the image in front. When I saw this, I was greatly surprised that they were so openly worshipping idols.</p>
<p>Several years ago when I was in Manila, I purposely went to observe the situation of worship in the Roman Catholic Church. The idolatry there is even more terrible. At times they bring out an idol and hold a procession; this is exactly the same as the noisy processions and festivals held in honor of local deities in China. Often they carry the statue of Mary in a procession, and many of those who are in high positions compete to carry the statue. Do we see the degree to which the church has become degraded?</p>
<p>Although idolatry among the Nestorians is not as strong as in the Roman Catholic Church and in the Eastern Orthodox Church, they still have idols. History tells us that when the Nestorian missionaries went to China in the Tang Dynasty to preach their religion, they not only brought the Scriptures, but they also brought the images. Therefore, there were idols also among them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. NOT LETTING GOD SPEAK</h2>
<p>The fourth item in the degradation of the church is not letting God speak. At a certain time the Church of Rome locked up the Holy Bible and took the pope&rsquo;s words as their criteria. Thus, they did not allow God to speak; they shut the mouth of God. The Eastern Orthodox Church and the Nestorians also took the words of the patriarch of their respective churches as the highest authority. The decisions of their patriarchs were higher than the Holy Bible. This also is equivalent to not letting God speak. At this point God had no way to express His mind in the church; instead, the church became a place where man&rsquo;s ideas were expressed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. HAVING DIVISIONS</h2>
<p>In the degradation of the church the fifth item is having divisions. From the second century or at the latest the beginning of the third century, a small number of the people in the church began to separate themselves from the majority due to differences in the interpretation of the truth and differences in systems. Those who separated themselves and left were mostly believers who had a pure heart and who did not wish to be a part of the degradation of the church; therefore, there were divisions. In the fifth century the Roman Church, because of the power struggle, was divided into the western Roman Church (which is the Latin Church, the Roman Catholic Church), and the eastern Greek Church (which is also known as the Greek Orthodox Church or Eastern Orthodox Church). This was a great division, and it caused the church to have two great branches. Furthermore, due to a doctrinal contention, another division occurred, and the sect of the Nestorians was brought forth. (The Nestorians are also known as Syrians because they use the Syrian language. The name of their leader was Nestorius. When they went to China, they were called the &ldquo;Ching religion.&rdquo;) Therefore, at this point in time, the church on the earth was divided not only into a few small groups but also into three large groups, namely, the eastern Greek Church, the western Roman Church, and the Nestorians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. HAVING ORGANIZATION FOR UNIFICATION</h2>
<p>The sixth item in the degradation of the church is having organization for unification. This damaged the principle of the original church of &ldquo;one city, one church.&rdquo; As early as the middle part of the third century, Cyprian had suggested unifying the churches. He also used the term <em>catholic church,</em> meaning &ldquo;universal church.&rdquo; The use of the name Catholic Church did not start with the Church of Rome; it was used by Cyprian much earlier. Later the entire western Roman Catholic Church was unified under the pope in Rome. Up to the present day, Roman Catholic churches throughout the world continue to be unified under the pope in the Vatican at Rome. (The Vatican is a small part of the city of Rome, the capital of Italy, and it was set apart as the capital of the pope of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1929, when Mussolini was in power, he made a treaty with the pope, permitting the city of Vatican to become an independent nation, not under the jurisdiction of Italy. It has its own police force and its own laws. Furthermore, various nations send consuls and ambassadors to the Vatican and vice versa). We can see the degree to which the unification of the churches has developed. On the other hand, the Greek Orthodox Church is mainly unified under the patriarch in Constantinople. Likewise, the Nestorians were also unified under their patriarchs (first at Seleucia and then at Baghdad). At this point, the church was divided, and the ground of the church and the principle of one city with only one church was damaged. The church was joined in an unlawful organization for unification that went beyond a local church. This led to the most serious point in the degradation of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. USURPING THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST<br />
AND ENCROACHING ON THE AUTHORITY<br />
OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The most serious point of the degradation of the church is the usurpation of the headship of Christ and the encroachment upon the authority of the Holy Spirit. When the church began to have an unlawful organization for unification, Christ lost His position in the church and the Holy Spirit could no longer rule in the church. In the Catholic churches the pope has become their head and highest authority. Under the pope there is a hierarchy, a clergy, including cardinals, archbishops, bishops, and priests, all of whom became the authority to the laity, the common believers. On the side of the Greek Orthodox Church and the Nestorians, the patriarchs have become the highest authority, and the clergy under the patriarchs are also the authority to the laity. At this point, all of the characteristics of the church have become completely degraded; none of its original characteristics are left. From the inside to the outside, from the principle to the nature, from the inner reality to the outward appearance, from the testimony to the ground, everything of the church has become degraded.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE RECOVERY WITH THE PROTESTANT CHURCH&mdash;<br />
IN THE FIRST PART OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY</h2>
<p>We have seen the original condition of the church and how the church became degraded. Now we need to see the recovery of the church. We must realize that the original condition of the church on earth did not last long. The church was established around A.D. 30, but near the end of the first century, after only fifty or sixty years, when the apostle John was about to depart from this world, the church began to have a little degradation. At that time the desolation of the church was limited to its inward content; it remained more or less the same in its principle and ground. At the beginning of the second century, however, the degradation of the church in its principle set in; some of the basic principles began to go awry. In the first part of the fourth century, even though the church had existed on earth for only a little over two and a half centuries, the degradation became quite serious when the Roman Emperor Constantine accepted the Christian religion. Finally, in the fifth century, when the Roman Catholic Church was officially formed, it became the imperial religion of the Roman Empire in complete union with the world. It also unified the religious organization and produced the pope as the highest authority. At this stage it might be said that the degradation of the church was complete. Both in regard to its nature and principle or its testimony and ground, every aspect became completely degraded; nothing was left that had not become degraded. It could be said that the church at that time could no longer be considered the church. This situation of degradation continued for approximately one thousand years until the first part of the sixteenth century when Martin Luther brought in the Reformation. In these one thousand years, the church may be said to have been in a period of total darkness. Students of history know that this was also the darkest period in the history of Europe. History books contain a considerable record of the situation of darkness.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth century there were some people in the church who rose up to recover and to correct the situation. We all know that reformation of the church began formally with Martin Luther. The Reformation was brought in through Martin Luther. However, before Martin Luther, there were some who were quite enlightened and who rose up to speak for God in protest to degraded Christianity. Two of the most powerful ones were John Wycliffe on the British Isles and John Huss on the Continent. Both of them were very strong, and the light they received from the Bible was also quite clear. Before the time of Luther, they rose up and told people that the Roman Catholic Church was an apostate church, that she had left the revelation of God, and that her actions were completely against God; under her, they said, the church had become completely degraded. They gave numerous illustrations and released much light, and their words were received by many people. In their time, they laid a very good foundation for the Reformation.</p>
<p>In the first part of the sixteenth century, Martin Luther, who was still a monk in the Roman Catholic Church, was raised up by God. Once he stood up, many others responded, and the well-known Reformation in history exploded. At that time, the explosion of the Reformation not only had spiritual power, it also had political strength because the kings of European nations did not want to be controlled by the pope. They took the opportunity and joined the Reformation, hoping to gain political freedom. Therefore, the Reformation had a political element mixed into its nature; it was not a purely religious movement. Nevertheless, there were still many who came out of the Roman Catholic Church. Gradually, they formed the so-called Protestant churches of today. We may say that today&rsquo;s Protestant churches are products of Luther&rsquo;s Reformation.</p>
<p>From that time to the present, a period of almost four hundred years, Christianity has been divided into two great branches on the earth. One great branch is the Roman Catholic Church with the Greek Orthodox Church and a remainder of the sect of Nestorians. The other great branch is the Protestant church, which includes thousands of sects and denominations. The Reformation can be reckoned as the first step, or the first part, of the recovery. Now let us briefly look at the important points of this recovery from a spiritual perspective.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Recovering the Open Bible</h2>
<p>First, the open Bible was recovered through the Reformation. When God gave the Bible to man, it was for everyone. But in the degradation of the church, the Bible was locked up under the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church did not allow believers to read the Bible themselves. The Scriptures were read only by the clergy, a group of people specialized in holy service. Sometimes they selected some portions from the Bible and explained them to the believers, but they never entrusted the believers with the whole Bible. Therefore, at that time the Bible was locked up; the word of God was sealed. In the Reformation the first thing Luther did was to open the Bible to the public. He released the Bible completely so that everyone had a Bible in their hands to read. This is the most worthy thing of the Reformation, and it is also the most beneficial thing to later generations. Some have said that justification by faith was the first thing recovered in Luther&rsquo;s Reformation, but justification by faith is not the center of the Reformation. The most important item of the Reformation was the recovery of the open Bible. Luther&rsquo;s recovery of justification by faith was based upon what he found in the open Bible. Therefore, the most precious item given to us by the Reformation was the open Bible. The second item was justification by faith, which was derived from the first.</p>
<p>Although the Bible was made available to the public, not much of it was opened up, interpreted. Opening the Bible to the public is one thing, but opening up the Bible is another. Reading the Bible is one thing, but reading it with light is another. In the Reformation, the Bible was opened to the public, but not much of the Bible was opened up. The Bible in black and white was placed before people to read, but not much light came out of their reading. Of course, this is not speaking absolutely but relatively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even though some truths were opened up, they were not obeyed absolutely. There were certain truths which even Martin Luther did not obey. For example, after some achievements were made through the Reformation, the state churches still were produced. Although the Reformation rescued the church out of the Church of Rome, it did not rescue the church out of politics. Martin Luther saw this light from the Bible. He was clear concerning this, and he told people that the church&rsquo;s fall into politics was a matter not according to the Scriptures. However, he also said that he did not have a way to reform this matter at that time and wished that others would rise up to do it at a later time. During that time there were other truths which were opened up but which were not kept. This is still the case with the Protestant churches produced by the Reformation; many truths in the Bible have been released, but they have not been obeyed diligently.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the Protestant churches, the Bible is still not the highest authority in many matters. For example, in today&rsquo;s Protestant churches there is still the human headship and the resolutions of councils, which are frequently considered higher than the teachings of the Bible and thus have control over the churches. In many instances the opinions of their leaders and the resolutions of their councils are more authoritative than the teachings of the Bible. On many matters the teachings of the Bible are not the highest judgment; rather, the opinions of their leaders and the proposals of their councils are the final decisions. Therefore, even though the Bible has been unlocked, it seems as if there has not been much effect. It has not been opened up sufficiently, and what has been opened up has not been honored sufficiently. This is the situation regarding the recovery of the Bible in the Protestant churches.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Not Separated from the World</h2>
<p>Second, the Protestant church was not separated from the world. The beginning of the Protestant church was the formation of various state churches; thus, the church fell into the hands of political governments. Therefore, the Protestant church was not freed from the world; it was still, in principle, the same as the Roman Catholic Church which was mixed with the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Later, Protestants produced the so-called private churches, such as the Baptist Church, the Presbyterian Church, and the Wesleyan Church. Although these were not state churches and seemed to be outside of politics, they still had many elements and practices that were linked to the world. These situations continue to the present time. Therefore, the Protestant church is still mixed with the world, similar to a boat being in the water and water also being in the boat. The Protestant church did not have a thorough reform in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Forsaking Idols</h2>
<p>Third, the Protestant church forsook idols. Generally speaking, it is true that the Protestant church forsook idols outwardly. It is not easy to find an idol in any of the Protestant groups. This may be considered as a strong recovery with the Protestant church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Not Eliminating the Intermediary Class</h2>
<p>Fourth, the Protestant church did not eliminate the intermediary class. We all know about the intermediary class. For example, the system of priests in the Roman Catholic Church is an intermediary class. They exclusively handle things related to the service and worship of God, and the rest of the believers occupy themselves with worldly affairs. We have already pointed out that this is very much against the principle of the New Testament. The New Testament shows that every saved one is a priest, and as such, everyone can approach God and serve God directly without relying on an intermediary. But the deformed church brought the priestly system, the intermediary class, of the Old Testament into the church in the New Testament. The Roman Catholic Church has a priestly system. Protestant churches, even though they reject the priestly system, have produced other systems which in principle and nature are not much different. The state churches have a clerical system, the clergy, and sometimes those who belong to the clergy are called priests; the private churches have the pastoral system.</p>
<p>We are all too familiar with the term <em>pastor;</em> we know that a pastor is one who specifically handles spiritual affairs. Therefore, pastors also constitute an intermediary class. I often met this kind of problem myself. In actuality I am not a pastor, and among us there is no pastor, but frequently people addressed me as &ldquo;Pastor Lee.&rdquo; They called me &ldquo;Pastor Lee&rdquo; because they considered me to be someone who handles spiritual matters, someone who specializes in this line. It is as if being a pastor is a profession. Today if someone wants to be a medical doctor, he goes to study in a medical school; if he wants to be a lawyer, he goes to a law school; and if he wants to be a pastor, he goes to a theological school. After one has finished his training in a theological school, he can be a pastor. This is the common view. Once I heard a brother utter a humorous statement that when someone is sick, he looks for a doctor; when he has a lawsuit, he looks for a lawyer; and when he wants to worship God, he looks for a pastor. This makes service to God merely a profession among other professions. This is altogether against the principle and teaching of the New Testament. In the New Testament we do not need to look for a pastor in order to serve God. Every saved one can draw near to God and serve God directly; there is no need for a group of believers who specialize in this line and do everything for others. However, the priestly system in the Roman Catholic Church, the clerical system in the state churches, and the pastoral system in the private churches are all an intermediary class in principle. This matter is most offensive to God, and it hurts the church. It is quite damaging to the Body of Christ because it is God&rsquo;s intention and desire that all of His children would serve and worship Him directly and that all the saved ones would be members of the Body of Christ with each one fulfilling his function. Today, however, in the so-called churches, an intermediary class has been created to serve God so that a few are taking the place of all the believers in the service to God. In this way the functions of all the believers as members of the Body are annulled. This also damages the Body of Christ and causes the church to become degraded. The intermediary class as an element of degradation was not removed from the Protestant churches; it only changed in appearance a little.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Having Even More Divisions</h2>
<p>Because of the Roman Catholic Church&rsquo;s promotion of the unification of all the churches around the globe, the church did not have divisions on the surface. But when the Protestant church began, there was a division into numerous state churches according to distinctions of nations and national boundaries. Later, due to the promotion of different truths, the adoption of different policies and systems, and the holding of different spiritual giants in high respect, the church was further divided into many private churches. As a result, the Protestant church presently is divided into approximately two thousand denominations and sects. The Protestant church did not have a recovery in this respect; instead, it caused an even worse degradation of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Not Putting Away<br />
the Organization for Unification</h2>
<p>The various denominations of the Protestant church also established respective headquarters for unification. Almost every denomination has regional centers and general headquarters above the local congregations. The lowest level is the local congregation, the highest level is the general headquarters, and in the middle are regional centers. All of these forms of organization rob the Holy Spirit of His authority and usurp the headship of Christ in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Not Allowing Christ<br />
to Have Absolute Position<br />
Nor Allowing the Holy Spirit<br />
to Have Absolute Authority</h2>
<p>In summary, although the Protestant church was much improved in comparison to the Roman Catholic Church, it did not have a thorough recovery&mdash;it did not allow Christ to have the absolute position or the Holy Spirit to have the absolute authority. In the Protestant state churches, either the head of the nation or the highest bishop is considered as the highest authority. In the Protestant private churches, their councils are considered as the highest authority. The Bible, Christ, and the Holy Spirit are all neglected; all decisions are made according to the decisions of councils. This causes Christ to lose His position and the Holy Spirit to lose His authority in the church. The above points briefly describe the situation of recovery with the Protestant church.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE RECOVERY WITH<br />
THE MORAVIAN BRETHREN IN UNITY&mdash;<br />
IN THE EARLY PART OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</h2>
<p>Although the Reformation was a great recovery of the church, only a small part was recovered; a great number of important matters of the church were still not recovered. Therefore, after another two hundred years, in the early part of the eighteenth century, God had a further recovery with the Moravian brethren. The Moravian brethren originally lived in Moravia, but they suffered persecution because of their love for the Lord with a pure heart. Eventually, they escaped to Bohemia. In the early part of the eighteenth century, they brought in a great revival there. This revival was a strong recovery, and it was much more serious than the recovery through the Reformation. It recovered nearly ninety percent of what needed to be recovered in the church. To a great extent these brethren returned to the original condition of the church in its nature, in its principle, in its testimony, and in its ground. Let us briefly cover the important points of this recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Obeying the Lord&rsquo;s Word&mdash;<br />
the Bible</h2>
<p>First, the Moravian brethren not only had the Bible in their hands, but they also obeyed the words of the Bible. Their living, work, meeting, and worship were all according to the teaching of the Bible. Therefore, at that time the Bible was quite illuminating. They were much more advanced on this point than the Protestants.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Separated from the World</h2>
<p>Second, they were truly freed, separated, from the world. They did not mix themselves with politics. They were citizens of a nation, but on matters related to the worship of God they did not mix with politics. This time, the matter of the church being separated from the world was recovered considerably. It could be likened to the boat being on the sea but the sea water not coming into the boat.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Not Defiled by Idols</h2>
<p>Third, they were absolutely not defiled by idols. Concerning this matter, they were much more absolute than the Protestants.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Removing Distinctions in Rank<br />
and Stressing the Fellowship<br />
and Coordination of the Brethren</h2>
<p>Fourth, they removed distinctions in rank. Thank the Lord, when these Moravian brethren were raised up, distinctions in rank in the church were eliminated. They scorned rank and forsook organization; instead, they stressed the fellowship and coordination among themselves as brothers. Brother Zinzendorf, a leading one among them, once said that if he gave up fellowship with the brethren, he would not know where to find the church. What a marvelous realization! To him, the reality of the church was in the fellowship and coordination of the brethren. They paid attention to this point; therefore, their service was strong and living. This is evident in history.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Endeavoring to Keep the Oneness<br />
by Abandoning Differences in Doctrinal Views</h2>
<p>They also endeavored to keep the oneness by abandoning differences in doctrinal views. At that time, at least four different groups were meeting together: Moravian brethren, Baptists, Presbyterians, and Calvinists. These four groups were quite different from one another in their doctrinal views. At the beginning they argued so seriously that they were almost divided. Then Zinzendorf proposed that all of them make a contract in which they would agree to lay aside their doctrinal differences and pay attention only to the points that were similar among them. Because they were people who loved the Lord with pure hearts, being the so-called puritans in history, they accepted Zinzendorf&rsquo;s proposal and signed the contract in May 1727. From that time on they laid aside all the differences and focused on the similarities. Later the Holy Spirit continued to work so that even the doctrinal differences were completely eliminated. In this way they became absolutely one. Hence, they greatly experienced the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and after three or four years, they went in groups to foreign lands for the spread of the gospel in an unprecedented way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Removing Formal Organization<br />
for Unification</h2>
<p>In this recovery, they also removed formal organization for unification. They did not have a head church and branch churches. Formal organization was completely removed from their midst.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Allowing Christ<br />
to Be the Head and<br />
the Holy Spirit to Rule among Them</h2>
<p>In such a situation, the Moravian brethren allowed Christ to be the Head and allowed the Holy Spirit to rule among them. The recovery among them might be considered quite complete. All who read church history admit that the recovery among this group of Moravian brethren was the first serious recovery of the church since the first group of the apostles. This was a tremendous recovery.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE RECOVERY WITH THE BRETHREN&mdash;<br />
IN THE EARLY PART<br />
OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY</h2>
<p>Although the recovery with the Moravian brethren was quite strong, God did not stop there; instead, He continued to take the way of recovery. Approximately a hundred years after this great recovery, God had another strong recovery with the so-called Brethren. This recovery began in England in the early part of the nineteenth century, formally in 1828. This recovery was even stronger. Readers of the Bible who have the light all acknowledge that this recovery was the fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy concerning Philadelphia (Rev. 3:7-13). The name <em>Philadelphia</em> means &ldquo;brotherly love.&rdquo; When the Brethren were raised up, they were truly a &ldquo;Philadelphia&rdquo;; a situation of brotherly love was recovered and manifested among them. This recovery was very thorough, and it might be said that what needed to be recovered in the church was recovered completely. Every item related to the church was restored to its original condition. It was truly pleasing to the Lord. Here we can cover only the main points of this recovery briefly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Absolutely Obeying the Lord&rsquo;s Word&mdash;<br />
the Bible Becoming an Opened Book</h2>
<p>First, they obeyed the Lord&rsquo;s word absolutely. At that time the Bible in their hands was truly an opened book, a shining book. Many important truths were released at that time. The Brethren released almost all of the biblical and orthodox truths preached in Christianity for the past one hundred years, from the truth of the gospel to the deepest truths. What a tremendous matter!</p>
<p>For example, before the Brethren were raised up, even though the truth concerning justification by faith was recovered, the truth of the gospel was not clear, and there was no assurance of salvation. The Brethren started from this point and released the light of the truth. Other truths were discovered by the Brethren, including the truths concerning the second coming of the Lord Jesus and the church. Biblical truths flowed out from them like torrents, and we are still being helped by them. Many famous Bible teachers in church history were brothers in their midst, such as J. N. Darby, J. G. Bellett, C. H. Mackintosh (who wrote <em>Notes on the Pentateuch</em>), and William Kelly. These brothers knew the Bible and opened up the Bible book by book. At their time the Bible was completely opened up. This fulfilled what the Lord said to the church in Philadelphia: &ldquo;You have a little power and have kept My word&rdquo; (Rev. 3:8). When the Brethren were raised up, they kept the Lord&rsquo;s word. This is the reason that thel ight of the Lord&rsquo;s word was especially shining among them. To this day there is still much light among the Brethren.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Absolutely Separated from the World<br />
and Absolutely Forsaking Idols</h2>
<p>Furthermore, their separation from the world and forsaking of idols was thorough and absolute. At that time, many among them were persons with titles of nobility, and they respectfully returned the titles to the royal family. They were reluctant even in the matter of taking pictures. They would not have their pictures taken unless it was absolutely necessary. Mr. Darby was the weightiest among them, yet it is difficult to find a picture of him. He felt that this kind of thing inevitably had the smell of the world and carried the flavor of idols as well. He did not want to have his picture looked at and adored by others. Here we can see that their separation from the world and forsaking of idols was absolute!</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Absolutely Eliminating Hierarchy<br />
and Being Brothers Together and<br />
Members One of Another with Special Emphasis on Mutual Love and Fellowship</h2>
<p>It was not until the time of the Brethren that the hierarchy in the church was truly and thoroughly eliminated. They were brothers together. Among them, they called each other brother in their preaching; when shaking hands they called each other brother; in their conversation they also called each other brother. They always addressed each other as brothers. When people first went into their midst, it seems as if they could not hear anything else; they only heard &ldquo;brother.&rdquo; Based on this particular characteristic, outsiders called them the &ldquo;Brethren,&rdquo; since they did not have a special name. This term <em>Brethren</em> was translated into Chinese as &ldquo;Brethren church,&rdquo; but actually in English it is simply &ldquo;Brethren.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Concerning the elimination of hierarchy among them, I can tell you a little story. Many people have heard of George M&#252;ller, who founded an orphanage; he was also one of the Brethren. At the Lord&rsquo;s table, he always sat on the last row of seats, as if to say, &ldquo;I am the same as all the brothers; why should I sit at the front?&rdquo; By this we can see that they paid attention to being brothers to one another. They thoroughly eliminated hierarchy.</p>
<p>Let me tell another story regarding the Brethren. During World War I, England and Germany were bitter opponents. Because many British people were killed by the Germans, they hated the Germans. After the war ended and the peace treaty was signed, the Brethren in England felt that some of them should go and visit the brethren in Germany. Thus, they went, and the brethren in Germany greatly welcomed them. In one of the meetings, a brother in Germany stood up and said, &ldquo;We really thank and praise the Lord that some of the brethren of England have come to visit us.&rdquo; After he finished, a brother from England stood up and corrected him, saying, &ldquo;We are not brothers <em>of</em> England but brothers <em>from</em> England.&rdquo; Dear brothers and sisters, how sweet it was! All of the flavor of the world, all of the element of idols, and all the things related to the hierarchy were completely removed from their midst. They were purely before God as brothers and as fellow members of the Body of Christ, paying attention especially to mutual love and fellowship. Even today their mutual love and fellowship are still very strong. Although I have not personally observed their situation, others have described it to me thoroughly, and it is truly a tremendous scene of mutual love and fellowship.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Absolutely Eliminating Sectarianism<br />
and Maintaining the Testimony of Oneness</h2>
<p>In the beginning the Brethren absolutely eliminated sectarianism and maintained the testimony of oneness. The matter of leaving the denominations began with them. In the beginning many of them were believers who came out of denominations. They came together to maintain the testimony of the oneness of the church. This point also was stressed very much among them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Absolutely Freed from Any Organization</h2>
<p>The Brethren were freed from organization. They had no branch churches or headquarters.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Completely Allowing Christ to Be the Head<br />
and the Holy Spirit to Rule among Them</h2>
<p>The Brethren absolutely allowed Christ to be the Head and the Holy Spirit to rule among them because they were freed from any form of organization. In the first thirty years of their history, their situation was truly wonderful. If we read their history and letters, we must say that Christ was truly their Head and the Holy Spirit was truly their authority. They returned to the original condition of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE FAILURE OF THE BRETHREN&mdash;<br />
BEGINNING NOT LONG AFTER THEIR RECOVERY</h2>
<p>Even though the Brethren had a good recovery at the beginning, it was not maintained for very long. It is not easy to maintain a high peak or a high water level for a long time. In the first twenty or thirty years after the Brethren began in 1828, they had the original condition of the church. Regrettably, this situation did not last long. Around 1850, after they had met for approximately twenty years, some problems arose among them which led to their failure.</p>
<p>What kind of problems arose among them? In the beginning they forsook sectarianism and left the denominations. When they began to meet in various places, there was one assembly in one locality. There was no problem. After a while, many of the Christians in the Protestant denominations admired their situation and wanted to join their meetings, but they could not break away from their denominations and wanted instead to meet with both groups. When these ones came into their midst, the brothers among the Brethren had different attitudes toward them. One group of brothers held the view that they should not accept Christians who were meeting with both groups. They seemed to say, &ldquo;Although these Christians are brothers, they have not left the sects, the denominations. Therefore, they are &lsquo;evil companions&rsquo; and cannot be accepted. If they want to be received by us, they need to leave the denominations because denominations are wrong. We can receive them only when they have completely left the denominations.&rdquo; Another group of brothers, however, had a different opinion and seemed to say, &ldquo;This should not be so. Although these Christians are still remaining in the denominations, this sin is not sufficient for us to cut them off from the fellowship of the church. We can only say that they have made a mistake, but we cannot reject them.&rdquo; Thus, there was a split among the Brethren into two large groups. The group that did not agree with receiving Christians who were still joined to a denomination was strict in this matter and later became known as the exclusive Brethren. The group that was in favor of receiving such Christians was more lenient and later became known as the open Brethren. Thus, the division among the Brethren began; not only was one locality divided from another, but brothers in the same locality were also divided into an exclusive and an open group.</p>
 <p>After a while, the Brethren became more and more sophisticated in their study of the truths, and they became increasingly different in their views. At the same time, they also had many differences in their opinions and practices concerning meeting and service. In response, they said that those with different opinions were preaching &ldquo;evil doctrines&rdquo; and should not remain in the group. Thus, the Brethren further splintered into many small groups. These divisions took place among the exclusive Brethren and also among the open Brethren. The exclusive Brethren were divided mainly because of arguments concerning doctrines, and the open Brethren were divided mainly because of differences in opinions. Furthermore, the open Brethren had a particular characteristic of not quarreling when they had a difference in opinion; rather, they adopted a seemingly civil way of simply leaving and setting up another assembly. In this way they could boast that they never fought with each other. In actuality, they did fight; it only looked as if they did not fight because they would leave and set up another assembly. As a result, there could be several open Brethren assemblies in a locality. This was regrettable. As a result of so many divisions, they lost both the nature of oneness and the ground of oneness.</p>
<p>On one hand, the Brethren were divided into many small assemblies in a locality; this was not according to the principle of one city, one church, and it also damaged the ground of the oneness of the church in a locality. On the other hand, they also went beyond the boundary of a locality and joined with brothers in various localities who shared the same opinions and same views, thereby producing an &ldquo;extra-local&rdquo; union. This also damaged the local nature and ground of the church. These two practices&mdash;having an &ldquo;extra-local&rdquo; union and having many assemblies in one locality&mdash;completely damaged the orthodox oneness of the church on the local ground. When the Brethren deviated in this manner, they failed. This caused the high level of the recovery among the Brethren to decline.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE RECOVERY IN THE EAST&mdash;<br />
BEGINNING FROM 1922</h2>
<p>What we have seen above is in regard to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the Western world. Now we need to speak a little concerning the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the East. I believe that some of the brothers and sisters who are meeting with us might have a feeling that our gatherings are somewhat different from other Christian organizations. Sometimes outsiders also have some questions regarding us, asking, &ldquo;What kind of Christians are they? How is their situation different from other Christian organizations?&rdquo; Even some brothers and sisters have asked, &ldquo;Where did we come from? How did we become what we are today?&rdquo; Now I will speak a little concerning our story, which is also the story of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the East.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Accepting the Lord&rsquo;s Word&mdash;the Bible&mdash;<br />
as the Highest Authority</h2>
<p>Most Chinese who are over fifty years old are aware of the fact that approximately thirty or forty years ago Chinese society experienced a great reform. In particular, the young people were infused with many new thoughts. They received a new kind of education, and they were stirred up to exert their effort to bring blessings to the country and to improve society. The Lord also worked on many of these young people, causing them to be saved and seriously gained by the Lord. This was really something of the Lord. Throughout the country, from the south to the north, many like this were saved in many places.</p>
<p>After their salvation these young brothers began to analyze the situation of Christianity. They classified the things in Christianity into three categories: the Lord Himself, the Lord&rsquo;s Word&mdash;the Bible and the gospel, and the system, organization, regulations, and practices in Christianity. Concerning the first two categories, which are the Lord and the Lord&rsquo;s Word, they had no problems at all. They thanked the Lord that He brought these two things to the East through the brothers from the West. However, concerning practical Christianity, that is, the Christianity before their eyes, they had a big question. They questioned everything in Christianity, including the system, the organization, the various names, the articles of faith, and the practices. They questioned every item by asking, &ldquo;Is this right? What is the basis for this? What is the principle, the standard?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;We must study the Bible, we must acknowledge that the Bible has the highest authority, and we must decide everything according to the Bible.&rdquo; At that time, their slogan was that &ldquo;the Bible is the highest court.&rdquo; They decided every matter by bringing it to the Bible. Therefore, they spent a great deal of effort to study the Bible in a serious way. Not only did they study the Bible in a general way, they also studied specific topics.</p>
<p>For instance, because they saw that Christianity was divided into many denominations and sects, they put a question mark on this and asked, &ldquo;Are denominations and sects according to the Bible? Do they have a place in the Bible?&rdquo; Then they read through the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, specifically to study the matter of denominations and sects. As a result, they saw that denominations were not found in the Bible and that sects were condemned by the Bible. Later they noticed that every denomination had a special name, such as Presbyterian, Methodist, and Baptist. Hence, they also asked, &ldquo;Are these names according to the Bible? Do they have a foundation in the Bible?&rdquo; Then they carefully studied all the portions in the New Testament which spoke of names. Eventually, they concluded that we should belong to and exalt only one name&mdash;the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Being designated by any name or exalting any name other than the name of the Lord is not according to the Bible.</p>
<p>When they looked at the pastoral system, they again went to the Bible to study this matter. As a result, they obtained an answer which negated it. When they saw the layers of organization in Christianity with general headquarters, regional centers, and local congregations, they again asked, &ldquo;Are these organizations in Christianity according to the Bible?&rdquo; They went to the Bible to specifically study this matter and again obtained an answer that negated this point.</p>
<p>I do not need to go into all of these matters in detail. They put a question mark on every matter, great or small, including baptism by immersion or by sprinkling and the distribution of the bread by a pastor at holy communions; they ascertained an answer from the Bible one by one. Most of their conclusions were negative.</p>
<p>Thus, they could no longer accept or remain in the status quo of Christianity. They cared for the Lord and the Bible but not for deformed, organized Christianity. Therefore, they began to leave the denominations. From approximately 1922 to 1934, for over ten years, from the south to the north, Christians throughout China enthusiastically responded to the matter of leaving the denominations. These Christians were mainly the young people spoken of earlier, who were both capable and quite clear concerning the Lord&rsquo;s salvation and who intensely loved the Lord, feared the Lord, and diligently read the Bible. Gradually, they communicated with one another and had fellowship through correspondence. Spontaneously, they converged and became one flow. By 1935 small meetings had been raised up in many important cities from Kwangtung Province, the most southern region of China, to Heilungkiang Province, the most northern part. They were started by people who loved the Lord with a pure heart in various localities and who left the sectarian groups and erroneous denominations of organized Christianity. They gathered together for the worship of the Lord in a pure and simple way.</p>
<p>Let me give an example to show how absolute and simple they were at that time. In the city of Tsinan, capital of Shangtung Province, there is the famous Chilu University, established jointly by the Presbyterians and some other denominations. Thus, it was a Christian university with regular Christian worship services, a university chaplain, and a number of professors who were also Presbyterian missionaries. Around 1931, a group of students were saved. They truly loved the Lord and loved to study the Bible. In their reading of the Word, like all other seeking Christians, they realized that Christianity at that time was deformed and that the denomination before their eyes was not scriptural. So they left the denomination and would no longer go to the university chapel. But where could these believers go to meet? Surprisingly, they held their first Lord&rsquo;s table at a cemetery in a desolate place outside of the city of Tsinan. In that cemetery there were graves with a stone table in front for placing offerings. The young brothers used the stone table as the table for the breaking of bread. They placed the bread and the cup on the stone table; then they all sat on the ground around the table and sang hymns and gave praises to the Lord. In this way they broke the bread. Someone told me that in their meeting they truly touched the presence of the Lord; they truly touched heaven. This was the beginning of the church in Tsinan.</p>
<p>The church in Foochow also started when a group of young students saw that denominations were wrong and would not go back to them. They wanted to have a new beginning, to have a pure meeting not according to Western traditions but simply according to the Bible. So they came together to meet. At first they met in a brother&rsquo;s home. Later when the number of people increased, they needed to rent another place for their meeting. Because they were poor students, where could they get money to rent a house? They also read from the Bible that it was not acceptable to ask for donations and that the proper way was to rely on God, to believe in God. Therefore, they prayed before the Lord in simplicity. They kept praying until a young brother took off his jacket and secretly offered it to a responsible brother to be sold to pay for the rent. The responsible brother then asked in the meeting if someone would buy the jacket for eight dollars. Please listen to this lovely story. There were only a few saints, but upon hearing the announcement, some were touched. One sister said to another sister beside her, &ldquo;Look at that brother over there. His clothing is so lightweight. I am thinking of buying the jacket to give it to him, but I have only four dollars.&rdquo; The other sister said, &ldquo;I also have four dollars. Let us buy the jacket together.&rdquo; Thus, they combined their money and bought the jacket for eight dollars. Then they gave it to that brother, not knowing that he had offered the jacket originally. In this way they had a few dollars and were able to rent a place to meet.</p>
<p>From these examples we can see that the recovery at that time was pure, without any background, any motive, or any connection or involvement with organized Christianity. Furthermore, and most importantly, they accepted the Word of God absolutely, taking the Bible as their highest authority. They took the Bible as the yardstick to carefully measure every matter, including matters such as how to serve God and how to live their life. It did not matter to them what anyone said concerning a particular matter; they wanted to know what the Bible said. Consequently, at that time, there were many arguments in regard to the Bible.</p>
<p>For example, once a church in northern China needed lights in the meeting hall. In order to be scriptural, the brothers began to ask concerning the kind of lights that should be installed in the meeting hall. Some were against using electric lights because electric lights could not be found in the Bible. Others suggested, &ldquo;We should use oil lamps because they are scriptural. In the Bible the lamp contains oil, and it has symbolic meaning. The church is a lampstand, and the oil within it is the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This kind of talk sounds somewhat childish today, but it shows how earnest they were in their hearts to let the Lord speak.</p>
<p>They also had a thorough discussion concerning baptism by immersion and baptism by sprinkling. Eventually, they concluded that baptism by immersion was the biblical way. Then they discussed whether a believer should be baptized in natural water or in man-made water and whether one should be baptized in the river, the sea, or a pool. They also discussed whether baptism should be in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit or in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Another example concerned head covering for sisters. This matter was vigorously debated among them. Should the sisters wear head coverings? What should be the color and style of the covering? Should it be white or black or another color? Should it be a large piece of cloth or a hat? These questions were thoroughly debated. Even matters such as whether the sisters could open their mouths and pray in the meetings and whether they could stand up and give testimonies were vigorously argued and thoroughly debated. I cannot speak too much on these.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we must know that many of our practices today were found approximately twenty or thirty years ago through a thorough study of the Bible and a great deal of discussion. Therefore, when we began to meet, it was something completely new, something that came out of the Bible. We did not care for the Christianity that was behind us. From that day onward we cast away all of organized Christianity. We cared for the Lord and for the Bible; we did not care for deformed Christianity. Our desire was to find the pattern in the Bible and to see what the church was and what it meant to be Christians.</p>
<p>From that time, there was a new beginning for the church in the East. Among other things, the primary item of the recovery was the return to the Lord&rsquo;s Word&mdash;the Bible. Oh, at that time the Lord&rsquo;s Word was truly precious! We were young people who loved the Lord&rsquo;s Word; we felt that the Lord&rsquo;s Word was truly as sweet as honey and as precious as gold (Psa. 19:9-10). We also studied the Bible well. When everyone sat down to debate a question, one person would quote the Bible, and I would quote the Bible as well; everyone was according to the Bible, but we were all very humble also. When we discovered that what I saw was not right and was a little off, I would accept the proper view immediately without any further word. When we realized that what another saw was not right and that I had seen something more accurate, he would accept my view without a further word. Most of the issues were not decided according to our views. Instead, we would simply say, &ldquo;This is according to the Lord&rsquo;s will. Because this is what the Word says, this is what we have decided.&rdquo; At the beginning of the recovery among us, our respect and obedience to the Lord&rsquo;s Word was our strongest point.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being Freed from All Sects and Denominations<br />
and Recovering the Oneness of the Church</h2>
<p>When we rose up to take the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery by absolutely obeying the word of God, we read from the Word that the situation of division into sects and denominations is not right; it is not according to the Bible. Therefore, we all left our respective sects and denominations. In 1932, when we began to meet as the church in Chefoo, Shantung Province, there were eleven brothers present for the first three Lord&rsquo;s table meetings. These eleven brothers came from at least six or eight denominations. This shows how prevailing was the matter of leaving the denominations. At that time we truly had a spirit of oneness. We did not care that one brother was baptized by immersion and another was baptized by sprinkling. We also did not care that one brother was from the China Inland Mission, another from the Presbyterian Church, and still another from the Chinese Christian Church. When we sat around the Lord&rsquo;s table, it was seldom that we did not shed tears. We all felt grateful to the Lord that even though we were previously divided by the denominations, we were now breaking the Lord&rsquo;s bread together to testify of the oneness of the church. This may be considered the second point of the recovery among us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Abandoning All Rank and Systems<br />
and Recovering the Position of All the Saints Being Brothers to One Another</h2>
<p>At that time we also abandoned rank and systems and recovered the position of all the saints being brothers to one another. At that time, calling each other brother was very sweet. Previously in the Christian denominations in China, the believers called each other <em>chiaoyu,</em> meaning &ldquo;religious friend.&rdquo; Thus, they would say &ldquo;<em>Chiaoyu</em> Chang,&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>Chiaoyu</em> Lee,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>Chiaoyu</em> Liu&rdquo;; they never used the intimate term <em>brother.</em> However, at that time we changed and called each other brother. When we met, we called each other brother; it was sweet and intimate. Furthermore, we rejected all rank; we had no pastors, no priests, and even more, no bishops. We abandoned the priestly system in the Roman Catholic Church, the clergy system in the state churches, and the pastoral system in the private churches. We lived together before the Lord as brothers under the leading of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Being Separated from the World<br />
and Staying Away from Idols</h2>
<p>We practiced two more points, that is, being separated from the world and staying away from idols. We were completely separated from the world, and we stayed far away from idols. We absolutely did not want to have any part in anything contaminated by the world and idols.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Completely Taking Christ as the Head<br />
and Allowing the Holy Spirit to Rule</h2>
<p>As a result, we completely took Christ as the Head and allowed the Holy Spirit to rule among us. All intermediary classes and all forms of organization were eliminated. Every believer, and every church as well, lived directly before Christ, the Head, and allowed the Holy Spirit to govern and direct in all matters.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Taking the Locality<br />
as the Boundary of the Church&mdash;<br />
Each Locality Having Only One Church</h2>
<p>In 1933 and 1934 we clearly saw a crucial matter&mdash;the principle of the church taking a locality as its boundary. At that time, in many places there were brothers who rose up to meet together, but there was a question concerning the boundary of each of these meetings. How should the boundary be delimited? Concerning this matter, a certain brother, after spending much effort in studying the Bible, found that the church takes a locality as its ground and boundary; that is, he saw the light of one locality, one church. In Jerusalem there was one church, in Antioch there was one church, and in Ephesus there was one church. In a large city the church was one; also in a small city the church was one. The church in a large city did not divide into several churches; also the churches in several smaller cities did not unite to form one church. There was only one church in a large city such as Jerusalem, and there was also only one church in a small city such as Thessalonica. In every case, there was one locality, one church.</p>
<p>Based on this principle, from 1934 onward, no matter how large or how small a city is, we have taken the way of having only one church. On one hand, this prevents division and confusion; on the other hand, it also prevents &ldquo;extra-local&rdquo; unions. If one locality were united with another locality, it would cause Christ to lose His position and the Holy Spirit to lose His authority. This is not pleasing to the Lord, and it is most offensive to the Lord. According to the teaching of the Bible, the church in each locality should live directly before the Lord and be responsible to the Head, Christ. There should be no superior church, no head church, and no federation. All local churches, whether large or small, are equal. The lowest church is the local church; the highest church is also the local church. There is only one class of churches; there is not a second class. When there is a ranking system among the churches, the church on a higher level becomes the head and the authority of a church on a lower level, thereby usurping the position of Christ and encroaching on the authority of the Holy Spirit. Because we saw this clear light from the Bible, the churches in various localities absolutely would not form a union. No locality can control another locality; rather, every locality allows Christ to be the Head and the Holy Spirit to exercise His authority. On the other hand, all the churches love one another, fellowship with one another, minister to one another, and help one another in the Lord. This is something spiritual and of love; it is not organizational or formal.</p><h2 class="head2">G. The Church&rsquo;s Administration Being Local<br />
and Its Fellowship Being Universal</h2>
<p>Because we saw the preceding item, we all kept one principle: the administration of the church is local, and the fellowship of the church is universal. From the Word of God we clearly saw that the church in each locality has its own administration and is independent of the other churches. Each local church has its own eldership and its own administration. The administration of the church cannot go beyond the locality; once it goes beyond the local boundary, it causes the church to lose its local nature. Thus, the churches in all the localities will not be able to live directly before Christ, the Head. The fellowship of the church should not only be local; rather, it should also be universal because it is the fellowship of the Body of Christ. A local church should have fellowship with all the other churches; otherwise, it will be a sect. Because we have spoken sufficiently regarding this matter in previous chapters, we do not need to speak more regarding it now.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Not Having Any Organization for Unification<br />
but Having Only the Spiritual Fellowship</h2>
<p>We also clearly saw that churches in different localities should not have an organization for unification, because the administration of the church is local. All churches should be directly under the ruling of Christ, the Head, and should directly obey the authority of the Holy Spirit. There should be no regional centers or general headquarters acting as higher churches to rule over other churches. Although the churches should have mutual fellowship, this fellowship should be spiritual, not organizational. Therefore, from the beginning we kept this matter&mdash;the church should not have any organization for unification but should have only spiritual fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. Emphasizing the Universal Priesthood</h2>
<p>In addition, we also emphasized the universal priesthood; that is, we stressed the fact that every believer is a priest. In Judaism, the majority of the people are laymen, and only a few are priests. The Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant churches adopted the Judaic system; thus, they also have a small number of people who are clergy, including priests and pastors, and the majority of the people are laity, the common believers. With a distinction between clergy and laity, most of the members of the Body of Christ have lost their function, and many believers are not able to worship and serve God directly. This is absolutely against the Bible. Therefore, from the beginning we recovered the universal priesthood of the believers. All brothers and sisters are children of God, members of the Body of Christ, and priests to God; not only so, all can approach God and serve God directly. When we are in the bread-breaking meeting, any of the brothers, even newly baptized brothers and young ones, can give the blessing and distribute the bread and the cup if they have the leading. This is not like the denominations, where these things can be done only by pastors, and it is not like the Roman Catholic Church, where they can be performed only by so-called priests. In our midst, there is no intermediary class that monopolizes the spiritual services; instead, we can all serve God directly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Emphasizing the Body&rsquo;s Coordination in Service</h2>
<p>We also emphasized the Body&rsquo;s coordination in service, exhorting all the saints to keep the principle of the Body by serving together in coordination instead of serving independently. In preaching the gospel, for example, there is not only one person doing the work; rather, all the brothers and sisters coordinate together to do the work. Some may give the message, some may lead the singing, some may invite people to come, some may serve as ushers, some may sit with the guests, some may converse with the new ones, some may lead the new ones to pray, and some may follow up by visiting the new ones. All these tasks are done in coordination. We kept this principle in all our services; no one monopolized the service. Even though there are a few responsible brothers, they are only taking the lead and overseeing. The entire service is in the hands of the brothers and sisters.</p>
 <h2 class="head2">K. Emphasizing the Practical Church Service</h2>
<p>We also emphasized the practical church service. In all aspects of our service we did not want merely a theory; we also wanted the practice. In matters such as how to meet, how to serve in coordination, how to preach the gospel, how to give a testimony, how to speak for God, how to visit the brothers and sisters, and how to fellowship with them, we paid much attention to practically carrying these out and rendered practical guidance to the saints.</p>
<p>All the items mentioned above are the crucial points of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the East. The situation among us is completely different from that of traditional Protestant churches and that of the Roman Catholic Church. In summary, we can depict the degradation and the recovery of the church with a simple chart.<br />
In this simple chart we can see that the original church was on a straight line; then the Roman Catholic Church deviated from this line. The church was recovered to a certain extent by the Protestant Reformation, but not fully. There was a further step of recovery by the Moravian brethren in unity. Subsequently, the recovery among the Brethren brought the church back to the straight line. Later, however, the Brethren had some problems, and there was a deviation from the line again. We dare not say that all of them deviated, but some of them definitely deviated; this is difficult to show on the diagram. Today we must humbly acknowledge that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the East has brought the church back to the straight line.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/TestimonyGround/graphic3-3.jpg" width="384" height="181" alt="" /></p><h2 class="head1">VI. OUR PRESENT PRACTICE AND ATTITUDE</h2>
<p>Finally, we need to consider our practice and attitude today. This will enable us to understand our ground, be clear concerning our practice, and know our way. Even now, without saying anything regarding the outsiders who are not clear concerning us, many newly saved brothers and sisters among us are not clear. Thus, people have many misconceptions concerning us. Therefore, I want to take this opportunity to speak clearly concerning our practice and attitude. I believe that this will make many matters clearer. I also hope that after the brothers and sisters listen to these words, they will be careful not to speak inaccurate words or words that misrepresent us when speaking to others. Because today&rsquo;s Christianity is complicated, we must be accurate in our speaking and in our testimony</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Our Practice</h2>
<p>Let us first look at our practice. First, we emphasize the testimony of the church in reality as the fullness of Christ, which is filled with Christ, full of the presence of Christ, and thereby expresses Christ. This is our primary emphasis. Our desire is that in the meetings and among the brothers and sisters, we will be full of the measure of Christ, full of the presence of Christ, and full of the expression of Christ. This is the testimony of the reality of the church. At the same time, we also emphasize the ground of the church in practicality. Thus, we have an outward ground that matches the inward testimony, just as in the Old Testament the outward tabernacle matched the inward Ark of the Covenant. The Ark of the Covenant was the Ark of the Testimony of God; as such, it was God&rsquo;s center. But the Ark needed a tabernacle in which it could be placed. Likewise, Christ as the testimony of God is the center of God, but He also needs the outward ground of the church to match and support Him.</p>
<p>Second, we have returned to the proper ground of the church, the original ground of the church, the ground of oneness. The ground of today&rsquo;s Christianity is not the original ground of the church, because it has been divided. Look at the church in Jerusalem in the beginning; it was in oneness, and it was one. But today in Taipei the church has been divided. This means that the ground of the oneness of the church has been lost. Therefore, we absolutely believe that we must leave the divisions and return to the ground of oneness. According to Old Testament typology, the ground of oneness is Jerusalem. Jerusalem is the place where the temple of God was built, where the testimony of God was set up, where the name of God was placed, and where God was worshipped by His people. In Jeroboam&rsquo;s time, even though the nation of Israel was divided into two, there was still only one place for the worship of God; the people of Israel still had to go to Jerusalem to worship God. Jeroboam set up Bethel and told the people to worship God there (1 Kings 12:26-30). This, however, was never recognized by God. For God, there was only one place, only one ground. The meaning of this type is that the church has only one ground&mdash;the ground of oneness. The church absolutely should not be divided. The church must return to the ground of oneness and not remain on any of the grounds of division of organized Christianity. All of the grounds of denominations, being divisive, are not according to the Bible; therefore, we should leave them. These divisive grounds, like Babylon, bring the children of God into captivity. Just as the people of Israel needed to leave Babylon and return to Jerusalem (Ezra 1:3, 5; 7:7-9; Neh. 2:11), we also need to leave the divisive grounds and return to the ground of oneness.</p>
<p>Today there are also some free scattered groups of Christians, some of whom meet in their home and some of whom meet in schools or other places; they consider themselves a small &ldquo;church.&rdquo; These groups are not sufficiently according to the Bible. Although these groups seem to be nonsectarian and appear to have left organized Christianity, they still have not returned to the ground of oneness. This is similar to some of the people of Israel in the Old Testament who left Babylon yet wandered in many places between Babylon and Jerusalem, rather than returning to Jerusalem. These small free groups also must see the ground of the oneness of the church. All of the believers, wherever we are, must be one and not divided. Since we are saved and all belong to the Lord, we should be one; oneness is our ground. In a given locality there should be only one group of Christians, not several groups; there should be only one church, not several churches. The church is one; oneness is the ground of the church. Therefore, we would not remain on any ground of organized Christianity, which is the ground of division. Neither would we wander in the ground of the free groups, which is the ground of scattering. Instead, we have returned to the original ground of the church, which is the ground of oneness.</p>
<p>Third, it is not our desire to set up any so-called meetings of &ldquo;ours&rdquo; in different places; rather, our desire is to meet and serve the Lord together on the ground of the oneness of the church with all those who have forsaken divisions. It is not our desire to make ourselves a special sect and promote ourselves. Rather, our desire is to be with the brothers and sisters who stand on the proper ground, who are neither divisive nor sectarian, and who meet and serve the Lord together on the ground of the oneness of the church.</p>
<p>Fourth, we desire to have fellowship with all the brothers and sisters in the denominations, even those in the Roman Catholic Church. As long as they are saved, as long as they are brothers and sisters in the Lord, regardless of their denomination, we will fellowship with them. On the other hand, we absolutely will not have any part in those denominations or groups. We will fellowship with the brothers and sisters, but we will not take part in their divisions. The brothers and sisters are lovable, but the divisions are detestable. Whereas the brothers and sisters belong to the Lord, the divisions are rejected and condemned by the Lord. Therefore, we will fellowship with individual brothers and sisters, but we will not take part in any organized group outside of the ground of the local church, outside of the ground of oneness. In other words, we do not want to have a part in the Roman Catholic Church or in any Protestant denominations; we do not want to take part in any so-called Christian fellowships or in any Bible-study classes; we do not want to take part in any revival societies or in any evangelistic missions. These are organizations outside the ground of the locality of the church; they have forsaken the ground of the oneness of the church. Therefore, we do not want to take part in any of them. We acknowledge, however, that within these organizations there are many genuinely saved ones. Therefore, we like to have contact and fellowship with them. In brief, in regard to saved individuals, we will contact them; in regard to the Christian organizations, we will not have any part in them.</p>
<p>Fifth, we are willing to tolerate any view concerning doctrine and any opinion concerning system, no matter how different they are from ours, as long as they do not hurt the fundamental faith. It does not matter that we are in favor of baptism by immersion and others are in favor of baptism by sprinkling; we will tolerate this because it does not hurt the faith. It also does not matter that we like to practice head covering and others dislike the practice, because this also does not hurt the faith. With regard to all such different opinions and different views, we are willing to tolerate them. The only thing that we will not tolerate is the matter of division. It is absolutely unacceptable to us. In the church there can be different opinions, but there absolutely should not be any divisions because of differences in opinions.</p>
<p>Sixth, there may be saved ones who belong to a Christian organization and who hold different opinions. If they are willing to not be divided, we are willing to stand with them on the ground of the oneness of the church to meet and serve the Lord together regardless of the opinions they hold. We do not want to be divided from any who are saved; rather, we want to be one with those who are saved, but they must remove and forsake division. As long as they do not have the principle, element, condition, and ground of division, then in the Lord we are willing to be joined with these saved ones to serve the Lord. Even if there are differences in opinion and understanding concerning doctrine and system, we are willing to receive these believers as long as these differences do not hurt the faith of salvation.</p>
<p>Seventh, we receive all believers with different views, except those who meet the conditions for removal from fellowship. As long as a person is saved and in his conduct and living does not have any of the sins worthy of removal, as spoken of in 1 Corinthians 5, we will receive him even if he holds different views. We will receive even saved ones in the Roman Catholic Church, because we are all in the Lord. We should be one and not be divided.</p>
<p>Eighth, we allow the Holy Spirit to bear the real responsibility of spiritual fellowship. There are some who are saved and who have no sin worthy of removal, yet they do not live in the Holy Spirit, receive the ruling of the Holy Spirit, or deal with their flesh, and they may even love the world. We cannot reject them because of these things; we must receive them. But this does not mean that once we receive such a believer, he is immediately brought into spiritual fellowship. We do not bear the responsibility of spiritual fellowship. This is the responsibility of the Holy Spirit. We bear only an outward responsibility; the actual responsibility is with the Holy Spirit. Whether or not we receive someone is based upon whether he is saved and whether he has any sin which would cause one to be removed. This is altogether an outward matter. If he has been saved and has no sins which would cause him to be removed, regardless of what opinion he has and to what sect or denomination he belongs, we will receive him. This is an outward acknowledgment. But in actuality, whether he is in fellowship with the Lord, whether he is living before the Lord, none of us can decide; we can only leave these matters to the Holy Spirit. Therefore, we may receive someone, but it is possible that he is not in fellowship with the Lord. Simply because we have received him does not mean that his fellowship with the Lord is no longer a problem. Even if we approve him, the Holy Spirit may not approve him. We can bear only the outward responsibility and let the Holy Spirit bear the actual responsibility.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Our Attitude</h2>
<p>Now let us look at our attitude. First, we are not the Roman Catholic Church, nor are we the Protestant church. We do not recognize the Roman Catholic Church, nor do we recognize the Protestant church. These two large divisions have greatly deviated from the Bible and are not according to the Bible. They have lost the ground and the testimony of the church; they have also lost the principle and nature of the church. It is not an easy matter for us to say these words publicly. We know that it may hurt people&rsquo;s feelings and arouse their resentment. However, for the sake of the truth, we must speak honestly. In regard to these two great divisions, we neither recognize them nor take part in them. We do not want to be people who belong to the Roman Catholic Church or people who belong to the Protestant church.</p>
<p>Second, we are not the so-called Brethren, either exclusive or open. Although we have been helped by the Brethren in many matters and resemble them in many respects, we are not the Brethren in the East; we are neither exclusive Brethren nor open Brethren.</p>
<p>Third, we are not a small free group that has left the Roman Catholic Church or the Protestant church. Small free groups do not have the definite ground of the church and are scattered everywhere. A group might be formed by a professor who leads a group of students to meet together, which then becomes a small &ldquo;church.&rdquo; Another group might be formed by a few believers meeting together because they share the same ambition and purpose, and this meeting also becomes a small &ldquo;church.&rdquo; Some small &ldquo;churches&rdquo; meet in the homes; other small &ldquo;churches&rdquo; meet in the alleys. They all say that they are nondenominational and that they do not belong to any organization of organized Christianity. But they are small groups which are scattered; we are not like this. We believe that the church has a definite ground. The ground of the church is oneness, and this oneness is expressed in a locality. This ground is definite. No matter what locality is involved, there should be only the ground of oneness. All the nondenominational brothers and sisters should come to this ground; all should be together in oneness to bear the testimony of the oneness of the church.</p>
<p>Fourth, we meet with the churches in different localities, and as such, we stand on the ground of the church, the ground of oneness, in our respective localities, serving in coordination according to the principle and by the nature of the local church to live out the proper life of the Body of Christ for the expression of the life of Christ as the testimony of the church. I repeat, we are (1) meeting in the local churches, (2) standing on the ground of the local church, (3) serving in coordination, (4) according to the principle of the local church, (5) by the nature of the local church, (6) to live out the proper life of the Body of Christ, (7) for the expression of the life of Christ, and (8) as the testimony of the church. These eight points are the nature and goal of our meetings.</p>
<p>Fifth, we acknowledge that the saved ones in any denomination and sect (including the Roman Catholic Church) are our brothers in the Lord and members of the Body of Christ. But we also believe that they have lost the ground of the church. They belong to the church, but their ground is not the ground of the church. The brothers and sisters in the denominations and the saved ones in the Roman Catholic Church all belong to the church, but they are not standing on the ground of the church. Who would acknowledge that the ground of the Roman Catholic Church is the ground of the church? The Roman Catholic Church has lost and damaged the ground of the church; the ground of the Roman Catholic Church is her particular ground, not the ground of the church. Nevertheless, within the Roman Catholic Church there are some truly saved ones! There are even some who love the Lord and who are spiritual. Although they belong to the church, they are not on the ground of the church. They are on the wrong ground. Similarly, within the Protestant churches there are many saved and spiritual ones, but they are not on the ground of the church.</p>
<p>I feel that many people have an unfair attitude; they do not recognize the Roman Catholic Church, but they recognize the Protestant church. However, in principle, is the Protestant church completely free of the errors of the Roman Catholic Church? The Protestant church also has the errors of the Roman Catholic Church; the difference is only in degree. In principle, both have lost the ground of the church. Therefore, just as we do not recognize the ground of the Roman Catholic Church, we do not recognize the ground of the Protestant church. We acknowledge, however, that there are saved ones in both the Roman Catholic and Protestant church and that there are also pious, spiritual persons and lovers of the Lord. We acknowledge these ones as our brothers and sisters; they all belong to the church. However, they are standing on the wrong ground. We deeply and earnestly hope that they would receive the Lord&rsquo;s grace and leading to leave these wrong grounds. It is not sufficient to be right only in their person; their ground also must be right. They need to return to the ground of the oneness of the church, that is, the ground of locality of the church, to bear the testimony of the church in oneness together with us for the Lord.</p></body></html>
