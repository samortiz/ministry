Christ Is Man</h2><p>The Bible, both in the Old and New Testaments, contains many passages which clearly reveal that Christ is man.</p><h2 class="head3">A. In the Old Testament</h2><p>The first prophecy in the Old Testament. concerning Christ says, &#147;And I will put enmity between thee [the serpent] and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel&#148; (Gen. 3:15). This verse prophesies that Christ, as the seed of the woman, will bruise the head of the old serpent, the devil. Later He actually was born of a woman (Gal. 4:4) and became the seed of woman; that is, He became a man, and through His death destroyed the devil (Heb. 2:14). This is the first place in the Scripture which speaks concerning Christ being a man. When God promised Abraham, &#147;And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed&#148; (Gen. 22:18), the promised seed He referred to was Christ (Gal. 3:16). Christ causes all the nations of the earth to be blessed. However, He needed to become the seed of Abraham, that is, to become a man so that the people on this earth could be blessed through Him. Hence, He actually became the seed of Abraham (Matt. 1:1) to become a man. Later in Genesis 26:4 and 28:14, God also gave Isaac and Jacob the same promise, saying that Christ would be their seed and that all the nations of the earth would be blessed in Him. These are prophecies concerning Christ becoming a man. Genesis 49:10 says, &#147;The sceptre shall not depart from Judah...until Shiloh come.&#148; &#147;Shiloh&#148; here, which means Peace-Giver, refers to Christ. This is a prophecy concerning Christ who was to become the seed of Judah, that is, to become a man-the Peace-Giver.</p><p>Moses prophesied to the Israelites, &#147;Jehovah thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me&#148; (Deut. 18:15, ASV). This Prophet of whom he prophesied is Christ (Acts 3:22-23). His word here shows us that in order for Christ to be this Prophet He needed to be one of the brethren of the Israelites, that is, He needed to become a man.</p><p>&#147;The fruit of the land&#148; is referred to in Isaiah 4:2. According to the first half of this verse, this phrase refers to Christ. Isaiah 11:1 says, &#147;And there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots&#148; (ASV). Based on the following verses 2 to 5, this word refers to Christ. He is a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a Branch out of his roots. This also means that the Lord needed to become a man. &#147;And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land&#148; (Isa. 32:2). Based on this passage in Isaiah we can see that &#147;a man&#148; is Christ. Christ who is our refuge is a man.</p><p>&#147;Behold my servant....A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench...&#148; (Isa. 42:1-4). Matthew 12:18-21 tells us that this speaks of the Lord Jesus. He, the servant of God, is a man. Taking the status of a man, He ministers to God as a servant.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Concerning the Person of Christ &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
