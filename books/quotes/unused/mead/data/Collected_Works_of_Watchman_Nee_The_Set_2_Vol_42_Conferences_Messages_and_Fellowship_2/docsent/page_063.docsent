   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE GOD'S WAY OF ACCOMPLISHING HIS PURPOSE IN CREATING MAN 2 Date: December 14, 1936, evening</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Foochow GOD'S ORIGINAL PURPOSE IN CREATING MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that God's purpose in creating man is that man would receive His life and become His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man was created according to God's image and likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As far as his outward appearance is concerned, man is like God already.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man is like God in both image and likeness, yet he does not have God's life within him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Man must receive God's life before he can reach God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Adam's spirit was not the Spirit of God, but the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If Adam's spirit had received God's Spirit, he would have received God's life and fulfilled God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are four kinds of spirits in this universe the spirit of the angels, the Spirit of God, the spirit of man, and evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The spirit is the faculty for worship.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lions are strong, and monkeys and dogs are clever, but they do not have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, they have no faculty to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are lower forms of creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man is between the angels and lower forms of animals.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The angels have a spirit and a soul, but no body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The lower forms of animals have a soul and a body, but no spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But man has a spirit and a soul, like the angels, and also a soul and a body, like the lower forms of animals.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The lower animals belong to one category of living beings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Man belongs to another category of living beings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's life is yet another category His life is much higher than our life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Was God's purpose fulfilled after man was created in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After God created everything, the Bible says, "And it was so."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But after man was created, it does not say, "And it was so," because the work was not completed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why the final word was not pronounced.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The final word had to be spoken by man himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, God put man in front of the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only after man made the right choice would God's purpose have been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>MAN'S FREE WILL</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God created man for the purpose of receiving and sharing His life to become His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man's spirit was made to contact God's Spirit and receive His life, become His son, and fulfill His purpose in creating man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet God gave man the right to choose; man has a free will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After He created man, God put man in front of two trees.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The created and completed man was sinless; he was innocent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God placed him in front of two trees, setting two principles before man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The tree of life represents dependence on God, whereas the tree of the knowledge of good and evil represents independence from God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These two trees represent two kinds of lives.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The tree of life represents the life of God, whereas the tree of the knowledge of good and evil represents Satan's sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When man rejected the tree of life, he rejected the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In effect, he was saying to God, "I do not want to take You.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I will be a man by myself."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>GOD'S PURPOSE BEING FRUSTRATED</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Genesis 2:17 God said, "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This word is not a word of punishment, but a description of a natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If one eats, his stomach will be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If one puts his hands to the fire, he will be burned these are laws.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If man eats of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he will die this also is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God did not say that man would be punished by death when he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God did not say this, and we, of course, cannot add such a footnote.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God only said that man would surely die when he ate of it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Conversely, if man did not eat of the tree of life, he still could not have been a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In God's eyes, he was still without life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God's purpose in creating man was that he would be His son.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For this reason He gave man a free will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He wants man to choose the tree of life and become His son by his own free will.</S>
