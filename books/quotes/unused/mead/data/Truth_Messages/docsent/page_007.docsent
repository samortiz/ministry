   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ARMED WITH THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church in the Lord s recovery must be full of life and strong in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church as the pillar is composed of all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, even the young sisters must know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the reason that I encourage everyone, especially the young people, to get into the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the divine facts are contained in the Word and conveyed to us through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the Spirit shines upon the Word, we have the heavenly television.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The light shines upon the facts in the Word, and we know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we should always be ready to rise up and practice the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From now on the whole church must be armed with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are all under the heavenly television regarding matters such as the constitution of the church, the headship of Christ, and hierarchy, the church will be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It will be not only a house of life, but also a pillar of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE BASE OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1 Timothy 3:15 the Apostle Paul says that the church is not only the pillar of the truth, but also the base of the truth Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>. A pillar, which is a standing column, needs a solid base.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Greek word for base in this verse actually means a bulwark, a solid structure that upholds the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the pillar of the truth, the church must also have a solid base, a strong bulwark.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A bulwark affords protection and defense, especially during a time of war.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church must be so solid in the truth that it will be a bulwark of the truth during times of fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This bulwark should be so solid that nothing, not even the bombs of the enemy, can shake it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The pillar rests upon such a bulwark.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to be the pillar and base of the truth, we all must be solid, strong, clear, and rich in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every local church must be a solid bulwark and a high pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In every locality the pillar must be built up higher and higher to testify the truth to the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>TRUTH BEING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although the Apostle John was absolutely for life and the Spirit, in his last two Epistles he did not emphasize life and the Spirit; instead, he emphasized the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 2 John 1 he speaks of loving in the truth and knowing the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the next verse, he says, For the truth s sake, which abideth in us, and shall be with us forever Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>. If you compare these verses with John 14:16 and 17, you will see that truth is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John 14:16 and 17 say that the Spirit of truth will be in us and that He will abide with us forever.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then 2 John 2 says that the truth abides in us and will be with us forever.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the truth is actually the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, 1 John 5:6 says, the Spirit is the truth Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>. THE SPIRIT AND THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must have both the Spirit and the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without the Bible, the Spirit cannot be the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to get into the Word so that we may have not only the Spirit, but also the Spirit of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually, this Spirit of truth is the truth itself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 3 John 4 the Apostle John says, I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in the truth Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>. In Romans 8, however, Paul tells us to walk according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Actually walking in the truth and walking according to the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we walk according to the Spirit, we are walking in the truth; and when we walk in the truth, we are walking according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Never try to separate the Spirit from the truth, for these two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Remember, apart from the Bible, the Spirit can be only the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only when the Spirit is one with the Bible is the Spirit the Spirit of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How we thank the Lord that in His economy He has given us both the Spirit and the Word!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Together these two constitute the Spirit of truth that sets us free and sanctifies us.</S>
