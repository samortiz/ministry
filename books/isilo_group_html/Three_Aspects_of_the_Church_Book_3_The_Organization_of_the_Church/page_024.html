<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING GIFTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Significance of Gifts</h2>
<p>In existence and expression, the church has two aspects: a universal aspect and a local aspect. In administration and spiritual building up, the church has offices and gifts. <em>Gifts</em> is a specialized term. It refers to such abilities as speaking as a prophet, healing sicknesses, casting out demons, or speaking in tongues. The Greek word for <em>gift</em> refers to something that is given freely to someone else. Romans 6:23, which uses the word <em>gift,</em> says, &ldquo;The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; The root of the word <em>gift</em> is very close to the word <em>grace;</em> hence, gift is a matter of grace. Gifts are given through grace. In other words, God solemnly gives us something without our paying a price. He freely bestows it upon us. This is a gift. A gift is not sold; it is given freely.</p>
<p>All gifts, whether they are for the church or for individuals, whether they are ordinary or miraculous, are given freely by God in grace to men. God gives gifts freely without requiring anything in return.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Gifts Being a Matter of Grace</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Source of Gifts Being Grace</h2>
<p>Offices are a matter of authority, whereas gifts are a matter of grace. Offices depend on authority; gifts depend on grace. Offices are appointed through authority; gifts are given through grace. If a person is not under authority, he will not have an office. If a person loses grace, he will not have a gift. Even though gifts are a matter of grace, there is still a distinction between gifts and grace. Grace is the source of gifts. Although some people may lose grace, they may continue to possess a gift. This is an abnormal condition. The normal condition is that every gift should be of grace.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Significance of Grace</h2>
<p>Grace is the source of gifts, but what is grace? Generally speaking, this question is difficult to answer. Nevertheless, through our study in the past few years, many saints should have a better understanding of this matter. In simple terms, grace is God giving Himself to us. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Then verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; Then verse 16 continues, &ldquo;For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.&rdquo; Based upon these words, we must confess that grace is God Himself.</p>
<p>All things and all matters in the universe are false. Only God Himself is real. The Bible never speaks of the good things and positive matters of this age as being grace. At most they are called the good things or blessings (Josh. 23:15; Jer. 18:10; Ezek. 44:30). In the Bible <em>grace</em> is a special term.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul said, &ldquo;By the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.&rdquo; What was the grace that was with the apostle Paul? It was the God gained and experienced by Paul. He was able to labor more abundantly than the other apostles because he gained and experienced God who was in him. The apostle often ended his Epistles with similar words. Philippians 4:23 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.&rdquo; Grace is with our spirit. This grace, which is with our human spirit, is the God whom we receive in our spirit. Simply put, grace in the New Testament is God Himself&mdash;that is, the Spirit of God, the life of God&mdash;being received by us. Second Timothy 2:1 says, &ldquo;You therefore, my child, be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; This grace is God received by us.</p>
<p>The grace spoken of in the New Testament is God; that is, God giving Himself, His Spirit, and His life to us for us to receive as grace. If we compare John 10, 14, 15, and 16 to chapter 1, we will see that God Himself is grace and that grace is the life of God, the Holy Spirit of God. John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; John 10:10 says, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life.&rdquo; This shows that life is equivalent to grace. Moreover, 16:7 says, &ldquo;It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.&rdquo; The Comforter is the Holy Spirit. After resurrecting, the Lord came into the midst of the disciples and breathed into them, saying, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (20:22). Thus, the Holy Spirit is grace, God Himself, and God&rsquo;s life, which is spoken of in chapter 1. Hence, the Holy Spirit of God whom we receive is grace.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 3, The Organization of the Church &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
