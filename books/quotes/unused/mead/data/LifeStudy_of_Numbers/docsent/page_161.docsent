   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This enemy had to be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Otherwise, when God's people were about to enter into the good land, the Midianites would have been behind them, and that would have caused serious trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This enemy had to be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, God charged Moses to destroy the Midianites.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A. The Midianites</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What do the Midianites signify?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In typology, the Midianites signify the filthiness of the lust of the flesh, which is related to the devil Satan and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With the flesh there is lust, and with lust there is filthiness, defilement, which is related to Satan and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Old Testament gives us a picture of the Midianites.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Midianites were descendants of Abraham, born of his second wife, Keturah.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, by nature they were close to the Israelites in the flesh Gen 25:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Midianites were united with the Moabites, the descendants of Lot through incest in the lust of the flesh Num 22:3-4, 7; Gen 19:30-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, the Midianites were one with the Ishmaelites, the descendants of Abraham by the flesh, who sold Joseph into Egypt Gen 37:27-28, 36 .</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to realize that as we are pursuing the Lord's interests, there is an enemy the filthiness of the lust of the flesh signified by the Midianites right behind us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This enemy has a number of evil relatives and associates.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Moreover, with this enemy, this filthiness, a false prophet is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This false prophet seeks to ensnare us and frustrate us from fulfilling God's desire.</S>
