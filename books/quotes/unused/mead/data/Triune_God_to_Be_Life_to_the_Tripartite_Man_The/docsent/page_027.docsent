   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>As the Spirit of Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As such a compound Spirit, He is the Spirit of life Rom 8:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The ingredients of creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension have been compounded together in this one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now, this Spirit is the Spirit of life, waiting to be received and contained by the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Imparting the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>to the Believers of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit of life imparts the divine life to the believers of Christ 2 Cor 3:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We receive the Spirit of life by exercising our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we exercise our spirit, immediately the compound Spirit, who is the Spirit of life and the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , enters into our spirit, imparting the divine life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE TRIPARTITE MAN BEING CREATED</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>WITH A SPIRIT TO BE THE RECEIVER</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>AND CONTAINER OF THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Triune God as the life-giving Spirit desires to give life to man, but if man did not have a spirit to receive and contain Him, the Triune God would be unable to give life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rain may fall on a stone for many hours, but the stone will be unable to receive the water, because it does not have a proper receiver to receive the water.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, if rain falls on a sponge, after a short time the water will soak and saturate the sponge, because the sponge has a proper receiver for the water.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, the sponge will be mingled with the water.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This illustrates how man with his spirit is a receiver and a container for the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Life is the mingling of God as the Spirit with man in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, many people confuse life with virtues such as humility, meekness, or gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many of the students of Confucius are very humble and meek, but their humility and meekness are a matter of outward character.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Life is God processed to be a life-giving Spirit to be received by the tripartite man, who was created with a spirit as the receiver and container of the Spirit, who is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Life is God as the Spirit mingling Himself with us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In actual fact, we have such a mingling, but in our daily life we may not experience this mingling in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may live in a way that annuls the mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we sense that the mingling has ceased, we must confess to the Lord and receive the cleansing of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then, the anointing will return and the mingling will continue.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Life is the very Triune God, in whom we believe, whom we serve, whom we worship, and whom we exalt, processed to be a life-giving Spirit to be received by us, the tripartite men, who have been created with a spirit to be the receiver and container of the divine Spirit as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This life does not know what it is to be humble or proud, good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Life does have a number of attributes, and humility is one of these attributes; however, the humility of life is not something of human conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we ask, "What should we do?" we are not in life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Life is as spontaneous as breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are in life, without any intention we will simply live out the attributes of life.</S>
