   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Healing of Peter s Mother-in-law</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verses 14 and 15 say, And when Jesus had come into Peter s house, He saw his mother-in-law laid aside and in a fever; and He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and ministered to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Peter s mother-in-law represents the Jews at the end of this age who will be saved by receiving the kingly Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At that time, during the great tribulation, in the eyes of God the Jews will be in a fever v. 14 , hot in things other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The kingly Savior, after the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, will come back to this remnant of Jews that they might be saved Rom 11:25-26; Zech 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Peter s mother-in-law was healed in Peter s house, which represents the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the end of this age all the remnant of the Jews will be saved in the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They will also be saved by the kingly Savior s direct touch v. 15 , as the Jewish leper was v. 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the end of this age salvation will come back from the Gentiles to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, it will not come back to the scattered Jews, but to the Jews in the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time the Jews will be sick of a fever.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is even true of the Jews today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>So many of them are fervent in science, in finance, in education, and in all manner of worldly pursuits.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But in the eyes of God all this is a fever.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The temperature of the Jews today is very high in their fervency for politics, industry, agriculture, and warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are represented by the feverish mother-in-law of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in their heat and fervency they neither trust in God nor care for morality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Just as the Lord healed Peter s mother-in-law, so will He come back again at the end of this age to heal the Jews who will be fervent, burning, and sick of a fever.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He will not heal them through their faith, but through His direct touch.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the Lord s second coming, the Jews will be directly touched by His arrival and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Immediately after Peter s mother-in-law was healed, she arose and ministered to the Lord v. 15 . This signifies that at the Lord s coming back, the remnant of the Jews, after being saved, will arise and minister to Him in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>D. Healing of Many Restoration</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 16 says, And when evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed, and He cast out the spirits with a word and healed all those who were ill.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The words many and all those represent all the people on earth in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The millennium will be the last dispensation of the old heaven and old earth; thus it is considered the evening of the old heaven and old earth.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, all the demon-possessed and all the sick will be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The prophecies of Isaiah testify of this Isa 35:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That will be a real restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The casting out of demons and the healing of the sick in this age are just a foretaste of the extensive power of the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 16, after the Lord had healed Peter s mother-in-law, when evening had come, He healed many who were demon-possessed and all who were ill.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>During that period of time, all sicknesses will be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, the signs recorded in verses 2 through 17 have a dispensational significance.</S>
