   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION FOUR THE CALL OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AFTER RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>5:2 6:13 I. THE CROSS AFTER RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND THE MAIDEN'S FAILURE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>5:2 6:3 A. The Calling 5:2</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Song of Songs 5:2 says, "I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By this time, her own work and life have ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She is like one who is asleep; there is no further activity, work, endeavoring, struggle, effort, or anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She is perfectly at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The cross has not only dealt with all her sins, but has dealt with all her flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sin is no longer active, and the self is no longer active.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The whole outward man has been brought to a state of cessation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even when she does something, she does not feel that she is doing it herself; she feels that she is a bystander.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Indeed, she is asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But this does not mean that she is completely motionless, thoughtless, void of belief and activity, and void of work and living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The resurrection life of the Lord is in her, and the resurrected Lord Himself is dwelling and living within her through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the outward man is silent, the inward man is active.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here we see a complete separation between the outward man and the inward man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Outwardly we can be asleep, but inwardly we are awake and are not sleepy at all.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This matches Paul's word, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the expression of perfect fellowship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A person who is perfectly one with the Lord is very quick, alert, and full of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He can feel even the slightest voice or movement of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The inner man never sleeps.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever the Lord speaks, the maiden immediately hears, and she immediately identifies the voice of her beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What does the Lord do now?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He "knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this book, the Lord first revealed Himself as the King because He is after the throne in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then He was a caller, leading the maiden out of the inner walls into the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Finally, He reveals Himself as the Bridegroom, having a perfect love relationship with the maiden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now a completely different revelation is unveiled: "My head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What kind of picture is this?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is clearly His experience at Gethsemane.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There His head was indeed filled with dew!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That night His head was filled with the drops of the night Luke 22:44 !</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here He reveals Himself as a son of sorrows.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the past, we saw the cross for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We also saw the cross for identification.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have seen the suffering and death of the cross, and we have seen how the cross delivers us from the world and self.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have seen the victory at the cross and our conformation to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After a believer has seen these things, he may think that he has reached the peak experience and that he will then advance step by step toward resurrection and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Little does he realize that there is another aspect of the cross that he has not experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even if he has a little experience in this area, it is very shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although he knows about the suffering of the cross, he does not know the extent of the suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although he has realized the conformation, that is, the molding of the cross, he does not know what shape this mold will conform him to.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord now calls His believers to go through an experience of the cross that they have never before experienced, or that they have only experienced in a shallow way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The garden of Gethsemane speaks of God's rejection and everything associated with this rejection Isa 53:4b .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may understand the redemptive aspect of the cross, but there is still the aspect of His outward rejection by God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This aspect subjected Him to extreme shame.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Of all the previous sufferings, we can still find some glory in them, because God is still there.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But He was not only rejected by man, but was seemingly rejected by God as well.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It seems as if everything that came upon Him was a chastisement from God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because of God's smiting, He was rejected, and this was the greatest shame He bore.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord does not invite us to participate in His redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But He charges us to have fellowship with Him in the other aspects of His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The problems we encountered in the past revolved around sin, the world, Satan, and the natural self.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although we encountered the suffering and conformation of the cross, we were completely unfamiliar with God's rejection and man's shame.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now the Lord is knocking and saying, "Open to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that He calls every believer to open up their heart to Him once again and to receive once again the Lord who is filled with the drops of the night.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The maiden must still learn what it means to be rejected by God and to suffer the deeper misunderstanding and shame of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He calls her "sister;" He beckons the life of God within her.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>"My love" indicates her knowledge of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>"My dove" speaks of the nature of the Holy Spirit, while "my undefiled" speaks of her purity, chastity, and consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, He does not say "my spouse," because He is waiting for her to answer Him before He can be assured of her status as a spouse, one who is in complete union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord begs her to open herself.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Previously, she opened herself to receive the Lord as King.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now the Lord wants her to open herself and receive Him as a son of sorrows.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now the Lord leads her into the deepest aspect of a life of suffering together with Him and in conformation to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Yet the Lord will never force anyone to take a way that he does not want to take.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, He will only knock and ask; He has to wait until the believers become willing in themselves.</S>
