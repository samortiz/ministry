   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE THE PLACE OF WOMEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God made man for expression; God made woman for storage.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God made man a type of doctrine, and woman a type of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All doctrines are typified by man; all experiences are typified by woman.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, Abraham typifies the doctrine of justification by faith, while Sarah typifies obedience and submission, which are experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man represents objective doctrine, and woman represents subjective experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul said, "Does not even nature itself teach you..."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1 Cor 11:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nature teaches many things, not just things about hair.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are certain things that are beautiful in a man, but these same things are ugly in a woman, and vice versa.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today there are many womanly men and many manly women.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A masculine woman and an effeminate man are monsters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The question is not whether a woman can express herself in the meeting, such as prophesying, etc. The question is whether or not she is standing on her ground as a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She can prophesy, but she should prophesy with her head covered, i.e., standing in her position as a woman, not standing in a position as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a woman takes a man's position, she loses something womanly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is all right for a woman to prophesy, but she must prophesy as a woman.</S>
