   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FINE FLOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we must see something of the ingredients of the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have mentioned, the main substance is the fine flour, which is derived from the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Bible, the vegetable life always refers to the Lord's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a man, the Lord Jesus is so perfect, even as fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Fine flour is perfect in its evenness, its fineness, its tenderness, and in its gentleness, thus revealing the balance and evenness of the Lord's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some sisters are a little too emotional, and some brothers are a little too mental.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some sisters are so emotional that it seems they never think at all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some brothers, on the other hand, think too much.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever you talk with them, they turn their eyes a strong proof that they are exercising their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have seen some brothers who are so cold that they cannot even laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means they are not fine, not balanced, and not even; neither are they tender and gentle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the Lord Jesus in His humanity is so fine, so even, so tender, and so gentle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When it was time for joy, He was joyful John 11:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When it was time for tears, He wept John 11:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a man He was so finely balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes He was bold in rebuking the evil ones, but He was not rough Matt 21:12-13; 23:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was still fine and even.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I do not have adequate utterance to speak about the perfect humanity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is better to pray-read the four Gospels once more with this point in view.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we will see the fineness of all His behavior in His human living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is this perfect Christ who constitutes our present to God in the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not a gift from God to us, but a present from us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we come to the church meeting, we need to offer such a perfect Christ in His humanity as a kind of present to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can say, "Father, here is a dear present for You, and this present is just the man Jesus in His humanity."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God will be so pleased to receive such a present.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is no wonder that God is perfect, but that a man is perfect is an astounding fact.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Praise the Lord that upon the earth among the human race there was a man so perfect, so even, so fine, and so tender!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was just like the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is Jesus, the man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nothing could be so dear and precious to God as a present to Him of the humanity of Jesus in the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our present to God must be the man Jesus whom we appreciate, enjoy, and experience all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A MEMORIAL AND A SWEET SAVOR</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Leviticus 1, we cannot find the word "memorial."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But this word is used many times in chapter two concerning the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Its significance is greater than that of satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you are not satisfied with something, you can never have a memorial of it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when you are exceedingly satisfied with something, it becomes a continual memorial to you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the man Jesus, the perfect man, the fine man, presented to God by us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the greatest satisfaction to God, and this satisfaction eventually becomes a memorial to God forever.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here in Los Angeles we have been enjoying Christ so much, and I believe that as we experience the man Jesus more and more, we will have such a dear present to God in our church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This will become an eternal memorial to God, and even to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I believe that in eternity, we will still remember the enjoyment that we had of the humanity of Jesus on Elden Avenue in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is better than satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The words "sweet savor" are also used concerning the meal offering unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some versions translate this as "fragrance of rest."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a sweet odor that causes God to be so restful.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we present the man Jesus from our experience as a real present to God, this will become a sweet odor, a restful fragrance, and a satisfying savor.</S>
