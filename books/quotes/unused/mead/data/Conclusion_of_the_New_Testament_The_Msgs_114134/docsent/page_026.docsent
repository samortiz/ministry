   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Such Believing Is the Faith</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Given by God as a Gift</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our believing is a gift given to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that faith is something initiated by God, formed by Him, and given to us by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, it is of God that we could believe through hearing the word of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ephesians 2:8 says, By grace you have been saved through faith; and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Faith is the substantiating of invisible things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is by faith that we substantiate all the things Christ has accomplished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through such a substantiating ability, we have been saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The free action of God s grace saved us through our substantiating faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ephesians 2:8 indicates that faith is not of our works, nor of our endeavor or strife; rather, faith is God s gift, that no one should boast v. 9 . Faith is not of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although we believe, the faith with which we believe does not originate with us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In ourselves, we do not have any faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, at the time we repented and made confession to God in the name of the Lord Jesus, the believing ability was put into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before we were saved, we were utterly unable to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But on the day we were saved faith was imparted to us, and we believed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although we have never seen the Lord Jesus, we cannot help believing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This faith is not of ourselves but is part of the grace transmitted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Faith is actually an aspect of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the reason the New Testament speaks of the faith of Christ Rom 3:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, The life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Faith is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The faith which is given to us is the faith common to all believers Titus 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Faith is given, faith is received, and faith is common.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we put all these facts together, we see that this faith is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our faith in Christ comes not out of us but out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have faith in Christ because He is absolutely believable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we appreciate Christ, faith is imparted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, it is not unreasonable to say that faith is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is like saying that holiness, love, righteousness, patience, and endurance are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because the unique faith is Christ Himself, we who believe in Him have a common faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You do not have one kind of faith and I, another kind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Christ came to you, you believed; and when He came to me, I believed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever Christ comes to a person, that person believes in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a further indication that faith comes not out of us but out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because faith is a gift of God and is not of our works, none of us has the right to boast.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the contrary, we all should humbly thank the Lord and praise Him that we have received Him as our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>1 Through the Divine Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>of the Word of the Truth in the New Testament, Conveying as Its Contents the All-inclusive Christ</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>in His All-inclusive Person</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>and His All-inclusive Work as Scenery to Our View</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The faith which is the gift of God is through the divine revelation of the word of the truth in the New Testament economy, conveying as its contents the all-inclusive Christ in His all-inclusive person and His all-inclusive work as scenery to our view.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God forms the gift of faith and gives it to us through the divine revelation of the word of truth in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The whole Bible reveals Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Especially the book of Revelation, as the conclusion, completion, and consummation of the whole Bible, is the revelation of Jesus Christ Rev 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Through the preaching of the gospel, the all-inclusive Christ in His all-inclusive person and work was presented as scenery to our view.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we heard the gospel, we heard the speaking of the word of the truth of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As this speaking was taking place, a revelation came to us conveying the all-inclusive Christ as the scenery for us to view.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may say that we were a camera, that our spirit was the film, and that the divine revelation as the scenery was the object to be photographed.</S>
