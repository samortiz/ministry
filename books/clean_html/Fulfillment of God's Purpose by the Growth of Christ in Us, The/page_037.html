<P>After the eternal God accomplished creation, incarnation, crucifixion for redemption, resurrection, and ascension, He came down as the wind to blow through the whole earth. This wind includes everything that the Triune God has accomplished and attained. Within the wind are the elements of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and Christ's enthronement with His kingship, headship, and lordship. When He came down as the blowing wind to sweep through the whole earth, all these elements were within Him. In a sense, today He is still blowing and sweeping. We came into the Lord's recovery because of the blowing and sweeping wind. Today we are full of joy because we are under the blowing and the sweeping of the divine wind.</P><P>He came as the divine wind to baptize His chosen ones in the Spirit. He put all of His chosen people from the Jewish race and from the Gentiles into Himself. This is the baptism accomplished on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius (Acts 2:1-4; 10:44-45). We were all baptized there. Before we were born, we were crucified and regenerated. In the same principle, we were also baptized. The baptism in the Holy Spirit has been absolutely and completely accomplished. Through this baptism, the new man was born and the Body was produced. First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free..." Before we were born, we all were baptized. In the eyes of God, the Body has been produced, the new man has been born, and the New Jerusalem is already in existence. This is why the apostle John said in Revelation that he saw it (21:2). This is why the Bible says, "It is finished!" (John 19:30). Everything has been accomplished.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ENJOYING THE TRIUNE GOD WITH ALL<br>HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND ATTAINMENTS<br>IN OUR SPIRIT FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</H2><P>We need to see this vision. We have God, the creation, the incarnation, human living, crucifixion for redemption, burial, resurrection, the breathing of the Spirit, ascension, enthronement, and the descent of the Spirit as the wind to accomplish the baptism. Now the Body has been produced, the new man has been born, and the New Jerusalem is here. We are the human beings under the blowing of the divine wind. When we are in our spirit, we are one with this wind, this divine Person, and we are one with one another. But when we remain in our soul, that is, our mind, will, and emotion, we cannot have the church life. Instead, we are insulated from Christ and from the members of the Body of Christ.</P><P>The way to be recovered back to our spirit for the church life is by calling on the name of the Lord&#151;"O Lord Jesus." The more we call on the name of the Lord, the more we will be filled with Him. As we are filled with Him, the church life will spontaneously spread and there will be an increase in life and in number. When our mind, will, and emotion are flooded and filled with Christ as the Spirit, we will have the powerful, living church life. This church life is connected with the Triune God and all His accomplishments and attainments. In this church life, we enjoy the Triune God with His incarnation, human living, crucifixion for redemption, resurrection, and ascension. We also enjoy the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and the life-giving Spirit as the breath and the wind. The church life is so rich, because the church life is one with the Triune God and all His accomplishments and attainments.</P>
