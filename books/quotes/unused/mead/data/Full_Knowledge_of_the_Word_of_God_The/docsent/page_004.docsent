   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD DESIRING ALL MEN TO COME TO THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was raised in Christianity and participated in three denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I studied in a Baptist elementary school and also went to a Baptist Sunday School.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then I gained some further learning in the Chinese Christian Presbyterian Church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Later, I went to the Brethren Assembly to learn the truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time the Brethren Assembly was very famous in northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I attended their meetings five times a week, rain or shine, for seven and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I heard many sermons, and in these sermons the phrase "God desires all men to be saved" was often repeated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, I never heard anyone tell me that God not only desires all men to be saved, but He also desires all men to come to the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Chinese Union Version, the translation of 1 Timothy 2:4 is, "Who will have all men to be saved and know the true principle."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The "true principle" here is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot say that "know" is a wrong translation, but it does not bring out the full meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the original text this word, epignosis, is derived from a verb, epiginosko.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The prefix of this word, epi, means "exactly, completely, through and through."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This word indicates not merely a little knowledge but a thorough and complete knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many Christians pay attention only to "God desires all men to be saved" and neglect the other part of God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After we are saved, whether or not we will be useful vessels in God's hand depends on our attitude toward the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we know only a little of the truth, there will be a great lack.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God surely desires all men to be saved, but He does not stop there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He also desires that all men come to the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not only in Christianity, but even among us, there are some who have been attending meetings for many years but who cannot give a complete message on any point of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What a pity!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BEING ABLE TO APPREHEND THE TRUTH AND ALSO TO PUT IT INTO WORDS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When brothers and sisters stand up to speak in the meetings, we can discern from their speaking the measure of the truth that is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is often possible to determine a person's educational level from his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, even now I still recognize a few brothers and sisters who met with us in 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am afraid that if you were to ask them to give a ten minute message on God's justification, they would not be able to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everyone is able to stand up and give a testimony, but when we ask many of the saints to speak the truth, they are not able to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is for this reason that we must change the system.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the United States I told some people that, during the time from 1962 until today, a period of almost twenty-three years, their sons had graduated from college, but they, the parents, could not even give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the spiritual sense, they had not even graduated from elementary school.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is where we have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brothers and sisters, here in Taiwan we also have been meeting together for more than thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How many of you can stand up and speak concisely, clearly, simply, understandably, and thoroughly for five to ten minutes?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I doubt very much that I can find even one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we cannot speak spiritual words, how can we go out to supply life, release the truth, and preach the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will only be able to tell people, "It is very good to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you believe, you will have joy and peace; therefore, you must believe."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we need to speak further concerning the benefits of believing, we can only say, "Come and see.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Come and listen, and you will know.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You can only know these things by experience; I cannot tell you in words how good it is."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If it cannot be put into words, how can I tell you about it, and how did you hear about it?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The reason that you cannot put it into words is that you did not learn how to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many brothers and sisters in the United States were moved by the Lord and began to form gospel teams.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Two or three teams began to go out to preach the gospel on many university campuses in many states.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I had told them before that, even though the United States is a country of high education, the gospel that has been preached there is still elementary.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It speaks either about going up to heaven, about going down to hell, or about peace and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But the truth in the Bible is high.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because of this, I told them that they should go out to preach the high gospel, the gospel that people cannot help but receive.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, they always had a question: "Do you think that people will understand these things that we speak?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In answer to this I said, "Do not say that people cannot understand.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not that they cannot understand but that you do not know how to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you can speak, they will understand."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These words encouraged them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They formed gospel teams and preached the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The result was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When they came back to give a report, they all were excited and said, "It is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The students on the university campuses welcomed this subject the most.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One by one they were saved because of this subject."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How do you explain this?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, we must change our concept.</S>
