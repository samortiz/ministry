<h2 class="head1">A FEW REMINDERS</h2><p>In dealing with the brothers and sisters, you have to act in the principle of "two or three." If the feeling of the whole church is to deal with a certain brother, it will be easy to touch such a person's conscience.</p><p>The responsible brothers must learn to be bold on the one hand and to be in fear on the other hand. They must not be loose with themselves. When the Holy Spirit is in control and He wants you to be bold, you can be bold. When the Holy Spirit is in control, no one will dare be loose even if you allow him to be loose. Some brothers make mistakes all the time, but when they come to the meeting, they do not make any mistakes. The difference lies in the control of the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit is in control, even wrong things can be turned right. Those with little faith often hold the meetings tightly in their hands and do not let go. But you have to learn to allow the Holy Spirit to have the full authority. Do not keep everything in your own hand.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING SANITATION</h2><p>Concerning the cup that is passed around during the table meeting, some have asked if we should disinfect it a little before passing it on to the next person. Even if the air is disinfected, it will contain many germs after an hour. From the hygienic point of view, this matter is a hard call. We have three doctors here; they are the director of the Health Department, the director of the Army Medical Department, and the principal of a medical school. I believe they can give us a clear understanding of the subject. For example, Dr. Mei said that he is not afraid of drinking from the same cup because he believes that God is sovereign to keep germs away from us. Even if we touch the germs, we will not be infected. In His divine arrangement, God has not ordained that man isolate himself from germs. We have germs around us everywhere, and those who are healthy are not harmed by them. We should fear not, but only believe (Mark 5:36). But we should allow those who are weak in faith to do what they want to do. We should not condemn or stop them.</p><p>If a person is sick, we can ask him to sit in the last row. This is for the sake of practicing brotherly love. We have to take care of those who are weak in faith. This is not a legal requirement. If any outsider who smokes comes, we can ask him to sit in the last row in order that the weak brothers and sisters will not be affected. This is like a family with a son who has tuberculosis. When he speaks, others have to cover their mouths. Of course, the parents love the children and want to be close to them, but neither do they want the whole family to get tuberculosis. Our brothers and sisters have to learn from the Lord Jesus, who in His compassion touched the leper with His hand (Mark 1:40-42). We have to believe in the power of the Lord's protection. We should not be afraid of infection. If we do not have faith, we can be infected anytime, not just through drinking from the cup. Men living near the North Pole can die from the cold, but no one dies of a cold. Cold viruses are everywhere, but not everyone who comes in contact with them catches a cold. We have to believe and trust in the Lord's protection.</p><h2 class="head1">A QUESTION OF CHURCH SERVICE</h2><p>Witness Lee:The responsible brothers have to pay attention to the standard of the church service. If they set the standard too high, they may create a problem. Some problems arising in the service must be dealt with according to general spiritual principles. When a problem arises, it cannot be dealt with as an isolated case. There are, of course, exceptions when things that do not edify the saints occur in the church. But if such things happen again and again, something must be wrong within the church or with the leading brothers. If something happens only occasionally, there is no need to pay too much attention to it. But if it happens again and again, something is wrong. Therefore, this is not a matter of dealing with isolated cases. It is not a matter of dealing with things case by case. The elders have to make confessions before the Lord. They have to be dealt with, to receive enlightenment, and to follow the spiritual principles. When the immune system of the church is strong, it will not worry about germs.</p><p>Hong Kong is a civilized country. If the service in the church is strong, many problems associated with modern civilization can be overcome. The responsible brothers should turn the saints' attention to the big things. Do not pay too much attention to the small and secondary things. If we can show the saints something more important than hygiene in the church, their attention will be turned. Once a man is enlightened by the heavenly light, he will not be bound by earthly worries.</p><p>In Shanghai we have a lady who grew up in a very protected environment. She is like a bulb in a little pot; no one can touch her. Such kind of people get sick very easily. Those who are used to a rough and rugged life, however, can overcome many sicknesses. Sickness is a tool of Satan; he applies it especially to those who are weak. We are not talking about hygiene. If the church is heavenly and strong, it will transcend earthly hygiene and human weaknesses.</p><p>Brother Chien's concern is mostly a psychological fear. His inward spiritual capacity is not big enough. This is the reason he is worried about physical hygiene. Those who are spiritually strong judge things according to the science of spirituality. Those who are spiritually strong can sleep with the dead, put their mouth upon his mouth, their eyes upon his eyes, and their hands upon his hands (2 Kings 4:32-35). But those who are spiritually weak can only weep before the dead (Mark 5:38). We have to learn to be strong in our spirit and learn to transcend all physical and fleshly limitations.</p>
