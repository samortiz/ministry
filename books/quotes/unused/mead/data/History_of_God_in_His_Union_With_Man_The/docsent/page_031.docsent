   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SAVING MAN FROM HIS FALL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man became fallen to such a miserable state.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Surely such a fallen man could do nothing to help himself out of such a fallen state.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only the wise and almighty God could afford a full and dynamic salvation to the man created by Him and spoiled by His adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, He, as the unchanging and everlasting God, could not have any change in annulling His eternal economy which He made in His Divine Trinity in eternity past and for eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He had to rescue the man whom He had created for His unchanging purpose, and He did it!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, what God created for His purpose according to His good pleasure was a wonderful, excellent, marvelous, and precious man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the eyes of God, man in his original created state was most excellent, marvelous, and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may even say that in Genesis 2 man became God's pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, God loved man John 3:16 !</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He would save him at any cost, even at the cost of sacrificing His only begotten Son!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why even in eternity past Christ as the Second of the Divine Trinity was preparing to come into time Micah 5:2 to die for fallen man according to the divine determination made in the council of the Divine Trinity in eternity past Acts 2:23 and note 1; 1 Pet 1:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, God came in to save man from his fall.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Genesis 3 tells us that God came to visit the man whom He had created and who had become fallen and lost.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God came to Adam after his fall, He called to Adam, saying, "Where are you?" v. 9 . It was as if God were saying, "Where are you? You have become lost, so I have come to seek you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have become fallen, so I have come to rescue you."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That was God's visitation to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was the first case of "door knocking" in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God was knocking on Adam's door to visit Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man had not yet invented physical dwelling places, so there was not a physical door on which God could knock.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But God came to knock on the door of Adam's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He came to seek Adam because Adam had become lost.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When God found Adam, He had a kind of gospel conversation, gospel talk, with him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first gospel talk is recorded in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first lesson for those who intend to visit people with the gospel is in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should learn how to talk to a fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first thing God uttered was, "Where are you?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Adam responded by saying, "I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself" v. 10 . This indicates that when we talk to the sinners whom we visit, we have to spend some time to help them realize where they are.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need wisdom to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The way is not to tell them where they are but to let them tell us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God was very clear where Adam was, but God would not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead He asked, "Adam, where are you?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Adam told his story to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then God preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first thing in the preaching of the gospel is to condemn the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The serpent was cursed by God in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God said to the serpent, "Thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life" v. 14 . This indicates that formerly Satan, the serpent, was standing and walking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now he is cursed to go upon his belly along the earth and cursed to eat the dust.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now he is altogether something belonging to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In God's condemnation of Satan, He gave Satan a limitation: he cannot move above the earth, and he cannot eat anything except dust.</S>
