   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN TO KNOW THE POWER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF HIS RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall continue to dwell on Philippians 3:10, one of the great verses in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse speaks of four things: knowing Christ, knowing the power of His resurrection, knowing the fellowship of His sufferings, and being conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, four things are included in this verse: Christ, the power of His resurrection, the fellowship of His sufferings, and the conformity to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not many Christians have a proper understanding of the power of Christ's resurrection or the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many do not even know much about His sufferings, knowing only that He suffered during His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But this verse speaks of sufferings, not suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Knowing Christ, knowing the power of His resurrection, knowing the fellowship of His sufferings, and being conformed to His death are all related to our experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we would experience Christ, we must know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Knowing Him depends on how much we know the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, knowing the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings is vital in our knowing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The New Testament clearly reveals that resurrection, especially the resurrection of Christ, is related to death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Without death, there is no need of resurrection and no opportunity for resurrection to be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to know the power of resurrection, we must enter into a death situation and remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since it is necessary to be in death in order to know the power of resurrection, we must understand what it means to be in death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A CRUCIFIED LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this understanding, we need to consider the record of the life of the Lord Jesus as found in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Gospels are not merely an account of stories, lessons, teachings, or examples, but a record of a Person who is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the record of the Gospels, His life is a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not only was Christ crucified when He was put on the cross; before He was put on the cross, He lived under the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, He continually lived a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that He always put Himself under the death of the cross that He might be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ was constantly being crucified; nevertheless, He lived.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Galatians 2:20 says, "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this verse there are three significant words: nevertheless...yet...but.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, Paul said, "I have been crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be crucified is to be terminated and slain.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although Paul had been crucified with Christ, nevertheless he lived, yet not Paul, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This "nevertheless...yet...but" is the Christian life.</S>
