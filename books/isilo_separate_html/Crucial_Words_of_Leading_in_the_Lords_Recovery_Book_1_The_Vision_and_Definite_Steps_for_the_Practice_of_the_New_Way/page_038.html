<h1 class="title">THE PRACTICE OF THE HOME MEETINGS</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that we can be here to seek Your leading. You know that our inner being is in fear and trembling; we are afraid of losing Your presence and of either walking ahead of You or behind You. Lord, be in our midst and give us a deep impression so that we may clearly touch, and carry out as well, all that You want us to do. Save us from vanity and mistakes. Lord, may we not regret what we are doing today; instead, may it be of eternal value.</p>
<p>Lord, cleanse all of us that we may exercise our spirit to receive Your leading. We do not want to receive man&rsquo;s teaching or leading, we want to receive Your leading. Lord, You are the Head of the church. We pray that You would visit Your church, Your Body. We are members one of another, and we desperately need Your operating. Lord, we confess that we are weak, empty, and useless, and many of our activities, views, and feelings have become veils to us and restrictions, hindrances, to You. Lord, deliver us in these matters that we may enter into You to touch Your heart&rsquo;s intent.</p>
<p>Lord, give us the words and the utterance. As we speak and fellowship, make Your intention known to us so that we may touch the desire of Your heart, and be the testimony of Your heart&rsquo;s desire in this age. Lord, cleanse us and cover us with Your prevailing blood; draw the limit for us and do not allow Your enemy to overstep. Day by day spread a table before us in the presence of our adversaries. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL STEPS FOR THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship about the home meetings. First, Acts 2 says that immediately after the three thousand were saved on the day of Pentecost, they had meetings from house to house. They did not meet as small groups but met from house to house. Second, when we speak of meeting in a group, it seems as if the group can be either large or small, depending on our preference. But when we speak of meeting in a house, in a family, no one can increase or decrease the size of a house, a family, at will. Third, a home is the smallest corporate unit. If our promoting of a certain matter can reach the homes, we would have done a thorough job. Therefore, we are not subdividing merely into small groups; we are subdividing with the home as a unit. A year and a half ago I said that we needed to work to the point that there is a meeting in every saint&rsquo;s home. It should not be that only those who are strong and aggressive have meetings in their homes, whereas those who are weak, backslidden, and attend meetings infrequently do not. We hope that every home will have a meeting, including the homes of the weak and inactive ones.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Delivering Meetings to the Homes</h2>
<p>Someone may ask, &ldquo;If a certain saint has stopped meeting, how can we have a meeting in his home?&rdquo; It is because he has stopped meeting that we need to establish a meeting in his home, to &ldquo;deliver&rdquo; the meeting to his home. He has stopped meeting because he does not have a meeting at home. If there is a meeting in his home, naturally he will meet. For most of the saints, as long as a meeting is established in their homes, it will not be a problem for them to meet. Hence, the best way to recover a saint who has stopped meeting is to deliver the meeting to his home instead of asking him to come to a meeting. We need only to meet in his home once, and he will begin meeting again. Therefore, the problem with non-meeting saints is that we do not deliver the meetings to their homes. We bear the responsibility. I hope we will all have a change in concept. Instead of dragging the saints and forcing them to come to a meeting, we should bring the meeting to their homes. Suppose we invite someone to our home for a meal. If he cannot come, we should deliver the food to him so that he can at least taste the food. I cannot guarantee that the non-meeting saints will be revived immediately, but if the brothers and sisters are willing to coordinate with one another to deliver the meeting to the homes, at least there is a great possibility for them to begin meeting again. We must carry this out.</p>
<p>Another advantage of delivering meetings to the homes is that it solves family disputes. Perhaps a saint has stopped meeting for no reason other than family disputes. The longer he stays away from the meetings, the more serious the quarrels between him and his wife become, and the more he loses his heart to meet. A wife who has stopped meeting for eighteen years might have been crying out for help the entire time but has been unable to find any help. Suppose one day some of the saints bring the meeting to her home; as a result of their singing and praying with her, she is nourished and filled with joy. Then she might pray, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on us, and have mercy on my husband so that he could also enjoy You as I do.&rdquo; Moreover, if this sister has not been meeting for eighteen years, her children must not have been meeting as well. Now through our bringing the meeting to her home, the children also are joyful to receive salvation. In this way we reap several benefits with a single action.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago the medical field in Taiwan practiced making house calls to give injections; now we need to practice to deliver meetings to the homes. If we deliver the meeting to the homes, not only will the inactive saints be recovered, but their friends and relatives will also be given a great opportunity to receive the gospel of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. If we are willing to practice this delivery of meetings to ten homes per week, I believe that at least five homes will be raised up. At present there are at least six thousand non-meeting saints in about one thousand five hundred to two thousand homes, with at least one to two saved ones in each home. If in three months we visit these two thousand homes three to five times, at least one thousand homes will be raised up. This is truly the best way, and it is worthwhile to endeavor in this matter. Hence, we need to encourage the saints to practice this change in the system; moreover, we must find a definite way to effectively gain the increase.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> </body></html>
