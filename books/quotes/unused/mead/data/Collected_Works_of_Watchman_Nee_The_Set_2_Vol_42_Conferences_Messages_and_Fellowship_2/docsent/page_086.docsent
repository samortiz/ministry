   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE HOW TO EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE OVERCOMING LIFE 2 Date: December 21, 1936, evening</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Foochow</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that there are simple conditions for a person to have the Lord live in him, that is, to experience the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All he has to do is resign, quit, yield, let go, and let Christ take over.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When a man does this, he will overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have been meeting here for nine evenings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now I will ask a question.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Have you let go?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you have not let go, you have to say to the Lord, "I cannot make it, and I do not intend to try to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I let go.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I commit everything to You so that You can overcome for me."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some may feel that it is very difficult to let go, and some may not even know what letting go means.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have to realize that unless you truly let go, you cannot fully overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, tonight we need to consider once again how we can let go and commit everything to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>LETTING GO</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I was in Chefoo, a sister came to me and said that she could not let go because she did not know how to let go.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I asked her if she had ever taken a cab to her friend's house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She said she had.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I then asked if she had ever arrived at her friend's house and as she reached into her pocket to pay the driver, her friend came out and tried to pay the fare, with each trying to pay and each trying to push money into the other one's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She said she had.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I said, "Suppose your friend paid the twenty-cent fare for you, and the driver took the money and left.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since you did not want your friend to spend her money, you would attempt to put twenty cents into her hand before you left.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As you were leaving, she would try to put the money back into your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After pushing the money back and forth a few times, you could place the money on the ground and tell her that you were leaving.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In your heart, however, you would wonder if your friend had taken the money.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You would also wonder what would happen if she did not pick it up and some passersby picked it up instead.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, you would glance back quickly to see if she had picked up the money.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you saw that she had not picked it up, you would take a few more steps and look back again.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you did this, I can tell you that your friend would never take the money as long as you continued to look back.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if you left the money in the middle of the street and did not look back, walking straight ahead instead, your friend would surely come over and pick it up."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After I told her this illustration, she became clear and began to experience the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Last night I spoke of a sister who loved snack food.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A few days after I talked with her, she invited some guests to her house for a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During the meal, she wept again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She felt that she was still defeated and had not yet overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She still had not let go.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Chinese has an idiomatic expression: "To let go and die."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once a man lets go, God can do His work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Man always tries to do something and to come up with some methods, but God considers us to be hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He only asks us to let go.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As long as we still want to do something, God will allow us to go on by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But when we can say, "Lord, I thank You that I cannot make it, but I believe that You can make it," our faith will bring in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the one hand, many people commit themselves to God, but on the other hand, they cannot be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They constantly look back, fearing that God will not take up their consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not genuine trust.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God wants to be responsible for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But if we want to take control, He will not take control.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we do not take control, He will surely take control.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After we have committed everything to God, we should no longer take control or worry about anything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to say to God, "I have committed everything to You.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From now on, I do not care if I am good or bad."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once we commit ourselves to God in this way, He will take over and be responsible for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we let go, God will take over.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>BELIEVING</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, after many people know that they should let go, they still fail because they have not believed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After a person has let go, he must continue to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Letting go is just the negative side of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the positive side, we must believe.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to believe that we have overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Putting it more accurately, we have to believe that the Lord is living in us, that we have uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord, that we have a sustained prayer life, that we are obedient to God, and that we have the power to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Letting go and believing are definite steps that we must take.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Every Christian should know the day that he let go and the day that he believed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These days should be as definite as the day of his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our letting go and believing must be definite, but after we have let go and believed in a definite way, we need to continue to let go and believe.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Letting go and believing are things that we do continuously day by day; they are not things we do once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some people say, "This is hard.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How can I remember to do this?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After I hear a message, I may be able to remember.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But when I am busy, when I am studying, or when I am visiting the sick, I may forget.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What should I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have a brother who manages a factory that has more than a few dozen female workers.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He said that he often has been driven almost to insanity by the noise of the machines.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He did not know how one could be in Christ all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I asked, "When you have forgotten that you are in Christ, are you still in Christ in reality?"</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He thought for a while and answered, "Yes, I am still in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Thank the Lord that this is not a matter of us remembering, but a matter of the Lord remembering.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We can forget about the Lord, but the Lord will never forget us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have to realize that there is no problem with us at all, because we are in Christ already.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We can rest in the Lord, because He is responsible for everything.</S>
