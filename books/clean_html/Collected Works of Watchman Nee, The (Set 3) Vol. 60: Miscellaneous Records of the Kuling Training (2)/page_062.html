<h2 class="head2">Tracts Enabling All Believers to Function</h2><p>The seventh advantage of tracts is that they enable all believers to function. God has given to the church apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Although not everyone can be an apostle, everyone should do the work of an evangelist. Under normal circumstances, everyone in the church should preach the gospel; everyone should function. Some may say that they do not have the eloquence or the gift. They may say that they cannot sing or preach the gospel. But thank the Lord that everyone can pass out tracts. There is no distinction between tract distributors; a person who receives a tract does not care who he received it from. In preaching the gospel and in giving a testimony, some are more gifted and powerful; their preaching brings more people to the knowledge of salvation. Others are not as gifted and powerful; they bring fewer people to salvation. But tract distribution does not work this way. Whether or not one is gifted or powerful, he can pass out tracts. Whether he is a child or an adult, an educated man or illiterate, he can pass out tracts. The sphere becomes much larger. Anyone can do this as long as he is godly and dedicated. A businessman can invest a few dollars to print some tracts, round up some children, and go out with them to pass out these tracts. His work is different from the work of those preaching from the podium. The work of preaching is limited to a few brothers and sisters, but tract distribution is not restricted by this distinction. Everyone can do it. We have to help the distributors to realize that they have a share in God's service. Their work is a great blessing to the church. In this way their hearts will be drawn to the church, and they will be burdened for the souls of men. No work can be as widespread as the work of tract distribution.</p><h2 class="head1">EXAMPLES OF MEN SAVING OTHERS WITH TRACTS<br />AND BEING SAVED BY TRACTS</h2><p>God has used tracts to save many people. Many people are saved through reading tracts. We can find many such testimonies, and many of them are quite miraculous. I know that some people push tracts into others' homes through the front doors. Some put them in the mail boxes. Some pass out tracts to pedestrians while walking on the street. A pedestrian once took a tract and tore it apart. Another person picked up one of the torn pieces. The torn part spoke of escaping the wrath of the coming judgment. He did not understand what he had read, but he felt uneasy about it. Later he found the way to believe in the Lord, and he was saved. A man once picked up a tract and immediately threw it away. Another person came along the same road. He was hurt by a nail which stuck into his shoe. To relieve his pain, he took the rejected tract, folded it, and put it inside his shoe as a cushion against the nail. When he reached home, he took off his shoes and began to read the tract. His reading brought him to salvation. This is what is meant by casting bread upon the waters. In time it will bear fruit. Such an experience of salvation through tracts is extremely common and even amazing.</p><p>In the last century there was a preacher in England called Tusoney (?). He only had one lung, but he was very powerful in preaching the gospel, and many people were saved through him. He preached the gospel for thirty-seven years. It was a common thing for him to speak to three or four thousand people in open air. He prepared over a hundred different tracts for use in all the villages and towns of England. Some of them were for bigger cities, while others were for smaller villages. Some he used on a train or on a boat. The result of these tracts was quite phenomenal. The tracts for trains alone totaled twenty-two. For example, one tract was entitled: "You Have a Ticket for the Train, but Do You Have Your Tract?" It was used exclusively on trains. Once while he was on a train, as the train was pulling away from the station the conductor asked the passengers, "Do you have a ticket? If you do not have a ticket you cannot get on board." This tract distributor went behind the conductor and said, "Do you have a tract? If you do not have a tract you cannot get on board." On that day, seven people believed in the Lord. He printed the tracts, distributed them himself, and preached with them.</p><p>Mr. George Cutting, the author of the book Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment, was very clear about the grace of salvation. His little book ranks second in worldwide circulation, next only to the Bible. In his youth he was also a tract distributor. The Lord used him to write many tracts. He traveled all over England and did his best to save many people. We have to tell the new ones these stories, and we have to encourage them to do the same.</p><p>Another person who belongs in this category is the author of the book A Christian's Rest. His salvation was the result of four people receiving and passing on tracts consecutively. The first one passed a tract to the second, who after being saved, passed another tract to the third. When the third was saved, he passed another tract to the fourth. All four were greatly used by the Lord in England. They were all saved through another one giving them a tract. These tracts resulted in four great servants of the Lord. These examples show us the effectiveness of tracts.</p>
