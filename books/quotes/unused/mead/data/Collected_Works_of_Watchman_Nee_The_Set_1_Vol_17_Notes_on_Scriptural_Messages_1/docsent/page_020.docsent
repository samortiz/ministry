   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GLEANINGS FROM ENOCH Issue No. 11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I will now speak something concerning Enoch.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It will be like a kind of gleaning.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I do not know when Enoch repented, and what he did before he was sixty-five years old.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But we know that he began to walk with God at the age of sixty-five after he begot Methuselah.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We know nothing about his life before sixty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But we know that after he begot Methuselah, he had a change.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It might have been due to seeing a prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He lived to three hundred sixty-five years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The remaining three hundred years he walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The name of his son must have a deep significance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The name Methuselah means "at the time of his death, that thing will occur."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After Enoch begot Methuselah, he surely would have sought earnestly before God about the name of his son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Surely God showed him the coming great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was surely warned and became fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is interesting that Noah preached righteousness, while Enoch preached judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Noah preached the way of salvation because God revealed the ark to him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Enoch preached judgment because he received revelation through the name of his son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can only preach the things that have produced an effect upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through faith, Noah prepared an ark.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through faith, Enoch received the benefit of walking with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is good if we know that sinners, the flesh, and the world will all be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter said, "But the day of the Lord will come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the elements, burning with intense heat, will be dissolved, and the earth and the works in it will be burned up" 2 Pet 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If this is the end of the world, are we still going to love it?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Will anyone deposit money into a bank when he knows that the bank is going to go bankrupt?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the bank is going to go bankrupt, no one will want to deposit his money into it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since we know the end of the world already, and that it will be burned, we should not love it anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Enoch realized the meaning of the name "Methuselah"; he was watchful and was therefore raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we will consider a few things about Enoch.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>ENOCH'S ENVIRONMENT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Did Enoch walk with God because his environment was better than others?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No. Let us first consider the environment in his home.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Genesis 5:22 says, "And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some have said that preachers can walk with God all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But how can those with many household responsibilities walk with God?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But what does the Bible say about the first man who walked with God?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He walked with God and begat sons and daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some have asked how one can walk with God when he works in a factory, and only hears the sound of machinery all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But Enoch walked with God for three hundred years and begat sons and daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was not free from household responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The life which we received is not expressed only in smooth environments; it can be expressed in every environment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can walk with God not only in a smooth environment but in any environment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The complexity of family chores and a great number of children cannot stop a man who truly walks with God from doing what he is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A believer can walk with God not because his family burdens are little or his business responsibilities are light, but because he can be free from the entanglement of these things in contrast to the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He can walk with God in such circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was possible for Enoch to walk with God under such circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not only was Enoch faced with a condition in his family, but the environment of the age was also very dark.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the time of Enoch, Adam was still alive.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Genesis 4, we see that the tribe that came from Cain was still around.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What was it like?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah" v. 19 . Lamech was the first one to break God's law of monogamy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From that time on, polygamy was practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The name Adah means "beautiful"; she was given to adornment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The trend was already becoming evil, and women were striving to be fashionable.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle" v. 20 . This is the first case of cattle farming for profit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ" v. 21 . By then, men began to give themselves to music and entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron" v. 22 . The artificers in brass and iron made weapons.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By then warfare had started.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, in the midst of such an age, Enoch walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Is it not today's picture that men indulge in their lusts, scheme for wealth, give themselves to music, and brandish weapons?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God tells us that in such an age, Enoch walked with Him for three hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What about us today?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Are we walking with God?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Mr. G. H. Pember from England is a man deep in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A few decades ago, he prophesied that men would pay more attention to music, higher knowledge, and the wielding of weapons, while there would be an unprecedented movement for women's rights.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What about today?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We know that his words have come true.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Under such circumstances, we should walk with God.</S>
