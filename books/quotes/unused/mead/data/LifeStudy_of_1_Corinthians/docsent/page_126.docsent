   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Having No Commandment of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>concerning Certain Matters,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>but Giving His Opinion</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 25 says, Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as having received mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A wife should not be separated from her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This, the apostle says, is the Lord s commandment v. 10 . But concerning virgins not marrying, he says he has no commandment of the Lord, but he gives his opinion in the following verses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He dares to do this because he has received mercy of the Lord to be faithful to the Lord s interests, and he is really one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His opinion expresses the Lord s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is again based on the New Testament principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some readers of 1 Corinthians may think that Paul was too strong in giving his opinion when he had no commandment from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Which one of us would dare to say that we have no commandment of the Lord concerning a certain matter, but that we give our opinion?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet this is the very thing Paul does in verse 25.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here we see the highest spirituality, the spirituality of a person who is so one with the Lord that even his opinion expresses the Lord s mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul was absolutely one with the Lord and thoroughly saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because his entire being was permeated with the Lord, even his opinion expressed the mind of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this reason, we say that verse 25 expresses the highest spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 26 Paul gives his opinion: I consider then that this is good because of the present necessity, that it is good for a man to be as he is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have pointed out that the Greek word for present may also mean that the presence of a certain thing foreshadows and inaugurates something to come.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Greek word for necessity refers to the needs of the life in the present age, the demand of which constrains and presses people and becomes a distress and anguish to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul realized that the present age is a pressing age, an age full of necessities.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who are married and have children are pressed by necessities more than those who are not married.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be sure, there are many blessings in married life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if we are honest, we shall admit that in married life we are pressed again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who have children and grandchildren can testify of this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, our children make us happy; on the other hand, they cause us to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because of the present necessity, Paul thought it was good for others to remain as he was.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He realized that if a brother or a sister remained unmarried, that one would be spared the pressing caused by the present necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>F. Thinking That He Also Has the Spirit of God,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even in Some Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Which Is according to His Opinion</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 40 Paul says, But she is more blessed if she so remains, according to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verse 10 the apostle says, I charge, not I but the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 12 he says, I say, not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 25 he says, I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here he says, According to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All these words indicate the New Testament principle of incarnation, that is, God and man, man and God, becoming one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This differs drastically from the principle of Old Testament prophecy speaking for God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Old Testament, as we have pointed out, the word of Jehovah came unto a prophet Jer 1:2; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>1:3 , the prophet being simply the mouthpiece of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But in the New Testament the Lord becomes one with His apostles and they become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Both speak together.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His word becomes their word, and whatever they utter is His word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, the apostle s charge is the Lord s charge v. 10 . What he says, though not by the Lord, still becomes a part of the divine revelation in the New Testament v. 12 . He is so one with the Lord that even when he gives his own opinion, not the commandment of the Lord v. 25 , he still thinks that he also has the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He does not claim definitely to have the Spirit of God, but he thinks that he also has the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the highest spirituality; it is based on the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to see the principle of incarnation illustrated here and receive mercy and grace from the Lord to speak in a genuine and frank manner without any pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to speak like this we need to be saturated with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then what we utter or express will be our thought, our opinion, but it will also be something of the Lord because we are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>G. The Apostle s Teaching Becoming</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>the Word of God in the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whatever the apostle teaches, regardless in what way, becomes the word of God in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once again I would emphasize the importance of touching Paul s spirit in 1 Corinthians 7.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In his answers to the questions raised by the Corinthian believers, Paul expresses his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This makes it possible for us to sense his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul certainly was absolutely for the Lord and one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even in expressing his opinion, he had the feeling that he also had the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the New Testament teaching, and the way we should follow today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not follow the superficial Pentecostal way to copy the Old Testament manner of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Instead, follow Paul s way to touch the depths of the New Testament mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This mystery is that the Lord and we, we and the Lord, have become one spirit.</S>
