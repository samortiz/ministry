   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED OF REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Therefore, the salvation of man cannot start from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It has to start from the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this reason there is the need of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Regeneration simply means to cast off the dirty, corrupted life that we have and exchange it for a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is analogous to changing a fish's life for a bird's life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There will be no need to teach the fish to fly anymore; it will fly naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the present we will not mention the way to regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We just want to know what regeneration is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Giving up a life of sin and replacing it by a holy life is our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>CORRUPTED FROM WITHIN</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A few years ago I was in Amoy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One day I was preaching in the villages with another co-worker by the name of Wang.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By the time we completed our visits, it was close to midnight.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We were both very thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the shops along the way were closed, and there was nowhere that we could find water.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Approaching the end of a little town, we saw a small grocery store with its door still open.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With much joy we bought two big pears.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The ones we picked were the biggest and cleanest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There was no hole or any bad spot outside.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We took them with us and ate them on our way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After a while we tasted something strange.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we examined the pears under a lamp, we found that they were bad inside.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The only thing we could do was pick out the worms and eat the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I told Brother Wang, "The skin of these pears looked so shiny; there was no hole anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you know how those worms got inside the pears?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let me tell you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the pear tree was still blossoming, the worms had already laid eggs in the pear flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the flowers wilted and the pears were formed, the eggs hatched and grew inside them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Outwardly, these pears looked nice, but inside they were filled with worms."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is just what we have been talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The evil of man is not merely in his conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The basic problem is that he is corrupted in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The salvation of Christianity is not a change of our outward behavior, but an exchange of our inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>BURNING INSIDE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I know a lady who is very good-tempered.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She never gets angry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is always a smile on her face.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One day while her niece was visiting in her house, an extremely unreasonable person rebuked her for a length of time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many unbearable words were hurled at her, but she did not answer a word; there was still a smile on her face.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After the person was gone, the niece admiringly said, "Auntie, that was quite a demonstration of patience to be able to hold your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If I were you I would have lost my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At least I would have said something back to him."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The aunt said, "No. Do not think that I was not angry.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I was burning inside!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But I have cultivated forbearance and suppressed my feeling."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our problem is not whether trouble does or does not explode out from us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, it is whether there is trouble inside or not.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Alas!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is all too true that we have all kinds of problems inside!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Bible shows us that we are naturally sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is nothing strange about a man going after sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His inward and outward parts feel compatible with each other when he sins.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a most natural consequence to him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our human life is bound to be manipulated by the flesh, the world, and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>THE SEED OF SIN WITHIN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some people look nice outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They have a high sense of morality, and a decent standard of behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It seems as if they possess a better life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But the outward niceties are merely works of repression.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are like a horse held tightly by its reins.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Given a chance, it will plunge into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Let me say an honest word: every man can become a bandit, and every gentleman can become a dishonorable criminal.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Just let the hands go, and every vileness can break forth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is the seed of sin within man.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is not a strange thing for man to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No one needs to make up his mind to lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He only has to make up his mind not to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Never has a person written in his diary, "From this day on, I am determined to lose my temper once a day.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If I neglect to do so, I will punish myself!"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only patience requires deliberation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Committing evil is very natural.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is no conscious effort required.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A deliberate work is needed only in doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>SIN IS AN INHERENT NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I sleep in that little room right outside the door.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If there is a bright light in this hall, I will not be able to sleep there.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If I want to sleep, all I need to do is close the door, and the light will be shut out from me.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Darkness is the inherent feature of that room; light is the foreign element.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All I can do is drive away the foreign element.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I cannot drive away the inherent darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You can close your door to sinless aspirations.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But you can never close your door to sinful temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Because the life we have is corrupted, the expression of it in our living is likewise evil.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The salvation of God is to regenerate us so that we will have an exchange of life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The new life is the life of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Regeneration is receiving God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It means that henceforth our whole being is taken away, and God is living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We do not live our own life anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God becomes our living.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I never exhort people to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It will not work even if I exhort day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It is impossible for man to live God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Only the coming in of God's life can result in God-like living.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>To receive God's life is regeneration, and only regeneration will result in a change of outward behavior.</S>
