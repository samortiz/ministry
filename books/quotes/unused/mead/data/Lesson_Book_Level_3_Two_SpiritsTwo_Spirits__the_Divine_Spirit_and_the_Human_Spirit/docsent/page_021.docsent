   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Lesson Twenty-Two of the Lesson Book on the Triune God and the Person and Work of Christ we saw the matter of the essential and economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because this point is such a significant and crucial truth regarding the Spirit, we must consider it once again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We will also see more about the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Most Christians today are very confused about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I. TWO ASPECTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In chapter one of Acts the resurrected Christ charged His disciples to remain in Jerusalem for the baptism in the Holy Spirit: "For John indeed baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now" Acts 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 8 He went on to say, "You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here we see that the baptism in the Holy Spirit is a matter of the Spirit descending upon the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A. As Breath for Life</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Acts 1 the Lord talks about the disciples experiencing the Holy Spirit coming upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But had the disciples not received the Holy Spirit already?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to John 20, in the evening of His resurrection day, the Lord appeared to His disciples, breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit" v. 22 . In this verse the Holy Spirit is likened to breath.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Breath is something inward, something related to the life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In John 20:22, therefore, the disciples received the Holy Spirit as breath for life.</S>
