BY THE POWER OF RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The emphasis of God&rsquo;s salvation is that He has given Himself to us. Hence, our being a Christian depends on our having a normal relationship with the indwelling God. The Bible shows that God dwells in us in order to be our life. Not only does He lead us in every matter, but He wants to be the power of our living. This power is the power of His resurrection. The Lord Jesus went into death, and although death tried its best, it could not hold Him. On the third day the Lord broke through death and Hades, and He ascended to the heavens, transcending everything. This was accomplished by the resurrection power. Resurrection power enabled a Nazarene to break forth out of death and to ascend to the heavens. Such a resurrection power has entered into us to become our life.</p>
<p>Several places in the New Testament use a particular word in relation to the power that raised Christ from the dead. In the original Greek the word <em>operation</em> or <em>operate</em> is often used (Eph. 1:19-20; 3:7, 20; Col. 1:29). The resurrection power that operates in us is not harsh; it is gentle and refined but nonetheless very powerful.</p>
<p>Many Christians do not realize that there is such an operation within them. Hence, they are Christians outwardly but not Christians according to this inner operation. For example, a newly saved brother desires to learn how to live before the Lord. When he draws near to the Lord, this inner operation will give him the sense that he should spend more time to fellowship with the Lord and to have a thorough dealing. If he continues to fellowship with the Lord instead of being distracted, the operation within him will intensify. As a result, he will have a thorough dealing with the Lord. He will also enter deeper into God and let God enter deeper into him. While he is learning to fellowship with the Lord, a few brothers might encourage him to preach the gospel. If this young brother is active by disposition and also eloquent, he will feel happy while preaching the gospel. However, when he turns to outward things, he may become an outward Christian. Initially, he was experiencing the operation of the resurrection power within him. However, he may be distracted and begin to focus mainly on outward activities. It is good to preach the gospel, but some people cannot turn back to the inner operation after they are distracted and become involved merely with outward activities. Thus, this brother can become an outward, zealous Christian who is busy with many outward activities in the service but does not understand the inner operation of life.</p>
<p>Many years ago I met a gospel preacher in Shantung province. Before his salvation, he was an emaciated opium addict. One day he was genuinely saved, and he threw away his opium pipe. Then he put on weight and became plump and healthy. When he preached the gospel, he carried two pictures with him: one picture of himself looking emaciated and another picture of himself looking plump and healthy. He said that he was an advertisement for the gospel. However, this brother had merely dropped his bad habit and changed from being skinny to being plump; he knew nothing concerning God being life to man. He was energetic in preaching the gospel, but when he lost his temper, he was terrifying. At the time I met him, I was giving messages, and he came every day to hear the messages. The strange thing was that before and after the meeting he was interested to speak with me about gospel preaching, but he was not interested in hearing the messages that I was giving concerning life. From his speaking I was clear that he was a zealous Christian who lived in outward activities but knew nothing of the life within him.</p>
<p>We should preach the gospel, but the gospel should be preached by the operation of resurrection life. The apostle Paul was a minister of the gospel, but his gift of preaching the gospel was not out of his natural ability or natural eloquence. His preaching the gospel was the issue of the resurrection power that operated within him. This gift was produced in him by the resurrection life.</p>
<p>I know a brother who, after being dynamically saved, completely forsook all evil activities. He no longer desired the world, was clear concerning God&rsquo;s calling, and consecrated himself. He liked to pray and to read the Bible. When he drew near to the Lord, he experienced the Lord&rsquo;s operation within him. He told me of how the Lord operated in him. Although his mother had not spoken with him for many years, the Lord asked him to apologize to his mother. This was truly the operation of life within him. He received much light in reading the Bible, was desperate to understand the Bible, and desired to be a preacher. He often asked me, &ldquo;Where can I go to learn the Bible? Where can I go to learn to serve the Lord?&rdquo; I would reply, &ldquo;Brother, your living is your Bible school. If you live fully in the church life, you will learn to serve the Lord.&rdquo; However, he was quick by disposition and was not willing to learn to know God&rsquo;s life in his daily living, to allow the divine life to grow in him, or to know the Bible according to life. Neither was he patient enough to coordinate with others in the church in order to learn to serve the Lord according to the measure of life. While he was in this situation, a pastor who also loved the Lord encouraged him to study theology. As a result, he went to a seminary to study theology.</p>
<p>After four years he graduated from the seminary and came to see me. He said, &ldquo;I learned Bible knowledge in the seminary and received much instruction concerning how to preach the gospel. However, I cannot touch God anymore. What is the reason?&rdquo; I asked him how long he had been in this situation, and he said, &ldquo;From the day I enrolled in the seminary, I was very busy with seminarian studies. As a result, my fellowship with God was interrupted. Ever since I began to study theology, the &lsquo;-ology&rsquo; replaced God in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many Christians have the same problem. God has been in us from the day that we were saved. He is the God of resurrection, He is full of riches, and He is the God of great power. As such, He lives in us and is operating unceasingly within us. The most troublesome matter to Him is that we do not remain with His inner operation; we do not care about His operation in us. We often become outward Christians; we run around asking for advice and wanting to engage in various activities. As a result, not many people are inward Christians, and there are too many outward Christians.</p>
<p>A person who learns Chinese boxing must develop outward skills as well as internal strength. Boxing with outward skills consists of many gimmicks and actions that appear exciting but are not of much value. Boxing with internal strength does not seem to have many actions, but it has much power. There are two kinds of Christians, those with &ldquo;outward skills&rdquo; and those with &ldquo;inner strength.&rdquo; However, very few Christians have inner strength. Regrettably, Christians either indulge in sins and love the world, or they zealously preach the gospel, study theology, and are involved in Christian activities. Most pay attention to good behavior and working for the Lord. Such Christians have outward skills, not inner strength. God desires for us to be Christians with inner strength&mdash;Christians who afford His life, the resurrection power, the opportunity to grow in them.</p>
<p>Every plant grows slowly from the life within. A plant cannot be forced to grow fast. According to a Chinese proverb, any effort to make a plant grow faster would only pull up the seedling. There was a man who wanted to help his wheat grow faster, so he pulled on the plants. He did not know that his pulling on the wheat caused the plants to die. Often our efforts to help others is in the principle of pulling up a plant. We see that a brother is growing slowly, so we pull him up a little. However, we have not helped him grow faster, for after a short period of time he will wither and die. Hence, outward help is futile. If we desire a seedling to grow well, we should not attempt to pull it; rather, we need to loosen the soil and add compost so that nutrients and water can reach the plant and cause it to grow. Loosening the soil and adding compost and water will supply the plant, but pulling on the plant will cause it to die. Often instead of watering, adding nutrients, or loosening the soil, the saints pull when they visit people. As a result, people are &ldquo;pulled out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the leaves, flowers, and fruits of a plant are not added outwardly; they grow from within. Similarly, various Christian activities should be the result of growth from within; they should not be something added outwardly. The things that are added outwardly will not last long. They will wither and die after a short period of time.</p>
<p>These illustrations show that being a Christian is altogether an inward matter; it is not outward. Some people like to kneel down and pray for twenty minutes. Although it is good to kneel down to pray, such outward kneeling does not matter. What matters is whether we take care of the operating of God&rsquo;s resurrection power. Being a Christian does not depend on outward conduct, work, activities, or accomplishments but on taking care of God&rsquo;s operation within us. The apostle Paul said that God &ldquo;is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us&rdquo; (Eph. 3:20). Everything that God accomplishes for us is based on this operation.</p>
<p>Many saints wrongly apply Ephesians 3:20 to outward things and matters. A brother once testified, &ldquo;I asked God for a bungalow. I prayed for half a year, and God gave me a two-story house. What God accomplished is above all that I asked or thought.&rdquo; Ephesians 3:20 does not refer to such things. According to this verse, what God accomplishes for us is altogether related to the inner life, to the operation of His power in us. Suppose a brother is giving me a difficult time, and I pray only for patience in order to not lose my temper. However, if I allow the resurrection power to operate in me, I will not only be patient and not lose my temper, but I will also love him in a sweet way. In this situation the power that operates in me has accomplished above all that I asked or thought. I hoped that the life within me would lead me to overcome, but I did not expect that this life would lead me to more than overcome. This life achieves above all that we can ask or think. This is the meaning of Ephesians 3:20.</p>
<p>Paul said that he labored to present every man full-grown in Christ and that his laboring was according to God&rsquo;s operation which operated in him in power (Col. 1:28-29). We must see that God&rsquo;s desire to be life in us and to live out of us is altogether an inner matter; it is not outward. This desire is accomplished by life growing within us, not by adding something outward to us. The resurrection power in us is constantly operating; hence, we should cooperate with this operation and live by it. In this way the divine life will grow in us, and we will live out this life practically.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Knowing and Experiencing God as Life &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
