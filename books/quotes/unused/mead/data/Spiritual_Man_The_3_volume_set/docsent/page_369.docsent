   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At other times Satan directly attacks believers and causes them to die.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Actually, many such attacks have happened, but believers do not recognize them as such.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes the attack comes simply as a cold, sunstroke, insomnia, fatigue, or loss of appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sometimes it may be uncleanness, anger, envyings, or indulgence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not knowing the deadening significance behind these, believers lack perfect victory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If they recognized these deadening attacks and withstood them just as they withstand death, they would overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because the believers do not have sufficient knowledge to understand the real meaning of these experiences, they attribute them to their age or other factors, not realizing that the enemy is using death to attack them because the rapture is close.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus is coming back soon; therefore, we should wage a full-scale battle against death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the same way that we fight with sin, the world, and Satan, we should also fight against death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not only strive to overcome; we should also lay hold of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In every aspect we should firmly grasp the work of Christ in overcoming death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we look back on our past experience and ask God to shine upon us, we will see the numerous times that we have been attacked by death without realizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We considered these attacks to be something else and, in so doing, failed to have the power to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we had identified these as the attacks of death, God would have supplied us with the power to overcome them experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We often seem to pass over broken bridges and through torn-up streets; it seems as if our environment and everything else tell us that we are about to die, but we cannot die.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We often even despair of life, but we cannot die.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why should we die now?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Recently the children of God have had considerable experiences of fighting for their life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is most painful, yet they feel that they cannot die.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It seems as if they are saying that they do not want to die.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These are the attacks of death to prevent us from being raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is leading us to pitch our last battle against death before our rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today we should apply the victory of Christ to shut the door of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should stand up and refuse to let death have any power over us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Reject everything that has the element of death in it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Apply this view to every sickness, weakness, and pain.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes the body may not feel anything, but death has already done its work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All vexing in the spirit and sorrow in the soul result in death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God is now calling us to be raptured; therefore, everything that frustrates this rapture should be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is putting His children in different environments that strip them of their strength and all that they depend on, causing them to place their lives into His hand and hang on by a thread of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Otherwise, they would have no hope of survival.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At such times there seems to be no way except to cry, "Lord, keep me alive."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The battle today is truly a battle of life and death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The evil spirits of murder are working everywhere today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Unless the believers stand against them and pray, they will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you are still as passive as before, you will certainly die.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You may say, "Lord, make me overcome death."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the Lord will say, "If you stand against death, I will make you overcome death."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Prayer alone will not work very well if the will does not resist death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You should say, "Lord, because You have overcome death, I now reject all the attacks of death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am determined to overcome right now.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Lord, grant me a victory over death."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord desires that you would overcome death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Grasp the promise that God has given you, pray to be delivered from death, and believe that nothing can hurt you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not accept the fact that death can touch you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, if you are in a disease-infected area, reject the diseases and forbid them to come close to you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not let death attack you through disease.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not wait passively for the second coming and presume that somehow we will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must be prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Being raptured, just like any other matter, requires God's church to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Faith never lets things take their own course.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Death must be resisted with determination.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Likewise, the rapture is something that must be grasped with determination.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Faith is indispensable, but that does not mean we may passively abandon responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we theoretically consent to the fact that we can be completely freed from death, but yield passively to its power, what profit is this?</S>
