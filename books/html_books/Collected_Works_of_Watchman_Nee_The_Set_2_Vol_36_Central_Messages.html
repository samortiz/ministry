His ministry, therefore, was focused on Christ's death and resurrection for the producing of the church in life to experience the victory of Christ that His kingdom might by ushered in. For this reason, he considered messages on these matters as the central messages. His burden to hold the overcomer conferences and to publish The Present Testimony was to present such central messages. He also translated books in this same category into Chinese" (excerpt from Watchman Nee&mdash;A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age by Witness Lee, pp. 254-255, published by Living Stream Ministry).</p><p>In Volume 36 we have collected eight books by Watchman Nee that match the description given above. The first three chapters in the book Christ Is the Way, the Truth, and the Life are identical to the first three chapters in the book Christ Is All Spiritual Matters and Things. Therefore, only chapters four and five of the latter book have been printed.</p><h1 class="title">THE OVERCOMING LIFE</h1><p>Last Lord's Day, we saw that it is possible for every Christian to have a life that is perfect [see "The Extent of the Believer's Salvation," Collected Works, Volume 8]. It is possible for him to have a pure conscience, a clean heart, and to be anxious for nothing. It is possible for his mind to be single and undistracted. It is possible for him to obey God and love Him absolutely. It is possible for him to overcome whatever peculiar physical constitution he has, and to present his members as weapons of righteousness to God unto sanctification. Every Christian can reach the point where he can say that he is crucified with Christ and that it is no longer he who lives, but Christ who lives in him. This is possible and attainable. Today I will speak on another subject, which is the way to obtain the overcoming life.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE LIFE CHRIST LIVED WHILE HE WAS ON EARTH</h2><p>When Christ lived on the earth, He was absolutely obedient to God. He had absolutely no love for the world, and He did not speak or walk according to His own will. He never allowed any temptation to overcome Him, and He never sinned. He was obedient to God unto death. This was the life of Christ.</p><p>But how about us? Have we obeyed God absolutely? No. Have we denied our self-will completely? No. Are we sinless? No. Are we totally free from the love of the world? We may not love the world outwardly, but our heart loves it secretly. Has anyone here never been shaken by any temptation? No. This is terrible! According to the Bible, a Christian should obey God absolutely. He should not love the world or go along with his own will. He should not sin at all or be shaken by any temptation. But brothers and sisters, both you and I have to confess that this is impossible! We have been Christians for more than one or two years. Some of us may even have been Christians for three, four, or five years. Where have we been successful during these years? We often repent, feel remorseful, or even weep. But where is our victory?</p><p>We know the standard of a Christian set forth in the Bible. We must absolutely deny our self, we must be righteous as God is righteous, and we must pursue after the kingdom with singleness of heart. But what is our real condition? We often sin, our hearts are unclean, and we still lose our temper. We love the world secretly, and we are controlled by our lusts. We do not like to read the Bible or pray, and sometimes we almost think that it would be better if we were not Christians at all.</p><p>The Bible says that we "ought to," but we say that we "cannot." Truly, we always "ought to," but it is also true that we forever "cannot." Can we lower the standard of God's truth? Can we say that it is all right for us to sin just once? Can we say that some should love God, obey God, deny themselves, and be holy, but that this standard is not necessarily for everyone, but only for a few special ones?</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we have seen that although we cannot make it in ourselves, there is One who has made it. This One is Christ. We ought to be perfect, but we cannot be perfect. Yet Christ has made it; He is perfect. This shows us three things:</p><p>(1) The standard which God has set for our living is something which every Christian should be able to achieve.</p><p>(2) However, we cannot meet this standard.</p><p>(3) Throughout history, only one person made it&mdash;Christ.</p><p>Do we believe that we cannot make it? Yes. Do we believe that Christ has made it? Yes. All of us must admit that we ought to make it, but we cannot. However, we also must admit that Christ has made it all the way to perfection. What then does this mean? A standard of living that is according to God can only be lived out by God. This is true because God is higher than we are. But this would be true even if God were lower than us; there must be the same kind of life in order to have the same kind of living. Only a bird can live a bird's life, and only a beast can live a beast's life. Therefore, only God can live God's life. Since Christ is God, only He can live out God's life.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE CHRISTIAN LIFE SPOKEN OF IN THE BIBLE</h2><p>Philippians 1:21 says, "To me, to live is Christ." Does it say that to live is to be like Christ? No. Does it say that to live is to imitate Christ? No. Does it say that to live is to make Christ our pattern and example, and to follow Christ? No. It says, "To me, to live is Christ." It is absolutely useless to imitate or to do good. Even if we can read the Bible, pray, live a good life, and pursue diligently, as long as we have a wrong life, we will still end up with a wrong living. We may yearn, weep, repent, and pray to God, "God, I really want to obey You," but there is something basically wrong with us&mdash;we have a wrong life.</p><p>God has not merely put Christ on the cross to die for us; He has made Christ our life. Brothers and sisters, please be clear that God has no intention that we live the Christian life in such a difficult way. God wants us to be Christians, but He has no intention that we be like monkeys who are taught to put on clothes, to eat, and to move around. For a monkey to imitate a man is a great suffering. It would prefer to be a monkey rather than learn how to be a man. God has no intention of dealing with us in this way.</p><p>We have no taste for reading the Bible even for five minutes. Yet we have considerable interest in reading other books. We get nothing from our prayer. Yet if we do not pray, our conscience condemns us. We cannot give up the world. Yet we have no peace when we love the world. It is truly difficult to be a Christian, and it is impossible to live as God does. What a suffering this is! Yet it is good that we can still suffer, because this proves that we are still on the right path. If you do not feel any suffering at all, I feel sorry for you, because this means that you have left the proper path.</p><p>The world's temptations are often great, yet we have nothing to say about them because we are inwardly touched by them, and we can only sympathize with others for being the same. When we see a person giving himself to the Lord, turning his back on the world, and turning to God to obey Him, we think how wonderful it would be if we could do the same. So we make an effort to try again, only to realize the suffering related to the attempt. Brothers and sisters, it would indeed be a great suffering if God required that we be such a Christian. How can one succeed when the standard is so high? It is cruel to ask a five-year-old child to lift a three- hundred-pound burden. It would be inhuman to ask a child to bear a ten-thousand-pound weight. Yet asking a Christian to live a life that belongs only to God involves a greater suffering than asking a five-year-old child to bear a three- hundred or ten-thousand-pound weight.</p><p>Many times we make an effort to try. We try to suffer through it, or not exercise a craving for it. But we find ourselves committing one sin after another. We have not finished repenting before the things for which we repented come back. While our tears are still wet, the things for which we shed tears come back. Brothers and sisters, it would be wonderful if we believed that we cannot make it. God does not want us to try. The Bible says that the life God gives is not a life which falls and repents over and over again. It is a life in which "to me, to live is Christ." It is a life in which the Lord Jesus lives within us and out of us.</p><p>Mary gave the Lord a body, and through this body the Lord manifested the life of God. In the same way, we should give ourselves to the Lord and receive Him into us. When we do this, He will make us live a life that is the same as His.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, a Christian does not need to try or imitate in order to be holy, to deny the self, to love the Lord singleheartedly, and to obey Him absolutely, because God has prepared Christ for us. This is the full salvation. God has appointed Christ to do two things. On the one hand, Christ has kept the law for us. On the other hand, He inwardly empowers us to keep God's law. On the one hand, He died for us, and on the other hand, He lives for us. He accomplished salvation for us at Golgotha and applies this accomplishment at Golgotha in us. At Golgotha, He justified us. Now He lives within us to enable us to live righteously. Not only has He obeyed God, but He now lives in us to enable us also to obey God. Not only has He done things on our behalf, but He is now doing things within us.</p><p>Here we see the importance of resurrection. Paul said, "And if Christ has not been raised...you are still in your sins" (1 Cor. 15:17). He did not say that the record of our sins was still present; Christ has died, and the record of our sins has been removed. But if Christ had not resurrected, we would still be in our sins, and our salvation would only be a half salvation. In our preaching of the gospel, we often compare the act of sin to owing a debt; Christ is like a rich friend whose death repays our debt. This, of course, is right, and it is the gospel. But unfortunately, this is only a half salvation. It is true that the Lord Jesus has paid our debt, but we must ask if He has done more than just pay our debt. Will we not incur any more debt? Since He has cleared our old debt, will we incur new debts? If we continue to incur more debt that our Friend has to take care of, even though what we once owed has been paid by our Friend, is our salvation only a half salvation? Is God's salvation all about continuing to owe, even though our Friend has paid our debt, and continuing to sin, even though Christ has died for us?</p><p>Oh, God's salvation is the Lord Jesus dying for us at Golgotha and living within us. He has paid all our debts, and He lives in us so that we do not have to be in debt anymore. God has not saved us from hell merely to go to heaven. He has saved us to the extent that Christ becomes our life. If we only receive half of this salvation, we will surely suffer and not have the joy of salvation. Jesus Christ is our life. God does not say that a Christian should do this and do that. Paul said, "For to me, to live is Christ" (Phil. 1:21). Paul was able to bear all the beatings and persecutions, pass through all kinds of danger, and be imprisoned in Jerusalem and sent to Rome because Christ lived in him. He was not trying to be like Christ, nor was he imitating Christ. He was what he was because Christ was living in him. Otherwise, he would not have been able to live the way he did. Just as a monkey cannot become a man, a Christian cannot learn to be "like Christ."</p><p>Philippians 2:12-13 says, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure." Verse 1:21 tells us about Paul's personal experience. These two verses tell us what every Christian can experience.</p><p>When some people read, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling," they think that salvation is something to be worked out. Therefore, they make up their minds to rise up early to read the Bible and to be zealous to testify to others. But they fail because they have forgotten the words in verse 13 which say, "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure." Since the word "for" denotes a cause, "Work out your own salvation" in verse 12 is only a result.</p><p>In our daily lives we mainly do two things: (1) will (decide)&mdash;this is an inward resolution, and (2) act (work)&mdash;this is outward behavior. All our living is composed of these two things. Inwardly we plan, and outwardly we speak and act. We are able to will and work because God operates in us. This verse does not say that we should will and work; it says that God is operating in our hearts until we are able to will and work. God's operation is God's working. God works in our hearts until we are able to will and work. Since God has already worked in, we are able to work out. If nothing is worked in, nothing can be worked out.</p><p>We often tell God, "O God, I am willing to obey You absolutely. But this is extremely difficult. I do not want to love the world. But this is extremely difficult. I do not want to go along with my self. But this is extremely difficult." There is a way of deliverance; God can work in us to the point that we are able to obey Him absolutely. He is able to work to the point that we do not have to love the world and do not have to go along with our selves. Although we are not able in ourselves, God is able to work until we are able.</p><p>Full salvation for a Christian is not getting rid of one sin today and another evil tomorrow. Complete salvation means to receive the complete Christ. If you have Christ, you have full salvation. It is most difficult to help a Christian whose eyes are not set on Christ! He looks at what is good and bad about himself. He pays attention to his particular sins, to certain persons who entangle him, and to certain things that attract him. He blames himself and tries to overcome all these. But this is a big mistake. God has no intention that he overcome these things one by one or make things right one by one. God only wants him to receive a complete Christ.</p><p>Suppose that a child loves to eat fruit. He may want pears one day and go buy them from an orchard. The next day he may want oranges or bananas and go buy some more. Suppose that he later learns that his father is the owner of the orchard and is giving him the orchard. After he realizes this, his way of eating will be different because all the fruit is his. As Christians, we want to do one thing today and another thing tomorrow. Today we want patience, and tomorrow we want love. This is like the child who buys a pear one day and an orange the next. God wants us to receive the complete Christ. All the things in the "orchard" are ours. If we buy them piece by piece, we will have to buy again and again when we run out.</p><p>I am not saying that we do not need to be patient or to have love. We should be patient, and we should love. But if we try to practice these things item by item, we will not succeed. If we do this, day after day we will find ourselves loving the world more and being prouder than before. We should realize that the whole "orchard" is ours. God wants us to have one common goal&mdash;the complete Christ. God operates in us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.</p><p>In the past perhaps we may have heard the truth concerning Christ living His life out of us. But today I must ask, "Is this our case?" Although we know this, we only practice it on a trial basis. The result is that we inevitably fail.</p><p>First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption." We have to read this verse very slowly and carefully. At the time we were saved, God made Christ our personal righteousness and our personal sanctification. If someone asks, "What is sanctification?", we have to answer, "Christ." What is overcoming? It is Christ. What are patience and humility? They are Christ. If we can answer this way, all will be well and we will overcome. We are thoroughly corrupted and fleshly. But Christ is sanctification. He is my sanctification. No one is holy and no one can overcome. There is only one way to be holy and overcome. It is to say to God, "O God, I receive Your Son!"</p><h2 class="head1">III. WHEN DID CHRIST BEGIN TO LIVE IN US?</h2><p>Only Christ has the overcoming life. When did Christ begin to live in us? When we were saved, we received Christ. "He who has the Son has the life" (1 John 5:12). "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name" (John 1:12). At the time we believed, we received Christ. Second Corinthians 13:5 says, "Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?" Who are those who are not disapproved? "Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out" (John 6:37). Have we come to the Lord? Yes. Since we have come to the Lord, we are not disapproved. What do we have? We have Jesus Christ in us. It is wrong if anyone says that, even though we have believed in the Lord, we do not have Christ within, and therefore, need to receive Christ again. If one is not saved, he should receive Christ. But if he has been saved, Christ is already living in him.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. HOW TO HAVE CHRIST LIVING HIS LIFE OUT OF US</h2><p>We know that only Christ can overcome, we know that Christ lives in us, and we know that when we believe in the Lord we have Christ, but day after day we still remain the same. Nothing changes at all. How can Christ live out His life in us? There are two ways or two conditions:</p><h2 class="head2">A. We Must Surrender</h2><p>It is true that Christ is in us, but if we do not allow Him to work, He will not do anything. We must submit to God. What does it mean to surrender? To surrender is not promising God to do His will or doing good; it is not covenanting with God to do what we cannot. To surrender is to take our hands off our lives and to hand over both our good and evil, our capabilities and shortcomings, our past and future, our problems, our lives, and ourselves totally to God, and to solely allow Him to operate in us.</p><p>If you do not take your hands off, God has no way to live His life out of you. Suppose you give someone a book, but your hands do not let go of the book. The person has no way to possess your book. You should come before God and say to Him, "I will give You all my good and evil, likes and dislikes, willingness and unwillingness, successes and failures." Are you willing to do this? If you are not willing to do even this, God has no way to operate in you. It is your responsibility to hand over your failing self to Him. Today God only wants you to hand over your sinful self to Him.</p><p>To surrender does not mean that God wants you to do something you cannot do. He only wants you to hand over your good and evil and merits and defects to Him. I read a story about a young man who said, "I am willing to do everything, but there is one thing that I am not willing to do. If God asks me to preach to a Catholic, I cannot do it." Brothers and sisters, are you willing to hand over your unwilling heart to Him?</p><p>There are two kinds of surrender: one is to consecrate to God for His use, and the other is to consecrate to God for His operation. Many think that surrendering is just consecrating to God for His use. Brothers and sisters, God requests one thing of us: to henceforth give ourselves to God. This is the meaning of putting the self to death and being delivered from our flesh. We must hand over ourselves to Him. Are we willing to do this? If we are willing, we will overcome.</p><p>It is very difficult to take your hands off the persons or things that you love. I can say plainly that it is truly a very difficult thing to do. Whenever a price is too high in your eyes, you become very unwilling to let go. Suppose you always fail in the matter of friendship. It is very difficult to say to God, "No matter what will happen to my friends, I give them all to You. Deliver me from this friendship." Let me give you another example. Suppose you pray for a sick person who is not related to you. It is easy for you to believe that God will help him. Even though no one helps him and no one comes to his aid, you are not concerned. But if your parents, wife, or husband is sick, it is very difficult for you to commit them to the Lord. When no one comes to help them or cure them, you are afraid that they will die. This shows that those you love the most are the hardest for you to take your hands off of.</p><p>Today God does not want us to do good. He just wants us to give everything to Him. We have already had enough failure to chill our heart. I had a sin which I was not able to overcome until a few months ago. I tried to hand it over to God but lacked the faith. I tried once, twice, three times, even many times, but everything remained the same. Eventually, I simply gave the matter to God. Today we do not need to care about anything else. We only need to ask if we are willing to commit ourselves completely into the hands of God. If there is anything that we cannot let go of, whether a person, the world, a sin, or a certain matter, all we have to do is say to the Lord, "Lord, I give You whatever I am not willing to let go of. I ask You to operate in me until I am willing to let go." It does not worry me if you are not willing to let go of a person. It does not worry me if you are a hundred times weaker than you were before, and it does not worry me if you commit more sins. The only thing that worries me is that you may not be willing to give yourself to God's operation. Are you willing to commit to God your loved ones, a certain sin, a certain difficulty, or a certain matter that is not pleasing to God? It does not matter if you have a thousand or a million weaknesses and failures. But are you willing to say to God, "God, I commit everything to You"?</p><p>To surrender is not a matter of taking some bitter pill and suffering to death. To surrender is just allowing God to operate in us until we become willing. To surrender does not require that we do what we cannot do. It only requires us to place ourselves in the hand of God, to let God work until we become submissive and are willing to forego everything. As long as we are willing, God will have a way. God does not worry how great our sin is and how corrupted we are; God is only concerned that we do not put our heart into His hand.</p><p>In brief, surrender is just the submission of our will. It is to commit ourselves to God's hand, and to allow Him to work to His satisfaction.</p><h2 class="head2">B. We Must Believe</h2><p>After we have surrendered, we must believe that God can surely save us from our love, our unwillingness, and our inabilities. Psalm 37:5 says, "Commit your way to Jehovah, /And trust in Him; and He will act." To commit is to surrender, and to trust is to believe. The result of surrendering and believing is that He will act. We cannot do anything except commit ourselves to God and believe that the indwelling Lord will accomplish His purpose.</p><p>Can you say, "I have overcome"? Hallelujah! I can say that I have overcome because the Bible tells me so. What a pity, not only is our faith not as big as a grain of mustard seed; it is not even as big as a speck of dust! If we have faith, God will operate. God used only the word of His mouth to create the heavens and the earth; when He said, "Let there be light," there was light. If we have faith, God will operate, because it is God who will accomplish His work.</p><p>A few weeks ago a brother came to me and said that he could not overcome three or four sins. Sometimes he even wanted to commit suicide. I asked him, "Do you believe that Christ can save you from your sins?" He answered, "I believe." Then he said, "But I commit these sins again and again. I have overcome all other sins, but I cannot overcome these few." I read Romans 8:1 with him. "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus." I said to him, "The Bible says that there is a condition for being saved, which is to be in Christ Jesus. Are you in Christ Jesus?" He responded, "Yes." The Bible says, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death" (v. 2). I asked, "Are you free?" He said, "The Bible says I am free from the law of sin and of death, but I dare not say it." Then I said, "Where is your faith?"</p><p>I am not afraid of man's weakness, corruption, or sins. But I am afraid of those who do not believe in God's Word. How precious are the words "has freed"! God's Word says "has freed"; it does not say "will free." Do we believe?</p><p>Christ has died for us. As long as we believe in Him, we have eternal life. What more evidence do we need? The Bible has said it. The Bible has also said, "The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." I am already free and already delivered from the law of sin and of death. Even if there are a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand sins, I am delivered from them all. I am also delivered from the spiritual death that comes from Adam.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, do you believe this word? Do you believe that you are already delivered from the law of sin and of death? The Bible says that you have been delivered. If you believe, you will say, Hallelujah! Praise God! God's Word says that you are delivered from the law of sin and of death! Do you have certain sins or unclean thoughts which you cannot overcome? If so, please know that there is a gospel for you today: the law of the Spirit of life has freed you in Christ Jesus from all kinds of sins.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we must see that surrendering and believing work interdependently. Once these two things are linked together, we will certainly overcome and not fail. It is impossible to overcome merely by believing, without committing one's life to the Lord in exchange for the life of Christ. It is true that we received everything at the time of regeneration. But if our will does not cooperate to commit ourselves to God and if we do not allow Christ to live through us, God will not force us to do anything. On the other hand, if we merely surrender but do not believe, the surrendering is only a dead work. Although one is prepared to grant God the opportunity to work, he has not yet granted God the opportunity to come in.</p><p>We must: (1) lift up our head to say to God, "I commit my all to You; I am willing to let You work," and (2) believe that God has accomplished everything according to His Word.</p><p>Christ has fought all the battles for us. The government is upon His shoulders (Isa. 9:6). Day by day we only have to believe in Him this way. Faith is something continual, while surrender is only needed once; once it is done it is settled forever. (While it is true that some people surrender gradually and slowly, this is not at all necessary.) We can commit everything to God in an instant; there is no need to repeat such an act. Since we have committed everything to Him, we should believe that God will cause Christ to live out His holiness and victory through us. Formerly, salvation involved being delivered from the judgment of hell; now, salvation involves being delivered from the authority of sin. There is no need to do anything else; all we have to do is commit and believe. I hope that everyone of us can testify to our victory.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, all we have to do is believe. Unbelief profits nothing; belief brings in change. God has spoken. We have to praise and thank Him! We should believe calmly, without depending on any feeling. God has spoken and that is it. We have not seen heaven and hell; however, we believe that there is heaven and hell because of God's Word. As long as we believe, there is no need of further proof. Only one proof is needed&mdash;the Word of God; there is no need of other proof. We do not have to see if we have changed. We only need to believe that what God has spoken counts. If we believe, there will be change. If we do not believe, we will see no change.</p><p>Once, I shared Romans 8:2 with a brother and asked him if he believed. He said, "I believe." I asked him again, "If you rise up tomorrow morning and sin again, what will happen? Suppose you still sin, what will you do?" He did not know how to answer. Brothers and sisters, the greatest danger is the first temptation that comes along the way. Satan will say, "Your surrendering and believing was in vain. Have you not sinned again? Are you any different from before? You are still the same!" But brothers and sisters, I have said this and I want to say it again: "Faith is always long-lived. Anything that is short-lived is not faith. Of everything in this world, faith survives the longest." Trials may come, but as long as God says you are victorious, you will certainly overcome and the trials will fail. How you deal with the first temptation will prove whether or not you have faith.</p><p>The Lord Jesus said to the disciples, "Let us go over to the other side" (Mark 4:35). Later there "arose a great windstorm, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already beginning to fill up....And they woke Him and said to Him, Teacher, does it not matter to You that we are perishing? And having awoken, He rebuked the wind and said to the sea, Be silent! Be still! And the wind ceased and there was a great calm. And He said to them, Why are you cowardly in this way? How is it that you do not have faith?" (vv. 37-40). Since the Lord commanded them to go over to the other side, they would certainly arrive there. Even if the waves were greater, they would not have stopped them from reaching the other side. Brothers and sisters, the most important thing is to believe the Word of God. God has spoken; this is sufficient; do not care for anything else.</p><h1 class="title">A TWO-SIDED TRUTH</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 2:12-18</h1><p>We know that the Epistle to the Philippians was written by Paul in a prison in Rome. While he was in prison, Paul wrote not only the Epistle to the Philippians but also the Epistles to the Ephesians and the Colossians. Each of these three books has its own special emphasis. Ephesians is on the Body of Christ. Colossians is on Christ and His relationship to the church. Philippians does not cover deep doctrines like Ephesians and Colossians. Its general subject stresses one thing, which is to have no discord. Philippians 4:2 says, "I exhort Euodias, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord." These two workers were sisters. There was disharmony between them, and Paul wrote to exhort them.</p><p>Philippians pays considerable attention to humility, harmony, and loving one another. Philippians can be considered as a kind of footnote to 1 Corinthians 13. Paul exhorted the Philippians to have lowliness of mind and to consider others more excellent than themselves. Each should not regard his own virtues, but the virtues of others also. Then he spoke of the Lord's emptying Himself, how He took the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men, and humbling Himself to become obedient unto death, and that the death of a cross. Paul told them that this was the mind of Christ, and he exhorted them to have this mind in them, which was also in Christ Jesus. But immediately a problem arose. Although they might have been willing to follow this example, they were unable. It is one thing to hear and another thing to do. The apostle Paul spoke of the Lord's emptying Himself, His humbling, and His becoming obedient unto the death of a cross. This is such a lofty standard. The two sisters might have wondered how they could meet this high standard. Therefore, Paul had to go on to tell them how they could reach this standard. This is the subject of verses 12 through 18.</p><p>Verse 12 says, "So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling." "So then" indicates that these verses are a continuation of the previous verses. The words "my beloved" were used whenever Paul was about to say something very important. Since he addressed them this way, what follows was very important. "Even as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence." What does this mean? Paul was saying in effect, "When I preached the gospel among you, you obeyed me. Now that some troubles have started, you should obey me all the more. Not only was the gospel preached to you when I was among you, and not only was I a pattern to you, but you obeyed me while I was in contact with you. Therefore, you should obey me now all the more." These words reveal three things: (1) While Paul was with them, they obeyed because they were in contact with him. (2) While Paul was away, they were still obedient because Paul had committed them to God. (3) Now they needed to obey in one thing more&mdash;to work out their salvation in fear and trembling.</p><p>"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling." We should read these words over and over again. Fear is towards God, while trembling is towards oneself. On the one hand, we should fear God, and on the other hand, we should be trembling in ourselves. Because temptation is so fierce, we should tremble. Because God is so great, we should fear. But please note how this salvation is being worked out. We thank the Lord that God has a way to work it out.</p><p>The Bible divides salvation into three stages. The first stage is in the past, when God saved us out of the punishment of hell. The second stage is in the present, when God saves us from the power of sin. The third stage is in the future, when God will save us into the kingdom to reign with Christ. We can illustrate these by a few examples:</p><p>Second Timothy 1:9: "Who has saved us." This is in the past. Everyone who believes has obtained this salvation.</p><p>Hebrews 7:25: "He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him." This is a present salvation, something that we obtain today.</p><p>Hebrews 9:28: "So Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time to those who eagerly await Him, apart from sin, unto salvation." This is a future salvation.</p><p>The Bible clearly shows us that there are three kinds of salvation. One is in the past, one is in the present, and one is in the future. Although some Christians have received the past salvation, they may not have received the present and future salvation. Some Christians have received the past salvation as well as the present salvation, and they will also receive the future salvation. It is possible for a person to be delivered from the punishment of hell yet still sin every day. A person may be delivered from the punishment of hell, but he may not necessarily be able to reign in the future. Let me quote three more passages to prove these three stages of salvation.</p><p>Ephesians 2:8: "For by grace you have been saved." This is the past salvation.</p><p>Romans 5:10: "For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled." This is the present salvation which we receive through the life of the Lord.</p><p>Romans 8:24: "We were saved in hope." This is for the future.</p><p>We praise and thank the Lord that we are saved! But there are still two salvations that are not yet accomplished. This is why we have to pursue them. If a person is not yet saved, we tell him that the minute he believes he will be saved. This salvation refers to the salvation from the punishment of hell. Even though we are already saved, we still need to be saved from the power of sin, and we still need to seek after the glory of the coming kingdom. This is why we have to work out our salvation with fear and trembling.</p><p>Mr. D.L. Moody was a powerful preacher and a capable soul-winner. But he said that he had never in his life seen a lazy man be saved! This means that even though a man may want to be saved from the punishment of hell, if he is lazy, he cannot make it. "Therefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you" (Eph. 5:14).</p><p>During the past few weeks, I have been speaking on the fact that we cannot do anything, and that the minute we try, we suffer greatly. But if we surrender and believe, Christ will do everything for us. This, however, is only half of the story; there is still the other half, which is the working out of our own salvation with fear and trembling. We have to be responsible for this part. If we do not do this part, we will become unbalanced. It is true that Christ has died for us, shed His blood, and resurrected and ascended for us. Some think that since this is the case, all they have to do is worship and be absolutely passive. There is no more need to pray, to read the Bible, or to consecrate themselves. However, the very fact that God has accomplished salvation means that we should be all the more zealous. God has done it, and we should work it out. But how can we work it out? The next verse tells us.</p><p>Philippians 2:13: "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure." Verses 12 and 13 can be considered two sides of one glorious truth; they include everything. If we look at the first verse, we may think that we have to do everything ourselves. But if we look at the second verse, we see that everything is done by God. On the one hand, these verses say that we should work it out. On the other hand, they say that God will do it. These are not contradictory words; they are complementary words. Verse 12 says that we should work it out, while verse 13 says that God will enable us to work it out.</p><p>These two verses explain a very important two-sided truth in the Bible. From the Bible we see, on the one hand, that God has many solemn commandments; He commands that we do this and do that. It seems as if He has put an unbearable burden upon us. We are pressed beyond measure, unable to move our feet, and are pressured to the point of death. On the other hand, there seem to be many promises of God which promise that God is doing this and that for us; everything seems to be according to His grace and everything seems to be His work; it seems as if we have nothing to do. Because some do not understand this two-sided truth, they become biased. Some people think that everything is related to God's commandments, and that we have to obey them ourselves. They see God's commandments as a heavy burden. On the one hand, they cannot lift it, yet on the other hand, they cannot drop it. They feel that they are pressured to the point of death. Then there are some who think that everything is according to God's grace and God's work. God accomplishes everything, and man does not have to be responsible for anything. Inevitably, this leads to laxity. These biases (no matter which side one is biased toward) are dangerous in that one can neither fulfill the scriptural commands nor obtain the scriptural promises. God's truth is equally important on both sides. God is working in us, and at the same time, we are working it out; we work out what God has worked into us. If we merely allow God to work within us without working out this work ourselves, we will have nothing. However, if we try to work things out ourselves without allowing God to work within us, this also will result in nothing.</p><p>Everything with the human life can be summed up in the words "the willing and the working." To will is an inward resolution, while to work is an outward act. We act out whatever we have inwardly resolved to do. This is the meaning of willing and working. The willing refers to the condition of our heart, while the working refers to our outward conduct. Yet both our inward willing and our outward working are the result of God's operating within us for the accomplishment of His good pleasure. All the willing is done through God's operation, and all the working is done also through His operation.</p><p>We often want to obey God yet find ourselves unable to obey. But God tells us that He will work in us to the extent that we will obey and work out what needs to be worked out. Many Christians find it very painful that they cannot do many things. They often want to tell God how painful it is to try to obey Him, and that they cannot make it. They do not want to love the world, yet they cannot stop loving it. They do not want to hate others, yet they cannot stop hating. God has not ordained that we should suffer. His intention is to operate in us until we become able to do whatever we should do. Hence, we should say to the Lord, "Although I cannot obey, give up the world, or love others, I ask that You operate within me until I become willing to obey You, drop the world, and stop hating others." If you believe, you will see a change after you pray this way. Even a matter that you have not been able to overcome for a period of three to four years will be overcome through such committing and believing.</p><p>When Mr. Chapman first began his work for the Lord, those who gathered to hear him grew in number day by day, and a great building was erected at the place where he preached. Mr. Moody heard of his fame, and took a train to where his church was, in order to listen to his preaching. When Moody arrived, he sat quietly and listened. After the meeting, Mr. Chapman recognized Moody and stepped down from the platform to greet him. He asked Moody for a frank comment. Mr. Moody said, "Brother, your work is a failure; it will not be successful, because there is something wrong with your life." When Mr. Chapman heard this, he was not happy. He thought, "Mr. Moody should not have criticized me this way. He does not have the authority to say this to me." Nevertheless, he realized that Moody had pointed out something to him, and he knew that in at least one area he was not perfect. He realized that he was too attached to his wife and children; for two or three weeks, he felt very bad about it. In the end, he told the Lord, "I cannot give up my love for my wife and children. But I pray that You will make me able." From that day on, he found the proper way to love his wife and children. Later he became very prevailing in his work. When someone asked him to give a testimony, he said, "If I can preach the gospel or deliver any message, and if there is any goodness in me at all, it comes from that one time of obedience that I had."</p><p>God will operate in us to the point that we become able. Abraham ordered the old servant to find Rebekah for Isaac. The old servant had to do his best to bring her to Canaan, but Abraham prepared the camels and needed items for the journey (Gen. 24:10, 61). The one who was wounded by the robbers on the way to Jericho was carried by the Samaritan on his own beast and brought to the inn (Luke 10:30, 33-35). We do not have the strength to walk, because we have suffered the sin-wound; we will never be able to walk by ourselves. But God operates in us until we can will, work, and do everything. He operates in us both the willing and the working for whatever is according to His good pleasure. If we can remember this, everything will be well.</p><p>Mr. D.M. Panton in England once said that when God is in us, we can do everything God can do. When one woman died, her epitaph said, "She has done what she could not otherwise have done!"</p><p>Daily we live a life which is seemingly impossible to live. If it is ever possible for us to experience full salvation, and if our life can ever be clean and perfect, it is because of God's operation in us. Many people want to imitate Christ, but they never succeed. God must first work before we can work. We have to lay hold of this fact daily: it is God who operates in us. It is not our working, but God who first works, and then we work. If we see the lofty standard of the Bible, think we should meet it, and try to meet it, we will surely fail. We ought to ask God to operate in us until we become willing.</p><p>Mr. Panton once told a story. A doctor charged a nurse to ask a patient to do one thing. The nurse told the patient accordingly. But the patient said that he could not do it. The nurse went back and told the doctor. The doctor went to find out why the patient could not do it. After he examined the patient, he said, "The problem with this person is not that he cannot do it or that he will not do it, but that he cannot make himself willing to do it." The problem with us is that within we are not willing, while without we are not able. Within, we are not willing to give up the world, and without, we are not able to give up the world. But God can operate in us until we become willing and able to fulfill God's good pleasure, and until we actually carry it out.</p><p>God has worked in; therefore, we can work out. Because God has operated within us, we can work out whatever He has worked in. Our burden today is the way to practice. It is not a matter of waiting or praying, but a matter of working it out. Everyone who has believed in the Lord has Christ living within him. "Do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?" (2 Cor. 13:5).</p><p>There are two common mistakes. One is to think that we should do good; we hope to do good and to have a spiritual living. The other mistake is to think that since we are saved already, we do not have to move a finger anymore; there is no need to pray, read the Bible, or consecrate, because Christ will automatically make us zealous. The mistake of the first group is to try to do good by themselves. The mistake of the second group is to think that there is no need to strive and pursue after a person is saved. Actually, if a saved person is not diligent, he will not have a spiritual living. Yet, if we do not believe in God, nothing will avail either. We must believe that God operates in us to will and to work, and that therefore we can pray, read the Bible, and testify. The believing comes first, and the working out comes afterwards. The kingdom is taken by violence; the violent ones seize it (Matt. 11:12). Day by day we have to work out our salvation. We should not say that there is no way, because God has done everything. Since we have received what we have received, we can surely make it. Let me give a few illustrations.</p><p>The Lord taught the disciples, saying, "Take heed to yourselves. If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him. And if he sins against you seven times in a day and turns again to you seven times, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him" (Luke 17:3-4). Immediately after this word, the disciples prayed, saying, "Increase our faith" (v. 5). The disciples knew that they could not do it. It is terrible enough for someone to sin once, twice, or three times. If he sins seven times and repents seven times, this is too trying and difficult to endure. Therefore, the disciples asked the Lord to increase their faith. How did the Lord answer them? "If you have faith like a mustard seed, you would have said to this sycamine tree, Be uprooted and be planted in the sea; and it would have obeyed you" (v. 6). What does this have to do with forgiveness? When we have faith within, we can say to the hatred within our heart, "Hatred, go away." When we have such a faith, we can forgive others when they come to ask for forgiveness. When we believe that God has done it, we can make it. Not only do we need faith before we can forgive others, we need faith before we can read the Bible, pray, or give up the world. When we believe that God can make us do it, we can do it.</p><p>Philippians 2:14 says, "Do all things without murmurings and reasonings." The apostle told us that it is God who operates within us to will and to work. The result of such operation is obvious: the saints will be in harmony with one another, and there will not be murmurings and reasonings. To have no reasonings means to have no doubt or wavering. To have no murmurings means to be able to believe and to love one another. Verse 13 says that God's life is working in us, while verse 14 tells us of the resultant perfect harmony.</p><p>Not only does Philippians speak of this. We can find similar examples in Ephesians and Colossians. After Ephesians 3:19 speaks of being "filled unto all the fullness of God" (verses 20-21 being words of praise), 4:2-3 immediately speaks of "all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing one another in love, being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace." When God's power operates within a believer, the resultant outward manifestation among the believers is peace. Colossians 1:11 says, "Being empowered with all power, according to the might of His glory, unto all endurance and long-suffering with joy." The might of God's glory is God's great power. We may think that once we receive the might of God's glory, we will be able to perform miracles, do works of wonders, and accomplish unimaginably great things. Little do we realize that the result is nothing other than endurance and long-suffering. Yet this is the ultimate expression of God's power.</p><p>It is harder to endure a bothersome believer than to pray to God and ask for an answer to our prayer. It is hard to endure. Yet God's power can make us able to endure. All three books tell us that when we receive the operation and filling of God's power, we will have peace with others, and we can endure and suffer.</p><p>Philippians 2:15 says, "That you may be blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as luminaries in the world." To be blameless is to be irreproachable. To be guileless is to be inwardly simple and not double-minded. Crooked means something that is not straight, while perverted means to come apart or to become disjointed. This verse tells us that a Christian is set apart from the generation which has deviated and become disjointed from God's will; he is simple and blameless, and is a light in the world. To shine is an expression of life.</p><p>Verse 16 says, "Holding forth the word of life, so that I may have a boast in the day of Christ that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain." Some believers think that they can lead others to Christ by their good works, and that there is no need for them to open their mouth to testify. But only ignorant believers would say this. We should hold forth the word of life. We should present to others the word of life; we should lift it up high so that others may see it. We should not only testify with our life, but also testify with our mouth. The Bible never says that witnessing is only done by our life and not by our mouth. Among our relatives, friends, and those whom we have contact with, we should open our mouth to testify. Otherwise, we have not held forth the word of life. While Matthew says, "You are the light of the world" (5:14), it also says that we should confess the Lord's name (10:32). If you can believe and work out what you believe, you should also believe that, in addition to shining, you can testify to those around you. Paul said if we do this, we are perfected.</p><p>"The day of Christ" is the day when Christ reigns. To "run" refers to seeking out sinners and preaching the gospel to them. To "labor" refers to our ministering to the believers, shepherding and teaching them. According to the apostle, if the believers would do the above things, they could boast in the day of Christ that they had not run in vain or labored in vain.</p><p>Verse 17 says, "But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and I rejoice together with you all." "The sacrifice and service of your faith" is the living sacrifice in Romans 12:1, which comes as a result of presenting our bodies. According to Paul, if the Philippians would do the above things, he was willing even to die with them and sacrifice his own life for them. If they would offer themselves as sacrifices to God, Paul was willing to sacrifice his own life. Paul had rejoiced before. But now he would rejoice together with them all.</p><p>Verse 18 says, "And in like manner you also rejoice, and you rejoice together with me." In the last verse Paul was rejoicing, and was rejoicing together with them all. This verse says that they should rejoice and rejoice together with Paul. Those who are under the operation of God's power have nothing to say except to rejoice.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we should believe that God has done His work, and therefore we can work out what He has worked in. All we need to do now is be willing.</p><h1 class="series">A PRAYER FOR REVELATION</h1><h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1><p>The goal of God's redemption is to work Himself into us until we become mingled with Him, possessing His life and nature, and are transformed to become the same as He. God has put His very own being, with all that His nature possesses, into Christ, His Son, and through the Son, He has given everything to us. When God gives us Christ, He gives us everything related to Himself and His nature. Through His death on the cross, Christ completed in His flesh all the steps that were necessary for us to receive God and all that His nature possesses. Through resurrection, He has passed  into the Spirit, and through ascension, He has descended in the Holy Spirit into all those who have believed and received Him.</p><p>God in Christ has accomplished everything concerning our salvation, and in the Holy Spirit, He has wrought these things into us. Everything concerning God and His nature is in Christ, and everything has come into us through the Holy Spirit. God is in Christ, Christ is in the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is in us. When we receive the Holy Spirit, we receive Christ, and when we receive Christ, we receive everything concerning God and His nature. Since we are joined to Christ in the Spirit, everything that Christ has experienced and attained, such as death, resurrection, ascension, and entrance into glory, is our experience and attainment. Hence, everything concerning God and His nature and all of Christ's experiences and attainments have become ours! God's salvation has given us all this! We have received everything that God will give to us and has done for us. We do not need anything more. The question before us now is whether or not we realize what we have received. May we follow the apostle Paul to have such a prayer for revelation!</p><p>Witness Lee</p><h1 class="title">A PRAYER FOR REVELATION</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:3-23</h1><p>As we begin to know God, His work, and His eternal plan which He purposed in eternity, we begin to realize that the light in the book of Ephesians is abundant, high, and special. We need to realize one thing before the Lord: in the book of Ephesians, God caused Paul to pray two prayers. One prayer is found in chapter one, while the other is found in chapter three. The prayer in chapter one is basic, while the prayer in chapter three is for the building. In chapter one, Paul prayed that we would realize our relationship with the Lord. In chapter three, he wanted us not only to realize our relationship with the Lord, but also our relationship with the church. Now we will speak on Paul's prayer in chapter one.</p><p>In verse 17 Paul prayed, "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him." Why did Paul want the believers to have a spirit of wisdom and revelation? He wanted them to have it in order to know the following things:</p><p>(1) "The full knowledge of Him" (v. 17). This is to know God Himself.</p><p>(2) "The hope of His calling, and what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints" (v. 18). This refers to God's eternal plan and the accomplishment of His plan. God's calling is for us to be His sons. These sons are His inheritance. God's calling was made before the foundation of the world. In the coming eternity, He will have an inheritance in the saints, an inheritance that is full of the riches of glory. In eternity past God made a decision, and in eternity future God will gain a result. These two things added together make up God's eternal plan and its goal. Paul was trying to make known to us the eternal plan of God.</p><p>(3) "The surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe" (v. 19). This refers to the kind of power God uses today to reach His goal and accomplish His plan. Today this is related particularly to our relationship with Him and His eternal plan. We have to know these few things, and we must receive revelation before the Lord concerning them.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF HIM</h2><p>Paul asked God to give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation to know these three things. The first is to have "the full knowledge of Him." How wonderful it is that we can have the full knowledge of God.</p><p>While Paul was in Athens, he passed by an altar, upon which was inscribed, "TO AN UNKNOWN GOD" (Acts 17:23). In the minds of the Athenians, there was no way to know God. They could not know God by their mind or by their philosophies. They could hypothesize and speculate, but they still did not know God. This is like some men today who say that there is a God with their mouth, but who do not know Him.</p><p>Before the Lord Jesus died, He said, "And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ" (John 17:3). He showed us what eternal life is. Eternal life is just the knowledge of God. The Ephesian saints knew God already; we cannot say that they did not know anything about God. They definitely knew God, because they had eternal life already. But Paul prayed in his first prayer that God would "give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him." While the Athenians did not know God at all, this prayer reveals that a Christian, who has received eternal life and who has known God initially, may still not have a sufficient knowledge of God.</p><p>Immediately after we believe in the Lord, or a few years after we believe in Him, we cannot say that we do not know something about God. Yet we often depend very much on our mentality or our feeling to support us in our journey. We know a little about God. But other than the little that we know, we very much depend on our thoughts and ideas. If we do not have these thoughts and ideas to support us, we feel that our knowledge of God is not that sure and our reasonings not that sound. Therefore, we often need the support of our mind in maintaining our Christian walk. It seems that when we reach an impasse in our reasoning or in our doctrines, we cannot go on without the help of our mind. At other times, we need feelings, feelings of warmth, feelings of joy, and feelings of exuberance. We need these feelings in addition to our knowledge of God before we can go on.</p><p>Yet one day God gives to us a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Then He reveals Himself to us in a fresh, special, and deepening way, so that we can say that not only do we know Him, but we have a full knowledge of Him. Then we can declare, "Now I know. I have seen, and I am clear. I do not need any other support. I do not need my mind or my feelings to support me anymore. I have the full knowledge of God now."</p><p>Perhaps some of you do not understand what I mean. I will illustrate with a few examples. A Christian once said, "I have been a believer for twenty-two years. During the first two years, I tried hard to believe. If you asked me if I was saved, I could tell you definitely that I was; no one could say that I was not saved. I knew that I was saved, and I knew that I had eternal life. But there was one problem: when others asked if I believed in God, I had to push myself very hard to tell them that I did. It seemed as if I was grasping hold of my believing, and that if I did not grasp on to it, I would become a non-Christian. My believing in the Lord was a tiresome believing. Did I believe in God? Yes, I did. But did I know Him? No, I did not. I needed many reasons and doctrines to support my belief. I could only be at peace when I found enough reasons to justify myself and when I found the right doctrines. Only then could I speak to others about my faith. I needed the support of my mind to be a Christian. But today I can testify that I am not like that anymore. I can say that I know my God. I do not need any reasons to support my faith, and I do not need any external evidence to defend my belief."</p><p>Brothers and sisters, this is what it is like when we truly know God. This kind of knowledge comes from revelation. It is not a matter of a lucid teaching, but a matter of inward knowledge. This knowledge is unlike the knowledge we had when we first believed, which had to be handled with much care, like a cup full of water, lest it spill. Many people believe in the Lord Jesus in a way that is like holding a cup full of water; they walk very carefully. They are afraid of hearing this or that. But one day God gives them a revelation, and they know Him; they begin to have the full knowledge of Him, and they truly see Him. Then they no longer have any problems. Brothers and sisters, if you truly know Him, the whole world's faith will not help you, and the whole world's unbelief will not shake you. Even if the arguments of others sound reasonable, even if they say that the Bible is false, and even if there are more reasons to disbelieve than to believe, no reason can shake you. You can boldly declare, "I know inwardly. My knowledge is deeper than my mind. My knowledge is deeper than my feelings. Nothing outward can shake this inward knowledge of mine."</p><p>This is indeed a very crucial matter. Many Christians live by their feelings. If they feel happy and joyful, they say that God has been gracious to them. If they feel cold and indifferent, and if they lose their taste for everything, they almost say, "Where is God? It is hard to know Him!" Many people are sustained by their feelings. Once their feelings are gone, they waver and shake. They are this way because they do not have the full knowledge of God. God has to lead us to the point that we no longer care if we feel cold or hot, indifferent or excited, because we have known God. Our knowledge is deeper than our joy, our pain, or any feeling. Although outwardly there may be joy, pain, or other kinds of feelings, no feeling will change us, because we know Him inwardly. Brothers and sisters, only this kind of Christian will stand, and only this kind of Christian will not be shaken. God can only use this kind of person.</p><p>There was a brother who was told not long after he became a believer that there were mistakes in the Bible. He became so worried that he almost cried. He believed that the Bible was right, and he believed that there could not be anything wrong with it. But others pointed out to him several places which made him a little concerned. He worried about what would happen if the Bible was indeed wrong. He referred this matter to an older sister. He thought that she would definitely be concerned if she heard about some mistakes in the Bible because she loved the Lord and the Bible so much. But to his surprise, after he mentioned it, the sister acted as if nothing had happened. She only said, "It does not matter." The brother thought, "It does not matter to you. But it matters to me." He pressed on for an answer from the sister. Eventually, the sister replied that one's knowledge of God does not depend on such questions being answered. The brother thought, "Perhaps a person as old as you does not need to think about these questions. But I am a young person, and I have a mind that thinks. It is impossible for me to let this matter go so easily." Later that brother spent a year to study the Bible and investigate the allegations. Eventually, he found the evidence to prove that the Bible had no mistake and that it was right. He felt that a big rock was removed from his heart. Actually, had that brother known God, he would not have needed to waste his time worrying. Brothers and sisters, if you have the full knowledge of God, even if more questions come, you will not have any rock in your heart, and nothing will bother you. Others may prove this and that, but Christians can prove one thing&mdash;God is God. We know our God. He is so real. Once we know, we know. If we have the full knowledge of Him, every problem will go away. It is not a matter of persuasive reasonings or clear doctrines, but a matter of revelation. Revelation is indispensable. We have to ask God to give us a spirit of revelation, so that we can have the full knowledge of Him. This knowledge is foundational to a believer, and it is quite necessary.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING GOD'S CALLING AND HIS INHERITANCE</h2><p>Not only does God want us to know Him; He wants us to know His calling. He wants us to know what our calling is and what is His inheritance in the saints. In other words, not only does God want us to know Him, but He wants us to know what He is doing from eternity to eternity. He wants us to know His eternal plan and its purpose.</p><p>Ephesians speaks of things that span from eternity to eternity. It shows us God's eternal plan. Paul speaks of God's calling, His inheritance in the saints, and His power toward us who believe. This tells us that when a man truly understands God's eternal plan, and when he sees what God is doing from eternity to eternity, he will realize that God's eternal plan is related to everyone who is called. It is also related to the inheritance which God secures in the saints and to the power which He manifests among them. This shows us that God's eternal plan is not something abstract; it is not something unimportant, dispensable, or something that one can shuffle aside. Brothers and sisters, God's eternal plan has a great deal to do with every one of us. When we speak of God's eternal plan, do not think that this is something unfathomable or incomprehensible. No, God's eternal plan has a great deal to do with our calling; it has a great deal to do with God's inheritance, and it has a great deal to do with God's power and its operation in us.</p><p>Let us first consider God's calling and His inheritance, and then we will consider the power which is manifested toward us who believe.</p><p>First, let us look at God's calling. Verse 18 says, "The eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of His calling." I do not know how many Christians know that there is a hope before them. Many people only hope for heaven. Thank the Lord that there is heaven; it is true that there is heaven. But this is not the goal for which God has called us. This is not the hope of His calling. What then is this calling? Verse 4 says, "Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love." This is God's calling. God's calling is that we be like God. On the positive side, it is to be holy, and on the negative side, it is to be without blemish and blameless. Brothers and sisters, what a grand calling this is! If you have never been weak, and if you have never realized that you have erred, you will not realize how special this calling is. But if you know a little about how weak and worthless you are, and how wrong you have been, you will realize the preciousness of this calling. You will say, "Thank the Lord. You have called me to be holy and without blemish; You have called me to be blameless and to be as perfect as You are." Thank the Lord that one day the goal for which God has chosen us will be reached. It does not matter how weak and worthless we are today, and it does not matter how many defects and faults we have today. Thank Him that one day He will bring us to the point where we will stand before Him holy and without blemish as He is. This is what God has chosen us for, and this is what He has called us into. Since He has ordained this, He will surely accomplish it. Now we know the kind of hope we have before God. We have hope, and our hope is to be like God. God has chosen us and called us for this.</p><p>Second, let us consider God's inheritance in the saints. Verse 18 says, "The eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that you may know...what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints." What is the inheritance God has in the saints? The saints are God's inheritance; they are God's possession. This verse does not say that God has given the saints an inheritance. Rather, it says that the saints have become God's inheritance. Paul said that God has an inheritance in the saints. Such an inheritance is glorious. It is not only glorious, but in it are the riches of glory.</p><p>In Ephesians 1:5 and 11, the word predestinate is used. Verse 5 says, "Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will." This tells us that we were predestinated unto sonship. Verse 11 says, "In whom also we were designated as an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One who works all things according to the counsel of His will." This tells us that we were predestinated to become His inheritance. There is a slight difference between verse 5 and verse 11, though the two are related.</p><p>God has an eternal plan which spans from eternity to eternity. His plan is to gain many sons. Many people do not realize how great the matter of sonship is. But we have to realize that God's goal is to have sons. God's plan involves sons. Galatians 4:6 says, "And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!" This shows us that God has put the Spirit of His Son in us for the purpose of making us His sons. Hebrews 2:10 says, "For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory." This shows us that when God reaches His goal, many sons will be in glory. God is leading many sons into glory. His purpose is to gain sons. He calls these sons His inheritance. In Ephesians 1, God shows us, on the one hand, that He has predestinated us to be sons (v. 5), and on the other hand, He has predestinated us to be His inheritance (v. 11).</p><p>What is God's inheritance? God's inheritance means something that belongs to God. God has predestinated us unto sonship, and He has also predestinated us to be His inheritance. Every one of us belongs to God. Paul prayed that the eyes of our heart would be enlightened to know the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints. What is this glory? This glory is to be the same as God is and to glorify God. This is what God desires. He has chosen us to be His people, His inheritance, and His sons. May the Lord open our eyes to see what a glory this is!</p><p>Not only should we know Him, we should also know His work, His plan, and His goal. In order to have this knowledge, we need a vision. Without a vision, we will see little; it will be limited and temporary. Concerning spiritual works, we are often burdened with the little projects in our hands. We are happy when we see good results from our works, and we are sad when we do not see good results from our works. Our view is limited to a small sphere, and we do not see the greater things before the Lord's eyes. What we see is indeed trifling. We are like a small child with a ten dollar note in his hand; he is overwhelmed by the note. It is his total possession. Many times, our views are just as small; we do not see the eternal things. We have to realize that God's view is from eternity to eternity. He desires to open our eyes and deliver us from being narrow. Man is too narrow. We are too narrow, and the works in our hands are too narrow. God wants to deliver us from this narrow realm. He wants to show us the hope of His calling and the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints. This is not merely a matter of man's need, but a matter of God's need. Why do we have to preach the gospel? We preach the gospel not only because man has a need, but because God has an even greater need. Do not think that the gospel of grace and the gospel of the kingdom are two different gospels. No, they are not two different gospels; they are one gospel from two different angles. On man's side, it is the gospel of grace. On God's side, it is the gospel of the kingdom. God wants to gather many people unto Himself and have many people to fulfill His purpose. For this reason, we should not base our work on man's view only, but on God's view. God wants to gain a people; He wants to gain men to glorify Himself. Our preaching of the gospel and our gaining of men are for the purpose of meeting this need of God. Hence, God's children need a vision, a vision of eternity. A vision will change our work, our view, and our Christian life. Once we see a vision, we can no longer remain in our trifling work. We cannot hold on to our past views and methods, and we cannot be concerned all the time with our trifling gains and losses.</p><p>Some brothers and sisters have heard of God's plan and purpose. But when they turn around to work and preach the gospel, they say, "I do not know how to relate my work to God's plan. When I become busy with my work and when my hands are on my work, I lose sight of what I have heard concerning God's eternal plan and purpose. His eternal plan and purpose fade away and disappear. While I was hearing about them, I was very clear. But within a short time I forgot all about them." We have to realize that what we hear can be easily forgotten, but what we see is not easily forgotten. It is easy to forget doctrines, but it is not easy to forget a vision. The question therefore lies in whether or not we have seen something, and whether the eyes of our heart have been opened. If God has opened the eyes of our heart, and if we truly see God's calling, His inheritance, His plan, and His purpose, we will spontaneously see that all our works, both great and small, must be related to God's plan. If they are not linked to His plan, they cannot be considered God's work.</p><p>We need God to open our eyes and give us a vision. This will be a great deliverance; it will deliver us from ourselves and from our narrow world. We will feel that as long as the work of eternity is not finished, it is impossible for us to rest. As long as God's eternal plan is not fulfilled, it will be impossible for us to be satisfied. The commitment of our heart, the burden on our shoulder, and the work in our hands will be nothing less than what God wants to do. Even the moving of a little piece of stone should be toward the building of that one work which spans from eternity to eternity. May the Lord grant us grace to remain in this vision. How easy it is for us to lose sight of this vision. How easy it is for our work to come short of this vision. God does not necessarily want us to do great works. Yet whatever work we do must be within that great realm, must be joined to that great goal, and must be a part of that great work. It is hard to say if our life's work consists merely of the little that we are doing. But if this little is what God wants us to do, it is actually a great work because it is surely a part of the work which God is carrying out from eternity to eternity.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING HIS POWER</h2><p>Ephesians deals with something that spans from eternity to eternity. On the one side, we see eternity past. In eternity past, God had a predestination, a plan, and a will. On the other side, we see eternity future. In eternity future, God will accomplish His own purpose and gain what He is after. In between the two eternities, within the span of time, what is He doing? What is He doing to accomplish what He determined to do in eternity past and what He will gain in eternity future?</p><p>Paul's prayer has two aspects, the subjective aspect and the objective aspect. On the objective side, he prayed that we would have the full knowledge of God and know the hope of His calling and the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints. On the subjective side, he prayed that we would know "the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe." After we have known God and His work from eternity to eternity, we will see this power within us, and only then will the subjective aspect begin. First we need the objective seeing, and then we need the subjective working. Many Christians have dropped one of these two sides; they have neglected altogether one of these two aspects. They think that they can put aside the knowledge of God and His eternal will, and make it their first priority to acquire power from God for themselves, so that they can be more holy, more victorious, and more spiritual in themselves. Their attention is on themselves and not on God. But God's focus is different: through our knowledge of Him and of His eternal purpose, He will work in us to the extent that we fulfill His eternal purpose. God works within us for the purpose of fulfilling His eternal will. All of our personal victories and individual works are for the fulfillment of God's eternal goal.</p><p>Among God's children, many have reversed this order. Their attention is on personal things. They are concerned with their personal victories, their personal holiness, and answers to their personal prayers. This is true of those who do not have a seeking heart for the Lord. But it is also true of those who are seeking, who hope to go on properly before the Lord. Many times, they only desire that their personal problems would be solved before God. Their attention is on their personal problems. Their desire and hope are merely for God to deliver them and release them to live a peaceful and happy life. Many people are centered on themselves. Their lives revolve around themselves, and their attention is only on themselves.</p><p>It is true that God needs to work on us, and we need personal victories, holiness, power, strength, freedom, and deliverance. But there is more at issue than this. First, God wants us to see a vision and know the goal of His work, and then He wants to work within us to fulfill that goal. God's goal is not merely to grant us an overcoming life or a holy life. God's goal is not that small. God desires to show us His work which He intends to accomplish from eternity to eternity. Every redeemed person has a part in His plan, and God works according to the operation of the might of His strength for the purpose of fulfilling His eternal plan.</p><p>Hence, we must see one crucial principle: the subjective work is based on the objective seeing. The subjective power is based on the objective vision. First there is the vision, and then there is the power. First there is the objective, and then there is the subjective. If a man does not have a vision, he cannot expect God to work within him. Suppose a father asks a son to buy him something, and he gives him some money for that purpose. The father's goal is not to increase the money within his son's pocket. The father's goal is for the son to come back with the purchased goods. In the same way, God has given us power not for our personal spiritual enjoyment only, but for the purpose of reaching His goal. We must deal with this matter in a thorough way before the Lord. We may think that this matter is too broad. This matter is indeed great, but it is very much related to our spiritual future. Many people do not experience God's subjective work within them because they have never received a vision. All subjective work is based on the vision we have received from God. Vision comes first, and then subjective work follows. First we see the vision, and then we have subjective work. First we know the hope of the calling and the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and then we know the surpassing greatness of His power toward us. May the Lord grant us grace to see that it is not enough for us to be servants in the house of God; it is not enough to merely perform some duties. We must be God's friends, those who understand His heart. We have to see, know, and have a vision; this vision must seize us and capture our heart to the extent that we realize before the Lord that God's work is our work.</p><p>One can only become useful before God when he sees a vision; he can only become useful when he knows the work of Christ within him and God's power within him. A vision allows us to see God's plan, while the power enables us to fulfill His plan. The vision causes us to understand God's plan, while the power causes us to carry out His plan. The apostle showed us that we must not only know the hope of God's calling and the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, but we must also know "the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe." Not only must we know God, His plan, and His goal, we must also know the might of His strength. If God's power has not done anything in us, it means that we do not truly know God, and we do not truly know His plan and purpose. If we only know God and only know His plan and His purpose, without knowing the surpassing greatness of His power, everything is still objective; it is not subjective. This is why we need to know God. We need to know His plan and purpose, and we need to know the power of His resurrection.</p><p>Verse 19 says, "And what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe." This power is indeed great. It is so great that God must open our eyes before we can see its greatness. It is so great that even the Ephesian saints did not know its magnitude. It is so great that they could not fathom it by themselves; they needed Paul to pray for them, so that God would grant them a spirit of wisdom and revelation and open the eyes of their heart. We cannot say how great this power is. We can only say that it is great; it is greater than what we think and what we know.</p><p>Hence, we must never underestimate what is inside this earthen vessel. We have to realize that there is a treasure within this earthen vessel (2 Cor. 4:7). Do we believe this? There is a treasure within this earthen vessel. The treasure within this earthen vessel is so precious that even we ourselves are not clear how precious it is. On the one hand, we see that this earthen vessel is an earthly tabernacle that will pass away. But on the other hand, we see the surpassing greatness of the Lord's power toward us. God's children must know what they received the minute they were regenerated. When a man is regenerated, he receives the Lord. The experience may only last a minute, but it takes thirty to forty years for a man to discover what he received during that one minute. The experience of that one minute passes away quickly, but a man needs thirty to forty years to continually experience the great gift that he received during that one minute, and for God to open his eyes to see such a gift. From that minute on, the surpassing greatness of God's power begins to work in him. Regeneration happens within a very short time. But those whose eyes are opened will agree that what they have is a life of eternity; this life will last for eternity, and there is a surpassing greatness to God's power. No child of God can fully comprehend the greatness of what he received at the moment of his regeneration. But blessed are those who know a little more than others do.</p><p>Our growth does not depend on how much power we receive from the Lord, but on how much we see concerning the power we received from the Lord. At the instant we were regenerated, God put such a treasure within the earthen vessel, but we need a whole lifetime to discover the greatness of this treasure. We need a whole lifetime to discover what kind of treasure this is. If a man sees no difference between the treasure he received on the day he was saved and the treasure he has ten or twenty years afterwards, he has not made any progress. Although he has lived ten or twenty years as a Christian, he is the same as a newborn baby. God desires that we see the surpassing greatness of His power toward us through the revelation of the Holy Spirit. Whether we are strong or weak depends on how much we see. Those who see are strong, and those who do not see are weak. The strong ones are not those who have received, and the weak ones are not those who have not received; we have all received. The question today is whether or not we have seen. God works within us not because we ask Him for this or for that. He has given us everything that can be given; everything is within us. Today we need to ask God to give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that we can see. Those who see have the experience. In the past, many saints experienced a spiritual breakthrough not by receiving a puff of power from God, but by waking up in themselves and exclaiming, "Thank the Lord, all these things are mine." They did not beg again and again for what they did not have. Rather, they saw that they had everything, and they uttered thanksgiving and praise. Those who have never seen this do not know the surpassing greatness of His power.</p><p>How great is this power? Paul said that it is "according to the operation of the might of His strength." We should take note of the words "according to." We have to realize that the power which is toward those who believe is according to the operation of the might of His strength. In other words, the power that operates in the church is as great as the might of strength that operated in Christ. The might of strength which God operates in us is as great as the might of strength which He operated in Christ. There is no difference between the two. I do not know if you have seen this. If you have not seen this, you need to pray. You should not think that you are all right, just because you have read the book of Ephesians a few times and can memorize 1:19 and 20. Whether or not you can memorize them does not count; what counts is the revelation and the seeing. Paul prayed that we might see the surpassing greatness of God's power given to us. If we have not seen that the power in us is the same as the power that is in Christ, we still need to pray for the seeing. If the power that is manifested in us does not match the power that is manifested in Christ, we have to confess that there are still things we have not seen. We have to admit humbly that there are still many things we have not seen, and that God has to show them to us. But whether or not we have seen them, the fact remains: the power that is in those who believe in Christ is as great as the power that is in Christ. Thank the Lord that this is a fact. May the Lord open our eyes so that we would truly see. We do not ask God to transmit more power to us from the outside. We only need to ask God to help us discover and see more of what we have within us. If God opens our eyes and we see, we will praise Him for what we already have.</p><p>Now let us consider what this power has done. Paul said, "According to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead." This power enabled Christ to be raised from the dead. Every time we consider resurrection, it is a precious thought to us. Resurrection means to be loosed from the pangs of death (Acts 2:24). Death cannot hold Christ. No one who went into death could ever come back alive. There has never been such a person. Everyone died throughout the past ages, went into death, and remained in death; they could not come out. But here was a man who came out of death. This One is our Lord. He said, "I am the resurrection and the life" (John 11:25). He is the life; therefore, those who believe in Him will never die. He is the resurrection; therefore, those who believe in Him, though dead, will be raised up again. Everyone who went into death was imprisoned by death; no one could come out. Only one power was strong enough to enter death and come out of death. That power is the power of God. Brothers and sisters, when you see a man dying and you wish that he could live on, you will realize at that moment how great the power of death is. It is easy for man to enter into death, but it is impossible for him to come out of death. It is possible for man to refuse life, but it is impossible for man to refuse death. Satan's work comes through darkness and through death. But there is a power from God which can pass through death without being imprisoned by death; the authority of the devil cannot overcome it, nor can the power of Hades swallow it. This is resurrection. Resurrection is that which passes through death and which is not affected by death. This power is now within us. The power which raised Christ from the dead enables us to pass through death without being seized by death. This power enabled the Lord Jesus to be raised from the dead; it also enables us to resurrect from death.</p><p>This power from God not only raised Christ from the dead, but also seated Him "at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all." Furthermore, it "subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church." God made Christ the Head over all things to the church. Christ as the Head over all things is for the benefit of the church. This is why the church can receive the supply of power from the Lord. Brothers and sisters, the power within you is such a power. There is such a treasure within you. If you still say that you cannot make it to be a Christian, what more can God give to make you able? You should say to the Lord, "There is no need to give me anything anymore. You have done everything." This power is now installed within you. For a Christian, there is no unsolvable problem, and there is no unsurmountable temptation. The power within a Christian is the resurrection power; it is a power that transcends everything, that puts everything under Christ's feet. It is the same power that operated in Christ.</p><p>Paul was very careful in writing the book of Ephesians. He was afraid that we would be misled to think that this subjective work is something personal. Therefore, following the phrase "gave Him to be Head over all things," he added the words "to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all." The subjective work is not for individuals, but for the Body. God shows us that His plan for eternity is related to the church and not to individuals. It is the church that is involved with God's eternal plan. In eternity past, it was the church. In eternity future, it will be the church. Today God's work is also the church. Everything has to do with the church, not with individuals. If power is manifested in you today, it is for the church, not for you alone. God wants the church, not individuals, to receive this power. By ourselves, we can never acquire this power. We have to ask God to be gracious to us so that we see the Body of Christ, and see that our life is only preserved in the Body. An isolated member is worthless. For life to be preserved means that the life within is not disrupted, and the life within others is not disrupted. If a blood vessel breaks, and the leakage of blood continues, the whole body will die. On the positive side, when the ears hear, the whole body hears. When the eyes see, the whole body sees. What one member receives is received by all the members. Hence, we have to learn to live in the Body. We have to learn to consider less about ourselves and learn to appreciate the church. We have to learn to go on together with all other children of God. We have to see that the Body is the vessel that preserves life. Paul said, "The church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all." Such a surpassing greatness of power is experienced by those who know the church. If a person does not see the church and does not deny himself, there is no way for the surpassing greatness of power to be manifested in him. Hence, when we speak of God's subjective work in us, the basic unit is the church, not an individual.</p><p>May God open our eyes so that we may truly see His work within us. This great power comes from our seeing; it does not come from any other means of grace. The basic issue is the revelation and seeing. It is useless to merely listen to doctrines. If we hear many doctrines, but do not have any revelation, we will not experience any power in us, and the doctrines we have heard will be like delinquent accounts, which can never be cashed or used. May the Lord deliver us from such delinquent doctrines, and may He grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that we can truly see something.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR REVELATION</h2><p>We have seen something concerning Paul's prayer for the saints in Ephesians 1. There is one main point to this prayer: he hoped that they would receive a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that their eyes would be opened to see some things. The one thing Ephesians 1 speaks of is that all of God's works are finished. We do not need God to do more works, but we need to have the revelation concerning the works that He has completed. God has planned and purposed. Today God's children need to know His plan and His purpose. "He who comes forward to God must believe that He is" (Heb. 11:6). God is He who is; He never changes. Today we need revelation to see God. The apostle prayed that God would grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him who already "is," that we would have a full knowledge of His predetermined plan and have a knowledge of His accomplished works. Many people hope that God will make some new arrangements and do some new works in His plan. But the apostle showed us that God does not need to do this. He wanted us to see clearly that God already "is." It is not a matter of wishing God's plan to be this or that; God has arranged everything already, and we only need to see what He has arranged. We do not need Him to do one thing more; we only need to see what He has already done. Once we see, we will have a fresh experience. We need a spirit of wisdom to understand His work, and we need a spirit of revelation to know what He has done. Then we will become useful persons in God's eyes.</p><p>Paul showed us two parts to God's work. The first part was done before the foundation of the world. The second part was done on the cross. One has to do with His eternal plan, which was made before the foundation of the world. The other has to do with our fall and our failure, which were dealt with by Him on the cross. In eternity God had a calling, a selection, and a predestination. Everything He wanted was decided before the foundation of the world. He selected and predestinated, and no one can shake it. From the foundation of the world, man became fallen, and Satan entered in to damage God's work. But thank the Lord that there is the surpassing greatness of His power toward those who believe. There was the fall, but there was also redemption. There was death, but there was also resurrection. God has an eternal plan, and He also has a cross of redemption. It seems as if the eternal plan was damaged by man, but what the fall damaged, resurrection has recovered and brought back. The cross can break the spell of the fall, and resurrection can remove death. We can find God's work completed through the cross and through resurrection.</p><p>God's work is completed. None of us need to ask God to do one more thing for us. Some have said, "It would be wonderful if God had made an additional arrangement before the foundation of the world." But Paul said that His arrangement before the foundation of the world was perfect. We may say, "How wonderful it would be if God would do one more thing for us today." But God wants us to realize that everything has been completed on the cross and through resurrection. Today believers do not need to ask God to do anything more. What we need today is God's revelation. Paul did not pray for God to do a little more work. He did not wish God would give us a little richer grace. He did not pray for God to manifest more of His power in us. He prayed that God would give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him, and that He would enlighten the eyes of our heart to see and know the hope of our calling, the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and the surpassing greatness of His power toward us. Paul was not praying for us to have more of Him, but for us to see the glory, the riches, and the greatness of the things we have received. What is lacking today is not God's work, but the revelation of His work. What we need today is not more of God's work, but to see more of His work. Paul's prayer in Ephesians 1 is for the saints to see what God has already done. He did not pray for God to give the believers more power; he did not pray for God to do more work. He prayed for wisdom and revelation. This wisdom and revelation will enable us to see what God has accomplished. The answer to this prayer is seeing. This is not a matter of whether or not God has a work. This is a matter of whether or not we have received the revelation. There is a great distinction here. Many Christians are hoping for this and that, as if God has never done any work on them or given them anything. But what is so special about Ephesians 1 is that it shows us that God has done everything; He has left nothing for us to do. God has accomplished everything in eternity past, on the cross, and in resurrection. There remains only one question today: do we see or do we not see? Whether or not God has worked is not the crucial question. Whether or not we have seen God's accomplished work is the crucial question.</p><p>Suppose a brother has a terrible temper (using a simple matter as an illustration), and he cannot overcome it once, twice, and three times. He wonders why God does not deal with his temper. It seems as if he puts some of the blame on God. Have you realized that his problem lies in the fact that he still hopes that God would do a work? He thinks that everything would be well if God moved His finger a little. But Ephesians 1:3 says that God "has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ." "Has blessed" means that it is done. God does not want us to ask Him to do anything more. He wants to open our eyes to see that He has done everything. Hallelujah! God wants us to see that He has done everything already. This is what Ephesians 1 shows us. We may pray, "God, why don't You give me more power so that I can chase away my bad temper and evil habits?" We may pray for greater power, but the Bible says that we do not need greater power; what we need is a spirit of wisdom and revelation in order to see the surpassing greatness of the power within us. If God opens our eyes one day, we will see how great the power within us is. Then we will readily agree that there is nothing greater than this power.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, do you realize that the power of resurrection is God's greatest power? The Bible reveals one fact to us: resurrection is the peak of God's work. At the time of resurrection, God's work reached the peak. God wants to open our eyes to see that He does not need to do any more work. God's work in Christ had reached its peak; it is impossible to add anything more to it. As a consequence, in Ephesians 1, Paul did not ask God to do anything more. In his prayer, Paul did not expect God to do anything more. Thank and praise the Lord! God's work is completed. It is impossible to add anything to it. All that God wants to do is to open our eyes and show us a little. As soon as we see the kind of power that exists, it will be manifested in us.</p><p>Among God's children, many hope for a future salvation. To them, salvation may come tomorrow or next year. But God wants to show us an accomplished salvation. There is no need to wait for the future. To many, victory is something that belongs to tomorrow or to the future. The aspirations, hopes, and prayers of many people are for the future. But if we have the revelation, we will see God's accomplished facts. Revelation shows us what God has accomplished, not what He will accomplish. Many people hope for deliverance because they have certain weaknesses and failures in themselves. But if God opens our eyes, we will see that our weaknesses and failures were dealt with on the cross. When our eyes are opened, we will say, "God, thank and praise You because You have accomplished everything. Thank and praise You because You have overcome these matters already."</p><p>We treasure Ephesians 1 very much because it shows that forgiveness, redemption, and the receiving of the Spirit are all accomplished facts. It shows that everything is ours already, and that we only need one thing&mdash;revelation. Once we have revelation, everything will be in place. We are still so weak because we have not seen. We are still so useless because we have not seen. Even though the Lord Jesus was so powerful when He was on earth, we are so weak because we have not seen. The power which God has toward those who believe is the same power which operated in Christ. God has given us this power. The difference lies in the fact that we do not see as much as our Lord saw. Today the difference does not lie in the kind of power that we have or in the degree of power. The difference lies in our seeing. What we lack today is revelation. Once we have revelation, everything will be all right.</p><p>This is why we repeatedly emphasize the need for revelation. Without revelation, nothing will prevail. We repeatedly emphasize the fact that it is useless to simply hear something; there must be the seeing. It is a matter of revelation, not a matter of doctrine. It will not do us any good even if we familiarize ourselves with and memorize all of Ephesians 1. But the minute we see, we become a different person. Paul prayed that "God...may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation" (v. 17). Other than the Holy Spirit, nothing will avail. Cleverness is worthless, and doctrines are useless. The Holy Spirit alone can open our eyes and grant us sight. When the Holy Spirit truly opens our eyes and gives us sight, we will immediately say, "Thank God that it is done." We should not expect God to give us greater power. We only need to see the greatness of the power God has already given us. A spirit of wisdom will make us understand, and a spirit of revelation will enable us to see. There is the need for wisdom, and there is the need for revelation. We need wisdom before we can understand and become clear, and we need revelation before we can see and comprehend.</p><p>Perhaps we have heard of God's eternal plan many times, and perhaps we have heard about the position of the church in His eternal plan. But when do we begin to be related to this eternal plan? Our revelation is the beginning. Revelation enables us to see God's arrangements and His accomplished work in eternity past, and revelation enables us to see what God has done on the cross. Revelation shows us the plan of eternity and the work of the cross, and revelation enables us to understand, see, and know the power that God has toward us. Revelation makes us a part of the church, and revelation henceforth makes us a useful vessel in the hand of the Lord.</p><p>Perhaps some of us are very familiar with this word already. But we need to be reminded once again before the Lord of the importance of revelation. We believe that God in heaven today is concerned for His revelation because He has already accomplished all that He wants to accomplish. The question today is how much has man seen. We do not need to ask for anything else. We should be like Paul, who prayed for himself and for the other brothers and sisters that God would grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation. We have to humble ourselves before God and pray, "Lord, I want to see! I want to see!"</p><h1 class="series">CHRIST IS THE WAY,<br />THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE</h1><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class="title">CHRIST IS THE WAY,<br />THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 14:6</h1><p>The Lord Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (KJV). This shows us something very clearly. What is the way that God has given us? It is Christ. What is the truth that God has given us? It is Christ. What is the life that God has given us? It is Christ. Christ is our way, Christ is our truth, and Christ is our life. Through Christ we go to the Father. In God's eyes, everything that has to do with God is Christ, who is His Son. This is why our Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me." What God has given us is just Christ; He has not given us many things apart from Christ. Many times, in spiritual matters, we see only things, and what we touch are merely things. These things are merely terms and letters to us; they do not have any spiritual value. May the Lord open our eyes so that we may know the Son of God. The characteristic of Christianity, the root of Christianity, and all its depth and riches are contained in the knowledge of the Son of God. It is not a matter of how many methods we know or how many doctrines we have or how much power we possess. It is a matter of how much we know God's Son. If we know God's Son, we have the way, we have the truth, and we have the life. Our power comes from our knowledge of the Son of God. God has given us His Son, not many individual items apart from His Son. The crux of the matter lies in our knowledge of the Son of God. Let us now consider the meaning of "I am the way, the truth, and the life."</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST IS THE WAY</h2><p>"I am the way." A way can be considered as a method. The Lord meant that He is the way for us to go to the Father; He is the method by which we can go to the Father. If we have Him, we have the way. If we do not have Him, we do not have the way. If we have Him, we have the method. If we do not have Him, we do not have the method. Every true Christian has learned the lesson at least once that the Lord Jesus is the way; He is the method. If you are saved, you have gone to the Father through the Lord Jesus as your way. You at least have this experience. The Lord Jesus is the way, and no one can go to God except through Him. Every genuinely saved Christian knows that this is the only way that can be taken. Thank the Lord that many genuine Christians have at least learned one lesson, which is to go to God through His Son, Jesus of Nazareth. He is our way. We have taken this way at least once. This way is just Christ Himself; it is not a method apart from Christ. We need to see that not only do we have to come to God through the Lord Jesus when we are saved, but that the Lord Jesus is still the way any time we go to God; there is not some method outside of the Lord Jesus.</p><p>Some Christians are merely seeking for some methods to spirituality. Once a man was preaching on the subject of victory through Christ versus victory through ourselves. After his message, another brother shook his hand and said, "I have failed all these years. But today, everything is well." When the first brother asked why, he answered, "I have been seeking a method of victory. Thank the Lord. I have found the method! Victory is through Christ, not through ourselves!" The first brother told him bluntly, "If you have found a method, you will still fail." What does this mean? The Lord Jesus told us, "I am the way." In other words, the Lord Jesus is the method. A method is not something apart from the Lord Jesus. The method is the Lord Himself. If what we have is merely a method, it will not work. God has not given us a method; He has given us His own Son. We often hear of others' experience and admire it. But we do not realize that they have touched the Lord, while we have only seen a method. As a result, we fail again and again. The basic reason for this is that we do not realize that the Lord Jesus is the way.</p><p>We must remember that believing in the Lord and believing in a formula are two different things. Some Christians experience God's grace, and their eyes are opened. They see the kind of persons they are, and they drop themselves and believe in the Lord. They trust the Lord to do what they themselves cannot do. As a result they are satisfied in God, and they are liberated. A little while later, another person may come and, upon hearing the testimony of the first group, ask for God's enlightening also. He asks for God to show him his worthlessness, and he learns to trust in God, to be humble, and to deny himself. But strangely, the first group of people experiences deliverance, while the last man does not. One group is liberated, but the man is not. This happens because the first group of brothers have faith in God; they have touched the Lord. However, the last brother does not have faith; he is merely copying the formula of faith. He has not received God, but a formula of faith. In other words, the last brother has received a method from the first group of brothers; he has not received the Lord. There is no power in methods; methods will not work. They are dead because methods are things; they are not Christ Himself.</p><p>We have to remember that in spiritual matters, everything apart from Christ is death. Some brothers and sisters say, "It is so strange that when others have the faith, God answers their prayer. I believe just the same, but God has not answered my prayers. When others go to the Lord, the Lord is gracious to them. I do the same thing as they, but God does not grant the same grace to me." It seems as if they are putting the blame on God. They do not realize that they are believing in a thing; therefore, it is dead. A formula is worthless, and a method is useless. Only when we have Christ will everything be living. Even if you have learned all the methods, that will still not make you a Christian. God's children are produced by begetting; they are not produced by teaching.</p><p>The Lord Jesus said, "I am the way." Christ is the way; He is the method. Brothers and sisters, is your way Christ? Are your methods Christ? Or is your way just a way, and your method just a method? Praise the Lord. If your method is Christ, everything will work out. But if your method is only a method, even though it may truly be a good method or even the best and most correct method, it is still dead, and it has no spiritual value at all. Many prayers are not answered and many testimonies of believers have no effect on us because we have not touched the Lord; we have merely copied other peoples' methods. We have not touched the Lord ourselves.</p><p>Once a brother was preaching on Romans 6&mdash;8. After another brother heard it, he said: "Today I know the way to victory. I am clear. I believe that I will no longer fail as I did before." Another brother came up to the preaching one and shook his head. The preacher asked him what he meant, and he said, "I cannot say what the first brother said. The Lord has opened my eyes, but I dare not say that I have seen Him, and I dare not say that I have not seen Him." The second brother did not receive a method, but the Lord Himself. Eventually, he was able to stand. But the brother who thought that he would never fall eventually failed because he had merely gained a method; he did not gain the Lord. Therefore, it was worthless.</p><p>Many times, we are wrong even in the way that we listen to a message. We do not ask the Lord for revelation, and we do not ask to see the Lord. Instead, we exercise our mind to remember a method. Actually, even if we followed the method exactly, we would still not see any result. Sometimes, we may think that we have not seen very much; we may not be so confident as to say that we have seen the Lord. But in fact, we have seen Him. This seeing will bring about a real change in us. Thank the Lord that this is the way. We have not learned a method; rather, we know the Lord. The Lord shows us clearly that He is the method. Every time we hear a message or a testimony, we should ask ourselves, "Have I met the Lord, or have I merely understood a method?" The mere understanding of a method will not save us; only the knowledge of the Lord as our method will save us. A testimony by others of how they have trusted the Lord will not save us; only our own trust in the Lord will save us. The words may be the same in both cases, but the facts are vastly different. The Lord is the Lord of life. Those who touch Him touch life, and only those who touch Him will live.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST IS THE TRUTH</h2><p>The Lord said that He is the way, and He also said that He is the truth. Truth is just Christ Himself. Truth is not words concerning Christ. Truth is not doctrines about Christ. Truth is just Christ Himself. Christians often consider expositions and explanations of Christ to be the truth. Actually, truth is not an exposition of a thing. Truth is just Christ Himself. The Lord said, "And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free" (John 8:32). Brothers and sisters, let us consider how many truths have set us free. God's Word says that the truth shall set us free, that it shall liberate us. But many times, the truth is merely a doctrine to us; it is not Christ. Our eyes have not been opened to see Christ. What a pity that we have been preaching so many doctrines for ten years, yet we still have not seen. We may have heard many doctrines for ten years, yet we still have not seen. Men can speak about the doctrine of co-crucifixion, but others do not see the power of crucifixion in them. They can speak about the resurrection life, but others do not see the resurrection power in them. If what we preach are merely doctrines, then we only have things that are dead, not something that is living.</p><p>Once a person wrote a letter to a brother and said, "A brother has offended me. I do not know if I should forgive him. Therefore, I am writing to you. My heart is unbiased. If you say that I should forgive him, I will forgive him. If you say that I should not forgive him, I will not forgive him." Brothers and sisters, do you think that this sounds like a Christian? Suppose I have a loved one who has died, and I write a letter to others, saying, "My loved one has died. Should I cry? If you say I should cry, I will cry. If you say I should not cry, I will not cry." If you heard this, you would surely laugh, because this is ridiculous. If one cries because others tell him to cry or does not cry because others tell him not to cry, his crying will be a performance, and his not crying will also be a performance. Both will be a performance, and both will be dead works without life. Here is a brother. You either forgive him or you do not forgive him. If you say, "I will forgive him if I know I should forgive him, and I will not forgive him if I know I should not forgive him," this is dead work based on dead teaching; it is even a kind of false performance.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, if we do not have the Lord living within us, and if it is not the Lord who is our truth, a teaching that guides our action is nothing but dead works; it is not life, and it is not living. Do you see the difference? The difference here is too great and too tremendous. Working requires that we exercise our memory, but life does not require us to exercise our memory. When we speak something out of life, we do not speak it because we remembered to speak it. A power within us motivates us to speak. The Lord is controlling us; a doctrine is not coaching or controlling us. The day will come when the Lord will open our eyes to see that spiritual reality is not apart from Christ. We do not present some doctrines to others. Rather, we lead others to Christ Himself. We do not need to remember a doctrine and then act according to it. Rather, Christ is living in us, and Christ is becoming our truth.</p><p>Once a brother offended another brother. The offended one could not contain himself, and he gave the other brother a severe scolding. After the scolding, his conscience bothered him, and he felt that he should go and apologize. Yet when he considered how the other brother had offended him, he could not help being angry again. Nevertheless, he felt that he had to apologize. So he prepared a letter to the other brother. The first thing he said in his letter was, "It was wrong for me to scold you." But he again recalled how the other brother was wrong to offend him, and he became angry again. After a while, he picked up the pen to start writing again. But while he was writing, he could not stop the hate and anger toward the other brother. After he finished the letter, he was still angry when he sent it out. Outwardly, it seemed as though the letter was a very proper Christian letter. But this was merely the result of teachings; it was not the result of life. Although he had written his letter and had apologized, he was still angry at heart. When he saw the other brother, he might be able to greet him and might be able to shake hands with him, but inwardly he had not forgiven him, and his speaking would not be natural at all. Brothers and sisters, do you see the difference here? The Lord is the truth. If what we do is a teaching and not the Lord, it is dead. We should realize that spiritual things are living only when the Lord is there, and they are dead when the Lord is not there. When the Lord shines within us, when He becomes the One working within us, and when we realize this inwardly, what we have will be living.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST IS THE LIFE</h2><p>The Lord said that He is the way and the truth. Then He said that He is the life. We have mentioned briefly what it is for Christ to be the way and the truth. Now we have to speak some concerning Christ being our life. Wherever there is life, spontaneously there are works. But works cannot replace life. We have to be very clear that works are not life. Life does not require any effort of our own. Life is just Christ Himself. Many people try hard and exert considerable energy to be a Christian. Daily they strive toward this goal to the point of exhaustion. To them, the doctrines are strict; one has to be humble, meek, loving, forgiving, and enduring. These teachings are truly tiresome. They consider it a hard thing to be a Christian. This is especially true for young Christians, who find that the harder they try, the harder it is for them to live like a Christian. Brothers and sisters, if Christ is not the life, we surely have to do everything. But if Christ is the life, we do not have to do anything. Let me repeat: life is Christ Himself, and works cannot replace life.</p><p>Among God's children, the greatest misunderstanding is to think that self-effort is life and that unless one exerts his own effort, he does not have life. But we have to realize that if there is life, there is no need of work. If there is life, everything will be lived out spontaneously. Consider how your eyes see. Consider how your ears hear. Your eyes see spontaneously, and your ears hear spontaneously because they all have life. Life is so spontaneous. We must be clear that where life is, spontaneously there are works. However, works cannot replace life. Some works on the contrary prove the absence of life, or they prove that the life is weak. If it is life, it will surely result in good moral behavior. But good moral behavior cannot take the place of life. Suppose a brother is very gentle; he does not speak much, and he is neither too soft nor too hard. Some brothers may say, "This brother has quite a good life." But these brothers have actually used the wrong words. The Lord said, "I am the life." Although the brother may be gentle and quiet, his behavior is not life unless it issues from Christ. You can only say that he has a good temper. You can only say that he does not cause much trouble, or that he treats others politely, that he does not argue or quarrel. But you cannot say that this man has a good life. You cannot say that what he has issues from Christ, because what he has is natural; it is not life, and it is not Christ.</p><p>Some people hold to another concept. They think that life is power, and the Lord being their life means that the Lord gives them power to make them do good, behave well, and be a good Christian. They think that this is life. But God has shown us that power is not a thing. Our power is Christ; it is a person. Our power is not a drive to accomplish something; our power is a person. Our life is not only a power, but a person. It is Christ manifesting Himself from us, not us utilizing Christ to manifest the goodness that we desire to have. These two things are absolutely different, and we must distinguish between them clearly.</p><p>One brother went to meet in a place, and an elderly Christian asked him, "Why did you go to that place to meet?" The brother answered, "Because that place has life." The elderly man asked, "Is our place not as noisy as the other place?" The brother responded, "No, it is not noisy at all." The elderly man said, "What do you mean? If it is not noisy, how can it have life?" The brother answered, "It is not at all exciting, yet it has life. Life is not excitement; it is not emotional stimulation. Life is not a warm atmosphere or loud noise." The elderly man said, "Perhaps young people like excitement, but my preference is for thoughtful messages. Whenever I hear a thoughtful message, I touch life. To me this is life." The young brother replied, "I have also heard the kind of thoughtful messages that you speak of. But I did not touch life." Brothers and sisters, this conversation shows us that life is not emotional stimulations, good thoughts, wise words, clever words, logical words, or thoughtful words. All these may not be life.</p><p>Some may say, "This is strange. If life is not excitement and it is not thoughtful messages, what is life? What do you consider as life?" We admit that we cannot describe life with any better words. We can only say that there is something deeper than feelings and deeper than thoughts. When we touch this something, we become enlivened. This something is life. Brothers and sisters, what is life? Life is something deeper than the thoughts; thoughts cannot be compared with life. What is life? Life is something deeper than feelings; feelings cannot be compared to life. Thoughts and feelings are outward things. What then is life? The Lord said, "I am...the life." One does not meet life when he walks into some excited atmosphere or some spiritually charged environment. We have to ask what is the source of such an atmosphere. Experience tells us that many people who are very good at creating a noisy atmosphere know very little about the Lord. Many excitable people know very little about the Lord. Christ is life; nothing else is life.</p><p>We have to learn to know life. Life is not a matter of excitement or thoughtful ideas. Life is an expression of the Lord Himself. We have to know the Lord. Nothing can be compared to our knowledge of the Lord. Whenever we know the Lord, we touch life. We have to realize before the Lord what it means for Christ to be life. Those who are excitable or who are smart are not necessarily the ones who know the Lord. But when there is a group of people who know the Lord in a particular way, who know what the Lord is like, their spiritual discernment of the Lord and their knowledge of the Lord will tell them that Christ is life. If we have such discernment and knowledge, we will be changed. If we know that the Lord is life, we will realize that in spiritual matters, natural energy is useless. If we know the Lord as life, we will look to Him alone. When we first believed in the Lord, we did not know what it meant to look to Him. But after we have learned some lessons, we begin to look to Him more and more, because we know that everything depends on Christ and not on us. When we first became Christians, we were after individual things, and we did not trust in the Lord. After we learned some lessons, we began to understand a little and began to realize that we have to learn to trust in the Lord. Trusting in the Lord does not mean trusting in Him for individual things, but trusting in Him to do what we cannot do in ourselves. When we first became Christians, we felt that we had to do something, and that unless we did something, things would fall apart, and everything would collapse. We always tried to do everything by ourselves. But after we find out that Christ is our life, we realize that everything depends on Christ and not on our working. Then we learn to rest and to look to Him alone.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we must remember that God does not give us individual things, one by one. He has given us His Son. We should always lift up our head and say to the Lord, "You are my way; You are my truth; You are my life. Lord, I have to deal with You alone, not with the things that belong to You." Brothers and sisters, may the Lord be gracious to us and show us that spiritual matters are nothing but the Lord, that spiritual matters are nothing but Christ. Day by day, we have to realize that it is wrong for the way to be something that is apart from Christ. It is wrong for the truth to be something that is apart from Christ, and it is wrong for the life to be something that is apart from Christ. Yet how easy it is for us to take the way, the truth, and the life as separate things. We call a noisy atmosphere life. We call clear logic life. We call rich emotions life. We call outward behavior life. Actually, they are not life at all. We have to know that the Lord is the life. Christ is our life. It is the Lord who lives out this life from us. May the Lord deliver us from many fragmentary, outward matters so that we can touch the Lord Himself. May we see the Lord in everything, and may we see that our way is our knowledge of the Lord, our truth is our knowledge of the Lord, and our life is our knowledge of the Lord. May the Lord open our eyes, and may we be delivered from many outward things to see the Son of God. May we live in Him, and may He live in us. Amen!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class="title">CHRIST IS THE RESURRECTION<br />AND THE LIFE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 11:25</h1><h2 class="head1">WHAT HE DOES VERSUS WHAT HE IS</h2><p>Chapter eleven of the Gospel of John shows us how the Lord Jesus gave life to a dead person; it shows us how the Lord Jesus resurrected a person from among the dead. The Lord can resurrect man, but He did not say, "I will resurrect the dead." Instead, He said, "I am the resurrection." After He said these words, He resurrected a man. Both Martha and Mary were there on that day. To them, it would have been better for the Lord Jesus to say, "It does not matter that your brother has died; I can resurrect him." We like to hear this kind of word. Our desire and hope is that God will do something for us. We often pray, hope, and wait before God for a word concerning what He will do for us. But the Lord does not want to show us what He will do; He wants to show us what He is. What He can do is based on what He is. Martha believed in the Lord's power. She said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died" (v. 21). Martha believed in God's power, and she also believed in the Lord Jesus' power, but she did not see that the Lord Himself is the resurrection and the life. We must see that everything God can do is included in what God is. The reason a man does not have God's power is that he does not know what God is. "He who comes forward to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him" (Heb. 11:6). All the power that God has is based upon what He "is."</p><p>In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus was not saying that He can preserve a man's life, but that He Himself is life. He was not telling us of His ability to resurrect men, but of the fact that He Himself is resurrection. May God open our eyes to see who the Lord is. We must see that in God's eyes, Christ is our everything. Once we have this kind of understanding, it is possible to have genuine growth in spiritual things. We must realize that in God's eyes, there is not any other object; the only object is Christ Himself! Whether or not we grow spiritually depends on whether we have truly touched spiritual reality. In other words, do we just know the individual things that God has done, or do we know God Himself?</p><p>John 11 does not say that the Lord Jesus resurrected Lazarus. Instead it says that the Lord Jesus was resurrection to Lazarus. Brothers and sisters, do you see the difference? The Lord was resurrection to Lazarus, and then Lazarus was resurrected. The Lord did not give resurrection as a thing to Lazarus; He became resurrection to Lazarus. In other words, what the Lord does is only the appearance; what He is is the reality of the matter. We are not saying that the Lord did not resurrect Lazarus. We are saying that Lazarus resurrected because the Lord was resurrection to him.</p><p>We must remember that everything that God does in Christ is done in this principle. When the Lord is something to me, that something comes into existence. First He "is," then He "has." Many Christians separate the Grace-giver from the grace given by God. One day we will find out that the Grace-giver is the very gift given by God. God has not given us many things; He has only given us the Lord Jesus Himself. All spiritual things and all of God's gifts are but Christ Himself. God does not give us something piece by piece. God has given us Christ Himself. One day God will open our eyes to see that everything is in Christ. How wonderful it will be if we see this.</p><p>In declaring who He is, the Lord said, "I am the resurrection and the life." He is the resurrection. This is why His delaying did not cause a problem in the resurrection of Lazarus. In raising up Lazarus, the Lord was trying to lead men to the knowledge of Himself. The resurrection of Lazarus was not the greatest thing; the greatest thing is to know that the Lord Jesus is the resurrection. Many people believe that the Lord Jesus is the Life-giver. But it is altogether different to believe that the Lord Himself is life. He is not only the Life-giver; He is also the life. He is the Life-giver, and He is the life which He gives. He is not only the Lord who resurrects; He is resurrection itself. Once you see this, you will see that everything in Christ is living. God has only given Christ to man. We hope that at least a little light will shine on us so that we can know that the Lord is everything and know Him as such a Lord. He is the Grace-giver, and He is also the grace given. Our Lord said, "I am the resurrection and the life." Resurrection and life encompass the whole Bible. It is wonderful to know the resurrection and the life. Let us now see what life is.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST IS THE LIFE</h2><p>God placed the man whom He had created in the garden of Eden. There were two options before the man. One was to receive life, and the other was to die. If man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the result would be death. But if he ate of the fruit of the tree of life, he would receive life. The man created by God was good, but there was still one unresolved question&mdash;the question of life and death. In the garden of Eden man could think and act, but he did not have life. We are not saying that he was not alive. As far as his natural life was concerned, man was alive. Genesis 2:7 speaks of man being a living soul. Nevertheless, as far as the life represented by the tree of life was concerned, man did not yet have life. The life we are speaking of is this life represented by the tree of life. At the time of Genesis 2, although man was alive, he had no life. Man had sound thoughts and sound feelings (these two being the most important elements of man's soul), but he did not have the life represented by the tree of life. From this we see that life is deeper than feelings and thoughts.</p><p>In Christianity, there are counterfeits to everything. There is false repentance, false confession, false salvation, false zeal, false love, false spiritual works, and false spiritual gifts. Everything can be counterfeited; even life can be counterfeited. Many Christians think that good feelings are life. They think that an exciting atmosphere and loud noises are life. If you ask them what life is, they will not separate life from feelings; they always mix the two together. They do not realize that life is deeper than feelings. Other Christians do not take feelings as life, yet they take mental activity as life. This means that if there are enough ideas in a message to invoke mental activity, enough words to stir up one's interest, and enough doctrines to inspire admiration, they think that this is life. But those who are experienced and who have learned some lessons tell us that life is deeper than feelings and mental activities. Neither is life a kind of activity. We cannot say that just because a person is lively, energetic, and active, he has life. These are merely activities; they are not life. They are merely the performing of some activities; they are not the living of a life. We are not saying that life does not express itself in mental activities, feelings, or actions. We are saying that life is not feelings, mental activities, or actions. The words that come out of one person's mouth may be life, while the same good words out of another person's mouth may only be nice ideas. One may just touch excitement in one person, while he may touch life in another person. Many brothers think that when they feel a certain way, they have life. But an experienced brother will tell you that this is not life. Many brothers think that when they have a certain idea, they have life. But an experienced brother will tell you that this is not life. Two brothers may understand and expound a scriptural passage in the same way, but the strange thing is that an experienced Christian will sense a difference. One has both the right thought and life, while the other merely has the right thought. It is true that one often can touch life and mental thoughts at the same time. But we must not presume to think that touching the mind is equivalent to touching life. These are two different things. Many people think that because two people speak the same thing, they are therefore the same. But this is not necessarily true. It is possible that in one person we have the mind, while in the other person we do not have the mind, but life. Life is much deeper than mental activity; it is something deeper than good ideas. The Lord said, "I am the life." Life is the Lord Himself. Life is not something other than Christ. If it is a thing, it is dead; it is not life. To many Christians, life is something they can produce out of themselves. But the Lord told us that He alone is the life.</p><p>We need the Lord's mercy before we can see something concerning this matter. We can identify something as mental activity, we can identify something as feelings, and we can identify something as works. But we cannot identify what is life; there is no word to describe life clearly. We can only ask the Lord to show us what life is. Brothers and sisters, one day when the Lord opens our eyes, we will know what life is, and spontaneously we will touch the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST IS THE RESURRECTION</h2><p>Let us consider again what resurrection is. Whatever encounters death and still exists is resurrection. Resurrection is that which withstands death and endures death. After man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, death came in and man died. Those who enter the grave never come out again. Once they go in, they never return. In the whole universe, of all men, only one came out of death. This One is our Lord. The Lord said, "I am...the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever" (Rev. 1:17-18). The Lord is the resurrected Lord. Resurrection is that which passes through death but is not imprisoned by death. In the Bible, the authority of death is described as a kind of imprisonment. To imprison someone is to confine him and not release him. Once man enters death, he cannot come out anymore. Death imprisons everyone who enters it. But death cannot imprison Him. This is the meaning of life, and this is the meaning of resurrection. Resurrection is the life that passes through death and rises above death. Our Lord Jesus is the life. He became dead and was in Hades. He was in the deepest place of death. But death could not imprison Him. Death was unable to detain or keep Him. He came out of death! When life passes through death and is not imprisoned by death, this is resurrection.</p><p>Resurrection means that a life bears the mark of death, yet still lives; it is living, yet it also bears the mark of death. This is what is meant by resurrection.</p><p>Many people ask why is it that after His resurrection in John 20, the Lord Jesus left the mark of the nails in His hands and the mark of the spear in His side for Thomas to touch (v. 27). We have to realize that this is what is meant by resurrection. The Lord Jesus was not showing Thomas one who had never been wounded and one who had never died; He wanted Thomas to see that He was wounded but now alive. He wanted Thomas to see that He had died but now lived. The Lord has the mark of death in His body, yet He is now living. This is what is meant by resurrection.</p><p>We can apply this principle to ourselves. There are many things in us that do not have the mark of death; they cannot be considered as resurrection. Resurrection must be something that has the mark of death and yet is still living. Do not think that as long as you have eloquence, cleverness, and talent, everything will be all right. It is possible for you to have eloquence without the mark of death. It is possible for you to have wisdom without the mark of death, and it is possible for you to have talent without the mark of death. Whether or not others see the mark of death in our eloquence, cleverness, and talent determines whether we have resurrection. A brother may be very competent, capable, and apparently lively. However, he is too self-confident and self-assured. He thinks that everything put in his hands will be handled well. There is no mark of death with this person; one does not see any mark of death in his competence. Although he is self- confident, self-trusting, self-assured, and very energetic, the mark of death cannot be found in him. This does not mean that a person who has passed through resurrection has no ability in himself. It merely means that with such a person, there is the mark of death. He can still do things, but he dares not trust in himself anymore, and he has lost all confidence. His own energy has been weakened. This is resurrection.</p><p>Paul wrote to the church in Corinth and said, "I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling" (1 Cor. 2:3). This was spoken by a man who knew God. What a pity that among Christians, there are too many strong and self-confident ones! However, here is a man who said that he was "in weakness and in fear and in much trembling." His body bore the mark of death, the seal of death.</p><p>Therefore, resurrection can never be separated from the cross. The cross removes something from us. Many things that originate from the self will not rise again once they have passed through the cross; they are lost in death. Whatever remains after it has passed through death, and whatever has the mark of death and is still living is resurrection. Resurrection must be something that has passed through death and whatever has passed through death must have suffered deprivation and loss. Brothers and sisters, if you really see what resurrection is, you will see what the cross is. You will see the stripping power of the cross. If you really know what resurrection is, you will find many things removed from you as you pass through the cross. If you really know what resurrection is, you will become another person; many things will be stripped from you. Only those things that have life will resurrect. Without life there is no possibility of resurrection. Suppose we cut a piece of wood into small segments and bury them into the ground. After some time, they will decay and become worthless. However, if we cut down a branch from a tree and plant it in the ground, after some time, it will germinate. In one case the sticks become rotten. In the other case the branch germinates. Anything that is dead rots, and anything that has life resurrects after it passes through death. Hence, the Lord's resurrection was based upon His life. Because there is an incorruptible life in Him, death cannot imprison Him. Since there is something in Him which cannot die, death was cast away even while He was put into death. When we go through the cross experientially, many things will remain in death and not come out. Only the things which are of God will resurrect. When we touch the cross, we ourselves will be eliminated. The cross is a big minus; it subtracts many things.</p><p>Many brothers and sisters often ask, "How do I know whether I am dead or not? How do I know that the Lord has done something within me through the cross?" It is quite easy to answer this question. If the Lord has done something within, you should have lost many things. But if you have been the same since the day you were saved, and if you are still as full as you were before, the cross has not done anything within you. If the cross has truly done something within, you will find that a great elimination work has been done; you will find that the Lord has done a thorough cleanup job in you. The result of this elimination is that you can no longer do what you could do before, and you are no longer capable of the things you were once capable of. You are no longer sure of what you had such assurance of before. Where you were bold before, now you become fearful. This proves that the Lord has done something within you. If resurrection is within you, many things have been left behind in the grave, because these things could not pass the test of death. Nothing in Adam can live once it passes through death. Anything that belongs to resurrection belongs to the Lord's life, the life which has passed through death and which has come out of death. Some things are lost through death, but are given back to us by the Lord. This is like the cutting of a branch from a tree. The branch seems to be dead. But when it is planted in the ground, after a period of time, it grows up again. This is resurrection. When we speak of having the mark of death on our body, it does not mean that we cannot speak or move anymore. Instead, it means that when we speak and move, we will not be as loose and self-confident as before. If a man has been touched by the Lord and dealt with by the cross, he will be weak, fearful, and trembling. He will not say, "I will do it," "I can do it," or "I can make it." From that time on, he will still work, but he will be very fearful of God when he works. He will still walk, but his walk will be a walk after God just as Abraham walked step by step with God. You will see the mark of the cross on such a man. Such a man will have been penetrated and pierced by God. He will not be as whole as he was before. There will be the mark of death on his body. This is resurrection.</p><p>Today God communicates with man in resurrection. Yet this resurrection includes the cross. Therefore, nothing that we have can contact God without passing through death. Everything in the natural realm has to pass through death. If we are not in resurrection, God cannot fellowship with us. He cannot contact us except on the side of resurrection. Hence, we have to pass through death to enter into resurrection. The life we have received is the resurrected life, and whatever we have that has to do with God is in resurrection.</p><p>One problem frequently encountered in the spiritual realm is that man's service to God is often based on natural things. Seldom do we see his service based on things in resurrection. Many people are very enthusiastic, but few have an enthusiasm in resurrection, an enthusiasm that has passed through death and that is still alive. Much enthusiasm is the first enthusiasm, not the second enthusiasm. We can find many brothers who are diligent and capable, but their capability is the first capability, not the second capability; such capability has never passed through death. If we live before God by the things in the natural realm, we are not living in resurrection.</p><p>Some have asked what the Body of Christ is. The Body of Christ is none other than the place where His resurrection is testified. In other words, anything that is not in resurrection cannot share a part in the Body of Christ. The church is not the place where you bring one thing and I bring another thing. It is not the place where you contribute your cleverness and I contribute my ingenuity. The church is not the place where you contribute something natural and I contribute something natural. The church shuts out all natural things and accepts only the things that belong to resurrection. Whenever natural things come in, the church will no longer be the church. In the church we cannot have anything that does not belong to resurrection. Many brothers ask how the church can be one. We need to know that oneness can never come through man's ways. The oneness of the church can only be achieved when God's children know the cross and deal with the flesh and natural things. If a man does not know the cross, whatever way he tries is useless. If the church resorts to natural means and human ways, nothing will be achieved. The church cannot have the flesh, and the church cannot have anything natural. If the flesh and natural things are brought into the church, the church will no longer be the church. It is true that the church needs people who consecrate themselves and who are useful, but the mark of death must be there. When we are useful, and when we also have the mark of death on ourselves, we have resurrection. We need to see that not only has the Lord Himself resurrected, He wants a church in resurrection also.</p><p>In order to have such experiences, we must look to God to work in us. We may be very familiar with many doctrines. However, if the Lord does not give us a fundamental blow, we will remain the same. Sometimes we fall and suffer pain, but this pain lasts only a couple of days or a few months. However, if we are broken by God in a fundamental way, and if we are broken deeply enough, we will not suffer pain for a few days or a few months, but we will have a scar over our entire life. We will remain crippled in God's eyes the rest of our life, and the mark of the cross will always be with us. Paul saw the vision once on his journey. Many years later, he still testified, "I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision" (Acts 26:19). If some day the Lord has mercy on us and gives us a severe blow, our self will never rise again, and the scar will remain on us forever. We can touch the nail scars in the resurrected Lord's hands and the wounds in His side. Today scars will be found on those who know the Lord and who experience the Lord as their personal resurrection as well. These scars will not pass away, and these scars will strip them of all their boastings; they will not dare to be self- confident, self-assured, or boastful of their own strength. Once a person is knocked down by the Lord, he will never be able to rise again. We hope the mark of the cross will become more and more apparent on us. It cannot be a performance or a pretense. Performance and pretense are useless. Whatever we do by ourselves is easily forgotten after a short time. However, once we are put on the altar and killed by the knife, we will never be able to rise up again. If we experience a fundamental blow, we will see that we can do nothing, we are nothing, and we are finished. If there is the mark of death on us, that mark will be a proof that we know resurrection. Those who know the cross know resurrection. Resurrection is whatever remains after passing through the cross. Many things will never rise up again once they pass through the cross. They are gone forever. Resurrection is whatever can pass through the cross. Only these things have spiritual value. Many things are brought into the grave and stay in the grave; these things are dead. However, many things pass through the grave and are brought to the other side; they bear the mark of the cross, and they are the things of resurrection.</p><p>May the Lord grant us the true knowledge of Christ as our resurrection. May we not only know Christ as our life, but also know Christ as our resurrection. May the Lord eliminate the many things that belong to us. May the Lord not only grant us more life and more of the things which are of Him, but may He eliminate all that we should not have. Many times we still live by our natural life and have not been broken by God. We have not seen God's discipline and have not known the cross. May the Lord have mercy on us. May the natural things in us be eliminated more and more, and may the things of resurrection be expressed more and more. May life and resurrection be a fact and not an ideal to us. Whenever we stretch out our own hands, may the Lord show us that there is no resurrection, but only naturalness and the flesh. May He show us the flesh by the way of resurrection. If we do not see this, may the Lord have mercy on us and grant grace to us. Amen!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class="title">CHRIST IS THE BREAD OF LIFE<br />AND THE LIGHT OF LIFE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:35; 8:12</h1><p>We have already briefly seen that all the spiritual things and all spiritual matters are Christ. God gives us Christ to be our spiritual things and matters. This is the crucial point in the spiritual life. Is our experience merely an experience? Or is our experience Christ? Is our righteousness merely righteousness? Or is our righteousness Christ? Is our holiness merely holiness? Or is our holiness Christ? Is our redemption merely redemption? Or is our redemption Christ? We often speak of the way, but the way we speak of may not be Christ Himself. We often speak of the truth, but we do not realize that Christ Himself is the truth. We often speak of the life, but the life we speak of may not be Christ Himself. In other words, we have many things other than Christ. This is the biggest spiritual problem among God's children. We say with our mouth that Christ is the centrality of all things, but in our living we still keep many things other than Christ, as if these things could help us live our Christian life. We must turn this concept around. We must realize that God has no intention for us to keep so many so-called spiritual things other than Christ. Under God's sovereign arrangement, there are things and matters, but God's things and matters are just Christ. Christ is all spiritual things. He is our righteousness; He does not give us a righteousness apart from Himself. He is our holiness; He does not give us a power apart from Himself that enables us to be holy. He is our redemption; He does not give us a redemption apart from Himself. He is the way; He does not open a way for us apart from Himself. He is the truth; He does not present us a truth apart from Himself and then charge us to understand it. He is the life; He does not give us something called life apart from Himself. Brothers and sisters, the more we go on in God's way, the more we will discover that there is only one grace among all God's graces. There is only one gift among all God's gifts. The grace is Christ, and the gift is Christ. Thank God that He is showing us that Christ includes everything day by day. Formerly, we thought of the Lord as our Savior. Today we can say that He is not only our Savior, but our salvation as well. This is amazing, yet it is a fact. When we were first saved, we believed in the Lord Jesus as our Savior. Now we can say that the Lord Jesus is also our redemption and our salvation. More and more we discover that Christ is God's things and matters.</p><p>If we wrongly presume that what the Lord Jesus gives is different from the Lord Jesus Himself, and if we wrongly presume that grace and the One who gives grace are separate, these mistakes will cause us to suffer great spiritual damage. It will cut us off from the source of life. Therefore, we need to see more concerning Christ being our things and matters. In John 6:35 and 8:12, the Lord tells us that He is the bread of life and the light of life. Let us first see how He is the bread of life.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST IS THE BREAD OF LIFE</h2><p>The Lord Jesus said, "I am the bread of life." He said this to those who looked for Him in Capernaum. They expected the Lord to give them food, and the Lord told them, "I am the bread of life." This means that He is not only the One who gives the bread of life, but He is the bread of life itself. The Giver and the gift are one, not two. Thank God, Christ is not only the Giver, but also the gift of God.</p><p>What is the significance of bread in the Bible? In the Bible bread means satisfaction. The Bible uses hunger to express man's dissatisfaction. In order to solve man's dissatisfaction, man must have bread. Whether or not God's children have the strength to go on depends upon whether they are satisfied within. Today if we feel satisfied within, we have strength. If we feel empty like a tire void of air, no one can drag us along. We cannot say that we do not have life, but we can be without strength. Satisfaction gives us strength. Satisfaction enables us to walk. Such an inexplicable satisfaction makes us feel well.</p><p>Let us see what the bread of God's children is. The Lord Jesus said, "I am the bread of life." The Lord Jesus gives life, and He also sustains life. Many Christians think that the bread is just an hour's prayer or an hour of reading the Bible; they do not realize that the bread is the Lord Jesus Himself. We do not mean that prayer or reading the Bible is useless, but we should remember that the Lord Jesus said, "I am the bread of life." This means that the bread of life is just Himself. Many times God's children are not satisfied because they do not realize that Christ is the bread of life. We often meet hungry people, those who are not satisfied with spiritual things. They are not satisfied with this, and they are not satisfied with that. Every day they are surrounded by dissatisfaction. We are not urging people to be proud or self-satisfied. Pride and self-satisfaction are one thing, but eating to the full and becoming satisfied is another. Some people have been dealt with by God; they live before God fearfully, and they are in weakness and trembling. They are not proud, yet they have touched the Lord and eaten to the full. They are satisfied before God, and this satisfaction is their power.</p><p>How then can we be filled? How can we be satisfied? We need to know that all satisfaction is related to Christ and all satisfaction is in life. Christ is the bread of life. Whenever we touch life in a real way, we are immediately satisfied. Whenever we offend life, we immediately feel inwardly collapsed. We need to mention some concrete examples to see how man can be satisfied.</p><p>Some brothers say, "I have been busily working for more than one year, running here and there. I have been so busy that my whole being is drained. I am hungry, and I hope to go some place for a spiritual retreat." But when we read John 4, we realize that there is something wrong with these words. The Lord Jesus Christ was wearied from His journey and sat by the well of Jacob. The disciples had gone into town to buy some food, which shows that the Lord was hungry. At the well He met a woman of Samaria. God's will was for the Lord to speak to her and save her, and the Lord did it accordingly. When the disciples came back with the food they had bought, they invited the Lord to eat, but the Lord said, "I have food to eat that you do not know about" (v. 32). The disciples thought that someone else had given Him something to eat. Therefore, in the following verses the Lord said to the disciples, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work" (v. 34).</p><p>From this we see that working should only make us full; working should not make us hungry. Spiritual work should make us full every time we engage in it. If we become hungry every time we work, there must be something wrong. If we feel weak or deflated after we have worked, or if we feel that we are collapsing, it shows that there must be something wrong with our work. If our work is not separated from God's will, and if our work is not according to ourselves, every time we work, we will not collapse, but we will increase in strength. Many times there is not an adequate preparation before the Lord, and we begin to work because there is a great need from outside or because of others' urging. When we work under such circumstances, something within us will collapse, and we will not have the strength. After we finish such a work, there is no strength left within us, because something has gone wrong between us and the Lord. The more we participate in any work outside of God's will, the more hungry we will become. In order for us to be satisfied, we must follow God's will.</p><p>We must realize that Christ is our bread; our bread is not spiritual retreats or scriptural doctrines. We do not work until we become empty, and then go away for a rest; this is not our bread. Christ is our bread. We do not preach until we run out of teachings to speak about, and then go and find some new doctrines; this is not our bread. Our bread is Christ. Whether or not we are busy, if we have a word and the strength within, every time we stand up to speak for Christ, not only will the listeners be filled, but we will be filled as well. This is the result of the Lord working in us and in our life. This is why we touch the Lord. Eventually, after we are done, we will not feel any emptiness. Instead, we will feel that we have eaten a big meal and are full. It is wrong if we think that satisfaction depends on resting, on listening to messages, or on spiritual retreats. Food comes when we allow the Lord to do what He wants to do in us. The Lord is within us. Let us touch His life, and we will be satisfied.</p><p>In spiritual matters, one is not fed when he is at ease; he is fed when he is busy. While we are busy, we are fed. In spiritual matters, when we walk in the Lord's will, the busier we are, the more we will eat. We will not collapse through our busy schedules, and we will not become empty through these activities. I believe many brothers and sisters can testify of this. Suppose you talk to a person today, yet God has not moved in that direction; He has not spoken in you. Even though you may speak enthusiastically, after five or ten minutes of this kind of speaking, you will feel that something is wrong within. You may try to change the direction of your conversation because you feel that you cannot go on. Finally, when you leave, you will feel empty inside. There is nothing wrong with your words; the words are right, the attitude is also right, and you have tried your best to help. But the strange thing is that the more you speak, the emptier you become, and the more you feel that something has collapsed inside. When you leave, you will feel as though you have committed a big sin. Sometimes you may see some outward results and may feel that you have done a good work. But when these feelings pass away, you feel just as empty and hungry within. Whenever you do something by yourself, no matter how successful you are outwardly, inwardly you will feel deflated. Brothers and sisters, have you ever had this kind of deflated feeling? If your work is not done before the Lord, and if you are not following the Lord fearfully but are walking by yourself, even if you have the best motive or intention, you will still feel deflated and depleted of any spiritual vigor. You will feel as though the more you work, the more meaningless things become, and the more emptiness there is. Under such circumstances, the more others speak of your success, the worse you will feel inside. The more others praise you and mention the help they have received from you, the more you will hate yourself. This shows that your work is not a kind of bread, because it does not satisfy you. Brothers and sisters, those who know the bread are the ones who have found satisfaction in the Lord. Only Christ is the bread of life; only Christ can satisfy you. You will feel hungry with any work you have done if the work does not bring you in touch with the Lord. If you touch the Lord, if you touch life, and if you touch spiritual reality, whether or not you are busy, you will be able to say, "Thank and praise God. I have the bread. The Lord is my bread." Brothers and sisters, have you seen this? This is absolutely not something outward. The question is not where you have gone, what you have done, what message you have spoken, or how long you have spent in spiritual devotions. The question is whether or not you have touched the Lord within. Whoever touches the Lord is satisfied.</p><p>Some brothers and sisters may say, "What should I do? The Lord has not called me to preach in any place or to work in any place. Those who give messages and work have the opportunity to be filled. But we are not professional preachers and workers. Are we going to go hungry?" Brothers and sisters, thank God we do not have to be hungry. We may be doing only the smallest things; we may speak only ten or twenty sentences to others, or may speak only ten or twenty minutes to others. But as long as it is something out of the Lord, and as long as we do these things according to the Lord's operation in us, we will feel relieved and satisfied after we have done them. It is the Lord who gives us a burden, and once we unload the burden, we feel satisfied and full within. Once we touch God, we are satisfied and fed. Therefore, brothers and sisters, the workers do not have the exclusive right to eat; everyone has the chance to eat. Every day we have the opportunity to eat, and every day we also have the opportunity to be satisfied. Christ is our bread. When we touch Him, we have bread.</p><p>Let me mention a deeper example. We often think that something is good or spiritual, but this thing is not the Lord's will. When we carry it out, we feel empty inside. We can only be satisfied when we follow the Lord. Once a brother saw another brother walking in a wrong way. More than once he felt the need to clearly point out to the brother that the way he was taking was not a way of building up, but a way of corruption. However, he wanted to be a gentle Christian. He thought the best way was for him to smile and speak a few sweet-sounding words to persuade the brother. But every time he spoke in such a way, he felt like a glass with a hole in the bottom&mdash;everything had leaked out. In man's eyes, he did quite well; he was gentle, and he did not try to hurt anyone. In man's eyes, he was successful. Yet he felt hungry and unsatisfied. After two or three months, he felt wrong and came to the Lord and prayed for light. He asked the Lord to point out where he had gone wrong. One day he said to the Lord, "Lord, I will do whatever You want me to do." The Lord listened to his prayer and showed him what he should do. Later the other brother came again, and this one rebuked him severely. According to his nature, whenever he said a severe word to others, he would suffer for a few days. But the strange thing was that this time, the more severely he spoke, the more he felt he was touching the Lord. He also did not have to make a confession, which he always did after he rebuked others. Instead, he could praise the Lord. After he rebuked the other brother, he felt as though he had taken a good meal. This does not mean that we can rebuke others as much as we please. It is wrong to rebuke someone according to our will. However, it means that when we do anything according to the Lord's will, we are filled within, and we become stronger than ever. This shows us a fact: the good that we can perform by ourselves is not our food. We may think that as long as we can be gentle, everything will be fine. But experience tells us that even if we act gently, it is only our outward man who is doing it. It is a performance by our outward man, and this cannot become our food. Only when the Lord moves in us and we move according to His will, can we receive food. Whenever we touch life, we have food, and whenever we touch the Lord, we have satisfaction.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST IS THE LIGHT OF LIFE</h2><p>The Lord not only said that He is the bread of life, but He also said that He is the light of life. Food is for satisfaction, while light is for seeing. When one is satisfied, he has the strength, and when one sees, he can walk. We have seen how Christ is the bread of life. Now let us consider how Christ is the light of life.</p><p>First, we have to point out that the light of life is not the knowledge of the Bible. Everyone knows that as Christians, we should read the Bible properly. But if we read the Bible as a book of knowledge, a textbook of theology, we will merely gain knowledge. If we read the Bible this way, we may gain some doctrines from the Bible which are truly scriptural. Yet these are mere letters. At the time the Lord was born in Bethlehem, many priests and scribes could memorize the books of the prophets, but they did not know Christ. Today even though we have one book more than they, the New Testament, it is still possible for men to know only the letters of the Bible without knowing Christ. We are not saying that we should not read the Bible. But we need to realize that when we read the Bible, it is possible that we will gain only knowledge instead of knowing Christ. Many of the priests and scribes had only dead knowledge; they did not know the living Lord. Many people think that the light of life is just knowledge, doctrines, theology, or church dogmas. Some persons say that they have received some light, but the light they are speaking of is not necessarily the light of life. The light they are speaking of may only be interpretations of certain verses or certain teachings. At most they afford others a little more Bible knowledge. The light of life is not knowledge or anything other than the Lord Himself. The Lord said He Himself is the light of life. The light of life is the Lord Himself.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, many people can tell us from their experience that what they see in the light of life is often difficult to articulate. Interestingly, those who see it see it, yet they cannot say what they have actually seen. Once someone talked to a sister to find out if she was saved. He asked her a few questions. She answered, "When I was first saved, I did not know what it was, but I knew I was saved. If you believe that I am saved, I am saved, and if you do not believe that I am saved, I am still saved." What she said is true. She was indeed saved, but she could not explain how she was saved. She knew it, but she could not explain it. Therefore, when the light comes, we may not be able to tell others many doctrines; it may be two or three years later before we can utter some doctrines or teachings. This light is the Lord Himself. When we see the Lord, we see the light.</p><p>What difference then does it make to us whether or not we see the light? What change will there be if we see the light? The difference is very great. If we truly see the light, we will fall to the ground. The light not only enlightens us but also kills us. Before Paul received the shining, it was not easy to put him on the ground. But once he received the shining, he fell. Some people always want to be humble. They try hard to be humble; they act humble in the way they speak and the way they act. But this kind of humility is very exhausting; even others feel exhausted for them. It is like a small child lifting a big dictionary; the book may not be very heavy, but it is exhausting for him to carry it. It is not easy for a proud man to be humble. It is not easy for us to fall down from the throne of pride. But once the light of the Lord shines on us, we fall immediately. We cannot explain it, but as soon as the light shines, we fall.</p><p>Teachings cannot make a man fall. A person can hear eight or ten teachings, and may even be able to recite them clearly and reasonably, but he remains the same. A message which should bring one to tears, or which should touch one's carnal living and bring a man to his knees, can be turned into a subject of study, and a person may think that he has received something spiritual. When a doctrine becomes a thing, a teaching becomes a thing, and words become a thing, the result is death; it is not light. One brother was so happy after he heard the teachings of Romans 6 that he thought he had seen Romans 6. But after a few days, he and his wife fell into a big argument. The Romans 6 that he saw was a thing; it was letters from a book; it was not the light. If what he saw was light, he would not have been the same. He would fall down in the light. Light is piercing; it can do what a man cannot do. A teaching will not do it, the brothers and sisters will not be able to help, and our own effort will not achieve it. But the minute the light shines, everything is solved. We may say that we are very stubborn, but once the light shines, we will become soft. When John saw the light, he became as dead (Rev. 1:16-17). When Daniel saw the light, he fell toward the ground as dead (Dan. 10:5-9). No one can see the Lord's face without falling down, and no one can see the Lord without becoming as dead. It is difficult to make ourselves die or to humble ourselves. But once the light shines, everything follows. The Lord's light kills. Once a man receives the Lord's light, he falls.</p><p>The Lord Jesus Himself is the light. Hence, when a man meets the Lord, he sees. When a man meets the Lord, he falls and becomes weak as though he were dead. With many people, their old personality is stubborn and has never been broken. It is useless for others to try to deal with their personality. It is also useless for them to try to deal with it themselves. However, once the Lord's light shines on them, they receive sight and become broken men. Whenever a man sees the Lord, he becomes weak. Whenever a man sees the Lord, he is broken and cannot survive. This is the meaning of light. Brothers and sisters, we must never substitute any other thing for the light. What we usually speak of as light is not necessarily light itself. Most things are mere teachings and so-called truth. They do not have any spiritual value to us. Once a brother who loved the Lord very much met a man who said to him, "I am very glad because I found the doctrine of sin in Romans." When the brother heard this he said, "Friend, did you only find the doctrine of sin in Romans today? I think you should have found the reality of sin in yourself long ago." Many people are looking for doctrines, but they have not found the reality. Doctrines are mere words, and they are death. They are not light, they are not life, and they are not Christ.</p><p>When the light comes, the first thing it does is kill. We should not think that light only gives us sight. On the contrary, when the light comes, the first thing it does is to take away our sight. The light makes us see, but that is a later result. At first the light makes us blind and makes us fall; afterwards, we see. Anything that cannot make us fall to the ground is not the light. Anything that cannot humble us is not the light. Paul saw the light and fell to the ground, and his eyes could see nothing for three days (Acts 9:8-9). When we first encounter light, we become confused. When a person in darkness first sees light, he cannot distinguish anything; everything seems confusing to him. Anyone who is self-assured and who thinks he knows everything needs God's mercy, because such a man has never seen the light. All that he knows are doctrines and knowledge. Once he sees the true light he will say, "Lord, what do I know? I know nothing." The greater the revelation, the blinder one becomes, and the more severe a blow one suffers. Light makes a person humble; it makes a person fall. Only after this will a person see. If we have never suffered any blow and never been humbled, and if we have never been confused and never felt that we knew nothing, we have never encountered any light, and we are still in darkness. May the Lord have mercy on us so that His light may take away our self-assurance and so that we will not be so confident that we are right, that we are not wrong, and that we know so much. May we say before the Lord, "Lord, You are the light. Now I know that what I saw before was nothing but things."</p><p>Light is not something abstract; it is something very concrete. The Lord Jesus is the light. When the Lord Jesus was among us, He was light among us, the very light walking among us. What a pity that to some Christians so many things are abstract. They hear this and that doctrine, but everything is abstract to them. They only know some abstract doctrines, but have not received any practical help.</p><p>One brother was studying in a parochial school when he was young. He went to church often and heard the teaching concerning salvation many times. Yet he had never met anyone who was saved, nor was he himself saved. One day he met a man preaching the gospel. When he heard the gospel the man preached, he was saved. He had not been saved earlier because he had heard only abstract doctrines. On that day, he met a genuinely saved person; he met something concrete, and he was saved.</p><p>One brother once related his experience of studying the Bible. He said, "I had heard many brothers and sisters speaking on sanctification, and I went to study the doctrine of sanctification. I found more than two hundred verses about holiness in the New Testament. I memorized them all and arranged them in proper order. Yet I still did not know what sanctification was; it was meaningless to me. Then one day I met an elderly sister who was a truly sanctified person. On that day my eyes were opened, and I saw what sanctification is. I met a person who was sanctification. The light was so bright that it hurt; when it came there was no way for me to escape. The light showed me the meaning of sanctification."</p><p>From these experiences we can see that light is something concrete, living, and effective. If you merely convey doctrines to others, the result will be merely doctrines in them. This is dead, and this is not the light of life. The light of life will shine in their lives and will shine out from them. We must remember that with the Lord Jesus, light is something concrete. With us, it is also something concrete. This light is a living person. When this light appears, it is something living in us also.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, why does it seem as if God's Word has lost its power in these days? Why does it appear so weak and abstract? The only reason is that there are too many doctrines! There is too much "truth" and too much knowledge of theology! We have to realize that only the living Lord can produce living persons. May the Lord truly have mercy on us to show us as the days go by that all things are dead and only the Lord is living. In Christianity even the nicest looking things, the sweetest sounding things, and the things men consider most spiritual are dead if they are outside of Christ. The Lord Himself should be everything in us. He Himself is everything. Only He is living. He is living in us, and when He is passed on to others, He will be living in them as well. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we will prostrate ourselves before Him. When we do this, we will know the Lord in a way different than we did before.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">CHRIST IS THE "I AM"</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 3:13-14a; John 8:28a</h1><p>From eternity to eternity, our God is God. He is not limited by time and space, because He is from eternity to eternity. First, we want to see how God is not limited by time.</p><p>The psalmist once prayed to God, "Teach us to number our days,/That we may gain a heart of wisdom" (Psa. 90:12). If men are wise, they should know how to number their days. But what about God? There is no way to count God's days because He is God from the ages to the ages; He is God from eternity to eternity. Second Peter 3:8 tells us "that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years like one day." Man can never have this view. If we treat an hour as a week, or a week as an hour, we will throw many things into disorder. As men we cannot live without dealing with time. But God sees one day as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day; He is not limited by time, and He is not bound by time. God is God; therefore, He transcends time.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD IS THE "I AM"</h2><p>If we want to learn to go on and to know God, we need to realize that God has one characteristic: He is beyond time. We cannot measure God by time. All of God's works are beyond the limitation of time. If we want to contact God, to gain some spiritual experience, or to receive some spiritual help, we have to learn to get away from the concept of time. Whoever wants to pursue God and know God must not be bound by the concept of time.</p><p>We need to see another very special matter: God is the present God, the God of today. In other words, there is no concept of time in God. This is not to say that God does not have time, but God does not have the concept of time, and God is not bound by time. Human beings divide time into periods. To us, one period of time belongs to the past, another period of time belongs to the future, while we call a third period of time the present time, or today. Whenever we think of time, we always think of the past, the present, and the future. Everyone thinks in this way. However, in our communication with God, there is only one time period&mdash;the present time. God does not have the past. In God all the past is the present. God does not have the future either. In God all the future is the present. We are not saying that God does not have time, but time as we think of it does not exist in God. Our time is the past, the present, and the future, but God's time is eternally present; it is continuously, eternally present. In God, neither the past nor the future exist.</p><p>In the Bible, God has the name Jehovah. Jehovah means that God is the self-existing and eternal God. God is the One who now IS and who forever IS. In Revelation 1:4 God is called "Him who is and who was and who is coming." From man's view, He is the One who was, who is, and who is to come; there is a distinction of the past, the present, and the future. Whenever the Bible mentions God's past, present, and future, it is with man's realization in view. But as far as God's name is concerned, He is the eternal One. There is no concept of time in Him. If there is, it is always the present, and this present is forever unchanged. For instance, a father's birth is always earlier than that of his son. This fact is true not only today, but forever. God is the God who now is. He is forever the God who now is. This is an assured fact.</p><p>God Himself is unchangeable. What we think of as the past and the future does not apply to Him. God is forever the God who is. The only tense God has is the present tense. In Exodus 3, God told Moses His name&mdash;the self-existing and ever-existing One, which, according to the original text, can be translated as "I AM THAT I AM." The time of the "I AM" is present. God said to Moses, "I AM THAT I AM," which meant "I am the One who now is." As far as God Himself is concerned, He is the God who now is.</p><p>Hebrews 11:6 says, "But without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to Him, for he who comes forward to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him." To please God we must believe. But what must we believe? We must believe that "He is." "I AM" is what He calls Himself, while "He is" is what others call Him. We should not believe in God as the God of the future, because for God there is no future; nor should we believe in God as the God of the past, because for God there is no past. This teaching may bewilder even the most intelligent persons. From man's point of view, we always think that something belongs to the past, something belongs to the future, and something belongs to the present. We always divide time into the past, the present, and the future. But with God, there is neither a past nor a future. Why then does God's Word mention the past and the future? It mentions them because for human beings, there is always a need to reference things to the past or the future; otherwise, our mind could not comprehend or understand what is being discussed. To say that God is the God who now is does not refer to the "now" in time as we know it. Rather, it refers to the fact that God is the One who forever is in Himself. In God there is no past, present, or future. God is the God who now is.</p><p>In John 8:28, the Lord Jesus said to the Jews, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am." The meaning of the "I am" in this verse is the same as the meaning of "I AM" in Exodus 3. He was not saying, "I was" or "I will be," but "I AM," that is, "I AM NOW." This means that He is God; He is a God who now is. The Jews countered the Lord and said, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham? Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am" (vv. 57-58). When the Jews heard this, they took up stones to cast at Him, because the "I am" that the Lord spoke of here is the same as the "I am" in verse 28. The Jews knew this "I am." So they took up stones to cast at Him. Furthermore, when Judas led others to arrest Jesus and the Lord said, "I am," they drew back and fell to the ground (John 18:6). The Lord is the "I am." Once this God appears, no one can stand before Him; everyone has to fall to the ground.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING GOD BEYOND TIME</h2><p>What is the purpose of speaking about this? We have to realize that this has much to do with our life. If we truly see this, we will be led to know God more. Anyone who wants to know God needs to be delivered from the limitation of the concept of time. If a person is bound by the concept of time, he cannot even be saved. Do not think that time is nothing; time is a very crucial thing. We want to prove this point specifically by the following four items.</p><h2 class="head2">Example One&mdash;The Forgiveness of Sins</h2><p>First John 1:7 says, "The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin." When we preach the gospel, we usually tell people that the blood of God's Son Jesus cleanses us from all our sin. Someone may ask, "How could the blood of the Lord Jesus cleanse us from all our sin?" We tell him that the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, paying the price for our sins. Our sins have been cleansed by the blood He shed. But others may not understand and ask, "How is this possible? The Lord Jesus was crucified more than nineteen hundred years ago. On the day He died, I was not even born yet, and I had not committed any sins. How could He die for someone who was not born yet and had not committed any sins?" Brothers and sisters, when you encounter this kind of problem, how should you answer? When you encounter this kind of problem, you should realize that this problem occurs because people have brought in the concept of time. However, the Lord's cross transcends time. When people bring in the concept of time, there is no way to understand the cross.</p><p>We need to remember that Christ is the One who now is. In God there is no distinction between past and future. In God it is always today. God is the One who is from eternity to eternity. From the ages past to the ages in the future, He has not changed. God does not have any past or future. God is the God who now is. If we bring time into our concept, we cannot communicate with God. When we look in the Greek New Testament, we will find out that 1 John 1:7 is in the present tense. It does not say that the blood of His Son Jesus cleansed all our sin in the past. Neither does it say that the blood of His Son Jesus will cleanse all our sin in the future. All of our sins are cleansed now, not in the past or in the future.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, before we were saved, our minds were filled with the concept of time. We thought of Jesus as someone far away. Not only did He live far away geographically in the nation of Israel, but in time there was a gap between Him and us of more than nineteen hundred years. How could He have died for us? How could a past Savior save a sinner today? The Lord Jesus was a past Savior, but I am a sinner today. How could One who lived in the past save me in the present? It was incomprehensible to us; we could not fathom it. Then one day, we said to our God, "I do not know everything. But I know this: I am a sinner. I know I need to be saved and now is the time for me to be saved." At that moment, God opened our eyes and we saw Jesus the Nazarene crucified for us on the cross. It was as if He were stretching out His hands and saying to us, "As long as you come to Me, as long as you do not refuse Me, everything will be all right." At that instant, we received Him with tears as the Savior. Brothers and sisters, at that time did you consider the question of time? Did it occur to you that He was a past Savior and that you were a present sinner? Our experience tells us that from that day forward, time did not present a problem to us, and we did not think of the cross as a past event anymore. God is the God who now is. Our words cannot express this thoroughly. All we can say is that God is present. In fact, even the word present is not adequate to express this characteristic of God.</p><p>The ashes of the red heifer in Numbers 19 signify the Lord's redemption. These ashes mingled with running water and sprinkled upon a person made a person clean. The death of the Lord Jesus is likened to the red heifer being burnt to ashes. According to history and to man's view, the Lord Jesus died nineteen hundred years ago. However, one day the Holy Spirit revealed to us the fact of the Lord's accomplishment. That is like running water being mingled with the ashes: when we received what He accomplished, we were cleansed. In the Spirit, the Lord's redemption is not something of the past, but something of the present. The Holy Spirit is God's power today. The Holy Spirit unveils all the facts in God to us and makes them ours today.</p><p>We need to remember that God is the present God; in Him there is no past. Everything we do will pass away, but what God has done will not pass away, because He is life and He is always living. To man, God's works are related to time; one may say that such and such a thing was done in the past, or that such and such a thing will be done in the future. Yet in Him everything is present because He is the perfect life; He is so perfect that there is no possibility of advancement anymore. Human beings make advancements; when we advance, something becomes the past. I advance a little now, and after a while I advance some more. When I move on, the things that happened before become things of the past. On the one hand, there is a constant advancing, while on the other hand, things are constantly turned into past history. However, God remains the same from eternity to eternity. Therefore, there is no past with God; nothing in God can pass away. God is the God of life, and He lives forever. In God one cannot find anything that belongs to the past. When a person is saved, his eyes are opened at least once to see that the Lord's work is neither past nor future. Therefore, he receives the Lord Jesus. We need to be saved from the concept of time so that we can know this God who is not limited by time.</p><h2 class="head2">Example Two&mdash;Dying with Christ</h2><p>Romans 6:6 says, "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves." This shows us that God not only caused the Lord Jesus to shed His blood on the cross so that we could be forgiven, but He also put us in Christ. When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, God also crucified our old man with Him. We have been crucified with Christ on the cross. This is God's fact. But our human minds cannot understand this. The Lord Jesus' crucifixion was obviously something in the past. How can we be joined to Him? How can we as ones living today be related to Christ who was crucified more than nineteen hundred years ago? Thank God that one day He opened our eyes, and we saw the light. The Bible says, "Our old man has been crucified with Him," and we also confessed that we have died. When we say this, we do not consider the death of Christ to be something in the past. We are not talking about a fact of death more than nineteen hundred years ago. We are saying that this fact of death is here today, living and fresh. It is true that Jesus died, but this truth is something we can touch and see today. We need to remember that everything God has done in Christ is done in the present. Second Timothy 2:18 says, "Who concerning the truth have misaimed, saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and overthrow the faith of some." The people who misaimed concerning the truth did not say that there was no resurrection, but that the resurrection had already taken place. Saying that the resurrection has already taken place is to misaim concerning the truth. We need to know that resurrection has not passed away. It is still here today. Did the cross pass away? No, it is still here today. Did the fact that we died with Christ pass away? No, it is still here today. God is forever the God who now is; therefore, everything that God has done in Christ is now and forever now. If we consider any aspect of the work of Christ as being past, that aspect will be dead to us. We thank God that all that He has done in Christ is present; nothing is past. God put what His Son has done in the Holy Spirit. In the Holy Spirit there is no past, there is only now.</p><p>The work of the Lord Jesus in us is something living when we look at it through the Holy Spirit. But if we consider it apart from the Holy Spirit, it is just letters. If we read it as mere letters, it is dead. If we speak of it as a doctrine, it is dead, and if we consider it merely as a story, it is also dead. Some people say, "I believe in all the facts of the Bible. Why is it that they do not produce any effect on me?" Some people say, "I have heard that doctrine, but why does it not have an effect on me?" Others say, "I have found God's words in the Bible. But why do they not have an effect on me?" The reason is that these ones are not touching God's facts in the Holy Spirit. Everything in Christ belongs to the past when it is viewed according to letters or when it is viewed doctrinally. But when it is viewed according to the Holy Spirit, nothing belongs to the past; everything is now.</p><p>Hallelujah! Nothing in Christ is past. Christ is still the great "I AM" today! He does not have a past; He cannot pass away. Hallelujah! Our Lord cannot pass away! Everything in Him is full of life and fully in the Holy Spirit; nothing can pass away. Brothers and sisters, if a person is truly under the Lord's leading and is going on all the way, he will see that everything in Christ is a matter of now; there is no past. Christ is the Lord of today; there is no past in Him. Everything in Christ is always today. This is true with Christ's experience, and it is also true with our experience of Christ&mdash;it is forever a matter of now. We do not have enough words to describe this kind of thing, but when the Lord's Spirit works in us and brings us into a union with Christ, we will see that all the facts in Christ are now; nothing is past, because we are joined to the Lord. The cross of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, the ascension of Christ, and the descension of the Holy Spirit are all matters of the present. All that God gave us in Christ is now. We cannot take what God gave us in Christ as history. All that God has given us in Christ is now. Thank God, Christ is still the "I AM" even today. He is always there and does not pass away. God is a God of now; there is no past in Him.</p><h2 class="head2">Example Three&mdash;Faith in Prayer</h2><p>Mark 11:24 says, "For this reason I say to you, All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them." From man's point of view, prayer and petition are things of the present, and "you will have them" is a thing of the future. There is a gap of time between "pray and ask" and "you will have them." When I pray to God for the healing of a disease, for the salvation of a sinner, or for the accomplishment of a work, I do not know when the disease will be healed, when the person will be saved, or when the work will be accomplished. In man's eyes, answers to prayer belong to the future. But the Lord Jesus' word here is very unusual. He is speaking of genuine faith. "All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them." In our mind, we often misread the word "have" in the phrase "believe that you have received them." We often change it to "believe that you will receive them, and you will have them," or we change it to "believe that you can receive them, and you will have them." Sometimes we change it to "believe that you are going to receive them, and you will have them," or "believe that you will receive them in the future, and you will receive them." But once you change it, that is no longer faith. Only one faith is genuine faith&mdash;the faith that believes that "God is." "All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them." The Lord's Word does not say "going to receive" but "have received them." "Believe that you have received them" means that I believe that I have received them now. I am not waiting for the future. Do we see this? This is not the future as we think of it. In Christ there is no future. Brothers and sisters, do not think that this is a small teaching. We should know that this has everything to do with our spiritual life. We cannot disregard this.</p><p>One day, while the Lord Jesus was on His way to Jerusalem from Bethany, He was hungry, "and seeing at a distance a fig tree having leaves, He came to see if perhaps He would find anything on it. And when He came to it, He found nothing except leaves, for it was not the season for figs. And He answered and said to it, May no one eat fruit from you forever!" (Mark 11:12-14). "No one eat fruit from you forever" is a fact. The Lord Jesus stated a fact. This was a flourishing fig tree, but the Lord said, "May no one eat fruit from you forever." He spoke with such confidence. What is the secret? The secret is in verse 24. What the Lord Jesus said in verse 24 is a continuation of the subject of the fig tree. He said, "For this reason I say to you, All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them." This is what He did to the fig tree. He did not wait until the fig tree had died before saying such a word. He said, "May no one eat fruit from you forever" when the fig tree was still flourishing. Although the fig tree was flourishing, in the eyes of faith, the Lord Jesus saw it as dead already and that no man would eat the fruit of it forever. Though the fig tree had not died, the Lord Jesus saw the fact of its death. The faith which "believe[s] that you have received" is this kind of faith. The facts that faith sees are not in the future but in the present. Those who do not know the Lord can only say that they know something when they actually see it in the future. But for those who know the Lord, it is a matter of today and not the future. They know something before they have seen it; they know it within already. We need to remember that in spiritual things, everything is today. Nothing is in the future. God is the God who now is, not the God who will be.</p><p>Mark 11:24 shows one thing: everything that God does is in the Spirit. According to man's view there is the past, the present, and the future; this makes sense to man. But spiritual things are different. Whoever has the experience can testify with us that there is neither a past nor a future in spiritual things. Everything is in the present. There are many things which, according to man's view, are in the future. But we say that they are in the present. Thank God, in genuine faith, everything is done.</p><h2 class="head2">Example Four&mdash;<br />The Foretaste of the Power of the Coming Age</h2><p>Hebrews 6:5 says we "have tasted...the powers of the age to come." What is this? How can the coming age be moved to today? Can all the things in the future be moved to today? We know "the age to come" is the millennium. Hebrews 6 tells us that Christians can have a foretaste of the powers of the age to come. The prophecies in the Bible about the millennium are wonderful. For example, "the wolf will dwell with the lamb;/And the leopard will lie down with the kid, /And the calf and the young lion and the fatling together;/And a young boy will lead them about./The cow and the bear will graze;/Their young will lie down together;/And the lion will eat straw like the ox./The nursing child will play by the cobra's hole,/And upon the viper's den/The weaned child will stretch his hand./They will not hurt nor destroy/In all My holy mountain,/For the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah,/As the waters cover the sea" (Isa. 11:6-9). At that time, "they will beat their swords into plowshares,/And their spears into pruning hooks;/Nation will not lift the sword against nation,/Nor will they learn war anymore" (2:4). Oh, how wonderful is the kingdom age! From man's point of view, these things can be enjoyed only in the future. But Hebrews 6:5 speaks of Christians having a foretaste today; Christians can have a foretaste of the powers of the kingdom. In the kingdom age all the demons will be cast out. But today man can cast out demons also. In the kingdom age everyone will be healthy. But today the Lord sustains the human body also. In that day men will know the Lord. But today men can know Him also. In that day the nursing child will play by the the cobra's hole. Today men can take up serpents (Mark 16:17-18). The children of God can have a foretaste of the powers of the coming age. According to the concept of time, these things will happen in the future. But the church can move the future to the present, just as she moved the past to the present.</p><p>We have to shout, Hallelujah! Christ is the Christ who is now. Christians are in contact with such a "now" Christ. We communicate with such a Lord, and we are related to such a Lord. Every spiritual thing to Christians is a matter of now. We often have heavy burdens, trials, and difficulties. We pray to the Lord, yet it seems useless. The more we pray, the more unclear the situation becomes. Our petition seems to have no effect no matter how we pray. This is because we are standing on the wrong ground in our petitioning. Our thought is that God will answer us in the future. We have limited God by time. We wait for the future. As a result, nothing happens. But thank God that we can bring the future and the present together. We believe that in our individual experiences, we can move the things of the kingdom to today.</p><p>May God show us that our Lord is the God who now is. Whoever touches this holds the key to communion with God. We need to ask God to save us from our thoughts, our cleverness, the limitation of time, the future, and the past, and deliver us from dead knowledge outside of the Holy Spirit, so that we may see that in the Holy Spirit everything is now and living. May the Lord lead us and bless us. Amen!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">CHRIST IS THE ROCK OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:13-19</h1><h2 class="head1">"WHO DO YOU SAY THAT I AM?"</h2><p>"Who do men say that the Son of Man is?" The Lord Jesus posed this question to the disciples. No doubt the Lord was the Son of Man. Everyone would admit that He was the Son of Man. The Jews admitted it, and so did the Gentiles. This was not the problem. The problem was not whether the Lord was the Son of Man, but who the Son of Man was. The Lord was not asking if others considered Him to be good or bad, but who did men say that He was. Those who opposed Him said that He was demon-possessed (John 7:20; 8:48, 52), a gluttonous man, and a drunkard (Matt. 11:19). We are not very concerned with these blasphemous remarks. But those who were favorable towards Him also had different views. Some said that He was John the Baptist; others said that He was Elijah. Still others said that He was Jeremiah or one of the prophets. Nicodemus said that He came from God as a teacher (John 3:2). The Samaritan woman said that He was a prophet (4:19). Who really was this Son of Man? Everyone had their own view and own opinion.</p><p>But the Lord did not stop with this question. He wanted to know one thing: He wanted to know the difference between the disciples' view of Him and the view of other men. In particular, He wanted to know the difference between Peter's knowledge of Him and others' knowledge of Him. In effect, the Lord was saying, "Others have said that I am this and I am that. But who do you say that I am? You who are My disciples, who do you say that I am?" "Who do you say that I am?" (Matt. 16:15). This was the Lord's main question.</p><p>Simon Peter answered the Lord and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" (v. 16). Peter's word was clear: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." Peter acknowledged two things about the Lord. First, he acknowledged that He is the Christ. Second, he acknowledged that He is the Son of God. As far as the Lord's person is concerned, He is the Son of God. As far as His work is concerned, He is the Christ of God. His being the Son speaks of who He is, and His being the Christ speaks of what He does. His being the Son speaks of His relationship with God, and His being the Christ speaks of His relationship with God's plan. As far as His person is concerned, He is the Son of the living God. As far as His work is concerned, He is the Christ, the Christ of the living God; He is the anointed One, the One set apart to accomplish God's plan. This was Peter's confession of the Lord Jesus. This is also our confession of the Lord Jesus.</p><p>After Peter made this confession, the Lord said, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" (v. 17). This was not something that Peter thought of, or something that he learned from others. It was something that the Father who is in the heavens had revealed to him.</p><p>Following this, the Lord said, "And I also say to you" (v. 18). First the Lord showed Peter where his confession came from. Afterwards, He pointed out the great significance of this confession. What did the Lord say to Peter? He said, "You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it" (v. 18). This tells us what the foundation of the church is. This is the most important question in Christianity. It is the crux of Christianity. What is the foundation of the church? The Lord showed us that the church is built upon "this rock." "This rock" is the foundation of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">WHAT IS THIS ROCK?</h2><p>Let us now specifically consider this rock. If we do not know what this rock is, we do not know the foundation of the church. If we do not know what this rock refers to, we will not know how the church is built up.</p><p>This rock is Peter's confession of the Lord. Peter confessed that the Lord Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. The church is built upon this confession. It is built upon man's confession and knowledge of the Lord Jesus.</p><p>Peter's confession did not come through a revelation of flesh and blood; he made this confession based on the revelation he received from God. This shows that Peter did not receive a Christianity that was handed down by others. He did not confess the Lord as the Christ just because others told him that the Lord is the Christ. He did not confess the Lord as the Son of the living God just because others said that He is the Son of the living God. This was not something that Peter thought of by himself, or something others told him. The Father in the heavens revealed this to him and gave him this knowledge. Peter's confession was not based on man's conjecture or the teaching of others. It was based on God's revelation of His Son in his spirit. This was the basis of his knowledge of Him as the Son of God and as the Christ of God.</p><p>The church is built upon this confession. This confession is based on God's revelation, and this revelation reveals Christ's person and work to man. When the Father who is in the heavens revealed this to Peter, He showed Peter that this One is the Son of God and the Christ of God. The Lord said, "Upon this rock I will build My church." What is this rock? It is Peter's confession: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." This word is man's confession, and it is also God's revelation. It is Christ Himself. This is the rock. The Lord is building His church upon this rock.</p><p>If we have a problem with this rock, it means we have a problem with our knowledge of the church. Once there is a problem with this rock, there is a problem with the foundation of the church. Hence, we have to spend some time to consider what this rock is. But this is a big subject; within our limited scope here, we can only touch this matter briefly.</p><h2 class="head2">The Rock Being Christ, the Son of the Living God</h2><p>As far as His own person is concerned, He is the Son of God. This knowledge is indispensable to everyone. Our knowledge of the Lord does not depend on what the Gospels say that He has done; our knowledge of Him depends on our knowledge of Him as the Son of God. What man sees, hears, and touches are not enough. The Lord is much more than what man sees and touches. He is the Son of the living God. Everyone confesses Him as the Son of Man; both friends and foes acknowledged Him as the Son of Man. But only those who have received God's revelation know that He is the Son of God. In God's eyes, whether or not a man has life depends on whether he knows Jesus of Nazareth as the Son of God. The Bible says, "And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ" (John 17:3). "That you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing, you may have life in His name" (20:31). "He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life" (1 John 5:12). Eternal life is knowing Jesus Christ, the One whom God has sent. Eternal life is knowing the Lord Jesus as the Son of God.</p><p>The Bible tells us that the Son of God is "the effulgence of His glory and the impress of His substance" (Heb. 1:3). He is "the image of the invisible God" (Col. 1:15). The Son of God is God manifesting Himself among men. "No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him" (John 1:18). Hence, if a man wants to know God, he must know the Son of God; he must know God through the Son. The Lord Jesus is the Son of God, the expression of God's substance. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily (Col. 2:9). God has manifested Himself through His Son. The nature of the Son is just God Himself, while the expression of God's substance is the Son. The Lord Jesus said, "He who has seen Me has seen the Father" (John 14:9). "I and the Father are one" (10:30). The Son and the Father are one. When God dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16), He is the Father. When He unveils Himself to man and when man sees Him and touches Him, He is the Son. John 1:14 says, "And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality." The Lord Jesus is the Word becoming flesh. This Word is the very Word who was with God in the beginning, and this Word was God (John 1:1-2). Words are expressions of a person; they represent the person himself. When a man utters some words, others realize what is inside him; they know the kind of person he is. The Son of God is God's spoken Word. Through Him man can understand and know God. The Lord Jesus, as the Son of God, is God's expression; He is God "manifested in the flesh" (1 Tim. 3:16). The Lord Jesus is the very God Himself.</p><p>Hence, to know the Lord Jesus as the Son of God is to know Him as the One who has God's life and nature; it is to know Him as God's expression and to know that He is God. If a man does not know the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, he does not know God. "Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also" (1 John 2:23). God has raised the Lord Jesus from the dead and designated Him the Son of God in power (Rom. 1:4). God desires that man would know the Lord Jesus as the Son of God so that through His Son, man would come to know God Himself.</p><p>What causes us to confess that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God? God's revelation within us causes us to recognize the Lord Jesus as God's Son. The Father who is in the heavens has told us that the Lord Jesus is God's Son. The Lord Jesus performed many miracles on earth, which demonstrated that He is the Son of God. However, a man does not confess Jesus as the Son of God because of the miracles and works of wonders he sees, but because of the revelation which he receives from the Father. Many brothers and sisters believe in the Lord Jesus as the Son of God without seeing even one miracle. On the contrary, many people who saw the Lord's miracles with their own eyes did not confess Him as the Son of God. Peter did not know the Lord Jesus as the Son of God because he had followed the Lord for so many years and had insight about Him. No man can be so capable as to know Him this way. There is only one reason that a man knows the Lord Jesus is the Son of God: the Father in the heavens has revealed it to him. Those who have seen miracles can confess the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, but those who have not seen miracles can still confess the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, because the Father in the heavens grants men this revelation.</p><p>The church is a group of people whose eyes have been opened by the Lord to see that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God. This inward knowledge can withstand any test. They know inwardly that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God, and nothing can shake them. They can forget what they see outwardly, and they can forget what they hear outwardly. But they cannot forget what they know inwardly. Hallelujah! They know the Lord Jesus.</p><p>God is not only revealing the person of the Lord Jesus to us. He is also revealing His ministry to us. In His person, the Lord Jesus is the Son of God; in His ministry, He is the Christ of God. The word Christ is the same as the word Messiah, which means the anointed One. An anointed person is one who is joined to God's work. In the Old Testament, when a man was appointed by God to be a priest, a prophet, or a king, he was anointed with ointment. Hence, an anointed one is one who is commissioned and sent by God to accomplish His work and fulfill His plan. The Lord Jesus is the Christ of God. This means that God's eternal plan is accomplished through Christ. In eternity past, the Lord Jesus was the Son of God. But at the beginning of God's eternal plan, the Son of God became the Christ of God, for the purpose of accomplishing God's eternal plan. God's Christ is eternal, but He was there from the eternity which has a beginning, while the Son of God was there from the eternity that does not have a beginning. The Son of God does not have a beginning, in the same way that God does not have a beginning. But God's Christ came into being when God's eternal plan came into being. Christ was established for the fulfillment of God's plan. The anointed One was separated for God's special work. From that point on, God's Son became God's Worker, His Messenger, and His Christ. From that point on, all of God's work, all of His hopes, and all of His goals were centered on His Son. From that point on, God's Son is not only God's Son, He has also become God's Christ. God's Son became God's Christ and the anointed One for the purpose of accomplishing God's eternal plan.</p><p>A Christian must see God's eternal plan before he can become useful in God's hand. It is not enough for a Christian merely to know that he has sinned, that the Lord Jesus has accomplished redemption for him, and that he can be saved through receiving the Lord Jesus. This Christian will not perish and go into perdition, but he will be of no use in God's hand. God did not establish the church simply for the purpose of gaining a group of people. God established the church for the purpose of gaining a group of people who would know His purpose and plan in Christ. We must be clear about this. We need revelation from the Father who is in the heavens in order to know that the Lord Jesus is the Christ of God and the anointed One, that Christ is the Head of the church, that the church is the Body of Christ, and that it shares in the anointing of Christ. Brothers and sisters, we have to confess that the Lord Jesus is the Christ, and we have to confess that we are Christians who belong to Christ and who share in the anointing. One day when God opens our eyes, we will realize how narrow our view has been during all the years we were Christians, and how small a realm we have covered in our work. One day God will place us under His anointing, and we will see the kind of work that He has done. It is amazing that some claim that they have received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and yet they have not entered into God's work or seen the purpose of the anointing. May the Lord open our eyes to see the purpose of the Lord Jesus' anointing and the purpose of the church's anointing. The anointing which the church receives is the same anointing the Head received, because the church is under the anointing of the Head.</p><p>Not only do we need to know the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, but we must know Him also as the Christ of God. Not only do we need to know that the Lord Jesus possesses God's life and nature, but we must know that He is the anointed One who accomplishes God's eternal plan. Through Him as the Son of God, we can know God Himself, and through Him as the Christ of God, we can know God's plan. If we only know the Lord Jesus as the Son of God without knowing Him as the Christ of God, we will not understand God's purpose in creating us and His purpose in saving us; we will not understand what God wants to gain from the church. We must have both kinds of knowledge&mdash;the knowledge of the Lord Jesus as the Son of God and the knowledge of the Lord Jesus as the Christ of God.</p><h2 class="head2">The Rock Being the Father's Revelation to Peter</h2><p>We need God Himself to open our eyes to see how great the Lord Jesus is. We need to see this in an inward way. This is not something that flesh and blood can reveal to us. Blood is related to our soul, while the flesh is related to our body. The soul and the body cannot help us to know the One God has appointed. When the Lord was on earth, countless numbers of people saw Him, but most did not know Him. Countless numbers of people followed Him, but most did not know Him. Countless numbers of people thronged His side or received His healing, but they still did not know Him. Man's mind and feelings are completely useless in this respect.</p><p>The Lord Jesus said to His disciples, "Blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to perceive the things that you see, and have not perceived them, and to hear the things that you hear, and have not heard them" (Matt. 13:16-17). Indeed, the Lord's disciples were blessed. But this was not enough to make them members of the church; this was not enough to make them a part of the church. Peter had the blessing that the Lord was speaking of because he had seen what the prophets and righteous men had not perceived and heard what they had not heard. However, this was not enough. Only when Peter confessed the Lord as the Christ and the Son of God did he touch the central issue. Only then did Peter's knowledge of the Lord change. In the past his knowledge of the Lord was outward, but now his knowledge of the Lord came from the revelation of the Father who is in the heavens. The Father who is in the heavens made known to him that Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ, the Son of the living God. This knowledge is a spiritual revelation. The knowledge that Peter had was inward rather than outward.</p><p>If a man does not have the knowledge that Peter had, he cannot be a part of the church, no matter how many years he has stayed with Christians. Even if he has seen Christ appearing in the flesh, he still cannot be a part of the church. In order to be a part of the church, a man must receive the same revelation that Peter received from the Father. When a man receives instructions from heaven to know that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God and the Christ of God, he becomes a part of the church. Therefore, we need to remember that the church is not only built upon Christ, but upon the Christ whom God has revealed. Without revelation, a man cannot know Christ or the Son of God. This knowledge cannot be gained by learning doctrines or by reading many books that say this and that about the Lord Jesus, and then repeating them. The revelation that we are speaking of is revealed and taught by the Father. The Lord Jesus once said to the disciples, "No one knows who the Son is except the Father" (Luke 10:22). What a wonderful word! If we were the disciples, we might have said, "What do You mean that we do not know You? We know where You were born. We know who Your father and mother are, and we know Your brothers and sisters. We also know Your cousin John. We not only know Your family, but we know Elizabeth and Zachariah." But the Lord Jesus said, "No one knows who the Son is except the Father." When the Lord says no one knows, He means no one knows. No one knows the Son except the Father. In Matthew 16, the Father was revealing the Son whom He knew to Peter so that Peter would know Him too.</p><p>One kind of knowledge of the Lord comes from man's revelation. According to the Lord Jesus, this kind of revelation cannot be considered real knowledge. The only real knowledge is the knowledge which God has concerning the Lord Jesus, and only God can reveal this knowledge to man. Therefore, anyone who has not received the Father's revelation does not know the Son. No one can come to the Father except through the Son, and no one can know the Son except through the revelation of the Father. This kind of revelation from heaven is indispensable. The church is built upon this revelation when it knows this man&mdash;Jesus&mdash;inwardly as the Christ and the Son of God. This inward knowledge is the foundation of the church. If a man does not have this kind of knowledge, yet tries to speak about this and that concerning the church, it is like cooking with a pan that has no bottom or drawing water with a bucket that has no bottom; the result is nothing but vanity. A man's knowledge of Christ does not come from man's teaching, but from the revelation of the Father who is in the heavens. The Lord said, "Upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it." The church is built upon this rock for the purpose of closing the gates of Hades. We must emphasize again and again that the knowledge of Christ we conjure up in our mind will not stand the tests; it is powerless and useless. If we come up with an idea of Christ in our head, a tranquil environment may not expose the superficiality of the knowledge, but the minute the gates of Hades open, our knowledge concerning Christ will prove untrustworthy and will be proven to be something other than God's revelation. It will not stand.</p><p>Peter knew the Lord Jesus, and he was tested. Did he fail? Yes, he failed. For a few minutes he denied the Lord, then he remembered His word after He turned toward him, and he wept. Although he failed and although he stumbled, he had the inward knowledge. This knowledge was precious; it led Peter to tears immediately after he fell. The church is resilient because its knowledge of Christ comes from the revelation of the Father who is in the heavens and not from man. It is wrong to think that as long as a person is smart, he can come up with an idea of Christ, or that as long as a person is eloquent, he can speak to others about Him. The knowledge of Christ that man produces by his own wisdom and ability is not a rock; it will tumble at the slightest push.</p><p>A Christ that is produced by our own imagination cannot help us, and a Christ that others tell us about cannot help us either. A big problem in the church is that many people receive their Christ from others' teaching; they say something because others are saying it. This knowledge is useless. This does not mean that the church should not preach. But it means that the kind of knowledge that is passed on from one mouth to another and from one ear to another is useless. If we do not have light from the Father who is in the heavens, and if all the light we have is handed down to us through others, we will be shaken when others are shaken. It is spiritually useless to have doctrines without revelation. What is a doctrine? A doctrine is something that flesh and blood reveal to us; it is something that exists apart from God's light and apart from any direct communication with the Lord. Anything that comes from flesh and blood, that requires the mind to remember and the intellect to understand, is a doctrine. We have to remember that the doctrine of Christ will not save us; we stand because God has revealed this Christ to us and we have received Him. The inward revelation that results in an inward knowledge of the Lord cannot be shaken by anything.</p><p>After Peter answered the Lord, saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God," the Lord said that Peter was blessed, because his declaration was not the result of revelation by flesh and blood, but from a revelation of the Father who is in the heavens. The Lord Jesus was not satisfied with right answers from man. He was after answers that were based on revelation. The worth of an answer is based on revelation. It is easy for a person to tell someone that Jesus is the Son of God. When you ask the second person who Jesus is, he may be able to tell you readily that Jesus is the Son of God. But if his answer is not based on revelation, it is worthless.</p><p>Anything the church says must be based on revelation; otherwise, it will not have any spiritual value. Without revelation, there is no knowledge. All those who genuinely know the Lord recognize this fact. If a church lacks revelation, it only has teachings, and it is doomed to failure. A teaching is something that is passed on from one man's mouth to another's, and then to a third's. The result of this passing on is that whatever a man learns, he passes on the same thing to others. The only things that these ones have are based on teachings handed down by others, and not based on revelation. This is the reason for the church's failure. We do not despise preaching. We pay a great deal of attention to preaching. Yet preaching cannot replace God's revelation. God wants us to have revelation and to speak according to our revelation. For example, Philip was sent by the Lord to the way of the wilderness, and he preached Jesus to a eunuch. When they came to a place with water, the eunuch asked to be baptized. "And Philip said, If you believe from all your heart, you will be saved. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God" (Acts 8:37). Philip then baptized the eunuch. Some people may try to imitate Philip's work. They may speak to others about Jesus being the Son of God for half an hour, after which they ask their listener, "Do you believe that Jesus is the Son of God?" If the other one says yes, they baptize him. If you asked why they do this, they would say, "Philip did this; therefore, this is scriptural." It is true that they may be saying the same thing, but we have to ask what is the basis for their speaking. Some base their speaking on revelation. This speaking will penetrate others' hearts. Others do not base their speaking on revelation. This speaking will impart only words to others. If your speaking is based on revelation, not only will you be speaking, but the Father and the Holy Spirit will be speaking as well. When this happens, the word will enter into others. Otherwise, others may be able to repeat word for word that Jesus is the Son of God, but what they say is only letters. Just because Philip did something once does not mean that we can do it now. This is outward imitation; it is not Christianity. The basis of Christianity is inward revelation and inward knowledge. Anything that comes by the way of teaching and imitation is not Christianity.</p><p>The foundation of the church is revelation. Where there is revelation, there is life. We were not saved by taking doctrine as life. In the same way, after we are saved, we cannot replace life with doctrine. If a man has merely received a doctrine without being enlightened, if he has only acquired a doctrine without acquiring Christ, he does not have life yet. After a man is saved, how should we help him and lead him on? Should we just ask how much teaching he has received, without checking if he has received any revelation from the Lord? The reason for the church's weakness, failure, and desolation is that it has paid too much attention to doctrines and has not paid any attention to revelation. There are too many teachings which are simply passed on from one person to another; they do not contain any inward revelation. How can the church not be weak this way?</p><h2 class="head2">The Rock Being Peter's Confession</h2><p>The church is built upon this rock, and this rock is Christ, the Son of God. The rock is also the revelation which God has given to man. Furthermore, the rock is the confession which issues from those who have received the revelation. We need to see. But confession is also very important. When our Lord was on earth, He said, "I am" (John 8:24). He is pleased to hear us confess, "You are." God is always pleased to hear and accept our salutation when we say, "You are." We say to the Lord, "You are Lord!" This is a very important word. We declare, "Jesus is Lord!" This is a very powerful declaration. Sometimes everything around us seems to be in confusion; Satan mocks us and tells us that we are through. At such times, prayer may not work, and the best thing to do is to declare loudly, "Jesus is Lord!" You will find that the difficulties are nothing and Satan's mockery is nothing. When you are put into any trial, you should rise up to speak. You may speak in your own room or in the prayer meeting. But wherever you are, you should say, "Jesus is Lord!" and tell Him, "You are!" The Lord likes to hear such a declaration. This will give us strength from within.</p><p>The Lord Jesus likes to hear the words "You are!" Otherwise, why would He have asked His disciples? If the disciples did not know the answer, what was the use of asking them? If they knew the answer, what need was there for the Lord to ask them such a question? The Lord Jesus asked this question because He wanted Peter to speak out. We have to remember that the foundation of the church is not only built upon the revelation from God, but upon Peter's declaration of the revelation he received. God has revealed His Son to us and unveiled His masterpiece to us. When we speak out and confess this revelation from God, and when we confess that Jesus is the Son of God and the Christ, we have the church. The church is Christ's voice on earth. God allows the church to remain on earth as a declarer and a confessor of Christ. It was not enough for Peter to say in his heart, "I believe that the Lord is powerful, that He reigns, and that He is glorious." It was not enough for Peter to say to the Lord, "Lord, I believe You in my heart." The Lord asked, "Who do you say that I am?" "You" refers to the Lord's disciples. "Who do you say...?" The disciples had to do one thing, which was to say, to speak with their mouth. What should they say? They should say who the Lord is. They should speak out the Lord Himself; they should say who He is. We have to pay attention to the phrase, "Who do you say that I am?" We have to remember that the church is built upon our confession of the Lord. The Lord said, "Upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it." If we have not seen the relationship between the church and the gates of Hades, we will not realize the importance of speaking; we will think that believing in the heart or praying is all that is needed. But if we see that the church is here to close the gates of Hades, we will realize that a declaration of who Jesus of Nazareth is is a declaration with life, with power, and with authority. Some can testify that they have often encountered difficulties before the Lord, and they could not get through no matter how hard they tried to believe. It seemed as if neither faith, prayer, nor supplications would work. But one day they stood up and said, "Lord, You are the Lord. You are the King! You have trodden the devil under. You are the One who has destroyed the work of the devil!" When they declared this, the power came. Therefore, the best prayer is not a supplication. The best prayer is to say, "You are! You are!" This should be the church's declaration of faith. Let me repeat this again: the church is not only built upon God's revelation, but also upon man's declaration of this revelation. A declaration that comes as a result of a revelation has spiritual value to it; there is power to it, and it shakes Hades.</p><p>We know that Peter was a talkative person. The Lord interrupted his speaking more than once. But this time, He allowed Peter to go on and even called him blessed after he finished. Peter's word represented the voice of the church. It is a voice that heaven loves to hear and a voice that is hard to find on earth. It is also a voice that Hades dreads to hear and a voice that God desires to find! In our prayer meetings, in the bread-breaking meetings, and in our personal prayers, we should learn to say more and more, "You are!" The Lord Himself declared on earth, "I am!" We should gladly respond, "You are! You are!" There are no better words than these. "You are" is the foundation of the church. The foundation of the church is built upon the Lord Himself; it is built upon God's revelation of the Lord. The foundation of the church is also built upon our declaration before men and the devil, a declaration of the Lord which comes as a result of our knowledge through revelation.</p><p>After Peter declared, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God," the Lord Jesus said, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona." Simon is Peter. The prefix Bar means a son. Barjona means the son of Jona. The Lord pointed out Peter's name and said, "Blessed are you," and He even mentioned Peter's father's name. The Simon who was so blessed was not any Simon, but Simon the son of Jona. Following this, the Lord said, "You are Peter." This shows us that this revelation is a personal one; it is absolutely personal. This declaration and confession are also personal, absolutely personal. Those who do not have such a revelation before the Lord and who do not have such a confession have no part in this blessing.</p><p>In short, this rock signifies three things: (1) This rock is Christ, the Son of the living God. (2) This rock is the revelation of Christ, the Son of the living God. (3) This rock is also Peter's confession of Christ, the Son of the living God. When we combine these three aspects together, we have "this rock" that the Lord spoke of.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IS BUILT UPON THIS ROCK</h2><p>The Lord Jesus said, "You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church." The name "Peter" means a little rock in the original language (John 1:42), while the word "rock" means a big rock. The Lord's choice of words here is very meaningful. He was saying, "You are a little rock, and I will build My church upon this big rock." The foundation of the church is Christ Himself. Christ is like a big rock. The church is built upon Christ. "You are Peter." This means that "you are a little rock. You Peter are a part of Christ." The Lord showed us that He needs many little rocks. He will build His church with these many little rocks. "This rock" is the big rock, which is the foundation. There is only one foundation, but there are many small rocks. We need to join with Peter to know who this Jesus of Nazareth is, and we need to join with Peter to confess who He is.</p><p>The foundation of the church is Christ Himself. The church is built upon Christ. This building is still going on, even today. He is building the little rocks upon this foundation. If a man wants to be a useful vessel to the Lord, he must know the Lord Jesus as the Son of God and as the Christ of God. We must not only see Him as the Savior, but as Christ and as the One appointed by God to accomplish His goal. The church must have this revelation, this testimony, and this declaration before the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. All the temptations of the devil and everything that death can do will fall before such a church. The church overcomes all the power of Satan through its inward revelation and through the testimony of its mouth. Hallelujah, the gates of Hades cannot prevail against the church. Death is swallowed up by life because the Lord has built His church upon "this rock"!</p><h1 class="series">CHRIST IS ALL SPIRITUAL<br />MATTERS AND THINGS</h1><h1 class="title">INTRODUCTION</h1><p>(The first three chapters of this book are the same as the first three chapters of the book Christ Is the Way, the Truth, and the Life published in this volume. Therefore, we have not included them in the following pages.)</p><h2 class="head1">IS IT CHRIST, OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE?</h2><p>The following five chapters are messages given by the Lord's servant some time ago. Because of the present urgent need of all the saints everywhere for these kinds of messages, we have published them today.</p><p>According to God's desire, plan, and redemption, He has ordained that His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, be all spiritual matters and things. When a man touches Him, he touches the reality of all spiritual matters and things. After a man gains Him, he gains all spiritual matters and things that God has prepared for him. But man has replaced Him with many so-called spiritual things. Although these many things, in man's eyes, belong to Him, they are nevertheless not Him. Rather, they are a replacement of Him. Therefore, they do not render man real help in his spiritual life.</p><p>We are facing a serious problem! What are we pursuing? What do we know, and what have we gained in the spiritual realm? Is it Christ, or is it something else? If it is Christ, we are touching the reality that God has ordained for us. If it is something else, no matter how good and valuable, we are merely touching vain and unprofitable things!</p><p>Today Christ is in the Spirit. In order to touch Him, we must be in spirit. We can use our mind to touch the things which are apart from Him. But in order to touch Him, we have to use the spirit. In order to touch the things that are apart from Him, we only need human zeal and cleverness. But in order to touch Him, we need God's revelation. We have to look to Him for His mercy and grace!</p><p>Witness Lee</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">CHRIST IS GOD'S MATTERS AND THINGS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:29; 6:53; 8:12, 24, 28; 11:25; 14:6; 1 Cor. 1:30; Col. 3:4; 1 Tim. 1:1; Psa. 27:1</h1><h2 class="head1">GOD'S GOAL AND MEANS&mdash;CHRIST</h2><p>God's goal is Christ, and Christ is also God's means. God uses Christ as the means to reach the goal, which is Christ. We can know and see God's goal particularly from the books of Ephesians and Colossians. In this message we would like to consider God's goal from these two books. There is one difference between these two books: Ephesians shows us that according to the economy of the fullness of the times, God wants to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth (1:10); Colossians shows us that God has not only made Christ to be Head over all things, but God has made Him all and in all (1:18; 3:11b). Colossians shows us that God's goal is Christ, and His means is also Christ. God's goal is for Christ to be Head over all things. In order to arrive at this, God must make Christ to be all. He must be all and, at the same time, He must be in all. Only then will all things be headed up, for if Christ is all and if Christ is in all, all things will be headed up spontaneously.</p><p>Please remember that in God's eyes, there are not many things. In God's eyes, there is only Christ. In God's eyes there is no matter and no thing; in God's eyes there is only Christ. What we ordinarily think of as matters and things do not exist in God's eyes. We may consider that there are many matters and things in this world. According to our worldly view, there are matters and there are things. But in God's eyes, Christ is everything. There is no matter, and there is no thing. Christ is all the matters, and Christ is all the things. When the day comes that Christ is in all matters and in all things, God's eternal purpose will be fulfilled.</p><p>I hope that you can see that Christ has headed up all things in Himself. This does not begin in the future when God's eternal purpose is fulfilled; it begins today through the church.</p><p>Tonight I will not go too deep; I will only touch this matter briefly. God has ordained that all matters and things will be headed up in Christ in the future. How can all things be headed up? God says that Christ is all things. He is all, and at the same time, He is in all. When this happens, we will only see Christ in the world; we will not see matters and things anymore, because all matters and all things will have passed away.</p><p>Today in the church, God is starting to show us that Christ is all matters and things. When the church sees this, it will begin to live in the realm of the spirit. If the eyes of the church are set only on matters and things, it has not seen Christ yet.</p><p>The matters I am referring to are not the matters of the world, and the things I am referring to are not the things of the world. The matters and things I am referring to are spiritual matters and things.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2><h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Things of God</h2><p>I would like to point out a very interesting thing here. The Gospel of John is the deepest Gospel; it is also the last Gospel written. It is the last book written in the New Testament. Many Epistles and books were written before the Gospel of John was written. John wrote his Gospel last. He wrote many things which are not found in the other Gospels. At the end he said that our understanding of Christ should be the same as God's understanding of Christ.</p><p>What we see in this book is not God's requirement for a lamb, or His gift of the bread of life. What we see is not just God's provision of a way, a truth, or a life. It is not a matter of the Lord having the power to restore man's life; it is not a matter of resurrection. It is not a matter of the Lord Jesus being able to give light, restore sight, and lead those who follow Him out of darkness. In the whole Gospel, we see only one great fact. This fact is that Christ is all things. The Gospel of John says that He is the light of the world; it does not say that He gives us light. It says that He is the bread of life; it does not say that He gives the bread of life. It says that He is the way; it does not say that He can show us the way. It says that He is the truth; it does not say that He can teach us a truth. It says that He is the life; it does not say that He can give us life. After Lazarus died, the Lord did not tell Martha and Mary that He had the power to resurrect their brother. Rather, He said that He is the resurrection.</p><p>Please remember that the bread of life is a thing, light is a thing, the way is a thing, truth is a thing, and life, resurrection, and the lamb are all things. But in Christianity, we do not find individual things. In Christianity, there is only Christ! Christ is what it is all about.</p><p>Today we have to see one thing before the Lord. We have to realize that in our experience there are not many matters and things. In our experience, there is only Christ. He does not give us the light; He is our light. He does not lead us to a way; He is our way. He does not give us life; He is our life. He does not teach us to understand a truth; He is the truth. Brothers, do you see the difference? All that God has given us is Christ Himself.</p><p>One day I told a group of people a spiritual fact. As I was speaking, many eyes began to stare at me. I said, "Let me tell you one crucial fact: God's Christ is God's matters. God does not have matters; God only has Christ! He has not given us light; He has given us Christ. He has not given us food; He has given us Christ. He has not given us a way, a truth, and a life; He has given us Christ. God's Christ is all things. Apart from Christ, God does not have any thing."</p><h2 class="head1">WHAT PAUL KNEW</h2><h2 class="head2">Christ Being Our Hope</h2><p>I would like to point out that not only does the Lord Jesus' own word testify to this, but Paul said the same thing. He knew the Lord, and he showed us one very interesting thing. He said to Timothy, "Christ Jesus our hope" (1 Tim. 1:1). I like this word. Do you like it? He did not say that our hope is in Christ Jesus. Rather, he said Christ Jesus is our hope. We do not put our hope in Him, and we do not draw hope from Him. Rather, Christ Jesus is our hope.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Being Our Life</h2><p>Again he said to the Colossians, "When Christ our life is manifested..." (Col. 3:4). He did not say, "When Christ is manifested." Rather, he said, "When Christ our life is manifested." He said that Christ is our life. A Christian does not have many matters; a Christian only has Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Being Our Wisdom:<br />Righteousness, Sanctification, Redemption</h2><p>This is not all. In these messages, the one verse that we emphasize more than any other verse is 1 Corinthians 1:30. What does it say? It says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption." God has not given us righteousness; He has given us Christ. Christ is our righteousness. God has not given us sanctification; He has given us Christ. Christ is our sanctification. God has not given us redemption; He has given us Christ. Christ is our redemption. God has not given us wisdom; He has given us Christ. Christ is our wisdom. This is why we say that the Christ of God is the things of God. God's Christ is God's matters and things. Apart from Christ, God does not have any matter or thing.</p><h2 class="head3">Christ Being Our Righteousness</h2><p>If God were to say to us, "I have made the Lord Jesus the Lord of righteousness; He is the One who justifies you," what would you say? You would say "Yes, He has justified us." But God has not asked the Lord Jesus to be the Justifier; He has asked the Lord Jesus to be our righteousness. Is this good? This is excellent. He is not the Justifier, but our righteousness. He is our righteousness.</p><h2 class="head3">Christ Being Our Sanctification</h2><p>Paul did not say that the Lord Jesus has become "the One that sanctifies." Rather, he said that Christ is sanctification. The Lord Jesus is not sanctifying us; He Himself is becoming our sanctification. God has made the Lord Jesus our sanctification. Our sanctification is Christ. Our sanctification is not a thing; it is not an act or a behavior. Our sanctification is a person&mdash;Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">Christ Being Our Redemption</h2><p>Again Paul did not say that the Lord is our Redeemer. He said that the Lord is our redemption. Is this not strange? First Corinthians 1:30 does not say that God has appointed the Lord Jesus to be a Redeemer. Rather, it says that the Lord Jesus is redemption.</p><p>Thank the Lord that our Redeemer is Christ, and our redemption is also Christ. The One who sanctifies is Christ, and our sanctification is also Christ. The One who justifies is Christ, and our righteousness is also Christ. The One who gives wisdom is Christ, and that wisdom is also Christ!</p><h2 class="head1">WHAT DAVID KNEW</h2><h2 class="head2">Christ Being Our Salvation</h2><p>If I stand here and say to you, "The Lord Jesus is our Savior," you will respond, "That is right. The Lord Jesus is our Savior." But Psalm 27:1 tells us that the Lord is our salvation. It shows us that the Lord is our salvation and not our Savior. It is a fact that the Lord is our Savior. But God showed David that the Lord is our salvation. The Lord is our Savior, but He is also our salvation; He is that very thing. The Lord Jesus is the things of God. He is God's matters and God's things. The Lord Jesus Himself is the very thing that God has given us.</p><p>I have no intention of remaining too long on the exposition of the Bible. I am merely laying a foundation. If you spend some time to consider God's Word, you will see that Christ is God's things. God has not only given Him to be our Savior and our Redeemer. He has not only given Him to be the Lord of sanctification and the Lord of righteousness. He has given us Christ to be our things. Righteousness is a thing, sanctification is a thing, and justification is a thing, or a matter. But Christ is these matters or things.</p><h2 class="head1">THERE BEING ONLY ONE PERSON<br />IN THE CHRISTIANITY OF LIFE</h2><p>You may ask, "Brother, why do you have to spend so much time on all this?" I must tell you that this is the very difference between a Christianity of life and a Christianity of behavior. There is a vast difference between these two kinds of ways. The gap between these two ways is very great. One is spiritual, and the other is not. One is of God, and the other is of man's mind. These are two entirely different things. If you study God's Word, you will find that there is only one person in His Word; there are not many things. There is only the person; there are not matters and things. There is only one person&mdash;the Lord Jesus. Other than this person, one cannot find any other matter or thing.</p><p>The biggest problem with God's children today is that the Christianity they know is a fragmented Christianity. One person receives a little grace. Another person receives a little gift. A third person picks up tongue-speaking, while a fourth person experiences some changes in his behavior. Some have love, some have endurance, and some have humility. You may consider this as Christianity. Indeed, this is the Christianity that man speaks of today. But actually, this is not Christianity. Christianity is just Christ. Christianity is not a gift; it is not Christ giving you something. Christianity is just Christ Himself. Can you tell the difference between the two? These are absolutely two different ways; they are two entirely different ways. Christianity is not Christ giving you something. Christianity is Christ giving Himself to you. The problem is that in today's Christianity, man thinks only in terms of Christ's gifts. When he was a sinner, Christ gave him grace and mercy. Now that he has become a Christian, Christ gives him endurance and Christ gives him humility and meekness. It seems as if Christ is giving him many things.</p><h2 class="head1">THERE BEING NO NON-PERSONIFIED<br />THINGS IN CHRISTIANITY</h2><p>In God's eyes, what is important is not the gifts of Christ. In God's eyes, He has given us Christ Himself. God has not given us humility or endurance; He has given us the whole Christ. Christ is becoming our humility, and Christ is becoming our endurance and meekness. It is Christ, the living Lord. This is Christianity.</p><p>Please remember that there are no non-personified things in Christianity. We must never receive a merely non- personified thing. In Christianity, all things are personified, and that person is Christ. In other words, our endurance is not a thing; our endurance is a person. Our sanctification is not an experience; our sanctification is a person, something personified. Our justification is not an experience; our justification is a person. Our righteousness is not an act; our righteousness is a person. Our redemption and deliverance are not something that we receive at one time; our redemption and deliverance are a person. Our endurance, humility, meekness, love, etc., are the Lord Himself; they are not things. This is Christianity. Christ is everything to the saints today. There is no need to wait for that day to come.</p><p>Many people ask how we can say that Christ is all. If you know the Christianity of life, you will acknowledge that He is all. He does not give all, rather He is all. These are two entirely different things.</p><p>Why is it that God's children fail so much today? They fail because they have only received a gift before the Lord; they have not received Christ. They have received fragmentary things before the Lord; they have not received the Christ God has given them. They have received only matters and things; they have not received a person. I do not know how much you have seen before the Lord. But I can say that when this question is resolved, all questions are resolved.</p><p>When we were saved, many of us heard God's Word, which says that He so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, so that we will not perish, but will have eternal life. When we heard such a word, we felt that we needed to be saved, and we went to God and prayed, "Lord, You have loved me and given Yourself to me. Can You give salvation to me also? You have become my Savior. Can You give me salvation also?" How foolish we were! We felt that having a Savior was not enough and that we needed salvation also! Many people have done this. And what do we do in our gospel preaching? We say that God has given us the Savior, yet when we repent, we pray, "God, grant me Your salvation." However, God has only one Son, and this Son is salvation. When we have the Savior, we have salvation. Do we still have to ask for salvation? Only a foolish man would say, "God, You have given me a Savior. Now please give me salvation."</p><h2 class="head1">"I AM..."</h2><p>Today we are Christians, and we are saved; God has given Christ to us to be our life. But we constantly ask for one thing after another; we ask for one, two, three, ten, fifty, a hundred, ten thousand, a million, and ten million things. We think that these individual things are important. But God shows us that Christ is our everything.</p><p>This is why God's Word shows us that Christ's name is "I am." Perhaps I should not be speaking so much of this matter outside the Bible; we should consider more of what the Bible says about this.</p><h2 class="head2">Food</h2><p>In the Gospel of John, the Lord said that He is the bread of life. We often ask God for food; we think that there is something called food. We are hungry, and we ask God, saying, "Please give us food." But it is so strange that those who ask for food never receive food. Those who ask for food are always hungry. Those who beg for food are the ones who are always hungry. I cannot say that I have been serving the Lord for many years. But I can at least say that I have been serving Him for some years. During these years, I have never met a person who asked for food who received it. You may say, "Does this mean that God's Word is wrong? Does not Luke 1:53 say that He will fill the hungry with good things?" I say, yes, it is true that the hungry ones will be filled with good things. But with what are the hungry ones filled? We have to realize that what fills us is not food, but Christ. We often feel hungry, and we have a need. We feel empty and believe that God has food. So we pray and hope to receive food. But we do not know how we can get the food. All we know is that we should contact the Lord, believe more, receive more, and enjoy more. But the amazing thing is that when we believe more, receive more, and look to Him more, we do not get the food that we hoped for, yet we are filled. We do not receive the food that we expected to receive. But through our looking to the Lord, and through contacting and receiving Him, we are filled. God's food is Christ. His food is not just food. God has no matters; His food is just Christ. The Chinese have an idiomatic expression "Chien-pien-yi-lu," which means "a thousand pages of the same thing." It is not a good thing to be all the same. But before the Lord, all the things of God are "a thousand pages of the same thing." No matter what we are seeking before the Lord, what He gives us is the same&mdash;Christ; He is "a thousand pages of the same thing." He is the One who meets our need; things do not meet our need.</p><h2 class="head2">Righteousness and Sanctification</h2><p>Many times, I can praise and rejoice for one reason only: my righteousness is not my conduct; my righteousness is a person, who is the Lord Jesus. Because the Lord Jesus has become my righteousness, every time I mention my righteousness, I can say that not only do I have righteousness or justification, but I can speak to my Righteousness, praise my Righteousness, and give glory to my Righteousness. Is this not a wonderful word? You may wonder how one can give glory to his righteousness. Yes, I often give glory to my Righteousness, because my Righteousness is the Lord Jesus. My sanctification is not my work. When I praise my Sanctification, I am not praising my work. No, I hate my work. Yet I can say that I praise my Sanctification, because my sanctification is my Lord. These are two entirely different things. Can you see this? It is not things but the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S TEARING DOWN AND HIS BUILDING UP</h2><p>We can find one fact in our spiritual experience. Some people have been Christians for one, two, three, five, or even twenty or thirty years. The strange thing is that when they first became Christians, they were very patient. But the more they went on as Christians, the more they could not control their temper, and the worse they became. I remember many people telling me that at the beginning, they were very patient; they could forgive, they could pray, and they could suffer any treatment from others. Others could treat them any way they wanted in school, at home, and at work. But now, they could not tolerate the same things anymore. In the past, they could do everything; now they cannot do them anymore. Sometimes they managed to hold back their temper, but something within them wanted revenge. We have seen too many examples of this kind. I can tell you a thousand, even ten thousand, stories like this one. Many people can testify that once they were humble, but they cannot be humble anymore. Once they were patient, but they cannot be patient anymore. Once they were loving, but they cannot be loving anymore. Once they were meek, but they have become stubborn. Once they were zealous, but they have become cold. They cannot explain this.</p><p>Brothers, we have to remember that God must take away everything that we have. When we first believed in the Lord, we felt that we lacked love, and we asked God for love. To put it in simple language, God gave us a "dose" of love, or a "packet" of love, so that we could love. It was a thing to us. We may have received plenty of these things. But God cannot allow love to remain forever as a thing in us; He has to put Christ into us. Therefore, He removes that love. Many people had a bad temper before they believed in the Lord; their temper was quick. After they picked up patience, patience became a thing, a gift, a salvation, or a spare part to them. As long as they had such a thing, they could work. During the first, second, and third year, these things may have served well. However, by the fifth year, or even as early as the third year, the situation began to change; the things themselves were gone. Today God is doing the same work in many of His children; He is removing all the things. Not only will He remove the worldly things; He will remove the spiritual things as well. Before you were saved, the matters and things of the world took the place of Christ. After you were saved, spiritual matters and things took the place of Christ. One day, God will show you that "Christ is all the world to you." Once God took away the things and matters of the world from you. Now he is taking away spiritual things and matters from you. He will take away your patience, your love, your power, your meekness, your humility, and everything that you have. He will show you that you do not live by patience but by a person. You will be patient because you have received a person, not because you have received a power. You will be humble, not because you have received a power, but because you have received a person. All the spiritual things have to go away. All the "its" have to go away.</p><p>For this reason, God's tearing down work, as well as His building work, goes on daily in many of His children. Daily "things" are torn down, and Christ is built up. This is the way God deals with His children. In the past, God might have given you a thing; He might have given you a power for endurance. You were so sure of this experience that you could almost write down the words: "My problem with endurance is over." Next you had to deal with humility, and God gave you another thing; He gave you the strength to humble yourself, and you were able to say that the problem of humility was also settled. When another thing is not settled, you pray daily before the Lord to try to solve it. You are always busy solving this and that problem. You are always trying to deal with this and that question. You are always dealing with individual problems. Brothers, God will take away many "things" from you; He will only give you One; He will only give you a person. This One will be your humility, your endurance, your meekness, and your love. He is the One who is. When you have Him, you can truly say, "God, You are the I am." This is Christianity. God is continually tearing down and building up. He will continue this work until one day we can say that Christ is everything. One day the universe will confess that Christ is everything. But first God wants us to confess within ourselves that Christ is everything.</p><p>Forgive me for speaking something about myself. I care much for many people and bear much of the responsibility for their spiritual condition. When I met a brother who was wrong, I often tried to exhort him. But I could only say, "Brother, you are lacking in love. Next time, you have to love your brother." He may have succeeded in loving, and I may have felt great that I saw some result to my work. But actually, what he acquired was love and not Christ. Love to that brother was not a person but a thing, a behavior. This is a Christianity of behavior. It is human conduct; it is man who is working, seeking, hoping, praying, believing, receiving, gaining, and acquiring something called love. This is why I say that love is only a thing and a behavior to him. But if that love is Christ, it is a totally different story. Christ alone is everything; it is not him. Christ is loving; it is not him who is loving. This makes love a law of life instead of an act of the will. This is a different kind of Christianity.</p><p>I do not know whether you have seen the difference. What do you feel when you render some help to a brother and open his eyes and help him to go on with the Lord? The most difficult thing we face today is that many people are merely involved in the things of Christianity; they do not know Christ and have not realized that God's thing is just Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SECOND STAGE OF KNOWING</h2><p>What does it mean to know Christ? I may say that knowing Christ is to know Him through matters and things. What does it mean to know Christ through matters and things? It means knowing that Christ is our matters and Christ is our things. Some people can say that they know Christ as their patience, Christ as their love, or Christ as their humility; this is knowing Christ. Once a person has this knowledge, he will have a thorough change. Once he has this change, he will say that his world does not consist of any thing anymore. I believe that some among us can say this, and some among us know what this means. In my world, my spiritual world, there are not many things. In my spiritual world, there is only Christ. I do not have any holiness; I only have Christ. But this does not mean that I am not holy; it means that Christ has become my holiness. If you have this experience, you will immediately see that Christ is the One who is. This is the focus of everything&mdash;Christ is the One who is. If you have this experience, you will be delivered from all the outward things. The only question now is whether or not you know Christ. It is not a question of prayer, exhortation, or encouragement.</p><p>I wish to see my co-workers paying more attention to this matter. It is not a matter of exhortation or encouragement. If you try to encourage someone, at the most you will stir him up to do something by himself. But the only thing that counts is God opening man's eyes to know Christ. Even if I could repeat the things I have said a hundred times, it would still be useless. If God opens our eyes to see that Christ is the one thing we lack, everything is solved. Many people know Christ as the Lord of justification, but they still fear God and do not know that Christ is their righteousness. Many people know Christ as the Sanctifier, but they are still not sanctified. This is because they think that they lack sanctification. They think that the Lord is the One who sanctifies them, and they ask Him to give them the strength to become sanctified; they want to be sanctified. But while they are doing this, they find that they cannot make it. They cannot do it; they cannot be sanctified. Then God opens their eyes and gives them the light to see that Christ is their sanctification. God is not asking them to be sanctified; He is not giving them the strength to be sanctified. Rather, Christ becomes their sanctification. Christ in them has become their sanctification. When this happens, all problems will go away because He will be the "I am." I can afford to lose my power. But I cannot afford to lose Christ. My sanctification is not something I do in myself. My sanctification is something He has done in me. Once I know what Christ is to me, all the problems are solved. Christ is the One who is. I have nothing else to say. I have only one thing to tell you: Christ is the One who is.</p><p>The problem is that although many of us know that Christ is our Lord, we do not know that Christ is our matters and things. All those who know Him only as the Redeemer, Justifier, Sanctifier, or any other "-er," only know His work; they do not know what He is. But God wants us to know Him as redemption, sanctification, and righteousness.</p><p>Let me ask a question: Is the Lord Jesus you know your Savior or your salvation? Is the Lord you know your Redeemer or your redemption? Is He your Liberator or your liberation? Is He your Sanctifier or your sanctification? Is He your Justifier or your righteousness. Those who know Him as the "-er," only know Him in a superficial way. Those who know Him as matters and things enter the second stage of their knowing of Him, and their knowing of Him is higher and deeper.</p><p>The problem among God's children is that there are too many things. When we know the Lord as the One who is, our things will become a person, and everything will be settled. Then God's purpose, which He intends to fulfill in eternity, will be fulfilled in us.</p><p>Whenever our holiness, redemption, regeneration, power, grace, and gift only remain as things, we are barely touching the periphery of Christianity. When we no longer see these things as things, but as the Lord Himself, we will begin to know God. Then we will begin to enter the goal of God's eternal purpose. From that point on, we will no longer see the many things of this world. We will see the Lord alone. He will become the One upon whom all the issues hinge.</p><p>This is why I said at the beginning that many people have things that are dead. Only when they understand what we are speaking of here will their things become personified. It is Him. Our regeneration is not a thing, but a person. We have a personified One, not a thing. Everything that I have is personified, because everything that I have is the Lord. First, the Lord leads us to know Him. Then He leads us to know that He is our things. When we are led to know Him as all things, we will be delivered from our own life, and we will be delivered even from the spiritual world and spiritual things. From that day on, we will truly say that the Lord is all and in all. We will truly say that He is everything in our living. If I am patient today, I am not the one who is patient, but Christ is my patience within me. When I love today, I am not the one who is trying to love. The power of love is not within me; rather, a person loves within me. If I can forgive today, it is not because I am forbearing, it is not because I have made any effort of my own, and it is not because I am capable. If I can forgive today, it is because there is One within me who is always forgiving. He is my forgiveness. We are humble not because we have told ourselves that we are too proud and that we have to be humble. We do not become humble by suppressing our pride or by making up our mind to be humble. Rather, a person is living out humility within us; He is our humility. This is why we can be humble. This is the law of life which we have been speaking of during the past few months. The law of life is nothing other than Christ becoming our things and Christ becoming our life.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, may the Lord open our eyes. We pray that He would truly open our eyes so that we would see. All things will eventually pass away, and only He will remain. Therefore, here in this place, we should only have Him alone.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">CHRIST ONLY&mdash;NOT MATTERS OR THINGS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 8:28; Col. 3:3-4; 1:16-20</h1><h2 class="head1">MAN'S THOUGHTS AND DEMANDS</h2><p>The first gift we received from God was the Son of God, who is Christ. But different people have different degrees of knowledge of God. Among God's children, some know the Lord Jesus as one of the many gifts of God, while others know Him as God's unique gift. Many people confess that the Lord Jesus is God's gift, which means that they recognize Him as God's unique gift. But many other people accept the Lord Jesus only as their first gift. Apart from the Lord Jesus, they still see many other gifts. There is the first gift, but there are also the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the tenth, the thousandth, and even the ten thousandth gift.</p><p>When many people believe in the Lord, they accept Him and they are saved. But after they are saved, they find that in spite of their salvation, they still have many shortcomings and needs.</p><p>Some people find that they have a quick temper. Although they are saved, they still have their temper. Some people find that they are very proud. Although they are saved, their pride still follows them. Many people find that they are weak and timid. Although they are saved, they are still timid.</p><p>Hence, among God's children, we very often find that after many believe in the Lord Jesus and are saved, they hope, ask, believe, and pray before the Lord, and subsequently receive many gifts. They regard the Lord Jesus as one of the many gifts. They consider the Lord Jesus as one from among many gifts of God; that is, He is only the first among many gifts.</p><p>It is very interesting that at the beginning of our pursuit of the Lord we see many needs in ourselves. We think that since we are Christians, we should not do this and that. We are very sure that we are genuine Christians, yet we still have many shortcomings. It does not matter what the shortcomings are; as long as there are shortcomings, we consider them as wrong, and we try all we can to deal with these shortcomings. For this reason, we pray before God, we hope, we believe, and we strive, and eventually we receive something. When this happens, it seems as though we have overcome our shortcomings, and we rejoice in our heart that we have acquired a gift.</p><p>In this circumstance, many of God's children begin to think that the purpose of God's gifts and grace is just to fill up our lack. When some people hear this, they may ask, "If God's grace is not here to fill up our lack, what is it for?" Many people think that God's grace is for filling up our lack. This is like a Bible that has two thousand pages. If it is short one page, we try to make up the missing page. This is what we do when we try to use God's grace to fill up our lack. In other words, we think that we are lacking just a part; we think that we are lacking only a little and that as long as we can fill up that little part, we will be perfect. Some have said that they lack five things, and as soon as they have the five things, they will be satisfied. Some have said that they lack ten things, and as long as they have the ten things, they will be satisfied. Some may say that they have love and that they only need a little more humility, a little more patience, or a few other things. As soon as they have these few things, they say that everything will be fine. Man's thought is merely one of lack and shortage. What does he do? He prays to God and asks God to give him what he lacks.</p><p>But the problem is that many of us have come to realize that what we think we lack before the Lord and what we ask for are merely things. Our lack and our prayers are all centered around the matters and the things; they are all individual, countable objects. We say that we lack this or that, and if God will fill up our lack, everything will be all right.</p><p>We lack patience. But what kind of patience are we looking for? Most of the time our eyes do not look to heaven. If our eyes did look to heaven, we would be looking upward. But most of the time, we cannot look upward; we can only watch and look at what is around us. We sigh and say that certain people are good but that we are not like them. What they have is patience, and what we have is a temper. What they have is meekness, but what we have is pride. We wish that we could be as patient and meek as they. Once I prayed to the Lord&mdash;it might have been my first prayer&mdash;that God would give me a Bible like the one I saw in a certain brother's hand. We can only pray for things that we see. We can only pray after we have seen something, and we can only pray for what others already have. We cannot pray for something from heaven which we have never seen. As a consequence, when we pray, we ask for patience like that of a certain person, or we ask for humility like that of another person. In our mind, we already have a picture of what humility is and what patience is.</p><p>If, when we were first saved, God had told us that He was going to pluck patience from a certain person and give it to us, would we not have been overjoyed? If we could have patience and humility on top of what we already had, we would have been satisfied and thought that we were perfect.</p><p>Patience is a thing to us; it is a thing that others possess. There is a certain thing called patience among the brothers and sisters, and we want it. We often hate ourselves, and we blame our parents for begetting us and giving us such a bad temper. We wish that we could be like certain persons, because they have something which we do not have. Many of God's children are after patience as a thing. They want something that will stop them from losing their temper. They think they need something called patience. With many people, patience is a thing. God has this thing, and it is found in many places on earth, but they do not have it. They think they need this thing, patience, so that they can become a patient person.</p><p>Here lies the basic difference between genuine Christianity and wrong Christianity. Many of God's children are looking for things which they think can be found everywhere except in themselves. They think that it is found in Mr. Chang, in Mr. Yu, in Mr. Hsu, or in this or that person, but not in them. They are pursuing after a thing that can be found on earth. This is Christianity in the mind of many. They are craving for and pursuing after things, and they have acquired things. Many people only acquire a thing; yet their heart rejoices and they thank the Lord because they have acquired it.</p><h2 class="head1">THERE BEING ONLY CHRIST IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD</h2><p>Many Christians have not seen that there are not many things in the spiritual world; there is only Christ. There is no patience in the spiritual world; there is only Christ. There is no humility, sanctification, or light in the spiritual world; there is only Christ. There are not many things in the spiritual world; only Christ exists.</p><p>The Lord has to do a fundamental work in us. This is what we need before the Lord. If you would not misunderstand me, I will say that we need a second salvation. In our first salvation, we saw that our need was Christ and not works. We saw that salvation was through Christ and not through work. Now we need another strong and thorough vision: we do not need things; we need Christ. We need to have an experience as thorough and strong as our first salvation, and we need to have as many things torn down as when we were first saved. When many people were first saved, many things were torn down, and they gained Christ. In the same way, many things need to be torn down in them today. The difference is that what was torn down the first time were sinful things, while the things that need to be torn down now are spiritual things. The first time their pride, jealousy, vainglory, temper, and other sins were torn down. Now their patience, humility, and so-called holiness need to be torn down. These things must be torn down before they will see that Christ is their life and that He is the One who is. This inward Christianity is absolutely different from the Christianity that man commonly believes in.</p><p>If you would not be offended, I would say an honest word to you. In the past, many brothers and sisters have come to talk with me and have asked me many questions. I could only say to them, "You may think that you are better than many people, but I am afraid that you will be the same as you are tonight for the rest of your life. You have many things. You have a great deal of patience and humility. You are a very capable and nice person. You are loving, helpful, and forgiving. You are willing to do this and that. Humanly speaking, it is hard to find a Christian like you. But I must speak an honest word: you only have things. You have to realize that what is truly spiritual before the Lord are not things, but the Lord Jesus Christ. What you are, what you can do, or what you have does not matter; only Christ matters. The only thing that has any spiritual value is what Christ has accomplished in you." In the spiritual world, there are not many things; there is only Christ. Christ is the matters and things of God.</p><h2 class="head1">TOUCHING CHRIST BEING TOUCHING LIFE</h2><p>Perhaps I can cover some practical experiences. Please excuse me for mentioning some of my personal experiences. During the past few days, a brother encountered an accident at home. Because of my responsibility, I should naturally have gone to visit him. By visiting him, I would be able to help him by expressing my personal concerns and also save myself a considerable amount of work later&mdash;we should either want to be a loving Christian or not want to be a Christian at all. But the strange thing is that when I resolved to visit the brother, I became colder and colder within while I was on the road. Nothing seemed to respond within me. I immediately knew that I was trying to perform an act of love. I was trying to perform an act of brotherly love, but as I was doing it, I touched death. It was the right thing to do. It was a good thing, but it was not Christ. I was doing it myself. After I did this, the result was an inward death. I touched death within, and I became cold. I touched an act; I did not touch life. This was an act of love, but I did not find the Lord in the act; I could only say that I was the one who loved. Every time we touch Christ instead of a work, we touch life. But every time we touch a work, we will surely die. Any time we try to do something by ourselves, we will surely die.</p><p>We have to see that Christianity is just Christ. The Christian life is just Christ. We should not pile a thousand good things together and call them the Christian life. Even if we put all the patience on earth, all the humility, and the myriads of good things together, we still could not make a Christian. If we put the myriads of things together, all we would see is a list of things; we would not see Christ.</p><p>A few years ago, my co-workers were always teasing me about "face-saving." I not only tried to save my own face, but others' faces as well. I do not like to expose others, and I do not like others to feel bad when they leave my house. I do not like to embarrass others by what I say. Before others feel any embarrassment, I become embarrassed for them already. I like being a gentle person, but when I try to be a good and gentle person before my brothers, something within often tells me that I am dead. I immediately become dead. There is no more life in me, and I touch death. The only reason for this is that gentleness is a thing; it is something that I have worked up. It is not Christ. This is why I immediately fall into death. I touch a corpse. I become weakened and powerless. Something within collapses and tells me that everything is lost.</p><p>The problem is that, in God's eyes, whenever we are involved with a thing, we find nothing but death in it. Once we just have a thing, we immediately touch death because what we have is not Christ. But if we touch Christ, we will immediately touch life because Christ is life.</p><h2 class="head1">ONLY THE TREE OF LIFE BEING LIVING</h2><p>We often become convicted in our work. Those who serve the Lord want to serve Him more. It is a good and right thing to serve the Lord. Our service to the Lord often demands that we suffer, sacrifice ourselves, and expend our energy and our money. But the strange thing is that when we do these things, we often do not touch life. Instead, we touch death, we become weakened, and we feel that something is wrong inside. Something within us tells us that we are wrong. Why are we wrong? While we are serving the Lord, while we are working and planning to do this and that for the Lord, we become weakened, and something within strongly rebukes us. Many times, the rebuke we suffer through sin is not as severe as the rebuke we suffer through doing many good things.</p><p>Many people think that the Lord within only rebukes them when they sin. But no! The Lord often rebukes us while we are doing good. The proper principle in God's eyes is not the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, but the principle of the tree of life. Being able to differentiate between good and evil is not enough. Everything hinges on life. All those who eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil will surely die the day they eat it; only the tree of life is living.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2><p>Among God's children, there are two kinds of Christian life. One kind is filled with things, and the other kind is just Christ. Outwardly, both kinds look equally good. One cannot detect much of a difference between the two. One talks about humility; the other also talks about humility. One talks about meekness, and the other also talks about meekness. One talks about love, and the other also talks about love. One talks about forgiveness, and the other also talks about forgiveness. Outwardly, both are more or less the same. They appear to be the same. But with one, we just have a list of things, while with the other, we have Christ. In reality, the two are entirely different.</p><h2 class="head1">WITH CHRIST, THERE BEING THE NEED OF THE CROSS</h2><p>I would like to point out that when we have things, we do not need the cross anymore. With Christ, there is the need of the cross. The cross restricts us not only from sin, but from our own activity as well. The cross not only tells us that we should not sin, but forbids us from our own activities. The problem with God's children is that they think everything is fine as long as they do something well. They have not seen that the good things are only things. God cares for Christ. Christ is the very good thing. He is the life. If He does not move, we cannot move. It is easy for us to say many comforting words to others. But if He has not said them, we should not, because once we do, we will touch death; we will be inwardly weakened and deflated, and we will collapse. We can help others in many ways. We can be very gentle, and others may consider us nice men. But when we act this way, something within us collapses, and we become weakened. Here we see the need of the cross. The many things we gain through good works do not require the cross. When we allow the Lord to live in us to be our everything, and when He becomes our things, we need the cross. When He does not move, we cannot move. We have to ask the Lord to deliver us from good and righteous acts as much as we ask Him to deliver us from sins. It is easy for us to ask God to deliver us from sins, because we have condemned sins already. But it is not easy to be delivered from the natural life, because many of us have not condemned the natural life in us. We have not seen the natural life, and we have not rejected it.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE HEALING</h2><p>What does it mean for Christ to be our matters and things? What is the significance of having Christ as our matters and things? I think we can draw a good analogy from our physical body. Many people are very weak physically. They ask God to heal them. We find three kinds of results or three kinds of faith in this asking. Some people believe that God is their Healer. Others believe that God will give them health and heal them. But a third group believes that God is their healing.</p><p>How does a person pray when he has an illness? What does he seek after? He expects God to be his Healer. God is living, and he wants God to be his Healer, to touch him with His power, to be his Physician and demonstrate His healing power and healing ability. If this is the case, his God is as far from him as his doctor is from him. I wonder if you have heard what I said. This is a crucial word. Many people want God to be their Healer, but the distance between God and such people is as great as the distance between them and their earthly doctors.</p><p>Other people are a little bit better. They want God to heal them and give them health. Then one day God heals them, and they recover. Many people pray, make supplications, and expect healings. But why are they continually weak? There are still many weak ones among us today. Many people expect God to be their Healer or to heal them. But having God as the Healer and being healed are outward experiences; they are merely things.</p><p>What is the result of these experiences? Many times God is willing to heal us. I am not saying that God will not heal us. God can deal with little children this way. But many times, He will not deal with us this way. When we first believed in the Lord, God might have been willing to be our Healer, and He might have been willing to heal us. But after we have believed in Him for a while, He will put us in His hands, and He will educate us and teach us. Then God will no longer be our healer and will no longer heal us. God reserves the best for those whom He considers the best; He becomes healing to them. He does not give them healing, but becomes healing to them. He does not become the healing God to them; He becomes the living God who is healing to them. God is our healing. I do not know how to put this in any better way. I can only say this most reverently before the Lord, that Christ is our healing.</p><p>The trouble is that many people only see healing as a thing. They think that this is something apart from Christ and that everything is over after He has performed the healing. You may remember the story of the woman who touched Christ and how He felt the power go out from Him. The Bible says that He perceived that power had gone out from Him (Luke 8:46). I take the liberty to make this word more plain by saying that Christ Himself went out. He was not performing a healing. Rather, He was the healing. When He became the healing, men were healed.</p><p>We often may be weak and may still have physical ailments. But we can lift up our head and say to the Lord, "Lord, I do not expect You to be my Healer, only to go away after my sickness is gone. I do not expect You to heal me, and then find You gone even though the healing remains. Lord, I expect You to be my healing. It is true that You are my Healer, but I want You to be the Healer in me. It is true that You are my healing, but I want my healing to be something personified. My healing should be a person; it should be something personified. It is a person who becomes my health." God becomes my health. Christ becomes my health. Is there a difference between being healed and knowing Christ as my healing? The difference is great! When I learned this lesson, I found that I not only possessed something called healing, but I possessed a person who has become life to my body. Once I saw this, all problems were solved, and I saw that my body has much to do with the Lord. When I have a problem with the Lord, my body immediately has a problem with Him. If He wants to put us through His test or do anything else to us, there is nothing that we can do to resist Him. Everything that we have depends on the Lord. We can only look to Him; we can do nothing. This is absolutely different from making healing a thing.</p><p>I thank the Lord for healing me many times. I can say that I was sick on a certain day of a certain month of a certain year, and God healed me on a certain day of a certain month of a certain year. I can tell you many stories about how I was healed at a certain hour of a certain day in a certain month and a certain year. I can count many cases of healing. But those healings were small healings. They were isolated things, and they can be counted. Whether there is one case, two cases, ten cases, or twenty cases, they can be counted. But I can also tell you another story, that at a certain hour of a certain day in a certain month and certain year, God opened my eyes to see that Christ is my healing. This is something that cannot be repeated; it is something that cannot be quantified. Once is enough. It is not a thing that can be counted. It is a person, a personified healing. My healing is a person who is in me as my healing all the time. Praise the Lord that this is a fact. Having God heal me and having Him as my healing are two entirely different things. One is a thing; the other is a person.</p><p>Paul was not healed, but he received the healing. Can we see the difference between these two? Paul showed in 2 Corinthians 12 that he was not healed (v. 9). He did not receive the thing which we call healing. But with Paul, we see One who was his healing continually. His weakness remained with him, but his healing also remained with him. His weakness was chronic, but his healing was abiding. What is a healing? To us, a healing is the removal of something. No, healing is not a removal; healing is acquiring something. Healing is not the removal of weakness but the presence of strength.</p><p>When I first saw this matter, the light came very slowly because my mind was filled with things; everything around me was a thing. I did not realize that the Lord wanted to be my thing, and I did not know that healing was not a thing. I only knew that the Lord promised me something; I did not know that the Lord wanted to be my healing. I only knew about the Lord's promise; I did not know about the Lord as my healing. One day I read Paul's story in 2 Corinthians. It was very strange to me. It would have been an easy thing for the Lord to grant him the healing. Removing the thorn was as easy for the Lord as a doctor removing germs. But why did the Lord not heal Paul? I prayed about this, and while I was praying, the Lord showed me one thing. In 1923 Brother Weigh invited me to preach at a certain place. In order to get there, I had to take a little boat along the Min River. The boats often became stuck to the riverbed because the water was too shallow and the rocks were big. The boat owner often had to tug the boat along. While I was praying, this scene suddenly appeared in my mind. I said, "God, it would be easy for You to remove the rocks. Would it not be wonderful if You removed the rocks, and the boat floated on the water instead?" I read 2 Corinthians 12 and realized that this was exactly how Paul prayed. The water was too shallow, and the rocks were exposed conspicuously; Paul prayed that God would remove the rocks so that he could sail on the water once again. But God answered by saying that He would not remove the rocks. Instead, He caused the water level to rise. When the water rises, the boat can pass over the rocks. This is what God is doing. Our problem and our prayer are that we are only for a thing&mdash;healing. But His answer is for Him to be our healing. When He is present, we can glide over our problems. Paul's weakness was still there; he did not use his own strength to fight it. If he fought with his own strength, he could only say that his own strength had tabernacled over him. But it was the power of Christ which tabernacled over him (v. 9). It was God who was working. There is a basic difference here. One is God giving me a thing, and the other is God Himself becoming my thing. God in me becomes the thing that I need. God Himself is that very thing.</p><h2 class="head1">"THINGS" CANNOT GO ON FOREVER</h2><p>The same is true with spiritual things. What do many people desire and seek after? They are after a "thing." Many sisters have come to me and said that they want patience. I often felt that the word "patience" was too small to them. They wished they could be patient. They thought it would be wonderful if God gave them a dosage of patience and they took it and became patient. They sought patience. This is a dosage to them, and it will last for three to five days. But there is an expiration date on it. After a while, the word "patience" becomes smaller and smaller, until one day the word runs out. If it is a thing, there is always a day when it will run out. Even if it is something one receives through prayer, it will still run out. Sometimes to answer His children's immediate need and to accommodate their foolishness, God answers their prayers. But God does not answer such prayers all the time. He will not go on this way forever.</p><p>In God's world, there are not many "things." Christ is all and in all. God only has Christ. He cannot allow patience, humility, or love to continue to exist as things by themselves on this earth forever. What does He want in the end? In the end He wants to show us that Christ is patience, Christ is humility, and Christ is love. He gives Christ, not "things." One day when our relationship with the Lord becomes proper, the matter of patience will be settled. It is a matter of Christ, not a matter of patience. Once our relationship with Christ is normalized to the degree that God expects it to be, the matter of patience will be settled, the matter of pride will be settled, and ten thousand other matters will also be settled. The issue is Christ; the issue is not "things."</p><h2 class="head1">THE KNOWING OF CHRIST</h2><p>Hence, in God's eyes everything depends on how we know Christ. What does it mean to know Christ? Some people know Christ as their love. Others know Christ as their humility. Some know Christ more, while others know Him less. Whatever "thing" you know Christ to be, that "thing" becomes your proper knowledge of Christ. This is the meaning of knowing Christ. The "knowledge of Christ" is not an abstract term; it is not something objective. Our knowing of Christ is positive and substantial. We know Christ by knowing Him as the various "things"; we know that He is this to us or that He is that to us.</p><p>Some of you can stand up and testify, "I did not know what it was to be clean, because everything with me, from my heart to my head and thoughts, was all unclean. But thank the Lord that Christ has become my cleanliness. God has made Him cleanliness to me." You can see immediately that this "thing" is not something that you have; this "thing" is Christ. When Christ lives in you, He brings this "thing" along with Him. It is something that He brings along with Him; it is not something that you have in yourself. This is genuine Christianity.</p><p>I must say bluntly that unless a child of God has his eyes opened to see that Christ is his things, he is not of much use, because all that he has is behavior. He is always the one who is doing the works. Even if he prays and God gives something to him, he only has temporary things that have no spiritual value in God's eyes at all.</p><p>To some people, grace from God comes in the form of separate individual things. To others, who also have the experience of grace, their grace comes in the form of a person, who is the Son of God. One day you will say to God, "I thank You and praise You because the grace I have received is Christ. My grace is a person; it is something personified." When you can tell the difference between these two things, you can tell the difference between life and death. Many brothers can only differentiate between right and wrong; they cannot differentiate between life and death. They can only differentiate between what is good and what is bad. There is only one simple explanation for this: they do not see that everything is in Christ. He, the person, is the matter. He, the person, is the thing. In the spiritual realm, there is only Christ; there are not many matters or things.</p><p>If God opens your eyes one day, you will see that this and that are things as soon as you touch them. This is very strange, yet it is very real. A man may be full of many things. He may be patient, meek, humble, faithful, loving, warm, forgiving, and merciful; he may be filled with many things. But what you see is only a big pile of things. You can at least tell the difference between a man's ring and his finger. You can at least tell the difference between a man's hat and his head, his glasses and his eyes, or his clothes and his body. If you can tell the difference between these things, you should be able to tell the difference between a thing and Christ. If you have never seen this, you will be surprised by what I am saying. But if you have seen this, you will see that this is a simple matter. Everything that is a thing is dead in itself, and outwardly it produces nothing but death. It is dead in itself, and when you perform this thing, if you have any spiritual sense at all, you will feel dead as well. While you are doing it outwardly, you sense that the result is death and not life.</p><p>The only thing you can say about certain persons is that they are very good, that they are nice men. You can only see good and evil in them; you cannot see anything spiritual in them. You can only say that some brothers are good, that they are nice men, that they have a good temper, that they are patient, and that they can suffer and deny themselves. That is all you can say. If patience, suffering, self-denial, humility, and love are only things, you may love them, but the minute you touch them, you are deadened within, and something collapses within you. There is a reaction against these things. Life has a strong reacting power. Sometimes a person says a very nice word, yet it is something that should not have been said, and there is immediately a very violent reaction within you against it. Take the prayer meeting as an example. What does it mean for you to say amen? It means that you are touched by life. When a brother prays, and the prayer touches your life, spontaneously you respond with an amen from within. Other prayers may be very earnest; the words may be very nice and the tone very loud, yet the more the prayer goes on, the colder you feel within. You wish that the prayer would stop because the prayer is exactly like the person who prays. There may be a thing, but it brings nothing but death. Just as a thing is dead in you, it is also dead in others. Things have no spiritual value at all, because man is doing all the work.</p><p>If what we have said is true, there is nothing more we can do before the Lord. We can only look to Him; we cannot do anything or perform any work. Brothers and sisters, we should realize more and more that works are abominable in the eyes of God. If we are truly led by the Lord to go on in this way, we will surely find out one thing: God hates sin, and He also hates behavior. When man sins, God says he will perish. When man behaves, God says he cannot be saved. God rejects behavior as much as He rejects sins. God only accepts one thing: His Son Jesus Christ. Only what Christ has done in us counts. Thank God that it is Him and not us. It is not we who are humble, but He. It is not we who love, but He. He does not give us the power; He is our power.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, I do not know what to say. I hope that the newly saved ones would pay special attention to this matter. As soon as you are delivered from the spiritual things, you will touch the Lord. The sooner you are delivered, the better it will be. The more you procrastinate, the more you will not see. Those who have many things piled upon them cannot see easily. God will have to do a great deal of work in chastising you and putting you down before He can take many things away from you and before you will take Christ. Nevertheless, as you advance somewhat in your Christian life, God will take things away day by day so that He can give you Christ.</p><p>I hope that this day will come. One day all the things in heaven and on earth will be headed up in Christ. One day God's Word will be fulfilled, and Christ will be all. Those who do not know that Christ is all today can never expect that Christ will be all. Today Christ is all my things already. He is already all things to me. God has given us His Son already. He has given us Himself. This is what He has given us. Today Christ has to be all in us. There must be no difference between Christ and things. Nothing can be considered a spiritual thing in itself. Only Christ is all. All things are Christ. Christ is all and in all. This has to start in the church; it has to start with us today. We can declare that He is all because we know and acknowledge that He is all. We can also declare that He is in all. He is in our patience, He is in our meekness, and He is in our love because He is in all. One day (and we hope that that day will quickly come) God's Son will be all and will head up all things because He is all and in all! In that day, we will know that what we learned today is for that day. May the Lord bless all of us!</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYER</h2><p>O Lord, we pray for grace before You. Lord, we confess that our eyes are blind; we do not see clearly enough. We know about things, but we do not know Christ. Our Lord seems so far away from us. The things seem so real to us, while Christ does not seem real to us. Lord, we pray that You would open our eyes so that Christ would become real to us, so that the things will pass away and life will fill us. Lord, we pray for deliverance from the many things, so that we can know the Lord as a person. May the Lord who is our person become our things so that everything in us becomes living and full of life, and so that others would see Christ when they see the things. Lord, we know that these two ways are entirely different. How different is the sinner's way from the way of the righteous. In the same manner, how different is the way of a genuine Christian from that of a false Christian. Many things need to be broken. You have to break us. Do not allow us to deceive ourselves, to think that we have seen it when we have not seen it, to think that we have touched the right way when we really have not touched it, to think that we are full of life when we are full of behavior, and to think that we are full of Christ when we are full of things. Lord, touch us. Lord, build up Yourself in us in a powerful way so that everything within and without us is just Christ, just Yourself.</p><p>Lord, bless these words so that they would bear fruit and would bring men back to Yourself in a rich way. May You utter what man cannot utter. May You cover man's weakness and forgive man's foolishness. May You gain something among us. We need to be laid bare. May tonight be the night when many are laid bare, when they see themselves as You see them. May a little light enter us, and may it shine through all falsehood and all performance so that we would see the replacements and everything that is not You. Bless Your own word, and glorify Your name. In the name of the Lord Jesus, amen.</p><h1 class="title">CHRIST BECOMING OUR WISDOM</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:30</h1><p>The Bible speaks of Christ as our life in many ways. But the meaning of the words "Christ is our life" is not that simple. First Corinthians 1:30 explains what Christ as our life means. This passage can be divided into two sections. The first section says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus." This speaks of our relationship with Christ. The second section says, "Who became wisdom to us from God." This speaks of Christ's relationship with us. Putting it another way, this verse speaks of how we are in Christ and also how Christ is in us. We must pay attention to these two things. Some Christians emphasize only the first of these two aspects, while others emphasize only the second aspect. Whether one emphasizes the first aspect or the second, any bias will result in problems and sickness to our Christian life. We must have a proper knowledge of both aspects. We must know how we can be in Christ and how Christ can be in us.</p><p>God has given us the Lord Jesus. His purpose is not for Him to be our teacher or a pattern that we follow, but for us to take Him as our life, so that His life can be manifested through us. If we do not have the life of Christ, we cannot be a Christian. If we have the life of Christ but do not know how this life has become our life, we cannot be a proper Christian and readily manifest His life. How then can we have Christ as our life? This is a very basic question. The Lord Jesus is God, and He is also a man. How can we have Him as our life? This seems to be impossible. We can never solve this problem. Only God can solve this problem. God is able to do what man cannot do. First Corinthians 1:30 tells us that this work has been accomplished by God alone. If God had not done this work, it would have been impossible for Christ to become our life. The first part of this verse says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus." The first part of the work was done by God. The second part says, "Who became wisdom to us from God." The second part of the work was also done by God. We cannot make the Lord Jesus our wisdom; He "became wisdom to us from God." Hence, Christ as our life is something that God Himself has done. Whether it is the first or the second part, nothing is possible apart from God, and nothing will be accomplished apart from God. God has made Christ our life.</p><h2 class="head1">IT BEING OF GOD THAT WE ARE IN CHRIST JESUS</h2><p>God wants Christ to be our life. But how did He begin to do this? God did not first put Christ's life into us. Rather, He first put us into Christ. God first put us into Christ, and then put Christ into us. The first thing that God wants to do is build up our relationship with Christ. If we do not have a relationship with Christ, we cannot have Christ come into us to be our life. First we are in Christ, and then Christ can be in us. This is God's order of work.</p><p>Why did God put us in Christ? He put us there because we are sinful; we have the Adamic life within us. We are sinful and have the Adamic life in us; therefore, we must first be dealt with, before God can give us a new life. God cannot carry out this dealing in us directly. If He carried it out in us directly, we would die; we would not be able to live. If God dealt with our sins directly, there could be no other way and no other result than eternal death.</p><p>On the one hand, God wants to deal with our sins and our Adamic life. On the other hand, He does not wish to see us die. What then did He do? He put us in Christ by the operation of the might of His power. As a result, whatever He has done to Christ becomes His dealing with us. We are all included in Christ. Whatever God has done in Christ becomes His work in us. When God dealt with Christ, the result was the same as if He had dealt with us. This is the basic biblical truth concerning the Lord Jesus being our Savior.</p><p>God told Adam in the garden of Eden that when he disobeyed God's commandment and ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he would receive a judgment from God. What was the judgment? God declared to Adam, "For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" (Gen. 2:17). It is a sin to eat the fruit forbidden by God, and the day that one sins, he will die. Death is the punishment for sin. If a man sins, he will suffer punishment. "For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." This means that those who sin will surely die. If a man sins, he will surely die. It is better for man not to sin. Once he sins, death will be the sure result. Sin is a fact which cannot be overturned, and death is the inevitable result of sin; it is also something which cannot be overturned. What then should be done? On the one hand, God has to put us to death completely. On the other hand, He must cause us to live. This is the only way to salvation. Thank the Lord that He has established a salvation for us. This salvation involves sending a Savior to die on our behalf. This is why Christ had to be born. If Christ had not been born, He could not have died for us. Without the flesh, there could not have been the vicarious death. Christ became flesh, and therefore, He could die for us. Through His death, He bore our punishment and became our salvation. How could Christ die for us? He could die for us because God put us into Christ. God put us all into Christ; this is the most crucial teaching in the whole Bible. We cannot fathom and do not understand how God exercised His power and authority to put us into Christ. All we know is that 1 Corinthians 1:30 tells us clearly that "of Him you are in Christ Jesus." "Of Him [God]" means that this is something that God has done.</p><p>What does it mean for us to be in Christ? I will explain this with an illustration. Peking produces a certain kind of lacquer box with a number of boxes being in a set. Each box in the set fits into another one. Outwardly there is only one box. But when one opens up the box, there are more boxes inside that one box; within the big box are the smaller boxes. This is the way we are in Christ. Our being in Christ is in contrast to Christ being in us. We are all descendants of Adam, and we were all in Adam. Adam is like the big box, while we were like the small boxes. The many small boxes come out of that one big box. Out of the one Adam, we were produced. When one is opened, there are many. We are the many. When we put the many into the one, we see only the one. From our side, there are many individuals. We are the many individuals. From God's side, we are only one man in Adam. This is like the many small boxes contained in the one big box. Outwardly there is only one box. Because we are all in Adam, "the disobedience of one man" constituted many sinners. Because we are all one in Adam, every one of us is condemned. God saved us according to the same principle. He has put us all into Christ, and "through the obedience of the One the many will be constituted righteous." Because we are one in Christ, we have all received justification of life (Rom. 5:18-19). God considers all of us as one person in Adam. In the same way, He considers all of us as one person in Christ. Adam is like one big box, while Christ is like a second big box. God has taken us out of the first big box and put us into the second big box. We are one in the first big box&mdash;Adam, and we are one in the second big box&mdash;Christ. The Bible calls the Lord Jesus "the second man" and "the last Adam" (1 Cor. 15:47, 45). The Lord Jesus is the last Adam, and God has included all of us in Him.</p><p>When Jesus of Nazareth was living as a man on earth, He was the unique One. But when He went to the cross, God included us all in Him.1 Therefore, when Jesus of Nazareth was crucified, that cross was not only His cross, but our cross as well. Because God put us into Christ, the cross is no longer just His cross, but a cross in which all those who are in Him have a part. We must realize that the cross of Christ is also our cross. If God had not put us into Christ, we would have nothing to do with the cross. Since God put us into Christ, we have a great deal to do with the cross. Thank and praise God that when Christ was crucified, we were included in Him. Since we are included in Him, His experience on the cross becomes our experience. This is what Romans 6:6 means when it says, "Our old man has been crucified with Him."</p><p>If we are not in Christ, we cannot be crucified together with Christ. Consequently, someone has said, "If we are not in Christ, we cannot be with Christ." This is a spiritual word as well as a scriptural word. We must remember that in order for us to be with Him, we have to be in Him. If we are not in Him first, we cannot be with Him. This is our fundamental faith, and we must be clear about it.</p><p>"But of Him you are in Christ Jesus." This is absolutely something that God has done. Yet we did not know this. In order for us to know, there was the need for the church to preach the gospel. The church announces to men this earth-shaking fact, that God has put men into Christ; when the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, God judged Him, and men were also judged in Him. Therefore, judgment is over as far as men are concerned. This is the gospel. The gospel tells us that God has done something in Christ. It tells us that God has included us in Christ. When He dealt with Christ, He also dealt with us. We have been dealt with in Him already. God has solved the problem of sin as well as the problem of ourselves. Thank the Lord that we died in Christ. This is why Romans 6:11 says, "So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus."</p><p>We are dead in Christ Jesus. What do we do after we hear such a fact? We are persons with a will. After we believe in this fact, we should have some kind of expression. Therefore, we want to be baptized after we believe in the Lord and are saved. What is the meaning of baptism? Being baptized is being in Christ Jesus and being in His death (Rom. 6:3-4). In other words, God has put us into Christ, but we have to do something to show others that we are in Christ. Our baptism demonstrates to others the way we get into Christ. When we are baptized into the water, do we remain in the water? No, we come out of it quickly. Our coming out of the water signifies that we have been resurrected with Christ. Whoever comes out of the water testifies that he has resurrected. Hence, our baptism is a reenactment of the work that God accomplished for us in Christ. It is a performance to show others what God did for us in Christ. This is a spiritual performance.</p><p>When Christ was on the cross, God put us in Christ and terminated the old man in Adam. God had to terminate Adam; that account had to be settled and closed. We were men in Adam, and we could only be delivered from Adam through death. When we are joined to the death of Christ, we are terminated and delivered from Adam. This is the first aspect of God's work. The second aspect of God's work is to put Christ into us. First Corinthians 1:30 says, "Who became wisdom to us from God."</p><h2 class="head1">"WHO BECAME...FROM GOD"</h2><p>We have spoken of our being in Christ. Now we will speak on Christ being in us. How can Christ be in us? Christ is in us because of resurrection. Because the Lord Jesus has resurrected and because He is now in the Holy Spirit (He is not merely a man, but a man in the Spirit), He can be in us. The Lord said that His flesh is meat indeed and His blood is drink indeed. He can be eaten by us (John 6:53-56). If He were still a man like He was when He was on earth, He could not be eaten by us. We eat the fruit of the tree of life; we do not eat the tree of life itself. We cannot eat the tree; there is no way we can take the tree into us. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was like the tree of life; there was no way for us to take Him into us. In the same way, there is no way for us to take a person into us today. If the Lord Jesus were not a resurrected Lord, if He were only a Lord who once lived on the earth, He could only be Himself forever, while I could only be myself forever. There would be no way for us to receive Him. It would not matter how holy and lovely Jesus of Nazareth was; there would be no way for us to receive Him, because He would only be a man. But thank the Lord that He is not only a man today; He has died and resurrected. In the Holy Spirit, He has become the Lord whom we can receive. The Holy Spirit is the Lord's coming in another form (14:16-20). Another name for the Holy Spirit is "the Spirit of Jesus" (Acts 16:7). He is also called "the Spirit of Christ" (Rom. 8:9). When the Lord Jesus put on the Holy Spirit, He became a "receivable" Lord. If He had not become such a Lord, we would not be able to enjoy Him. Christ has resurrected and put on the Holy Spirit. When we receive the Holy Spirit, we receive Christ; in the same way, when we receive the Son, we receive the Father. When men in the past saw the Father, they saw the Son; in the same way, when men know the Spirit today, they know the Son. The Lord Jesus has resurrected, and He is in the Holy Spirit. Therefore, we can receive Him into us to be our life. All those who have received the Lord Jesus, whether they are clear or not, have received this experience from God.</p><p>God has put us into Christ. This is the first thing. The second thing is that He has made Christ our wisdom. Neither of these two things have been done by us. We cannot get into Christ by ourselves, and we cannot put Christ into us. Both things could only be accomplished by God.</p><p>Christ became wisdom to us from God. What does this mean? First I would point out the proper punctuation for the second part of 1 Corinthians 1:30. According to the original language, there should be a colon after the words "wisdom to us from God." This means that wisdom includes the following three things: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. First Corinthians 1&mdash;3 speaks of God's wisdom and man's wisdom. Wisdom is the subject, and righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are the explanation of how Christ becomes our wisdom.</p><p>What does this verse mean? In order to understand this verse, we must first consider what life is. Suppose a temptation comes and stirs you up. You know that you have to be patient. But where does this patience come from? Your life supplies you with patience. You need to have life before you can exercise your patience. When you do not have life, you are dead, and there is no way for you to practice patience. You must supply and sustain your patience with life. Suppose you realize that laziness is wrong, and you want to be diligent. If you are diligent, your life is making you diligent. Suppose a man has encountered hardships, and you think that you should love him and help him. Where does this love come from? It is your life that compels you to love. Therefore, the inward reaction that is produced every time we encounter something is the result of the flow of life. These reactions originate from your life. The source of power for these reactions is life. Without life there can be no reaction. We only react when there is life. Every moment of our life we are dealing with things, and every moment we have reactions. We deal with the demands of the outward world moment by moment with our life. Moment by moment we are exercising our life.</p><p>God has not given us Christ so that He could just die for us on the cross; He has given Christ to us to be our life. Originally, we react to all the demands that are outside of us by exercising our own life; we act according to our own life. If our own life is strong enough, we make it. If our own life is not strong enough, we do not make it, or worse, we collapse. We react with our own life and deal with outward matters with our own life. But God has given Christ to us to be our life. Before we received the Lord Jesus, we lived by ourselves. After we receive the Lord Jesus, God wants Him to live inside of us and live for us. When the Lord Jesus becomes our life within, we do not have to live by our original life. It is not a matter of the Lord Jesus giving us commands, suggestions, or teachings and then us carrying them out. Rather, He becomes our life within and carries things out for us. From now on, we should live by His life. Formerly, we responded to outward demands with our own life. Now we should allow Christ's life to respond to them.</p><p>After understanding the meaning of Christ being our life, we now come to the question of Christ becoming our wisdom from God. Brothers and sisters, you have been a Christian for many years. Do you have anything other than your own wisdom? Have you received the Lord Jesus as your wisdom? Has the Lord Jesus been your wisdom once? How much have you known the Lord Jesus? This is the basic question, and we must be clear about it. This verse does not say that the Lord Jesus gives us wisdom; it does not say that God has given us the Lord Jesus' wisdom. It does not say that we understand and know how to speak or act, even though we were once foolish, because God has given us wisdom. No, the Bible does not say this. The Bible says that Christ became wisdom to us from God. The word "became" is very important, and there is no better word than this word. We can take the story of Moses and Aaron as an example. Moses was afraid of speaking to the Israelites; he was afraid because he was not eloquent. He said that he was slow of speech and of a slow tongue; therefore, he dared not go. What did God say? He said, "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?...He shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth" (Exo. 4:14, 16). Does this mean that when Aaron became Moses' mouth, Moses became eloquent? No, Aaron only became Moses' mouth, but Moses was still Moses. (Of course, Moses spoke later. But that is a different story.) When Moses' eloquence failed, he could ask Aaron to speak for him. This is the meaning of Aaron becoming Moses' mouth. Aaron became Moses' mouth. The eloquence was still with Aaron; it was not with Moses. Moses needed Aaron to be the mouth, because his own mouth did not work as well. It does not mean that after Moses took Aaron as his mouth, his own mouth became eloquent.</p><p>After we see the meaning of Aaron becoming the mouth of Moses, we see the meaning of Christ becoming wisdom to us from God. It does not mean that Christ has made us wise. Rather, it means that we are foolish, but we allow the Lord to become our wisdom while we do not move. Originally, when there were demands from the outside, we reacted with our own life. Today when there are demands from the outside, we know that we cannot make it and should not react anymore. What then should we do? We should allow the Lord's life to react. It is not a matter of becoming better in ourselves; it is a matter of the Lord living on our behalf. Moses' mouth did not improve. Rather, Aaron became his mouth for him and spoke instead of him. Christ being our wisdom is like Aaron speaking on Moses' behalf. Suppose you are going to speak to someone. What are you going to do when you cannot say what you want to say? You may ask another one who has come with you to speak for you. You cannot speak yourself, and you ask him to speak; he meets the demand. While he is speaking, your mouth remains dumb; it has not improved, and you are still the same as before. We must never think that when Christ becomes our wisdom, we become wise. We must remember that even when Christ has become our wisdom, we can still do nothing in ourselves.2</p><p>Galatians 2:20 says, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me." This is a fact. This shows us how a Christian should live. He should live by not doing anything by himself, but by allowing Christ to do everything. In other words, let Aaron speak and Moses be quiet. Some people are not eloquent, yet they need to speak. What do they do? They ask you to speak for them. But while you are speaking, they are not satisfied; they interrupt with a word or two. This makes it very difficult for you. If Moses' mouth could not speak, he should take Aaron's mouth as his mouth. Thank the Lord that this is God's way of salvation. God did not change Moses' mouth; rather, He gave him a new mouth. God does not change a person's mouth; He gives him another mouth. God does not change a foolish man into a wise man; rather, He causes Christ to become wisdom to the foolish man. Brothers and sisters, this is salvation. God has not changed foolish men into wise; rather, He has made Christ our wisdom; Christ has become wisdom to us from God.</p><p>Suppose a matter needs great wisdom to handle and settle it. You may try this way and that way in vain; your little mind may be exhausted, yet you still cannot come up with a solution. Then you say, "Lord, I am foolish. If it is left up to me to do, I will surely not be able to make it. I can only look to You. You do it for me." After you have trusted in the Lord this way, the Lord may direct you to do something, say something, or take some action, and you may not even be aware of the great wisdom involved in doing these things. But after you have done them, one day you will say, "What I did that day was not something that I could have done by myself. What I said that day was not something that I could have said by myself." This means that you have not changed at all; it was the Lord who became your wisdom. This is Christ becoming wisdom to you. Originally, we had to handle things by ourselves, yet we could not handle them. So we allowed Christ to be our wisdom. We have to remember that Christ's wisdom does not become our wisdom. In addition, Christ is not giving us wisdom so that we can become wise. Instead, Christ in us is becoming wisdom to us. Wisdom belongs to the Lord and not to us. He is our wisdom; He is becoming our wisdom. Brothers and sisters, if we know what it means for Christ to "become," we can live a proper life before the Lord.</p><p>We have previously said that Christ becoming our wisdom means three things: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. What do these things mean? Let us first consider righteousness. Then we will speak on the other two.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Becoming Our Righteousness</h2><p>We need righteousness before God. Righteousness has a great deal to do with God. If we did not have to stand before God, the question of righteousness would not come in. Once we think about God, we think of righteousness. For example, when we have to meet people, we always think of our dress. In the same way, when a man meets God, he must have righteousness. Without righteousness, no one can see God. Hence, righteousness is a basic item in the Christian life. The matter of righteousness involves the means by which we come to God every time we approach Him. If a Christian has not settled this matter, he does not have a solid foundation. A Christian who has doubts about righteousness cannot come to God with assurance. Many Christians desire to grow, and they would like to go on in God's way. But one of the reasons they go back and forth is that they are not clear about righteousness. Righteousness is a simple matter, yet it is foundational. Brothers and sisters, if we are not clear about righteousness, we cannot go on in peace; we will always have trouble. Hence, we must be clear about the matter of righteousness.</p><p>We are often not sure by what means we can come to God. We think that our good behavior is our righteousness and that we come to God by good behavior. Some brothers and sisters think that if their behavior is good and they do well from morning to evening, they have righteousness that day. But if their behavior is not perfect, they have a problem with righteousness. The brothers and sisters who have this kind of thought take righteousness as their conduct.</p><p>When God opens our eyes, we will see that our righteousness before God has nothing to do with our conduct; it is something else. God's light is like a knife to us; it divides our righteousness from our conduct. Formerly, we thought that when we came to God, our conduct was our righteousness. But now we see that when we come to God, Christ is our righteousness. Our righteousness is no longer our conduct; our righteousness is Christ. Thank the Lord that before God, our righteousness is Christ. Our conduct can improve, but our righteousness cannot improve. Our conduct is not perfect, but our righteousness is always perfect. Our righteousness is Christ, and we can come to God through Christ. Our conduct is not blameless, but praise the Lord, our righteousness is blameless because our righteousness is Christ.</p><p>We have to know that Christ as our righteousness is the greatest salvation. God has settled the matter of righteousness for us, and our position before God is secured. Brothers and sisters, we should have good behavior, and we should behave well. We should serve God more, and we should be diligent and bear the cross. But we have to realize that while our conduct can improve again and again, our righteousness before God cannot improve anymore. The means by which we can come to God today is the same means by which we can come to Him ten or twenty years from now. Our righteousness before God is not our own conduct; it is Christ. If a man does not have the revelation to see that Christ is his righteousness, he will not be able to come boldly before God. If he sees that his righteousness is a person, that his righteousness is Christ, he will be bold in approaching God. Brothers and sisters, we must remember that when we come to God, our righteousness is not our conduct. Our righteousness is not a thing; our righteousness is a person&mdash;Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Becoming Our Sanctification</h2><p>Before God, our righteousness is not our conduct. But this does not mean that we do not have to care for our conduct while we live on earth. Our righteousness before God is settled, but what should we do about our conduct and living? We must see that God has made Christ not only our righteousness, but our sanctification as well. This sanctification is not a thing or condition, but a person&mdash;Christ. God has made Christ our sanctification.</p><p>Some Christians have a certain concept about sanctification. They think that sanctification is Christ helping them to be sanctified. This means that they are not holy, but they will become holy through Christ's help. First Corinthians 1:30 tells us that God has made Christ sanctification to us. We do not have to try to be sanctified by ourselves. We do not become sanctified through the help of Christ. Christ Himself has become our sanctification. Our sanctification is the person of Christ, not the help of Christ.</p><p>Some Christians think that sanctification is Christ empowering them to become holy. They pray for the Lord to give them strength. They think that as long as they have the strength, they can be sanctified. But God's Word does not say that we can be sanctified. It does not say that Christ gives us the strength to be holy. God's Word tells us clearly that He has made Christ sanctification to us. Our sanctification is a gift. Our sanctification is a person. Our sanctification is not the result of a power from God. If we do not have the vision, we will not see the vast difference between these two things. This is not something that our mind can comprehend. If we do not have the revelation, it is useless even if our mind understands. God must show us that Christ does not come to help us to become holy; He does not give us the strength to be sanctified. Rather, He Himself is our sanctification.</p><p>Many Christians believe that there are two things related to sanctification. One is the power of sanctification, and the other is the fruit of sanctification. They think that a man must have the power of sanctification before he can bear the fruit of sanctification. According to this theory, where should we put Christ? Should Christ be on the side of power, which means that Christ as our power enables us to become sanctified? Yet God's speaking in 1 Corinthians 1:30 is totally different from this theory. Christ did not come to be our power of sanctification. Christ Himself is our sanctification. He did not come to be our power of sanctification to enable us to produce sanctification. He Himself is sanctification. I have to shout Hallelujah! He does not become our power of sanctification, which enables us to produce sanctification. Rather, we have Christ; therefore, we have sanctification. Brothers and sisters, if we say that sanctification is a thing, God's Word will tell us that Christ is that thing. Brothers and sisters, our thing is a living person. Our sanctification is a living person. Our thing is Christ; our sanctification is Christ.</p><p>We can take humility as an example. Suppose I am a very proud person. I am aware of my pride, yet I cannot humble myself. Therefore, I pray, "God, be merciful to me. Please send the Lord Jesus to help me so that I can be humble." Brothers and sisters, have you seen this? I have made Christ my help in trying to be humble. I think that with His help I can become humble. Therefore, I ask Christ to help me to become humble. But this is my concept; this is not God's way of salvation. God does not ask Christ to help me to become humble. God gives me Christ, who is my humility. God has not given us Christ as a power so that we can produce humility; God has given us Christ to be our humility. Brothers and sisters, does the Lord have power? Yes, every one of us knows that He has power. Has He given us this power? Yes, He has given us this power. Then why are we still so weak? We have to realize that He has given all the power to us already, but we cannot use this power. The Lord's power is real, but we cannot use it. If we try to be humble by the Lord's power, we find that we cannot make it. At the most we perform some outward acts which we call humility. But inwardly, there is no such thing as humility. God's Word shows us that our humility is not the power of Christ, but Christ Himself.</p><p>What does it mean for us to say that humility is just the Lord Himself? It means that I do not have any humility and I cannot be humble. Even if the Lord gives me the strength to humble myself, I still cannot be humble. I can only say to the Lord, "You are my humility. I allow You to become my humility." Brothers and sisters, what is the meaning of Christ becoming my humility? Simply put, it means that Christ replaces me and expresses His own humility in my place. When we ask God for power to humble ourselves, we may be able to humble ourselves for a while, but this humility is merely good behavior, a good attitude, a good intention, and a good condition. This humility is not Christ. When we ask the Lord to be our humility, we lift up our heads and say to Him, "Lord, I do not have any humility in me. Even if You give me the strength to humble myself, I still would not have humility. Therefore Lord, I ask that You come and be my humility and that You be humble in my place." After we look to the Lord this way, any humility that we begin to have will be a spontaneous humility. Such humility will not be a work, but a living person&mdash;Christ Himself.</p><p>Take patience as an example. I do not have any patience, and I cannot be patient. My patience is just Christ Himself. The same is true with meekness. I do not have any meekness, and I cannot be meek. My meekness is just Christ Himself. Brothers and sisters, have you seen this? God has made Christ my patience. God has made Christ my meekness. All our virtues are just Christ. Christian virtues are different from common human virtues. The virtues that we commonly speak of are individual things, but Christian virtues are not individual, fragmentary things, but a living person, who is Christ Himself. Our virtue is not plural in number, but singular in number. Our virtue is not fragmentary things, but a person. Brothers and sisters, if we do not have Christ, we do not have anything.</p><p>When Christ becomes our life within, He responds to all the demands outside of us. There is only one life, but because the demands outside of us are different, there are different kinds of responses. When pride comes, Christ is manifested as our humility. When anxiety comes, Christ is manifested as our patience. When jealousy comes, Christ is manifested as our love. From this one life issue all the virtues. Because the need in the environment varies, the manifestations of this life also vary. Daily we encounter many things. When the Lord manifests Himself in these things, we find Him in many virtues. Hence, the many virtues of Christians are not their own behavior, but the reflections of Christ and the manifestations of Christ. This is the meaning of Christ becoming our sanctification.</p><p>Hence, the Christian life is a matter of how much we know about Christ. It is not a matter of our humility, our patience, or our meekness. Everything depends on Christ. The more we know Christ, the more His virtues are manifested through us. Others may think that these are our virtues. But we know that they are nothing but Christ. A Christian has no virtue other than Christ. All Christian virtues are just Christ. Brothers and sisters, if we know Christ more, we will see that our virtues are just the outflow of Christ. Sister Wang's patience is Christ. Brother Chan's patience is also Christ. Brother Chow's love, Sister Hu's meekness, and Sister Liu's humility are not different virtues; they are Christ. The virtues manifested through different persons are different. But they are all Christ. Hallelujah! All of our virtues are just Christ! Everything that flows out of us is just Christ. The love that flows out of Brother Chow is Christ. The meekness that flows out of Sister Hu is Christ. The humility that flows out of Sister Liu is also Christ. The demands in the environment may be different, but the supply within is the same. The outward manifestations are different, but the intrinsic nature is the same. No Christian virtue is a product of one's own work; every virtue is the outflow of Christ. It is Christ reflecting Himself out of us. Brothers and sisters, once we realize this, we will lift up our head to the Lord and say, "I have tried in the past to be a Christian by myself. I was wrong. Lord, I thank You. Now I know that You are my sanctification. I want You to live Yourself out of me."</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Becoming Our Redemption</h2><p>Not only has Christ become righteousness to us from God, and not only has He become sanctification to us from God, but He has become redemption to us from God. The meaning of redemption is to buy back or to free by paying a ransom. There are three things which are indispensable in any act of redemption. The first is the person redeemed, the second is the redeemer, and the third is the price of redemption. All the redeemed ones were formerly sold under sin (Rom. 7:14); they were the slaves of sin. Now the Lord Jesus has paid the price of the blood (Matt. 20:28; Mark 10:45; 1 Tim. 2:6) and has redeemed us out of the curse of the law (Gal. 3:13). This shows us that the Lord is our Redeemer.</p><p>But we have to go on one step further. The Lord Jesus is not only our Redeemer, but also our redemption. If the Lord Jesus is only our Redeemer, He is still separated from the redeemed ones, in spite of the close relationship between the two&mdash;a relationship of grace, of saving our lives. The Lord Jesus has not only become our Redeemer but has become our redemption. This means that when we are redeemed, we are not only joined to a thing, but to a person. When we are redeemed, the Lord Jesus becomes one with us; the two become one. Our redemption is a person. When we have Him, we have redemption. Without Him we do not have redemption. If we want redemption, we need Him. Once we have Him, we have redemption because He is the redemption. Our redemption is not just a thing. Our redemption is a person who is joined to us.</p><p>Christ has become our redemption. Therefore, all those who have been washed by the blood can come boldly to God. While God judges the sinners, He can righteously pass over all those who are under the blood of the Lamb (Exo. 12:12-13; Rom. 3:25-26). All the redeemed ones have experienced a full redemption. In God's eyes, all He sees is Christ. It is as if He does not see any person; all He sees is Christ. Christ is the slain Lamb; His blood removes man's sin-record before God. When a man comes to God through Christ, God will no longer condemn him, because Christ has satisfied God's righteous requirement on man's behalf. He has borne sin's punishment on man's behalf. Once a man has Christ, he has redemption. When God sees Christ, He sees redemption.</p><p>Christ is not only our redemption before God; He is also redemption within us. Christ as our redemption within is particularly related to our body. Christ as our redemption within not only delivers us from the law of sin in our members (Rom. 7:23; 8:2), but has become life to our body. Romans 8:11 says, "And if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you." This does not mean that we will be resurrected after we die. It means that He will give life to our mortal bodies today. Second Corinthians 4:10-11 says, "Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh." The most outstanding thing here is that verse 11 seems to be a repetition of verse 10. Actually it is not a repetition. Verse 10 says that the life of Jesus is manifested in our body, while verse 11 says that the life of Jesus is manifested in our mortal flesh. With many believers, the life of Jesus may be manifested in their body, but may not be manifested in their mortal body. The difference here is great. Many believers are obedient and patient in times of sickness; they are not anxious, and they do not murmur. They feel the Lord's presence and manifest the Lord's virtues in their expression, their voice, and their actions. Indeed the life of Jesus is manifested in their body through the Holy Spirit. Yet they do not know that the Lord Jesus is able to heal their sickness. They do not know that the Lord Jesus' life is also for their body of humiliation. They receive grace from the Lord to endure the pain, but they do not receive the healing. They have the experience of verse 10, but do not have the experience of verse 11. Brothers and sisters, we have to realize that Christ is redemption to our body. For our mortal body to be made alive does not mean that the nature of the body is changed or that we become immortal. The nature of the body remains the same, but a new life comes in to supply strength to the body. Originally, the natural life was the source of strength of our body. Now we are supplied by the life of Christ. When our body is sustained by the resurrection life of Christ, our body is enabled to work in a strong way.</p><p>Christ becoming our redemption is a big subject. Christ as our redemption is not merely a matter of Him being the life of our body today, but it affords us a great hope, which is "the redemption of our body" (Rom. 8:21-23; 1 Cor. 15:50-54; Phil. 3:21). One day God will show everyone the way that He has redeemed the creation and the way that He made us His own. Then our body will be redeemed and will put off corruption to put on incorruption; we will no longer be under the bondage of corruption, and we will enter into the liberty of glory. Then the dead will rise up, and we will be changed. Our body of humiliation will be transfigured to be conformed to the body of His glory. Then we will see that our redemption is Christ! Who are those who have the assurance that they will be in the first (the best) resurrection? Who are those who have the assurance that their body will be transfigured one day? We believe and we have the assurance because Christ is our redemption.</p><p>First Corinthians 15:42-44 shows us that when a Christian dies, he is not buried, but is "sown." We know that to sow something and to bury something are two entirely different things. For example, when you bury a piece of copper in the ground, that is all there is to it; it will not grow up again. But if you sow a grain of wheat into the ground, it will grow after a few days. When a Christian dies, he is not like a piece of copper buried in the ground, but like a grain of wheat sown into the earth. One day he will spring up again. He can spring up again because he has the life of Christ within him. This life is a life that cannot be imprisoned by death, because the life of Christ is the resurrection life. This life is in the believer. This is why he will resurrect one day. Because Christ is our redemption, He will make us grow. Christ will not be imprisoned by death. A regenerated Christian has Christ within him. Christ is his redemption, and he will inherit a resurrected body which is incorruptible, glorious, strong, and spiritual.</p><p>This is not all. Because Christ is our redemption, some Christians will not see death, but will be raptured. There was a young girl who once asked a preacher, "Does it not take a great effort for a Christian to be raptured away?" For a child, the rapture takes great effort. But we know that the rapture is not something according to our concept. A Christian is raptured because Christ is in him. Christ is his redemption, and Christ will take him away.</p><p>Christ as our life is the foundation of the Christian life. The first step in our salvation is regeneration. The last step in our salvation is the redemption of our body. But from beginning to end, the basis is Christ as our life. The relationship between Christ and us is a life relationship. In other words, it is an indissoluble relationship. Christ does not become something outside of us. He has come into us to be our life. A relationship in life is an indissoluble relationship. If we have not received Christ as our life, we have nothing to do with Christ. But since we have received Christ as our life, we have an indissoluble relationship with Him. After Adam sinned, God immediately guarded the way of the tree of life with the cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way (Gen. 3:24). He did this because if Adam had eaten the fruit of the tree of life, he would have bonded an indissoluble relationship with God. Thank God that our relationship with Christ is a relationship which Adam did not have; it is an indissoluble relationship. Even God Himself cannot dissolve this relationship. This life lives in us all the time, and it is bringing us into glory, into eternity. What a great power this is! What a glorious hope this is!</p><p>May the Lord open our eyes to see that God has put us into Christ and made Christ our wisdom: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. May the Lord show us that of all the gifts He has given us, none is greater than His Son. May the Lord show us that Christ is the gift and also all the gifts. He is the singular gift and also the plural gifts. We have to learn to know Christ as our wisdom. We have to learn to know Christ as our righteousness, we have to learn to know Christ as our sanctification, and we have to learn to know Christ as our redemption. May the Lord deliver us from foolishness and darkness so that we realize that there is no matter or thing in the spiritual realm. All we have is just Christ.</p><h1 class="series">CHRIST IS OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</h1><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class="title">THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 3:21-28, 31</h1><p>Every time we consider our salvation, we realize that it comes to us because God loves us. At the same time, we should remember that it was not an easy thing for God to prepare such a salvation for us. This is because God has His nature and His ways, just as man has his nature and his ways. Man's way is man's method and habit of doing things. Man's way is related to man's nature. God also has His ways. God works according to certain rules, procedures, and methods. These are called God's ways. The Bible shows us that God's glory is just God Himself, while God's holiness is God's nature. The Bible also shows us that God's righteousness is God's way.</p><p>God's righteousness is God's way of doing things. Every person has his own characteristics; every person has his way of doing things. When we see the things a person does, we know what kind of person he is. For example, a person may be very thorough and carry out things according to clear procedures. Whenever he takes up a task, he is never sloppy; he is always reliable and clear-cut in carrying it out. Every person has his own particular way of doing things. When we see a certain way, we know that a certain person has done the work, because others do not do things in the same way. The same is true with God. God's works also have their own characteristics. These characteristics are His ways. God's ways have very much to do with Himself; they have very much to do with His nature. God's way is righteousness. He cannot do anything unrighteously. God must do everything in a righteous way.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S SALVATION MUST CONFORM<br />TO HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>Even though God has a desire to save us, there is a problem. On the one hand, He wants to save us. On the other hand, He cannot do anything that would contradict His way. A man cannot do anything that contradicts his own nature. If he does anything that is contrary to his own nature, he will suffer and not feel comfortable. The same is true with God; He cannot do anything that is contrary to His own nature. God is love. But even though He sees man's pitiful condition and realizes that He has to save him, God has to save him in a way that satisfies Himself. God must save us in a way that does not contradict His way.</p><p>Is God satisfied with the salvation that we have received? Yes, God is satisfied. God considers this salvation proper. We are, of course, glad when we receive salvation. But in order for God to give us His grace, He has to give it in a way that He Himself is satisfied. God cannot save us and say at the same time, "Oh, this is not what I really wanted to do. I did it just for their sake." God has His nature, and He has His way. God must work in a way that He Himself is satisfied, and that He Himself can say is good and right. When God restored the earth and the heavens, He saw that everything He did during the six days (except the day He created the firmament, for which He had other reasons) "was good." If something is not good, God has not done it. God's work always bears one characteristic; He works according to a particular procedure and a particular way. He does everything in an absolutely righteous way. He is not pleased with anything that is unrighteous.</p><p>God is a righteous God. Hence, while it is easy for Him to condemn man, it is not easy for Him to forgive man. Suppose a very righteous man sees someone sin. It would be easy for him to judge the other according to righteousness, but it would not be easy for him to forgive the other. Anyone who sins perishes; this readily manifests God's nature and righteousness. But it is much more difficult for God to forgive a sinner and, at the same time, manifest His nature and righteousness. If a man admits that he has sinned when he goes to God, he should perish; this is very righteous. But would it be righteous if God forgave him easily? Of course, it would not be righteous, and God cannot do this. He cannot do anything unrighteous.</p><p>We must remember that in preparing a salvation for us, God faced one great problem. On the one hand, He wants to forgive man's sins. But on the other hand, He must do it in a way that matches His nature. This makes things very difficult for Him. If God did not have to act according to righteousness, it would be very simple. All He would have to do is forgive. It would also be easy and simple if God decided to not forgive our sins and let us perish. It would be easy for God to choose either way. But God did not choose one of these ways. We have sinned, and we should perish. God wants to save us, yet He cannot be unrighteous. When we put these four things together, it presents a big problem. God wants to save us, but He cannot lower the standard of His righteousness. On the one hand, He wants to save us. On the other hand, He has to do it in a righteous way. On the one hand, God wants to have mercy on us. On the other hand, He has to judge our sins. On the one hand, He wants to save us. On the other hand, He has to maintain His own righteousness. Putting it in human terms, God is the Legislator and He is also the Executor. Just imagine this! What should our God, who is both Legislator and Executor, do? What way should He take in order to both save men and maintain His righteousness? In preparing a salvation for us, the first question He had to settle was how He could do it and still be in conformity with His righteousness. He has to show us that His forgiveness is absolutely righteous; He cannot let us get by easily.</p><h2 class="head1">FORGIVENESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW</h2><p>For this reason, God needs a way which would forgive us and still conform to His righteousness. Through God's grace He can forgive us, keep His own law, and execute it. God's grace says that He has kept His law and, at the same time, saved us. The grace of salvation tells us that sinners are saved and that God is still righteous. God has not only saved us; He has saved us righteously. God would not do one thing that would make a sinner criticize Him in his heart, while keeping silent in his mouth. God does not want to save a person and then be criticized as being unrighteous for doing it. God is always righteous in His works. He wants to save men in a most righteous way; He wants to save in a way that no one can criticize Him or say anything about Him. This is not all. In saving men, God not only wants to show men that He is righteous; He wants to shut up the mouth of the devil as well. God cannot save men in a way that the devil would consider as being wrong or unrighteous. God must save us in a way that both men and the devil have nothing to say. Furthermore, He has to save us in a way that even He Himself has nothing to say. As human beings, our actions are blameless only when they are blameless before men as well as blameless before ourselves. The same is true with God's salvation. He must do it in a way that neither men nor the devil nor Himself has anything to say. God must save us in a way that we consider right, the devil considers right, and He Himself considers right. It is not a hard thing for God to save men. But the problem is that He has to save in a righteous way. The Bible shows us that God saves men to the extent that both the saved and the unsaved ones have nothing more to say, the devil has nothing more to say, and even God Himself has nothing more to say. This is the meaning of salvation. Salvation is for God to save men according to His righteousness. This is why we say that salvation is God's masterpiece.</p><p>We know that we are saved by grace. We know further that God's grace is regulated by His righteousness. We can say that God's grace comes through the channel of His righteousness. Because man has sinned, he needs to be saved. But those who have sinned should suffer the punishment of sin; God cannot easily forgive a man.</p><p>Suppose a criminal is caught and sent to the court. The judge cannot release him just because the criminal's mother is too old to care for herself or because he has a three-year-old son at home. If the judge does this, even though he may be commended for his good heart, he is being unjust. He is "doing good" in an unjust way. This is wrong. God wants to do good in a righteous way. We need God to forgive our sins, but He cannot do anything unrighteously. God must come up with a way that would allow us to receive the benefit and allow Him to maintain His righteousness. Our God cannot do anything unrighteous; He cannot be unrighteous even in His salvation of men. Therefore, we must remember that God saves in a righteous way. What then did He do? He used the cross. We have to remember that if God were not righteous, the cross would become a redundant thing. If God could forgive men in a generous way, why would there be the need of the cross? If there were no righteousness, there would be no need of the cross. But God is a righteous God. Therefore, there is a need of the cross. The cross says that God knows our sins and that we should be judged and punished for our sins. God knows that in saving us, He has to satisfy the demand of the law. He uses the cross to satisfy the demand of the law. The cross is the price that God paid for us.</p><p>Twenty years ago, a preacher was preaching the gospel to a group of female students. He spoke on God's righteousness. He told them that God loved men and desired to forgive and save men. Yet His salvation had to be carried out in a righteous way. Man had sinned, and those who sin must be punished. The cross is God's recompense to His law. Only by the cross can God save us righteously. Most of the students did not understand what the preacher was talking about, so he tried to explain with an illustration. There was a large vase on the podium, and the preacher asked the headmistress, "If anyone in the school broke something that belonged to the school, what would she have to do?" The headmistress said, "She would have to pay for the damage." He asked, "This vase probably cost at least five dollars. If a student broke this vase, would the school demand that she pay a recompense?" She answered, "According to the school rule, she would have to pay. If she broke the vase and did not pay, others would not have to pay if they broke a window. If that happened, the rule would become empty words, and it would be useless." Not only were the students responsible for keeping the rule, but the headmistress was responsible for implementing the rule also. It was the headmistress's responsibility to keep the students from damaging anything, and it was also the headmistress's responsibility to get a recompense every time something was damaged. If a student broke the vase, she had to recompense according to the rule. If the student could not afford to pay, what could the headmistress do? The student could not afford to pay, yet foregoing the recompense would be unjust. If the headmistress wanted to be merciful to her and forgive her, and also wanted to take care of justice and keep the school rule, the only thing she could do would be to take five dollars from her own pocket, give them to the student, and tell her, "You have broken the vase, and there must be recompense. Take this money for your repayment." As far as justice was concerned, those who broke anything had to pay. If the money was paid, the demand of the rule would be satisfied. If out of her love, the headmistress was willing to spend her own money to make the recompense, this would be the expression of the headmistress's love. This is the meaning of the cross. God's righteousness requires that all those who have sinned be punished. We are like a student who has broken the vase. We have sinned, but cannot afford to make a recompense. God cannot be unrighteous and cannot let us go easily. Hence, He prepared the cross. The cross is the right punishment for us sinners. All those who come to God through the cross are saved righteously, in the same way that any student who acted according to the above principle would be forgiven justly.</p><p>Our God must save us, on the one hand, and maintain His righteousness, on the other hand. Therefore, He gave us His Son and crucified Him on the cross for us. We have sinned and deserve punishment, but we have the cross. We can show God the cross. Before God gave us the cross, we could say nothing if God punished us. But now that He has given us the cross, He has to forgive our sins and accept us. We must remember that since there is the cross, salvation is a matter of God's righteousness. Without the cross, we cannot be saved, because God cannot be unrighteous. With the cross, God cannot help but save us, because our salvation becomes a matter of righteousness and perfect justice. The Lord Jesus has suffered the punishment that we ought to suffer. Therefore, our sins are forgiven in a most righteous way. God has not forgiven our sins easily; He forgave us according to a righteous procedure.</p><h2 class="head1">COMING BOLDLY TO GOD</h2><p>Whether or not a person can be a proper Christian depends on whether he understands God's righteousness. Many people cannot live a proper Christian life because they think that their forgiveness is the result of God's mercy. They think that God forgives them because He sees that they are hopeless. They do not realize that God's righteousness brought about their forgiveness. Consequently, sometimes they feel that God has forgiven them, and at other times, they feel that God has not forgiven them. But we have to remember that God has given us His Son, who has borne the punishment of sin for us. Therefore, the Bible says that we can come boldly to God (Heb. 10:19). We thank and praise God that He has given us His Son. Before God gave us Jesus of Nazareth, He was free to forgive us or not forgive us. But now that He has given us Jesus of Nazareth, God cannot refuse us when we come to Him through Jesus Christ; He has to forgive us. God has to forgive those who come to Him through Christ Jesus. Hallelujah! God cannot refuse to forgive those who come to Him through Christ Jesus. Since He has given us Christ Jesus, when we come to Him through Christ, God has to forgive us whether or not He likes it. Hallelujah! We can come to God today not just because of His love, but also because of His righteousness.</p><p>We must realize the importance of righteousness. Righteousness gives us the boldness before God. We are not trusting in God's pleasure for forgiveness. We are not depending on our feeling for forgiveness. We are trusting in God's unchanging righteousness. God has given Christ Jesus to us. Now when we come to God through Christ Jesus, He must forgive us. Before Jesus of Nazareth died, it was possible for men to think, "God can forgive if He wants to, and God does not have to forgive if He does not want to." But Jesus of Nazareth has died for us. God cannot refuse to forgive those who come to Him through Christ Jesus. God has to forgive them. When we come to God according to righteousness, God has to forgive us.</p><p>Let me give you another story. There was a Sunday school teacher who once asked two young sisters how they were saved. The older one stood up and answered, "Thank God, I am saved by God's grace." Following this, the younger one stood up and said, "Thank God, I am saved by God's righteousness." The older one jabbed the arm of the younger one and said, "No, you should say that we are saved by God's grace." The younger one knew the Bible very well and quoted 1 John 1:9: "He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." God's Word tells us that our sins are forgiven and our unrighteousness is cleansed according to God's righteousness. The younger sister was very bold in her testimony.</p><p>We have to say that no one who knows the Lord comes to God in trembling. Did Noah tremble inside the ark? Did he have to worry that the ark would sink under the water? Did the firstborn in Israel need to tremble inside the blood-covered houses? Did they have to worry that the angels would kill them by mistake? We have to remember that God never forgives us in a loose way; He forgives us in a very righteous way. This forgiveness matches His nature; it is an absolutely righteous forgiveness. This forgiveness, when presented to men, shuts up men's mouths and, when presented before the devil, shuts up the devil's mouth. When this forgiveness is presented before God, even He has nothing more to say. Therefore, we can rejoice before the Lord; we can have the assurance and do not need to be afraid. Everyone who comes to God through the cross is free from condemnation and judgment. Both a young believer as well as those who have believed for a long time can offer their praise spontaneously when they think of salvation and righteousness. We have to praise Him because He has saved us righteously!</p><p>Thank the Lord that we are saved by God's righteousness. We are forgiven according to His righteousness. When we come to God through the Lord Jesus, we are not afraid. We have to remember that God's righteousness has saved us. God's righteousness makes it impossible for God to refuse us. We have to say, "God, I thank and praise You. Because of the Lord Jesus, You have to accept me. Had You not given the Lord Jesus to me, I could only beg outside the door, but now that You have given the Lord Jesus to me, no one can stop me from entering in."</p><p>God has given us the Lord Jesus. Hallelujah! The Lord Jesus Christ is ours already! Therefore, the Bible says that we have to enter the Holy of Holies boldly. Any kind of doubt is wrong. All those who have received the Lord Jesus Christ can say to God, "God, I thank and praise You because You are righteous. Your righteousness has secured my forgiveness." Whether or not we can live a proper Christian life depends on our understanding of righteousness. We have to be thoroughly clear that God's forgiveness is not based on grace, but on righteousness. We have to thank and praise God.</p><p class="hbody">When I was in sin and filled with pain,<br />Righteousness demanded that I be judged.<br />But when the Lord shed His blood for my redemption,<br />Righteousness demanded that I have peace.</p><p class="hbody">God, Your righteousness has brought my Savior<br />To the cross to suffer judgment,<br />So that righteousness can give the sinners<br />Forgiveness, justification, and peace.</p><p class="hbody">Righteousness requires that debts be paid,<br />And after the debts are paid,<br />Righteousness requires that the cleared debt<br />Not be once more repaid or recompensed.</p><p class="hbody">Since my Savior has shed His blood,<br />You can no longer crucify Him.<br />Nor can You demand that I take up my case;<br />You can only forgive and cleanse me.</p><p class="hbody">When I heard that You are righteous,<br />I could only fear and flee.<br />But when Your righteousness is mentioned now,<br />It feels precious and pleasant to me.</p><p class="hbody">Since I have come to know Your righteousness,<br />I understand more of Your grace;<br />The former gives me peace unspeakable,<br />The latter fills me with comfort.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class="title">CHRIST BECOMING OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:30; Eph. 1:6</h1><p>We have previously seen how God's salvation is based on righteousness. Now we will see how God makes Christ our righteousness. Righteousness is particularly related to God. If we do not intend to come to God, nothing more needs to be said. But if we want to come to God, we have to take care of the matter of righteousness. If a man does not have righteousness, he will not dare to see God's face. After Adam and Eve fell, they hid themselves among the trees and ran from Jehovah's face when they heard His voice because they were naked. Once a man hears God's voice, even if he has not seen His face, he will immediately feel his nakedness; he will feel that he cannot see God without a covering (Gen. 3:7-8). In the Bible righteousness is signified by a garment. Righteousness is like a garment; we can only see God when we put on this garment.</p><p>We have been baptized, and we are in Christ. But we have to pay attention to one question: since the day we belonged to Christ, what has been the means by which we come to God? On what basis do we come before Him? What should we wear when we come to God? Our sins are forgiven and washed away, but we still need a garment. Righteousness is not a negative problem; it is not merely related to sin or to our forgiveness. Righteousness is a positive matter; it is a matter of how we come before God. We must deal thoroughly with the matter of righteousness.</p><p>As a Christian, surely you pray. Have you ever wondered if God would answer your prayer? Why do you sometimes doubt that God will answer your prayers? It is because you feel that you are wrong, that you have this and that kind of defect, and that if you come to God, all the defects will be exposed. Either we do not pray at all, or we pray with all these questions coming into our mind. On what basis do we come to God? Either we do not pray at all, or we pray and immediately wonder how we can come to God. We must be covered by something before we can come boldly before God. This is a question of righteousness. It is a question of what we put on when we come before God.</p><p>What is the basis for us to come to God? What do we have that will satisfy God? God will not gloss over our sins; He has to examine us to the extent that He Himself is satisfied. Every time we come to God, we need righteousness. When we stand before God, we need to present to Him righteousness. Whether we have boldness before Him and whether we are strong or weak before Him depend on whether or not we have righteousness before Him. If we do not have righteousness, we are afraid of being seen by Him; we are afraid that once He examines us more carefully He will see our lack. If we do not have righteousness, all our boldness is gone, and inwardly we shrivel. But if we have righteousness, and if our righteousness is such that even God can say nothing, we will have boldness to come to Him, and we will dare to pray to Him. We must remember that a basic condition for prayer is boldness. Without boldness we cannot pray. If we are not bold, we cannot come before God. The necessary condition for coming to God is boldness. Boldness is being able to stand before God and being confident that He will not find any fault in us no matter how hard He searches. Without this, we cannot pray to Him with boldness, and we cannot even be a Christian.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>The question now is with what kind of righteousness can we come before God. In other words, what kind of righteousness is acceptable to God. We have to be clear that the righteousness we are speaking of is different from the righteousness mentioned in the last chapter. Chapter one speaks of the relationship between righteousness and sins; it speaks of the relationship between God's righteousness and our sin. The righteousness spoken of here is something we offer to God to satisfy Him when we come before Him. This is where the problem of most people lies. Yesterday they prayed before God, and they were bold because they preached the gospel twice, read five chapters of the Bible, and were in an upbeat mood before the Lord. When they felt that they were good and doing well, they thought that they had righteousness, and they were bold. But the strange thing is that their "righteousness" is like malaria; sometimes it is feverish, and sometimes it is chilling. Yesterday it seemed hot, but today it becomes cold. Yesterday their interest in reading the Bible was high, but today their interest is gone. Yesterday there was the zeal to preach the gospel, but today there is no interest in talking to people anymore. Any preaching seems senseless and does not do much good. As a result, when such a person prays today, he does not feel as invigorated as he did yesterday. When he comes to God today, he only considers the fact that he has not studied the Bible well and testified well and that his living is not proper. He feels that something is wrong within himself. He thinks that God will not answer his prayer today. Do you see this? This kind of "righteousness" is fluctuating and vacillating; it is good for two days and not good for two days. It is down for two days and up for two days.</p><p>If our righteousness is fluctuating and vacillating, our Christian life before God will also be fluctuating and vacillating. One day we will be very bold before the Lord, and the next day we will become very timid. One day we will feel that God will surely answer us when we pray, and the next day we will feel that God will not answer us. Sometimes we can stand before God with boldness, while at other times we cannot stand before Him with boldness. We fluctuate and vacillate this way because we are coming to God according to our own conduct and our own "righteousness." If our conduct  is good, we feel more at ease before God. But if our conduct is not so good, our hearts become cold towards the Lord. Our life before the Lord is like a flickering candle in the face of the wind; sometimes we feel good, and sometimes we feel terrible. Sometimes we can pray, and sometimes we cannot pray. Sometimes we feel invigorated, and sometimes we feel dejected. This is because our conduct is fluctuating. Sometimes it is up, and sometimes it is down. Sometimes it is hot, and sometimes it is cold. Sometimes it is bright, and sometimes it is dark.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST IS OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>What then should be our righteousness? This is a very basic lesson for us as Christians. We have to learn this lesson well, and we have to learn it from its very foundation. What is our righteousness? We have to realize that in giving us salvation, God not only solved the problem of sin, but the problem of righteousness as well. God forgave our sins according to righteousness, and at the same time, He has prepared a righteousness for us so that we can come to Him by this righteousness. Forgiveness is like taking a bath, while righteousness is like putting on clothes. We put on clothes in order to live before men. God gave us righteousness in order to live before Him, that is, so that we can see God. Thank the Lord that God has washed away our sins and clothed us with righteousness so that we can live before Him.</p><p>What is our righteousness? God's Word tells us that our righteousness is Christ, that is, the Lord Jesus Himself. First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption." We will not speak of the other aspects; we will only concentrate on one aspect&mdash;God has made Christ our righteousness.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Being the Righteousness of Christ</h2><p>Before speaking on Christ being our righteousness, we have to mention the difference between the righteousness of Christ and Christ being our righteousness. These are two entirely different things. It is wrong to take Christ's righteousness as our righteousness. Christ's righteousness cannot become our righteousness. It is Christ Himself who becomes our righteousness.</p><p>Second Peter 1:1 says, "The righteousness of our God and Savior." This refers to the righteousness of the Lord Jesus Himself. If the Lord Jesus did not have righteousness, He would not be qualified to be our Savior, and we could not be saved. The righteousness of the Lord Jesus was for Himself alone and is not for us. The Bible does not say that the righteousness of the Lord Jesus saved us. The righteousness of the Lord Jesus only qualified Him to save us. His righteousness belongs to Him alone. His righteousness cannot be counted as our righteousness. The righteousness of the Lord Jesus is the righteousness lived out by Him as a man. This is His personal attribute before God. This righteousness is His own conduct; it cannot be given to us. The righteousness of the Lord Jesus is something He did in Himself. It is absolutely His, and it has absolutely nothing to do with us. This is why the Bible never says that we are "in Jesus." When He was Jesus, He was God's only begotten Son. He was not the firstborn Son, and we were not the many sons. We still had nothing to do with Him. We have to remember that our union with Him did not begin while He was on earth, but while He was on the cross. Before the cross, everything that the Lord had was His alone, and we did not have any part in it. After the grain of wheat fell into the ground and died, it bore many grains. After the Lord Jesus died, we the many grains were produced. Our union with the Lord Jesus began from His death, not from His birth. Golgotha is the starting point of our union with Him. We were not joined to Him at Bethlehem. Before Golgotha, men only saw His righteousness, but could not participate in His righteousness. The Bible shows us from the beginning to the end that in God's eyes, we are not saved by the righteousness of Christ; we do not become a righteous man through Christ's righteousness. We become a righteous man through Christ Himself.</p><p>Some have asked, "Does not the Bible say that God has given us the Lord Jesus' robe of righteousness?" We have to ask, "Does God's Word say that He has given us the Lord Jesus' robe of righteousness, or does it say that God has given the Lord Jesus to us as a robe of righteousness?" In other words, are we putting on the righteousness of the Lord Jesus, or are we putting on the Lord Jesus Himself? If we study God's Word, we will find that it never says that we put on the righteousness of the Lord Jesus; it only says that we put on the Lord Jesus. God has given us the Lord Jesus as a robe of righteousness; we are putting on the Lord Jesus as a person. This is why God's Word says, "Put on the Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom. 13:14). God's Word does not say that we have to put on the righteousness of the Lord Jesus. It says that we have to put on the Lord Jesus Christ. Hence, we see a most interesting and special thing: our righteousness before God is not the conduct of the Lord Jesus on earth; our righteousness before God is the Lord Jesus, a living person. We come to God today because we have put on the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus is our righteousness. This righteousness is not the righteousness that the Lord Jesus had. It is the Lord Jesus Himself. We can have this righteousness all the time before God because the Lord Jesus lives forever. We can be bold before God all the time, because we have the Lord Jesus as our righteousness.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ as Righteousness</h2><p>If our righteousness before God is our conduct, we can never be secure, because our conduct can be good at times and bad at other times. Even if our conduct is good, this goodness is limited and can never come up to God's standard. But thank the Lord that our righteousness before God is not our conduct, but Christ. Therefore, we cannot be shaken before God. We may not be too strong today and may not be too good. Satan will come and say that we are worth nothing and that God does not want us. What should we say? We should say, "Satan, you have forgotten that my righteousness before God is not my good conduct yesterday; neither is it my not-so-good conduct today. My righteousness before God is Christ. If Christ has not changed, my righteousness has not changed either." If we are putting on our own garment, it will be torn and ragged, and we will not see God. But we can put on Christ and have the boldness to come to God. This is salvation, and this is liberation. This is the foundation of all Christian teachings.</p><p>If we ask a brother who knows God's Word, "Will your righteousness ever fail?", he will say no. If we ask, "Will your conduct ever fail?", he will say yes. Have you seen this? His righteousness will not fail, but his conduct will fail. His righteousness is not his conduct. If his righteousness is his conduct, his righteousness will surely fail when his conduct fails. Thank the Lord that his righteousness is not his conduct, which can fail; his righteousness is the Christ who can never fail. Thank the Lord that Christ can never fail, and as such, our righteousness will never fail. Our righteousness will never fail inasmuch as Christ will never fail. This seems to be a very bold statement, but this is God's Word. Our righteousness is Christ. He will not fail; therefore, our righteousness will never fail.</p><p>Some may then ask, "Does this mean that it no longer matters if our conduct is good or bad?" Certainly not. We see from the Bible that Christians have two garments. One is the Lord Jesus, as mentioned above. The Lord Jesus is our garment; He is our righteousness. The other is the bright and clean fine linen mentioned in Revelation 19:8. This fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints. Note that righteousnesses here is plural; it is individual righteous acts. Of course, all the good conduct and outward righteousness of a Christian come by grace. They are the result of the work of the Holy Spirit in man; they are not things that man possesses by his natural disposition. When we come before God, the Lord Jesus is our garment; He is our righteousness. We are not naked; we come to God by putting on Christ. On the other hand, when we appear before the judgment seat of Christ, we must have our own righteousnesses, which are the righteous acts of the saints (2 Cor. 5:10; 1 Cor. 4:5). In this chapter we are speaking of Christ as our righteousness. This does not refer to the righteous acts which believers have in themselves.</p><p>There is a precious word in the Old Testament: "Jehovah our righteousness" (Jer. 23:6; 33:16). Jehovah is our righteousness. Hence, our righteousness is not our conduct. May the Lord truly open our eyes to see that this is the gospel; this is the foundation of the gospel. When we come to God, our righteousness is not our conduct; Christ is our righteousness. Jehovah is our righteousness. We come to God by Christ. What can be more secure and unshakable than Christ?</p><p>Every time we come to God, we have to remember that Christ is our righteousness. Hallelujah, Christ is our righteousness! If we see that Christ is our righteousness, we can stand boldly before God. When we come to Him, we should say to Him like a child, "I have come to You today with Christ on me. Look." When God looks at us again and again, He will find no fault in us. The more He looks at this garment, the more He will find it perfect. This is because Christ is faultless; He is perfect.</p><p>Ephesians 1:6 says, "...His grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved." We are accepted in the Beloved. God accepted His Beloved, and we are accepted by God in His Beloved. When we are accepted in the Beloved, we are accepted as the Beloved is accepted. When we are accepted in the Beloved, God accepts us as much as He has accepted His own Son. He accepts those who are in the Beloved in the same way that He has accepted His Beloved. Whatever position the Beloved has, those who are in Him share the same. This is most glorious.</p><p>When Balak asked Balaam to curse God's people the Israelites, what did Balaam say when he tried to do so? He said, "He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob;/Nor has He seen trouble in Israel./Jehovah their God is with them,/And the shout of a king is among them" (Num. 23:21). Although Balaam was a greedy prophet, he was not speaking from himself. God made Balaam say that He beheld no iniquity in Jacob or trouble in Israel. Balaam could only speak as God told him to speak. In contrast, when the Israelites heard the bad news from the spies and murmured against God, He told them, "Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all who were numbered of you, all who were counted, from twenty years old and above, who have murmured against Me, shall by no means come into the land in which I solemnly swore that I would make you dwell, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun" (14:29-30). As far as their conduct was concerned, they had definitely sinned. We have also definitely sinned. Do not think that the Israelites were good and without sin because of Balaam's words. God did not say that the Israelites had good conduct. He was merely saying that there was a righteousness with the Israelites. Through the sacrifice that they had offered, and through the righteousness of the sacrifice, God beheld no iniquity in Jacob and no trouble in Israel. We know that the sacrifice typifies the Lord Jesus Christ. We can come boldly to God because we are in Christ and because we are accepted in the Beloved. Our righteousness before God is as perfect as Christ's. Since Christ is our righteousness, God can find no sin in us. When we accept the Lord Jesus as our Savior, God sees us as if we have never sinned. We must never have the thought that we are still a sinner and cannot be sure of our position before God, even though our sins have been forgiven by the Lord. We must not think that we still have a trace of sin and cannot be at peace, even though our past sins have been forgiven through the Lord Jesus. Thank God that He has put us into Christ; we can stand before Him as if we have never sinned. Christ is our righteousness. This is why God could say that He beheld no iniquity in Jacob and no trouble in Israel. If we come to God by Christ, will we not have boldness?</p><p>We lose our boldness in coming to God because we have looked at ourselves. We are afraid of seeing God because we have not looked at Christ. If we see only Christ, not ourselves, we will be bold every time we come to God. Christ will never fail; therefore, we can never be wrong before God. Thank God that our righteousness is not vacillating; our righteousness is forever unshakable. Our conduct can fluctuate, and our life can rise and ebb, but our righteousness before God can never fluctuate, vacillate, or rise and ebb. If anyone asks us if Christian conduct, zeal, and love can change, we answer yes. If we say no, we are deceiving ourselves. But our righteousness can never change because our righteousness is Christ. It is impossible for Him to change. God's Word is very clear concerning this.</p><p>First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became...to us from God...righteousness." When the Lord resurrected to become the Christ, God put us in Him so that He became our righteousness, and we put Him on as our righteousness. This is why our righteousness before God never changes. Since He is forever perfect and unchanging, we can come to God with boldness daily.</p><p>May God open our eyes to see that just as we could not trust in our conduct for salvation, we cannot trust in our conduct for coming to God after we become a Christian. This does not mean that we can be loose in our conduct. We will speak of this in the next chapter. In this chapter, we are dealing with the means by which we come to God. Our means of coming to God is Christ as our righteousness. We come to God by Christ. This is forever unshakable; it is forever sure. Hallelujah! Praise our Lord!</p><p class="hbody">God's Christ, who is my righteousness,<br />My beauty is, my glorious dress;<br />Midst flaming worlds, in this arrayed,<br />With joy shall I lift up my head.</p><p class="hbody">Lord, I believe Thy precious blood,<br />Which, at the mercy seat of God,<br />Forever doth for sinners plead,<br />For me, e'en for my soul, was shed.</p><p class="hbody">Lord, I believe were sinners more<br />Than sands upon the ocean shore,<br />Thou hast for all a ransom paid,<br />For all a full redemption made.</p><p class="hbody">Bold can I stand in every way,<br />For who aught to my charge shall lay?<br />Fully, by Thee, absolved I am<br />From sin and fear, from guilt and shame.</p><p class="hbody">This spotless robe the same appears,<br />When ruined nature sinks in years;<br />No age can change its glorious hue,<br />Its glory is forever new.</p><p class="hbody">Thou God of power, Thou God of love,<br />Let all Thy saints Thy mercy prove;<br />Our beauty this, our glorious dress,<br />Jesus the Lord, our Righteousness.</p><p class="hbosy">[Hymn #295]</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class="title">WE ARE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 5:21</h1><p>We have previously covered two points. First, God saves us according to His own righteousness. We are not saved by our own righteousness; we are saved by God's righteousness. God did not save us according to our righteousness, but according to His own righteousness. Thank the Lord that God cannot be unrighteous toward us, because He cannot betray Himself. When we believe in Him, He has to save us, and we have to be saved. Second, Christ is our righteousness. We come to God by putting on Christ. Our righteousness before God is not our conduct. Our righteousness before God is Christ. There is a difference between our conduct and our righteousness before God; we cannot mix up the two things. We cannot make our conduct our righteousness before God, or our righteousness before God our conduct. God's Word shows us that it is possible for our conduct to fluctuate, but it is impossible for our righteousness before God to fluctuate, because our righteousness is Christ. Thank the Lord. When God opens our eyes to see that our righteousness before God is Christ and not our conduct, we are liberated, we can pray and fellowship with God, and we can be bold before God.</p><p>Now we come to the third point, which is covered in 2 Corinthians 5:21: "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him." We were sinful. But through Christ being made sin on our behalf, we were saved. Those who have received salvation through the work of Christ are the righteousness of God in Christ. This matches the word in 1 Corinthians 1:30. First Corinthians 1:30 shows us that "Christ Jesus...became...to us...righteousness," while 2 Corinthians 5:21 shows us that "we...become the righteousness of God." The One who knew no sin was made sin on our behalf, and those who confess this One become the righteousness of God.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S REDEMPTION<br />EXPRESSING GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>I do not know how to put this, but it is a most wonderful thing that we are the righteousness of God. The Bible tells us that our righteousness is Christ, that God's righteousness is us. God has made Christ our righteousness, and He has made us the righteousness of God in Christ. What is the meaning of the expression "we become the righteousness of God"? This means that if anyone wants to know what God's righteousness is, and if anyone wants to see God's righteousness, all he has to do is find a Christian. God's righteousness is displayed in Christians. Hence, Christians are the righteousness of God.</p><p>Before we believed in the Lord, we were not clear what righteousness is and what unrighteousness is according to God's standard. Even after we become a Christian, we are still not necessarily clear about righteousness and unrighteousness. God not only has to save us; He has to teach us the lesson of righteousness. God's redemption saves unrighteous ones, and His redemption teaches us the meaning of righteousness.</p><p>In the first chapter, we saw that God cannot forgive our sins easily. When we sin, we break the law, and God is a God who honors the law. God loves us, yet He cannot disregard the law. He wants to forgive us, yet He cannot break the law. Therefore, He paid the price that we should have paid ourselves. This is the meaning of redemption. In order to forgive our sins, God sent His Son to bear our punishment. Since Christ has borne our sins, we can now come to God through Christ. God cannot reject anyone who comes to Him through Christ, because Christ's cross has satisfied God's righteous requirement.</p><p>Some may think that if God wants to save us, He can simply do it, and there is no need to send the Son or to crucify Him on the cross to shed His blood for us. They think there is no need for God to go to such lengths, but they have never thought of the matter of righteousness. We have to realize that God wants very much to save us, yet He cannot be unrighteous. In His heart, He wants to save us, but He must be righteous. What would happen if He allowed us to be saved easily, and what if He took away Hades, death, and the lake of fire? The consequence is very serious! If God took away Hades, He would take away His righteousness; if He took away death, He would take away His righteousness; and if He took away the lake of fire, He would also take away His righteousness. God is responsible to Himself for His righteousness. Although He does not have to be responsible to anyone, He cannot be careless with Himself; He has to be responsible to Himself. God must be righteous towards Himself.</p><p>When a Christian comes to God through Christ, others see him as the righteousness of God. This means that God has not forgiven men carelessly or without any ground. He forgives men righteously. He has given us His Son for the satisfaction of the demand of His law. When we stand before God and present Christ to Him, we become the righteousness of God. To say that we are the righteousness of God has nothing to do with our Christian conduct; it has to do with being the manifestation of God's righteousness through the redemption of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>We had our entrance through the way of righteousness; this is the way we were saved. The result of this is that as Christians, we should learn righteousness. We cannot be careless in anything. Since God has been righteous in saving us, we do not match God and are not compatible with Him if we are not righteous. Redemption makes us an expression of God's righteousness. What redemption has taught us should be expressed as God's righteousness in our lives. We should live our life on earth as righteous ones. We have to remember that God could not be unrighteous in saving us; He could not be unrighteous toward Himself. His nature is such that He has to be righteous. He cannot perform an unrighteous act or let an unrighteous act go unpunished. Since every saved person, every Christian, is a specimen and an expression of God's righteousness, how can we do anything unrighteous? If the unique supreme God has to be righteous, how much more should we spend our days on earth in righteousness? We can learn one lesson immediately: anything unrighteous does not resemble God, any violation of others' rights does not resemble God, and any neglect of our own duty does not resemble God. We must remember that for the sake of righteousness, God paid a righteous price, the price of His Son. God has sacrificed His Son for the sake of righteousness. Jesus of Nazareth, the crucified One, is God's righteous price. For the sake of righteousness, God paid a great price. Now what should we do? We cannot be unrighteous for fear of paying a price. For a while, it may be convenient and advantageous to compromise. But if we are an unrighteous person, we will eat the fruit of unrighteousness in the end.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, in order to advance in this way, we must first consider how we initially entered this way. In saving us, God did not bring us in through the back door; He welcomed us through the front door. Thank and praise God that we were saved in a respectable way. In bringing us in in this way, God shut up every mouth; He saved us in a righteous way. If God were unrighteous in any way, the devil would have something to say, because he is forever standing on God's opposite side. The devil would say that God saved men unrighteously. We thank the Lord that He prepared a salvation that even shuts the mouth of the devil. God saved us in a way that no one can overturn. First John 1:9 says, "He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." God saved us according to His righteousness. Hallelujah, this is the way we came in! Since God was not loose and unrighteous in saving us, we should not be loose in anything that we do throughout our life.</p><p>We have to learn the principle of righteousness. What does it mean to be righteous? Being righteous is owing others nothing; it is refusing to take what one does not deserve, and refusing to give what should not be given. To repeat, since God is not unrighteous concerning Himself, we who belong to Him cannot be unrighteous either. We cannot owe anyone anything. Whether or not we can be a proper Christian and grow depends on our view and feeling concerning righteousness at the time we entered the gate. It hurts our heart to see some so-called Christians having no sense of righteousness at all. They never feel that they have done anything unrighteous. Some have not even apologized once to anyone since they became a Christian. Does this mean that they have always been right? There can only be two possibilities as to why they have never apologized. Either they have been right all the time and never been wrong, or they have been wrong and not confessed that they were wrong. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we do not deceive ourselves to think that we are never wrong. May we not put aside confession through the hardening of our heart or the saving of our face.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH UNRIGHTEOUS THINGS</h2><p>In order to learn righteousness, we have to learn to deal with all the unrighteous things. Before we became a Christian, we might have done many unrighteous things, such as taking advantage of others, deceiving others, or unconsciously taking their possessions as our own. All these are unrighteousnesses. Some might even have done worse. Some have been unrighteous not only in material things, but with respect to the rights of others. Everyone has his own right. If you do not respect the rights of others, you are being unrighteous. Some parents argue with each other all the time. There is no peace between them all year round, and their children are deprived of the peace they deserve. As a result, the parents have trampled the rights of their children under their feet. This is being unrighteous. Some husbands have not fulfilled their duty as husbands. Some wives have not fulfilled their duty as wives. These are also unrighteousnesses. Now that we have become Christians, we should learn to deal with these unrighteous things.</p><p>How well we run the race before us depends on how well we have learned the first lesson. God's redemption tells us that God has saved us in such a righteous way that we can no longer live carelessly on earth; we have to be righteous. At least we should learn this one lesson. Once we know of any unrighteousness, we have to deal with it because all unrighteousnesses are sins. Many people only know pride, jealousy, murder, and arson as sins. They have not seen what unrighteousness is. God has to bring us to the point where we see unrighteouseness item by item. When we find any unrighteousness, we have to deal with it. If we do not deal with our unrighteousness, we cannot express God. When others see us, they will not see God's righteousness and not know what God's righteousness is all about. We must let others see God's righteousness in our daily lives. In the following paragraphs we will consider how to deal with unrighteousness.</p><h2 class="head2">Dealing with Unrighteous Money</h2><p>The thing that touches us the most is money. Hence, we must first learn righteousness in the way we deal with money. We cannot spend other people's money, much less can we steal money from others. We cannot turn other people's money into our own by improper means. Turning what is not ours into something that is ours through any improper means or in any subconscious way is unrighteousness. If there are such things, we have to deal with them. We cannot borrow something from others and never return it to them. At the beginning of our Christian life, we should do our best to clear up any financial entanglements with others; we must not be loose in this matter. If God has shown you that you owe others anything, that you have stolen from others, or that you have extorted from others, you have to deal with it. You have to deal with any evasion or omission in tax that is due the government. You must deal with the matter of money very seriously. You have to deal with everything in the past that the Lord puts His finger on, and you have to do your best to preserve yourself in this matter in the future. If you are loose in this matter, you will be loose in every matter. One cannot be loose or foolish about money. If you cannot financially afford to repay everything all at once, you must first confess to others what you owe, and then do your best to make restitution later. Repay if you can, but if you cannot repay now, confess first and then repay later.</p><h2 class="head2">Dealing with Material Things That We Owe Others</h2><p>Other than money, we have to deal with other material things that we owe to others. We should not have the habit of coveting others' possessions, and we should never borrow something from others without returning it to them promptly. Many times we have the bad habit of being careful with our own things and careless with the things of others. This is unrighteousness. We have to learn to be conscientious with others' possessions. We still have some borrowed items that should be returned to the owner. Some borrowed items have been lost; we should purchase similar items and return them to the owner or pay back the equivalent. We should not borrow some items from others anymore. Many people have failed in these material things, and we must be extremely careful. In all these matters we have to express God's righteousness. We cannot be loose or careless in handling material things.</p><h2 class="head2">Dealing with Covetousness</h2><p>We need to deal thoroughly with material things, and we also need to deal with the greed within us. Covetousness is a very bad habit as well as an inclination. We have to learn to benefit others, to care for others. We should not hope to gain from or take advantage of others. We must learn not to profit at the expense of others. Doing so is unrighteous.</p><p>Consider the example of rickshaw fares. Some of my friends realize that there are certain days that are slow days for the rickshaw drivers. The routes that they want to take are often unfamiliar to the rickshaw drivers. As a result, they bargain for a lower fare. But if we care for righteousness, should we try to take advantage of these circumstances? Outwardly speaking, it is not wrong for us to pay as we have agreed to be charged. But according to the Christian standard, we should pay the rickshaw driver a little more than what is required. Not only is robbing others unrighteous; greediness and taking advantage of others are also unrighteous. Even when others approve of what we do, we are often still unrighteous. Others may approve of us and agree to take up the loss because they have no choice, but a Christian should not do anything like this. In our business transactions, we should not calculate how much we can take advantage of others, but how much is a fair price. Righteousness will bring us to the point that we satisfy our Christian conscience within. It is not what others say, but whether our inner being agrees or disagrees.</p><h2 class="head2">Dealing with the Unrighteous<br />Infringement upon Others' Rights</h2><p>Not only can we be unrighteous in material things, but we can be unrighteous with respect to the rights of others. For example, there are set times for work and rest in public places. When it is time to rest, others have the right to rest. If we shout and yell while others are resting, we are disturbing their rest and are being unrighteous. Another example of infringing upon the rights of others is browsing over their documents. This is also unrighteousness. When we travel, we have to follow the proper order in boarding and unboarding buses. If we are at the end of a line and try to cut into the line, we are infringing upon the rights of others. This is unrighteousness. We should be sensitive concerning things of this nature, and we must deal with them; otherwise, we are not being righteous.</p><h2 class="head2">Confessing Our Wrongs</h2><p>There are many other things of a similar nature, and we cannot enumerate them all. If we are willing to be enlightened by the Lord, He will show us many unrighteous things. Once we see that we are wrong, we should not be afraid of confessing our wrong. When we first become a Christian, it is inevitable that we will make mistakes. The worst thing is being ignorant of our mistakes or refusing to admit our mistakes once we know them. Being ignorant of our mistakes is being in darkness. Sins can be forgiven, but darkness cannot be forgiven. If we confess our sins, the Lord will forgive us. But darkness makes us ignorant of our sins; therefore, we cannot enjoy forgiveness. The Lord said, "I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness" (John 8:12). If we do not have the light, we will not be able to tell the difference between black and white. If we are in the light, we will see what unrighteousness is and what sin is.</p><p>For a new believer, nothing is more important than knowing what unrighteousness is. For a Christian, as he grows, the most important thing is becoming more and more sensitive to unrighteousness and dealing with all unrighteousness more and more seriously.</p><p>A brother once said, "When I was first saved, I wrote a hundred letters of apology and confession the first year and another hundred the second year. In spite of that, I only knew sin but did not know unrighteousness. I knew that I had cheated, slandered, and supplanted others. These were sins, and I dealt with them. But I did not see what unrighteousness is; I did not know what it means to infringe upon the rights of others. I did not realize that I should give others what is rightfully theirs and that I should not give others what they do not deserve. Three years after I was saved, I read a story from a magazine which was about a conference that was held in a certain place. On the day of the conference, it was raining. Someone was sitting on the first row, and he put his raincoat on the back of the chair beside him. Another man was walking up to the platform to deliver his message, and he inadvertently displaced the raincoat on the front row. One sleeve of the raincoat fell to the floor, and he accidentally stepped on it with his muddy shoes. He knew what he had done, but he just kicked the sleeve aside. He delivered a very good message and others could see that he was very familiar with the Scripture. But the writer of the story remarked, `I do not care how good his message is. I just want to see what he will do to the sleeve when he comes down from the platform.' After the speaker finished his message, he kicked the sleeve aside just as he had done before and sat down. The writer of the story concluded with the words, `This is unrighteousness.' I never knew what unrighteousness was until the day I read this story. The word unrighteousness suddenly became very big to me. What is unrighteousness? Unrighteousness is trespassing on others. The man should not have stepped on the sleeve and then sat down. Even if he did not clean the sleeve, at least he should have apologized to the owner of the raincoat. For him to do such a thing was unrighteous." Brothers and sisters, we have to learn to know what unrighteousness is. Being unrighteous is crossing the boundary, trespassing against others, and causing others to suffer. God has made us His righteousness, and He has made us an expression of His righteousness to the extent that when others see us they see God's righteousness; therefore, we cannot be unrighteous in our daily living.</p><h2 class="head1">PETITION AND EXHORTATION</h2><p>Finally, I should add a few words. In regard to ourselves, we have to be righteous. But when we see others being unrighteous, we have to pray for them. The hardest thing for us to take is seeing others practicing unrighteousness while we are practicing righteousness. We may feel indignant and angry. We may want to cut them off and ignore them, but this is useless. We have to realize that they need light just as we do. Before we see the light, we also will not realize our mistakes. If our brother or sister is unrighteous, we cannot brush them aside, ignore them, reject them, or cut them off. We have to pray for them and ask God to give them the light to see. It is useless for us to see the light alone; they have to see the light also. We have to learn to petition on behalf of others and learn to speak the truth in love. At the same time, we have to deal with ourselves in a strict way. We have to remember that we are God's righteousness on earth today. In our daily living, we have to express God as the righteous God. Only then will others give praise and glory to our God. May God make every one of us a righteous person. God's salvation is righteous. May we express God's righteousness on earth by realizing His righteousness, and may we express this righteousness in everything.</p><h1 class="series">THE HOLY SPIRIT AND REALITY</h1><h1 class="title">INTRODUCTION</h1><p>The message in this book touches a great matter in the Christian life&mdash;the Holy Spirit and reality. With concrete examples, it demonstrates that behind everything spiritual there is the reality. This reality is in the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit leads men into the knowledge of this reality. The appendix after the message deals with one type of Christian sickness: obsession. It points out the phenomenon and causes of obsession as well as the way to divine deliverance.</p><h1 class="title">THE HOLY SPIRIT AND REALITY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 4:24; 16:13; 1 John 5:6</h1><p>God's children must realize that in God's eyes, every spiritual thing and matter has its reality. If we merely touch the outward appearance without touching the reality, what we touch has no spiritual value. What is the reality of a spiritual thing? The reality of a spiritual thing is spiritual; it is not physical. Although spiritual realities must be expressed in words, words alone are often not the reality. Although spiritual reality is expressed in our daily lives, legalistic formalities are not realities. Although spiritual reality is manifested through our behavior, human performance is not reality.</p><h2 class="head1">WHAT IS SPIRITUAL REALITY?</h2><p>What then is spiritual reality? The Lord said that "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness" (John 4:24). The word "truthfulness" can be translated as "reality." The Lord also said, "But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality" (16:13). First John 5:6 says, "The Spirit is He who testifies, because the Spirit is the reality." This shows us that God is Spirit, and everything related to God has to be in spirit. The Spirit of truth is the Spirit of reality. Hence, spiritual reality must be in the Holy Spirit. Spiritual reality is something that transcends people and things. Only that which is in the Holy Spirit is spiritual reality. All spiritual things are sustained in the Holy Spirit. Once a spiritual thing moves away from the Holy Spirit, it becomes letter and form, and it is dead. All spiritual things must be in the Holy Spirit before they can be real, living, and organic. The Holy Spirit leads us into all reality. Hence, any experience that we can acquire without the guidance of the Holy Spirit is surely not spiritual reality. Anything that we acquire through our ears, our mind, or our emotion alone is not spiritual reality. Only the things that the Holy Spirit guides us into are spiritual reality. We have to remember that the Holy Spirit is the Executor of all spiritual things. Whatever God is doing today is executed by the Holy Spirit. Only that which the Holy Spirit does is real, and only that is reality.</p><p>Everything that is in the Holy Spirit is reality. When man touches reality, he touches life. Life and reality are joined together. If a man wants to take care of the spiritual life, he has to take care of spiritual reality. If a man touches spiritual reality in the Holy Spirit, he will immediately respond when others touch spiritual reality; he will immediately say amen. When others who have touched spiritual reality touch him, they will also have an inward response and an amen. This is the meaning of Psalms 42:7, which says, "Deep calls unto deep." We can say that reality invokes others to touch reality. We will give a few concrete examples in the following pages to explain what spiritual reality is.</p><h2 class="head2">Example One</h2><p>The Lord told Nicodemus, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John 3:5). Paul wrote to the saints in Rome, "Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life. For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection" (Rom. 6:3-5). Both the Lord Jesus and Paul spoke of the reality of baptism.</p><p>However, some only view this matter from the physical point of view. Their eyes see only water. They say that once a man is washed in the water, he is regenerated. They have not touched the spiritual reality. Some tackle the subject with their mind. They realize that water alone cannot regenerate a person. Therefore, they assert that the baptisms of some are real and inward, and that these ones can enter God's kingdom. However, the baptisms of others are false and outward, and these ones cannot enter God's kingdom. They have not touched the spiritual reality either.</p><p>The baptism that the Lord mentioned to Nicodemus was a reality. The baptism that Paul saw was a burial with the Lord, with the result of one walking in newness of life. To the Colossian believers, he spoke of being "buried together with Him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with Him" (Col. 2:12). Paul saw that baptism and burial are one and the same thing, and he also saw that baptism and resurrection are one and the same thing. Paul knew what it meant to be buried with the Lord and to be raised up together with the Lord. He did not only see the baptismal water. Nor was he merely concerned with whether a baptism was true or false. He was speaking of the reality of baptism.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, if you see that baptism is a reality, you will spontaneously know what baptism is. In your mind, there will not be a distinction between real and false baptism, and there will be no question of an outward or inward baptism. You will see that baptism is being buried with the Lord and being raised up together with Him. Once you see this reality, you will exclaim, "Baptism is a great matter. It is too real and too all-inclusive." Once a man sees this reality, false things can no longer remain in him. If a man says, "I have been baptized, but I wish that I could be buried and raised up together with the Lord," he has not touched spiritual reality. Baptism is one thing to him, and burial and resurrection are another. Yet those who know spiritual reality know what burial is and what resurrection is. They know that baptism is burial and resurrection. Baptism is these very things to him.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, have you seen this? A man will never see spiritual things if he tries to see them with his physical eyes. A man will never understand spiritual things if he tries to understand them with his mind. All spiritual things have their realities. Once we touch the realities, all problems will go away.</p><h2 class="head2">Example Two</h2><p>The same is true with the breaking of bread. On the night the Lord Jesus was betrayed, "Jesus took bread and blessed it, and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is My body. And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. But I say to you, I shall by no means drink of this product of the vine..." (Matt. 26:26-29a). Some look at this from a physical point of view and say that once the bread and the cup are blessed, the bread changes its nature, becoming the Lord's flesh, and the vine product changes its substance, becoming the Lord's blood. Some look at this from an intellectual point of view and argue that the bread and the wine have not changed in substance; rather, they are merely representations. The bread represents the Lord's body, and the vine product represents the Lord's blood. But the emphasis in the Word of God is not on a change in substance or on the matter of representation, it is on a spiritual reality. When we "take, eat," there is a spiritual reality behind it. When we "drink of it, all of you," there is a spiritual reality to it. He said, "This is My body." He did not say, "This represents My body." He said, "This is My blood of the covenant." Following this, He said, "I shall by no means drink of this product of the vine." This means that the product of the vine did not turn into blood, and neither was it a representation of the blood. In speaking of the bread and the cup, the Lord's emphasis was on the spiritual reality. In the eyes of the Lord, there are no representations, and there is no change of substance. Paul said the same thing. "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ?" (1 Cor. 10:16). It was bread, yet Paul recognized it as the Body of Christ. It was a cup, yet he recognized it as the blood of Christ. This shows that in Paul's mind, there was no such thing as a representation or a change in substance. These things were a spiritual reality to him. Following this, Paul said, "Seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body" (v. 17, ASV). He could not have said this if he had not touched the spiritual reality. When a man says a fact, it is stated as a fact. If it is a parable, it is stated as a parable. If it is a plain narration, it is presented as a plain narration, and if it is a figure of speech, it is explained as a figure of speech. But here Paul was different. The phrase "we, who are many" is a direct narration, while "are one bread" is a figure of speech. In one sentence, he put a direct narration together with a figure of speech. This is because with Paul, "we, who are many" is a fact, and "are one bread, one body" is also a fact. To him, the spiritual reality is so real that after he said, "we, who are many," he followed with the words "are one bread, one body." He was not thinking about the grammatical structure or the syntax. Here was a person who truly knew the Lord. When he took the bread, he was truly partaking of the Body of Christ. He forgot about the bread, and was touching the spiritual reality. When he took the cup, he was truly partaking of the blood of Christ. He forgot the vine product, and was touching the spiritual reality. Language was no longer a problem to him, and doctrine was no longer a problem to him because he touched the reality.</p><h2 class="head2">Example Three</h2><p>The church is an even more interesting subject. When some people mention the church, they try to differentiate between the true church and the false church. But the Lord said to Peter, "And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in the heavens" (Matt. 16:18-19). This is what the church is in the Lord's mind. In the Lord's mind, the church is always real; there is no such thing as a false church. Not only is this true with the universal church, but this is even true with the local churches. He says, "Moreover if your brother sins against you, go, reprove him between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector. Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven" (18:15-18). In the Lord's mind, when the church says that a brother is right, he is right, and when the church says that a brother is wrong, he is wrong. When we read this, it is easy for us to ask the question: What if the judgment of the church is wrong? But when the Lord spoke these words, He was talking about the reality of the church. If the judgment is wrong, it must not have come from reality, and it must not be of the Holy Spirit, but of man. In the Lord's mind, the church is a reality. Anything outside this reality has no place in the Lord's mind at all.</p><p>When Paul spoke of the church in his Epistles, he said that it is called, it is holy, and it is the house of God (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:2; Eph. 2:22). The apostle John said the same thing as Paul concerning the church. The seven churches in Asia had many failures, but John still called them the churches. The Lord Jesus also said, "The seven lampstands are the seven churches" (Rev. 1:4, 20).</p><p>In the eyes of the apostles, the seven lampstands are the seven churches because the church is a reality. In the eyes of the apostles, the matter of a false church did not exist, because the church is a reality. This does not mean that there are no false churches in this world. But it does mean that if one does not see the reality of the church, his eyes surely will see something wrong. Those who look at the church outwardly will say that there is only the real church, and those who look at the church mentally will say that there are real churches and false churches. But in the eyes of those who have touched the spiritual reality, the church is spiritual, and all other questions have no ground at all.</p><p>I would like to mention one thing concerning the practice of the Body life. The Body life is not acting according to certain rules. When one touches the spiritual reality, he touches the church, and his actions will be the move of the Body and not independent moves. Suppose you have to do something. Practicing the Body life does not mean that you invite all the brothers and sisters to discuss it and that you go through the procedure in a very proper way. It is when you fellowship with other brothers and sisters (irrespective of the number) and touch the reality that there is the Body life. If you have not touched the spiritual reality, even when there is unanimous consent by the whole congregation, you only have opinions of the flesh and not the Body life. Only those who have touched the spiritual reality can live the Body life. The record in Acts 15 shows us what the Body life is. There was a gathering to discuss the question of circumcision for the Gentiles. Finally, James made a decision that was of the Holy Spirit. When they wrote the letter, they said, "For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us" (v. 28). The decision was of the Holy Spirit. It touched the spiritual reality. Although the words were by James, "the apostles and the elders with the whole church" (v. 22) could say amen to them and resolve to carry the matter out. This is the Body life. Only when one touches the reality in the Holy Spirit can he live out the Body life. The right procedure does not bring in the Body life. One must touch the reality before there can be the Body life.</p><p>We must realize that all spiritual living and all spiritual teachings have their realities before the Lord. If a man has not touched the reality, there is no spiritual value to expounding the doctrine clearly. If a man has not touched the reality of the church, even if he mentions the church in every other sentence, he is still in darkness and pride, and he is deceiving himself. If a man touches the spiritual reality, his living will be real and organic. It will not be superficial or in letters.</p><p>One amazing thing is that a person who touches reality knows if others have not touched or entered into it as soon as he comes in contact with them. Once he meets a person who acts according to his mind, the law, or outward regulations, he will know immediately that such a person has not touched the reality. There is one thing before the Lord, which the Bible calls reality. Once a person touches this reality, he will be delivered from doctrines, formalities, human thoughts, and human ways. Baptism, the breaking of bread, or the church are all realities to him; they are no longer rituals or doctrines.</p><h2 class="head2">Example Four</h2><p>Let us consider the matter of worship again. John 4 tells us that "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness" (v. 24). We have pointed out previously that the word "truthfulness" can be translated as "reality." The emphasis is the spirit, but it also mentions reality. Those who worship God must worship with their spirit. Anything that is of the spirit is real, and anything that is not of the spirit is not real. One does not worship God by the emotions, the feelings, or the mind. To worship God, one must be in spirit and in reality. Otherwise, one cannot touch spiritual reality. What is reality? When the spirit touches God, there is reality; when the spirit does not touch God, there is no reality. Anything that is of the spirit is real, and anything that is not of the spirit is not real. Formalistic worship is, of course, not up to the standard. But the so-called spiritual worship is, at times, unworthy of an amen. One may not be able to put his finger on the problem, but there is a feeling that it is not the real thing. Then there are those who are truly worshipping God; they may not say anything. However you can say amen, because you have touched something real in them; you have touched the reality in them.</p><h2 class="head2">Example Five</h2><p>Thanksgiving and praise are good things. But many thanksgivings and praises are ritualistic. They are not what the Bible describes as reality. Brothers and sisters, have you had the experience in which someone was thanking and praising but there was not an amen within you? In fact, you felt quite cold within. It seemed that the more the person praised, the colder you became. Sometimes a person encounters a problem, and he continues to thank and praise the Lord in a loud way, acting as if there is no problem at all. Is this good? It seems good. But the more he praises and thanks the Lord, the more you cannot say amen. You do not understand why. But something within you says, "It is good to thank and praise the Lord, but this kind of thanksgiving and praise is not genuine. It is not the reality." Some people seem to be unconcerned about their problems; they fill their mouths with joyful and happy thanksgivings and praises. But within, you feel that there is something wrong, that it is not right, and that it is not the reality. You may meet another brother who is not as loud as the first one in thanking and praising the Lord. He may not appear as joyful and may, in fact, show some sadness in his face. But the strange thing is that when he thanks and praises the Lord in a soft way, you can say amen. You feel that it is right, that it is the real thing, and that he has touched the reality.</p><h2 class="head2">Example Six</h2><p>Take prayer as another example. I will not mention formalistic prayers. Seemingly zealous prayers and long prayers often do not strike an amen in others. On the contrary, the more these prayers are offered, the more others become cold. This is because the prayer has not touched any spiritual reality. Luke 18 speaks of two persons praying in the temple. The prayer of the tax collector who "beat his breast, saying, God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!" (v. 13) touched others. But the prayer of the self-justifying Pharisee who praised God loudly did not touch others. This is because one was praying to God, while the other was only praying "to himself" (v. 11). Many prayers that are prayers to oneself do not strike any amen. On the contrary, they make others sick. A real prayer may be short in words and may even be inarticulate, but when one prays such a prayer, he touches reality. He touches the depth of others' beings, and others can respond with a spontaneous amen.</p><h2 class="head2">Example Seven</h2><p>Another matter is the blood of the Lord Jesus cleansing our conscience. Physically speaking, this is an impossible thing. When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, could anyone take the blood which was shed and sprinkle it on himself to cleanse his conscience? No. The Holy Spirit is the Executor of all spiritual things. When the Holy Spirit cleanses our conscience with the Lord's blood, He is cleansing us with the spiritual reality of the blood rather than the physical blood. Something is real only when it is in the Holy Spirit. When we touch the reality in the Holy Spirit, we touch life. But if all we touch are doctrines, the result is death, and we will not have life.</p><h2 class="head2">Example Eight</h2><p>Romans 6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ (v. 6). This is a fact. Some Christians say, "I know that my old man is crucified, but I do not know why my old man is still living today." The reason for this is that they have touched a doctrine; they have not touched the spiritual reality. We must realize that if a doctrine is in letters and not in the Holy Spirit, we will not receive any life even if we know all about it. If we merely touch the doctrines of salvation, justification, and sanctification, what we have are merely letters, and they are dead. A doctrine must be in the Holy Spirit before it can become a spiritual reality. When we touch the spiritual reality, we touch life, and it is living and fresh.</p><p>A person may seemingly deliver a very spiritual sermon. Yet what he says stifles others because he has not said the real thing itself. When a man touches reality, what he says will be real. It is reality that causes others to touch reality. Otherwise, even if there are extensive quotations and references, and even if all the logic is right, those who know reality will still say that it is not reality.</p><h2 class="head2">Example Nine</h2><p>Another matter is the knowledge of Christ. Those who know Christ according to outward appearance do not really know Him. The only real knowledge is the knowledge in reality. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, men seemed to touch Him, but actually they did not touch Him. They seemed to know the Lord Jesus, but actually they did not know Him. Their knowledge was outward and superficial. Those who truly knew the Lord Jesus were the ones who touched the reality. Their knowledge was in the spirit. We must consider a little more from the Bible concerning this point because this is a very basic experience.</p><p>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, men knew Him in two ways. One was knowledge according to appearance, and the other was inward knowledge. Let us first consider the meaning of knowing Him according to outward appearance.</p><p>The Jews knew the Lord Jesus according to His outward appearance. They held on to their presumptuous attitude from the very beginning. They said, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?" (John 6:42). They were very confident. Since they knew His father and mother, they thought that they knew Him as well. When the Lord Jesus came into His own country, they said, "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us?" (Mark 6:3). They knew not only the Lord's parents, but His brothers and sisters as well. But did they really know the Lord Jesus? No, they did not know Him. Although they knew the Lord's parents, they did not know the Lord Jesus. Although they knew the Lord's brothers and sisters, they did not know Him. They judged who the Lord was by His outward appearance, and they did not touch the reality.</p><p>Another group of people knew the Lord a little deeper than the Jews. But they still did not know Him in an inward way. When the Lord was in Caesarea Philippi, He asked the disciples, "Who do men say that the Son of Man is?" They said, "Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets" (Matt. 16:13-14). This was much more advanced than the knowledge of the Jews. Some said that the Lord was Elijah. Elijah was a powerful prophet; he can be considered as a symbol of power. The Lord Jesus was indeed an Elijah; He was a most powerful prophet. Others said that the Lord was Jeremiah. Jeremiah was a weeping prophet; he can be considered as a symbol of emotion. The Lord Jesus was indeed a Jeremiah, one who was full of emotion. When He rebuked the hypocritical scribes and Pharisees, He repeated eight times, "Woe to you" (23:13-16, 23, 25, 27, 29). When He saw some selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting there, He poured out the money of the moneychangers and overturned their tables (John 2:15). He was truly an Elijah. When He was with the tax collectors and the sinners, He feasted with them (Matt. 9:10). When He sat down in the house of Simon, He allowed a woman to weep over His feet (Luke 7:37-38). When He saw Mary weeping and the Jews who came with her also weeping, He sighed in His spirit, and wept also! (John 11:33, 35). He was truly a Jeremiah. But whether others called Him Elijah or Jeremiah, this knowledge was still outward knowledge.</p><p>The disciples' knowledge of the Lord Jesus in the beginning was outward knowledge; they did not have an inward knowledge of Him. Men like Thomas and Philip were with the Lord for a long time. Humanly speaking, they should have known the Lord. Yet they did not know Him. The Lord clearly said, "Where I am going you know the way." Yet Thomas said to the Lord, "Lord, we do not know where You are going; how can we know the way?" (John 14:4-5). The Lord clearly said, "If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him." But Philip said to Him, "Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us" (vv. 7-8). The Jesus that Thomas knew was only a Nazarene; Thomas did not know the Jesus of life. The Jesus that Philip knew was only a Nazarene; Philip did not know that He was the embodiment of the Father. Although Philip and Thomas were with the Lord, their knowledge of Him was only outward; they did not touch the reality.</p><p>Although the disciples knew the Lord a little better than the Jews, they did not know what kind of Lord He was. The Lord was with them for a long time, but they still did not know Him. They saw the Lord with their own eyes, heard Him with their own ears, and touched Him with their own hands. But they still did not know Him. This shows us that in knowing the Lord, one needs an organ that is sharper than the outward eyes, clearer than the outward ears, and more sensitive than the outward hands. With Christ, there is a reality, and this reality cannot be discerned by outward appearance.</p><p>One day Peter had inward knowledge. When the Lord asked, "Who do you say that I am?", Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." Immediately, the Lord said, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" (Matt. 16:15-17). The Lord meant, "You have been following Me for so long, yet your knowledge in the past was wrong. However, your knowledge today is a blessed one, because flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but My Father who is in the heavens has revealed it to you." This knowledge was real.</p><p>If a man does not have the revelation, even if he can eat, drink, walk, and dwell together with the Lord Jesus, he will still not know who He is. A knowledge that is void of revelation is a knowledge of an outward Christ, a historical Christ. This is knowing Him according to the flesh. The only kind of knowledge of Christ that is real and inward is the one that Peter acquired through revelation.</p><p>Paul said, "So then we, from now on, know no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer" (2 Cor. 5:16). When Paul knew Christ according to the flesh, he was fearless in attacking the name of Jesus of Nazareth and in persecuting the Lord's disciples and in punishing them (Acts 26:9-11). But after God revealed His Son in his spirit, he began to announce the faith which formerly he ravaged (Gal. 1:16, 23). He became a different man. His knowledge touched the spiritual reality, and he no longer knew Christ according to the flesh.</p><p>Mark records the story of a woman with a flow of blood for twelve years. "When she heard the things concerning Jesus, she came up in the crowd behind Him and touched His garment....And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she knew in her body that she was cured of the affliction." What did the Lord feel? He said, "Who touched My garments?" The disciples said, "You see the crowd pressing upon You and You say, Who touched Me?" (5:27-31). Here we see two groups of people&mdash;those who touched the Lord and those who pressed upon Him. Those who pressed upon Him could only contact Christ in the flesh. Only those who touched Him touched Christ in reality. The Lord did not seem to feel those who pressed upon Him. But the minute someone touched Him, He felt it. How sad it is that there were so many who pressed upon Him and only one who touched Him! The Lord said, "But in truth I say to you, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land; and to none of them was Elijah sent, except to the city of Sarepta of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. And there were many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them were cleansed, except Naaman the Syrian" (Luke 4:25-27). This is similar to the story of the woman who was healed of the flowing of blood. It is not a question of distance or time. It is a question of who is pressing upon Him and who is touching the reality. If a man has not touched reality, he will not change even if he manages to come before the Lord and press close upon Him.</p><p>Those who know Christ according to the flesh never actually know Him. One must have revelation before he can know Him. We cannot know Christ according to our outward senses of sight, sound, or touch. The knowledge of Christ is something that the Holy Spirit imparts to us. If a man does not have the Holy Spirit, he does not know the reality of Christ. In the eyes of God, if a man does not have the Holy Spirit, he has not touched the reality of the Lord Jesus even if he has memorized the Lord's history and even if he has pressed upon Him, heard His voice, knelt before Him, and prayed to Him.</p><p>The Lord said, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life" (John 6:63). Hence, once a man touches the Holy Spirit, he will surely have life. It is impossible for a man to touch the Holy Spirit without receiving life. Anything that is of the Holy Spirit is of life. If a man touches reality, he receives life. But this is where the problem lies: many people receive their knowledge of the Lord from books, while others receive it from other men. Whether they receive it by reading or hearing from others, they may not be touching the Lord Himself. The Christ that one acquires through reading or hearing cannot be compared to the real Christ. The real Christ can only be known in the Holy Spirit; there is no other way to know Him.</p><p>Many Christians are discouraged at times. It seems as if their faith avails nothing. They say, "I have been listening to messages for many years. I know very much, but none of the things I know are useful and workable." This is because they have not touched reality. If a man tries to touch Christ with his fleshly hands, he can never expect any result. Power did not go out to those who pressed upon Him. It only went out to the woman who touched Him. Many pressed upon Him but did not touch Him. However, one touched Him. Whether or not our faith works depends on whether or not we have touched reality.</p><p>We must realize that the Christ in the flesh can be touched by fleshly hands, seen by fleshly eyes, and heard by fleshly ears. But the Christ in the Holy Spirit can only be touched when a man is in the spirit. To touch the Christ in the flesh is different from touching the Christ in the Spirit. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, there was already a difference between outward and inward knowledge. The same difference exists today with our knowledge of Him. The real issue is how we know Christ. If we know Christ in a real way through the Spirit and touch the spiritual reality of Christ, we will have an inward knowledge, even though we may not be able to articulate or explain it. Once there is inward knowledge, all doubts will be gone. We need to ask the Lord to give us true knowledge, true seeing, so that we will know the Lord, not according to ourselves or to the revelation of flesh and blood, but according to the revelation of the Father who is in the heavens.</p><h2 class="head2">Example Ten</h2><p>It is right for brothers to forgive brothers. But sometimes we find a brother forgiving someone who has offended him in a very loud, forceful, and deliberate way. He has forgiven generously, but we inwardly feel that something is not right; it seems that the forgiveness is too deliberate; it does not feel like the real thing. This is because he has not touched reality. We may meet another brother who was hurt by someone. He is sad and not rejoicing. Yet he believes that God can never be wrong and that he ought to forgive from his heart. He does not proclaim loudly with his mouth that he is forgiving. He does not show others that he is forgiving. He does not seem as unconcerned as the first one. Yet in the end, he forgives his brother. One senses that this brother is not performing; he is forgiving. He has touched the spiritual reality.</p><h2 class="head2">Example Eleven</h2><p>Humility should be something that leaves a good impression in the mind of others. But the humility of some Christians makes others feel that they are striving to be humble. They say with their mouth that they can do nothing, yet one has the feeling that this is "self-chosen lowliness" and "self-imposed...lowliness" (Col. 2:18, 23). It gives one the feeling that what is being expressed is not humility itself. If it is outright pride, one can still call it by its name. But it is hard to pinpoint what this kind of humility really is. One cannot say that it is pride, but neither can one say that it is humility. Outwardly, it looks like humility, but actually it is far from the reality of it. Another brother may not be striving as hard to be humble. But a little remark by him and a spontaneous expression from him exposes others' pride immediately. Others feel ashamed of their pride; they feel that if anyone is qualified to be proud, this brother should be the one because he has something to be proud of. Yet this brother considers others better than himself, and he seeks their help in a very unpretentious way. This brother has touched the reality of humility.</p><h2 class="head2">Example Twelve</h2><p>Let us consider the example of love again. First Corinthians 13 gives us a clear picture of love. "And if I dole out all my possessions to feed others, and if I deliver up my body that I may boast..." (v. 3). Humanly speaking, it is hard to find this kind of love in the world. We can say that there is no greater love than this. Yet Paul continued by saying, "...but do not have love, I profit nothing" (v. 3). This means that it is possible to be without love even when one doles out all his possessions to feed others and delivers up his body that he may boast. In other words, unless he is touching the reality in the Spirit, he merely has outward behavior. It is possible for a brother to dole out all of his possessions to feed others and deliver up his body yet, at the same time, be without love. However, if a brother "gives to one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink...he shall by no means lose his reward" (Matt. 10:42). The basic question is not how much or how little one does, but whether or not he has touched reality. The only thing that is real is touching reality through the Spirit of the Lord</p><p>We must see that in God's eyes we cannot do more than what we are. Some people's love is great, but it makes others doubt whether the love is real or false. Some Christians have such a great "love" that they seem to be void of any human feelings. It makes others put a question mark on their love. In reading 2 Corinthians, we realize that Paul was misunderstood, slandered, and afflicted with pain and hardship; however, he overcame these things. His victory was the victory of a man, not the victory of an angel. He genuinely overcame, and he was a genuine man. He was a genuine man, and his victory was a genuine victory. Through the Spirit of God, he touched something real. When we read his writings, we cannot help but bow our head and say that here is a man who is not too distant from us. We can almost touch such a man. We feel that he was not among the ranks of Michael or Gabriel; he was not a person living among the cherubim. We feel that he was one we can understand. This is because he had the spiritual reality, and when we touch such a man, we touch life.</p><h2 class="head1">CONDUCT AND REALITY</h2><p>We must remember that in God's eyes, there is something called reality. The problem with many Christians is that they try to do something to make things real. However, what is expressed is, in fact, not reality. Many Christians try to manufacture a kind of "reality" before the Lord. They try to imitate and copy. But God does not require us to imitate; He only wants the reality, the real thing, to be manifested through us. What we generate by ourselves is artificial and fabricated; it is not the reality. We must see the vanity of acting according to doctrines. At the most, a man who does this has outward conduct; he does not have the real thing, and what he has is not the reality.</p><p>Therefore, we have to learn to live before the Lord in what we are. We must ask God to help us so that we would touch the reality behind all spiritual things. Many times, we are very close to falsehood because we know too much doctrine; we walk according to doctrines instead of walking according to the leading of the Spirit of God. Anytime we walk according to doctrines, we cannot touch reality.</p><p>A brother said the following when relating his experience: "Once a brother offended me very much. He came to me and said something to me. I responded, `Brother, it does not matter. It is all right.' But within me I said, `This is not right. He does this kind of thing all the time. He does it not only to me, but to many people as well.' I had the thought of saying something harsh to him. But if I said something harsh, he would think that I was an unforgiving person, and he might be hurt. Of course, if I shook his hand and invited him for a meal, I would be seen as practicing brotherly love. While I was thinking about this, a strong urge within me said, `You have to tell him the truth today, and you have to show him that he is wrong.' I struggled for a quarter of an hour. In the end I spoke the truth to him." Sometimes rebukes are more valuable than handshakes. We can have an outward gentleness and win the praises of others, but this kind of thing has no spiritual value at all before God. The question is whether our conduct issues from dead doctrines or from the leading of the Spirit. Our brother truly loved his brother from his heart. But the question is not merely one of the heart, but whether or not there is the spiritual reality.</p><p>A Christian once argued with his family. One member in the family was very fierce and slapped him on the face. At that instant, he remembered the words of Matthew 5, which say, "Whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also" (v. 39). He thought that since he was a Christian, he should behave like a Christian. Therefore, he turned his other cheek. After he did this, he could not sleep well for two nights. As far as his conduct was concerned, he had acted according to the Scripture. But he was so furious that he could not sleep well for two nights. This means that he had not touched the spiritual reality. His conduct was not life; it was not the real thing.</p><p>Many Christians feel that they have one shortcoming: they cannot differentiate between the real thing and the false thing; they cannot tell what is of God and what is not of God. As far as their spiritual experience is concerned, they cannot tell the difference because they have not touched the spiritual reality. If they have touched reality, their eyes will discern what is not reality right away. The power of discernment comes from what one sees. If you have touched the spiritual reality in one matter, no one will be able to deceive you in that matter anymore. A genuinely saved Christian has touched spiritual reality at least in the matter of salvation. It is not that easy for anyone to deceive him in the matter of salvation. In the same way, if he has touched the reality in any other matter, he will spontaneously feel the difference whenever there is the absence of reality in that particular matter. Once he touches something unreal, an inexplicable power within will repel the unreal thing; something within will tell him immediately that this is not the real thing.</p><p>We are easily deceived because we often deceive ourselves. Those who deceive themselves are easily deceived by others. If one is blind about himself, he will be blind about others. Whenever we know ourselves, we know others. We cannot know others if we do not know ourselves. If we have passed through God's dealings and if we know ourselves, we will spontaneously know others. Once we are touched and dealt with by God in a certain matter, once we touch something real, and once we know the way God's Spirit moves within, we will know immediately when we touch a person whether he acts by himself or by the Spirit of God. Spiritual discernment comes only after one has touched spiritual reality. Those who have not touched reality can only deceive two kinds of people&mdash;themselves and those whose spiritual condition is the same as theirs. They cannot deceive those who know what is of the Spirit and what living in the Spirit is. Even more, they cannot deceive the church. They may think that they are spiritual, but the strange thing is that the church will never say amen to them. We must realize that whenever the church cannot say amen, we have to confess our sins. If the brothers and sisters cannot respond with an amen, it means that there is falsehood and the absence of reality.</p><p>Many brothers and sisters are vexing and burdening the church not only by their sins, but by their "good" conduct. Sin can easily be detected, but it is not that easy to detect the many kinds of "good" conduct that originate from man himself; it is not that easy to detect that they are far from God and far from spiritual reality. Many Christians have not touched any spiritual reality. What they do has nothing to do with reality. Yet they still think that they have the reality. This is truly a vexation and a burden. We believe that whenever one touches reality, the result is life, and whenever one does not touch reality, the result is death. Some people do certain things, touch life, and cause others to touch life also. Some people do certain things and feel quite happy about what they have done, yet others do not touch life, and they are not edified. Those who touch life do not appreciate these kinds of works; rather, they dislike them. These works originate from the self and do not bring in life; rather, they bring in death.</p><p>We must learn to live in the Spirit. Otherwise, we may accomplish many "good" works without touching any spiritual reality at all. What does it mean to live in the Spirit? It means that we do not do things by ourselves. Doing things by ourselves is being of the flesh, and being of the flesh is surely far from spiritual reality. Spiritual reality is something spiritual; it is not fleshly. Simply put, spiritual reality is what one touches through the Holy Spirit. Only what we touch through the Holy Spirit is living and real. Any work that a Christian has apart from the Holy Spirit is not real. His work can never replace the real thing in God's eyes. His work cannot help others and cannot edify himself. May the Lord be merciful to us and may He show us that those who live in the Spirit are the only ones who live in spiritual reality.</p><h2 class="head1">SUPPLY AND REALITY</h2><p>Second Corinthians 4 shows us clearly that where there is reality, there is the supply. Paul said, "Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body" (v. 10). This shows us that when the death of Jesus is manifested, His life is also manifested. In other words, the life of Jesus is seen in us because the death of Jesus is seen in us. When a group of people knows the death of Jesus, life is made manifest in them. Paul then said, "So then death operates in us, but life in you" (v. 12). In verse 10, he spoke of the manifestation of life. In verse 12 he spoke of the supply of life. When the manifestation is in us, it is life. When the manifestation is in others, it is supply. But the source is the same&mdash;the death of Jesus. Therefore, hollow preachings are vain. Preachings that do not touch any reality do not render any supply to the Body of Christ. When the death of Jesus operates in us, the life of Jesus operates in others. This is not a matter of preaching or work, but a matter of the supply of life. Of course, preaching has its use. But if there is no reality behind one's preaching, there will not be the supply of life. When we have the "death of Jesus" in us, the Body of Christ receives the supply. Where there is reality, there is supply. If we do not know what the "death of Jesus" means and if we have not borne the cross in silence, we do not have the supply. Brothers and sisters, we have to remember that as far as spiritual reality is concerned, no work should be "performed" by us. When we pass through something in a real way, the Body of Christ spontaneously receives the supply. On our side, we should know the "death of Jesus," and on the side of the Body of Christ, there will be the supply spontaneously.</p><p>Therefore, there is no need for us to tell others that we are forgiving others. There is no need for us to blow the trumpet and tell others that we are loving them. We do not need to draw attention to our bearing of the cross. If we touch reality, spontaneously, others will receive the supply. It does not matter whether or not we know that others are supplied, and it does not matter whether or not we feel it. One fact is certain: "Death operates in us, but life in you."</p><p>Our trouble is that we know too many doctrines already. We act merely according to teachings and do not have the supply of reality. We need to realize that supply is not superficial behavior; supply is the reality. If we know what "the death of Jesus" means before the Lord, "the life of Jesus" will operate in the church spontaneously. If it is life, there will be the supply spontaneously. Supply gives life to others; it is not an exhibition of our own work. Supply edifies others, rather than broadcasts our own experience. The most important thing for us to do is have the supply through possessing the reality. Every time we pass through "the death of Jesus," there will always be some brothers and sisters who receive the supply of life. There will be no need for us to wait to write an autobiography before others will receive the supply. As soon as we receive life from the Lord, the church will have the supply of life.</p><p>We must realize that the help many receive transcends consciousness and feelings. As long as we have the reality, others will receive the supply whether or not we feel it. Life is a fact. Whenever we are truly bearing the cross before the Lord, the Body of Christ will receive the supply. If we do not know the meaning of the supply of life, we will not understand what Paul meant when he said, "Death operates in us, but life in you." Moreover, he told the Colossian saints, "I now rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church" (Col. 1:24). What is this? This is the supply of life. If we see that the Body of Christ is one, spontaneously there will be the supply. This is why Paul was able to suffer for the sake of the Body of Christ, and this is why he could fill up the lack of the afflictions of Christ in his flesh. If we do not see that the Body of Christ is one, we will not realize how the lack of the afflictions of Christ is being filled up.</p><p>May the Lord open our eyes to see that the Body is one. Those who truly see that the Body is one will see that everything they have has been received (1 Cor. 4:7). Everything we have is received; everything we have is a supply to others. The reality that we alone touch before God is a supply to the whole Body. The supply of the Body transcends any physical contact. Paul told the church in Corinth, "For I, on my part, though being absent in the body but present in the spirit, have already judged, as if being present" (5:3). Paul touched the reality of the Body. Therefore, he could say that he was present with them in his spirit, as if he was present with them in his body. This is not a wish. This is touching the reality. If we see that the Body of Christ is one, our spirit will be with the Body, and this is supply. This supply transcends words, transcends work, and transcends all physical contact. If we know God and are in contact with Him, all of our experiences will become the riches of the Body.</p><p>It is a pity that many Christians are still living in outward appearances! There seems to be a supply only when they work, but this supply stops once their work stops. When they open their mouths, they appear to be the best servants of God. But when they do not open their mouths, they are no longer the best servants of God. When others understand them, they can render others the supply. But when they are misunderstood, they cannot render the supply. They have not touched the spiritual reality before the Lord. This is the reason that they cannot render the supply of life to the Body of Christ. One brother may be in the company of others, and he may only open his mouth for five minutes in three hours, yet others receive his supply. The Body of Christ is a fact; one does not receive the supply only when there is the shaking of hands or face-to-face conversations. When a man experiences something before the Lord, and when he receives the "death of Jesus" from God's hand, he has supplied the Body of Christ already. Therefore, brothers and sisters, we supply the church with our inward knowledge of the Lord. We do not have to consciously do something to supply others. We do not have to intentionally do something to supply others. We supply others spontaneously. Those who have not touched reality cannot supply others. Only those who have touched reality will supply others. There is no way to fabricate anything. In Paul's experience, the supply to the Body of Christ is a reality; it is not an act. If we have passed through something in a real way before the Lord, and if there is the real thing in us, we will supply the church spontaneously. As long as we have the real experience, the church will spontaneously receive the benefit.</p><p>Paul's word was quite peculiar. It would be easy to understand him if he had said that the death of Jesus operated in him and the life of Jesus also operated in him. But he said that the death of Jesus operated in him, and that as a result, the life of Jesus operated in others. It would be difficult for anyone who does not know the Body of Christ to understand this word. Since the Body is one, what operates in me spontaneously operates in others. This is life, and this is supply. If we see this, we will rejoice. Everything that the members receive from the Head is found in the Body. We are all enjoying the same Body. Brothers and sisters, if we touch this reality, we will not feel that the church is poor or in desolation. Of course, we admit that outwardly speaking, the church does manifest a condition of poverty and desolation. We admit that, outwardly speaking, individual Christians have failed and individual Christian groups have failed. But whenever we touch the reality of the church, we will say that the church is not poor and not in desolation. The riches of the church are not diminished through the failure of individual Christians and individual groups. Day by day, everything that the members receive from the Head is supplied to the church. Paul touched the spiritual reality. As a consequence, he could rebuke the church in Corinth on the one hand, and supply it on the other hand.</p><p>Ephesians 4:13 says, "Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ." It is difficult to understand this according to our mind or according to outward appearance. Outwardly speaking, it seems as if the oneness of the faith is far away. It is difficult to say when the church will arrive at this. But when we touch the spiritual reality, we will feel that these questions no longer exist. We will know that the church is one in the eyes of God and that it has never been divided. Once we touch reality, all outward problems will go away. If we have not seen the reality, we will not have the supply. Once we see the reality, the supply to others will begin. Hence, supply is based on the experience of the cross, and it is also based on one's contact with the reality of the Body.</p><p>We have to realize that the supply of the word is also based on what we have already imparted to the church in life. Brothers and sisters, if what we speak is what we have already given to the church, the Holy Spirit will testify to our words. But if what we speak is not something that we have before the Lord, the Holy Spirit will not testify to the words. If we have imparted a certain matter to the church in life and then speak about that certain matter, others will receive the help from our words. But if our words merely provide others with clearer thoughts and more knowledge, we will only have fruits of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The food of the church is life; only the supply of life can be food to the church. The question is not what we can give to others, but what we have already given to the church. What have we contributed to the real church? What can we say is our contribution when we stand before that church? If we have not touched reality, we will have nothing to supply to others. Spiritual things and the reality behind the words supply the church.</p><p>Some Christians consider the Body of Christ to be an illustration. They do not see the reality of the Body. As a result they have no way to become a supply to others. If you do not see the Body, there is no way that you can be a supply. If it is the Body, the mouth's eating will be the Body's eating, the eyes' seeing will be the Body's seeing, and the ears' hearing will be the Body's hearing. One member receiving something is the Body receiving something. No matter which brother or sister, as long as one receives something, the whole Body receives it. We have to see that the Body life is not just a matter of corporate living, but a matter of life. If we do not touch the reality, the church will merely be a doctrine, the Body will merely be an illustration, and we will not receive any supply. Brothers and sisters, we have to remember that we are members of the Body, and we are all one Body. We are not alone. Paul said, "And whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it" (1 Cor. 12:26). Was he speaking vain words, or is this a reality? Paul was a person who had Body-consciousness. If he had not touched the reality of the Body, he could not have said such a word. May God grant us to touch the source, and may He grant us to touch reality, so that we can supply the church in a spontaneous way.</p><h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND REALITY</h2><p>If we do not see any spiritual reality, we will have many questions. Suppose you have heard a great deal about a person but have never seen him. When you meet someone who knows this person, surely you will ask all kinds of questions about him. But there is one person in this world whom you know very well and about whom you have no need to ask anyone. This person is yourself. You yourself are a reality that you know very well. Suppose you enter a house that you have never been to before. You will have to ask how many rooms there are or how big are the windows. But if you have moved into the house, you no longer need to ask these kinds of questions. You do not have to ask about anything that you are clear about. If you are living in reality, you will not need to ask many questions. If a man does not know the Body of Christ, he will ask what the Body of Christ is. But if he knows what the Body of Christ is, he no longer will have to ask any questions.</p><p>In spiritual matters, we can only clarify things to the extent that a person no longer has problems spiritually; we cannot clarify things to the extent that a person no longer has questions mentally. Take the case of the preaching of the gospel. Our gospel can only make others believe in a clear way; it cannot make others understand in a clear way. When Philip told Nathanael that he had met the One of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Nathanael said, "Can anything good be from Nazareth?" But after the Lord said, "Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you," Nathanael touched reality, and he spontaneously confessed, "You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel" (John 1:45-49). He touched reality, and his questions were gone. This is the way spiritual things work. Once a person touches reality, he will be enlightened within, and whether or not he can explain it, he will know it clearly within.</p><p>There are many words in the Bible which can easily cause misunderstandings. But if the Holy Spirit goes with these words, a man will touch spiritual reality. Once a man touches spiritual reality, there will no longer be any misunderstandings. Someone said once that misunderstanding is a mark of darkness. This is true. If a man sees reality, he will not have any misunderstanding.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO ENTER INTO THE REALITY</h2><p>However, spiritual reality is often just a term to us; we have not entered into the reality itself. We must enter the reality itself before what we have is real to us. How can we enter into spiritual reality? John 16:13 says, "But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality." Verse 14 says, "He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you." These two verses tell us that the Holy Spirit will guide us and the Holy Spirit will lead us into all reality.</p><p>The two greatest works of the Holy Spirit are His revelation and His discipline. The revelation of the Holy Spirit shows us the spiritual reality, while the discipline of the Holy Spirit leads us, through the ordering in the environment, into all spiritual reality.</p><p>Revelation is the basis of all spiritual progress. If a Christian has not received any revelation, he is shallow and superficial in God's eyes no matter how much spiritual knowledge he has or how good he behaves outwardly. It is possible that he has not even taken one step forward. At the same time, if the revelation of the Spirit is not matched with the discipline of the Spirit, the revelation is not complete. We can say that the revelation of the Spirit is the foundation, while the discipline of the Spirit is the building. But this does not mean that there is one period of time when we have the revelation of the Spirit and another period of time when we have the discipline of the Spirit. The discipline of the Spirit is mixed in with the revelation of the Spirit; while He is revealing, He is disciplining, and while He is disciplining, He is also revealing. Therefore, we cannot say that revelation includes the whole of the Christian life, unless we consider discipline as part of the revelation.</p><p>We believe that the Son accomplished everything that the Father committed to Him (17:4). We also believe that the Spirit accomplished everything that the Son committed to Him. We believe that no matter how great a spiritual reality is, the Spirit will bring us into that same reality. Nothing that is of Christ is held back from the church. This is not just a question of our experience, but a question of whether the work of the Holy Spirit is a success or a failure. We must remember that just as Christ accomplished everything, the Spirit will accomplish everything. We have to believe in the trustworthiness of the Spirit, and we have to believe in the perfectness of the work of the Spirit.</p><p>The goal of the work of the Spirit is to lead us into that which is real, the reality. On the one hand, the Spirit gives us the revelation and brings us into that which is real so that we will see what we are in Christ. On the other hand, the Spirit gives the discipline. It seems that some Christians are lacking in something. It seems that there is very little work and very little constitution of the Spirit in them. It seems that they can hardly help themselves, let alone help others. It seems that they can hardly supply their own needs, let alone supply the needs of others. If a Christian wants to help others, he must allow the Lord's Spirit to lead him into reality. In order to lead him into spiritual reality, the Lord's Spirit will have to lead him into much discipline and trials.</p><p>David said, "O God of my righteousness;/You made room for me when I was in straits" (Psa. 4:1). God allowed David to fall into straits in order that he would be enlarged. James 2:5 says, "Listen, my beloved brothers: Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He promised to those who love Him?" God chose the poor of this world in order that they could be rich in faith. God has no intention to always leave His children in distress. He has no intention to leave them in poverty all the time. He intends to enlarge His children through straits and enrich them in faith through poverty.</p><p>Revelation 21 tells us of the future condition of the church before God. What kind of condition will it be? The New Jerusalem will have "the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal" (v. 11). "And the building work of its wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass. The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone" (vv. 18-19). "And the city lies square, and its length is as great as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed to a length of twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal" (v. 16). This shows us the riches and the enlargement of the church when it appears before God one day.</p><p>What does it mean to be enlarged? Psalm 4:1 tells us that while one is in straits, God can enlarge him until he can enjoy God. This means that enlargement brings in the enjoyment of God, and that straits will never press one down. Those who see the fourth person walking in the midst of the fiery furnace (Dan. 3:25) are the ones who enjoy God. Such persons are enlarged. Those who are imprisoned and whose feet are secured in the locks, yet still pray and sing hymns of praise to God (Acts 16:24-25), are the ones who enjoy God. Such ones are the enlarged ones. Although the gate of the prison was locked, those who were inside could still enjoy the Lord's presence. These are the enlarged ones.</p><p>The Spirit enlarges us through distress. Unfortunately, sometimes when we are in distress, we cannot deliver ourselves out of it. We know that the Lord allowed Job to suffer in order to bring him to the Lord's end (James 5:11). Job indeed reached the Lord's end. But unfortunately, many people end themselves before they reach the Lord's end! Some stumble in their trials while they are being tried. They are in distress, but they are not enlarged. Some murmur against God the minute they are tried; they complain that God is not being fair to them. As a result, they are trapped by their own trials, and they are not enlarged.</p><p>Some Christians are not in distress, yet they are very poor. They lack spiritual reality, and what they have is not sufficient for their own use, much less for helping others. However, some Christians are rich, and one cannot fathom their depth or exhaust their measure. When anyone brings their problems to them, they can always render some help. It seems as though no problem is unsolvable before them, and it seems as if no one who goes to them comes away without receiving help. One can only bow his head and thank the Lord for giving such rich ones to the church. Their riches are greater than the problems and poverty of others; they are well able to render the supply. They are rich; therefore, they can render the supply. They are rich because they have touched reality.</p><p>Whether or not a church can be the golden lampstand and a testimony depends on how many enlarged believers are in that church. It depends on how many believers are rich in faith, who can supply others. When a friend comes to us at midnight to borrow loaves, and we have nothing to set before him, we can go and knock on our other friend's door (Luke 11:5-6). But sometimes, when others need the loaves, the Lord tells us, "You give them something to eat" (Matt. 14:16). How many loaves do we really have? We can often pray for provisional supplies, and the Lord can grant mercy to us. But provisional prayers cannot replace riches. If we do not have any increase in spiritual riches over a year or even five years, we are indeed in poverty!</p><p>What is the reason for our poverty? The reason lies in the lack of discipline from the Spirit and the lack of restrictions of the Spirit. We must remember that every enlarged person has gone through some experiences before the Lord. They have a certain amount of history before the Lord. Their experiences and history become the riches of the church. Many sicknesses are present in order to increase the riches of the church. Many problems are present in order to increase the riches of the church. Many obstacles and hardships are present in order to increase the riches of the church. Many Christians live in peace, yet their end is spiritual poverty. When other brothers and sisters are faced with problems, they cannot understand and render any spiritual help to them. They do not have a history before God, and the Holy Spirit has no opportunity to manifest the reality of Christ through them or to wrought Christ into them. They may have heard many teachings, but teachings cannot replace the work of the Spirit. With those who do not have the work of the Spirit, the Lord's riches cannot become their riches, and they have nothing to give to others. Therefore, whether or not we are useful in God's hand depends on whether the Holy Spirit has done a work in us. A Christian must not be so fallen as to have no intervention from the Holy Spirit, as if he is destined to poverty. We believe that the Lord does not let go of anyone who commits himself into His hands. We believe that every trial is for enlarging and enriching us. Once a man passes through a trial, he becomes that much richer. Every time a man faces a distress, he knows God that much more. In this way, he becomes gradually qualified to supply God's children in the church.</p><p>One sister was saved at the age of thirteen and lived until she was a hundred and three. When she was a hundred years old, a brother went to her and asked why God had kept her on earth for so long. She answered quietly, "God leaves me here to pray and pray." She was indeed a rich person! Another sister was bedridden for forty years, of which thirty-five years she could not hear anything. When a brother went to see her, she said, "I was once very active, running busily here and there. But I neglected the crucial work of prayer in the church. I have been lying here for forty years and every day I fulfill the work of prayer." She did not become angry, impatient, or murmur. On the contrary, she accomplished wonderful works. Her distress had enlarged and enriched her, and her riches had become the riches of the church.</p><p>Some brothers and sisters are not that eloquent in the church; they are not that knowledgeable, yet they can pray. Whenever they hear about something, they pray for it. They pray for the sick and pray for the saints who are in trouble. They continue to supply the church through their prayers. Some brothers and sisters only meet; they never pray. Or they only listen to messages; they never pray. These ones have nothing to give to the church. They have not passed through the discipline of the Spirit and do not know what spiritual reality is. They are poor. Some brothers and sisters, in the eyes of man, ought to have been crushed. Yet they are still not crushed because some others have been supplying them. Hence, the riches of life are not a matter of words of doctrine, but a matter of going through something before the Lord to the extent that one renders the supply to the church.</p><p>Day by day, the Spirit is seeking the opportunity to lead us into spiritual reality. If we do not accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit, He will not have the opportunity to lead us into spiritual reality. Often when difficulties come, some choose the easy way, and others try to circumvent the proper path. They may bypass the difficulties, but they have lost their opportunity for the Holy Spirit to lead them into spiritual reality. The Spirit will not have the chance to work in them to the extent that their portion becomes the church's. If a person runs away from the discipline of the Holy Spirit, he cannot expect to enter into spiritual reality; instead, he will lose his chance of being enlarged and enriched.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we must accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit before we can be enlarged and before we can supply the church. We need a more complete and thorough consecration so that the Lord's Spirit can have the opportunity to do His work in us and lead us into spiritual reality. May we learn something more day by day before the Lord, and may we have more deposit day by day, so that what we have learned and deposited within will become the riches of the church. These riches will one day be manifested in the new heaven and new earth. Brothers and sisters, no gold or precious stone can escape the fire, and no pearl can come about without some pain. Let us pray that the Lord would deliver us from vain talk and all kinds of poverty, and let us ask Him to show us more and more what spiritual reality is. May the Lord lead us through His Spirit into all spiritual reality.</p><h1 class="msg">APPENDIX</h1><h1 class="title">OBSESSION AND GOD'S LIGHT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 50:10-11; Psa. 36:9</h1><p>Spiritual reality is that which is true. It is the truth that sets us free. However, a Christian often does not touch that which is true; instead, he falls into falsehood, and he is deceived and bound by the deception. He does not see the true nature of matters, but is deceived to think that he is very clear. What he thinks and does is totally wrong, and yet he thinks that he is very right. This kind of condition is known as "obsession." Those who are obsessed need God's light before they can be delivered from their obsession. Let us first consider what obsession is.</p><h2 class="head1">WHAT IS OBSESSION?</h2><p>Obsession is self-deception. An obsessed person is like the person described in 1 John 1:8. An obsessed person deceives himself. If a man knows that he has sinned, yet tells others that he has not sinned, this is a lie. But if a man has sinned, yet believes that he has not sinned, this is self-deception. Lying is knowing that one has sinned but telling others that he has not sinned. Being obsessed is having clearly sinned yet, at the same time, thinking that one is as wonderful and as sinless as the Lord Jesus, even to the point that he believes and says that he has no sin. Lying is knowing that one has sinned and trying to deceive others. Being obsessed is believing that one has no sin and telling others that he has no sin, when he has really sinned. In other words, lying is deceiving others, while being obsessed is deceiving oneself. The content of lying and obsession are the same; there is sin in both cases. But in one case, a man's conscience knows that he has sinned, yet he deceives others by saying that he has not sinned. In the other case, a man's mind tells him that he has not sinned, and in his heart he also believes that he has not sinned. Those who deceive others are lying, while those who deceive themselves are obsessed. All obsessed persons are self-deceiving persons. All obsessed persons spend so much time considering themselves that they fall into obsession. Many proud people have become obsessed because they not only try to make others believe that they are a certain kind of person, but they themselves believe that they are that kind of person!</p><p>Paul was once obsessed. When Stephen was being stoned to death, Paul "approved of his killing" (Acts 8:1). He was obsessed within. When he wrote to the church in Philippi, he mentioned his former condition: "As to zeal, persecuting the church" (Phil. 3:6). He thought that he had to persecute the church in order to serve God with zeal. When men suffered harm, his heart rejoiced. But, according to his consideration, this was not enough. He "went to the high priest and asked for letters from him to Damascus for the synagogues, so that if he found any who were of the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem" (Acts 9:1-2). He believed that by doing this, he was serving God with zeal. But was this right? His desire to serve God was right. But it was wrong for him to persecute the church and think that by doing so, he was serving God. He was wrong, yet he believed that he was right. This is obsession.</p><p>In John 16:2 the Lord Jesus describes some people who are obsessed. He says, "They will put you out of the synagogues; but an hour is coming for every one who kills you to think that he is offering service to God." To think that one is serving God by killing the Lord's disciples is to fall into obsession.</p><p>Obsession is a matter of the heart. It is doing the wrong thing yet saying in the heart that it is right. If a man does something wrong, yet stubbornly says with his mouth that it is right, this is lying. But if a man does something wrong, and not only says with his mouth but even believes in his heart that it is right, this is obsession. Lying is being stubborn outside and being shriveled inside. In this case, the more confident one is outwardly, the more timid he is inwardly. But obsession is being stubborn both outwardly and inwardly. It is being confident both outwardly and inwardly to the extent that even the conscience seems to justify the act.</p><p>The symptom of obsession is thinking and believing that a wrong thing is right to the point that one cannot say that it is wrong. This is being obsessed. There are those who imagine that something is happening with others when nothing actually is happening. The imagination goes so far that they become convinced of a certain matter, and they even come up with proofs and evidences to support their imagination. This also is obsession. Some Christians want to do something or desire to achieve certain goals. In the beginning they have some feeling that what they want to do may not be right. But later, as their thoughts are set in that direction, the more they think about it, the more they feel that it is right, and the more real and true the things become. In the end, they believe that it is absolutely right. They consider it to be the truth, and they tell others that it is the truth. This also is obsession. One can be so obsessed that when others use God's Word and prove to him that he is wrong, he will still not take heed. It is not easy to help or correct an obsessed Christian, because he believes that his conscience says he is right.</p><p>We must be very careful not to have any intention of deceiving others. Even when we say something inaccurate by accident, we should correct it. If we try to consciously say an inaccurate word, we will first deceive others, but in the end, we will fall into self-deception.</p><p>There was a brother who wanted to be zealous for the Lord. He felt that he would not appear zealous enough if he prayed with his natural voice. As a result, he tried to generate a different sound. When he prayed this way in the beginning, he felt somewhat strange, and he was conscious that it was not his own voice. But after a long time, he forgot what his original voice was like. Others could feel the unnatural tone in his prayer, yet he thought that it was very natural indeed. Regarding something unnatural as natural is to be obsessed. In the beginning when he was pretending, there was still the feeling, but after he became obsessed, the feeling was gone; he thought that what he had was real. This shows us the pitiful condition of a man who is obsessed.</p><h2 class="head2">Examples of Obsession in Malachi</h2><p>In the Old Testament, there is one book which shows us what obsessed people are like. This book is Malachi. In 1:2 it says, "I have loved you, says Jehovah." This is a fact. Yet the Israelites said, "How have You loved us?" This is obsession. The word which came out of the mouth of the Israelites was different from ordinary lying. They were not afraid to say to God, "How have You loved us?" This proves that they sincerely believed in their heart that God had not loved them. They did not believe the facts, they took falsehood as truth. This is being obsessed.</p><p>Malachi 1:6 says, "A son honors his father, and a servant his lord. Therefore if I am a Father, where is My honor? And if I am the Lord, where is My fear? says Jehovah of hosts to you, O priests who despise My name." This is God's word. Yet they said, "How have we despised Your name?" They did not fear Jehovah, yet they believed that they had not despised His name. This is obsession.</p><p>Verse 7 says, "You offer defiled bread upon My altar." This is God's word. Yet they said, "How have we defiled You?" They were wrong, yet they believed that they were right. This is obsession.</p><p>Malachi 2:13 says, "And this second thing you do: You cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping and sighing, so that He no longer regards the sacrifice or receives it with pleasure from your hand." These are facts. Yet they said, "For what reason?" (v. 14). They did something wrong, yet they did not believe that there was such a thing. This is obsession.</p><p>Verse 17 says, "You have wearied Jehovah with your words." This is a fact. Yet they said, "How have we wearied Him?" They wearied God, yet they did not believe that they had done so. This is obsession.</p><p>Malachi 3:7 says, "From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you, says Jehovah of hosts." This is God's word. Yet they asked God, "How shall we return?" It seems as if they had never gone away from God's ordinances. They believed that they did not need to turn any further. This is obsession.</p><p>Verse 8 says, "Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me." This is God's word. Yet they said, "How have we robbed You?" They robbed God, yet they believed that they had not done anything. This is obsession.</p><p>Verse 13 says, "Your words have been strongly against Me, says Jehovah." This is a fact. Yet they said, "What have we spoken against You?" Their words had been strong against God, yet they believed that they had not done anything. This is obsession.</p><h2 class="head2">Examples of Obsession in the Gospel of John</h2><p>The New Testament also has a book which speaks a great deal about obsession. It is the Gospel of John. The following are some examples.</p><p>John 5:43 says, "I have come in the name of My Father, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him." The Israelites seemed to be perfectly at peace with their conscience when they rejected the Lord Jesus. This is obsession.</p><p>Verse 44 says, "How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that is from the only God?" They did not seek the real glory; they sought that which is not glory. What is this? This is obsession.</p><p>John 7:19 says, "Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill Me?" This is the Lord's word. The crowd answered, "You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill You?" (v. 20). They were obsessed by their lies. Otherwise, they would not have said, "You have a demon." They wanted to kill the Lord, yet they were so obsessed that they thought the Lord had a demon.</p><p>Verse 27 says, "But we know where this man is from; yet when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from." This is again lying to the point of obsession.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SYMPTOMS OF OBSESSION</h2><p>It is a pitiful and tragic thing to be obsessed. Those who are obsessed are in a very abnormal condition. Let us consider a few examples of obsession.</p><p>Some Christians are obsessed in their speaking. On the one hand, they say something yet believe that they have never said it. On the other hand, they may not say something yet believe that they have said it. Others may not have said something, yet they think that others have said something, and they are convinced that such a thing has been said. Such Christians are not only lying; they are obsessed. Lying is speaking something false while being conscious of it. Being obsessed is speaking something false without being conscious of it. Lying is speaking something false and then realizing that it is wrong. Being obsessed is speaking something false and then thinking that one is right. Some Christians are so obsessed that they take lies for truths, wrongs for right, and falsehoods for facts.</p><p>At the beginning, these Christians lie to deceive others. But in the end, they deceive themselves. When one lies, he first deceives one brother, five brothers, and then ten brothers. All the brothers suffer. Yet in the end he pays a great price because this darkness leads him into obsession. He becomes habitual in his lying, and he lies to such an extent that he becomes convinced that he is speaking the truth. He becomes obsessed. In the beginning, lying deceives others. But in the end, it brings one into obsession. For a person to tell another that such and such a thing happened and how real it was, when nothing actually happened, is to lie. But a while later, the same person may go and tell another the same thing, and two people can be deceived. He may then go and tell two more the same thing in detail, and two more people are deceived. When he first lied, he might have felt a little uneasiness, and he might have realized that a Christian should not do such a thing. But as time goes on, he begins to lose his feeling, and he becomes more and more convinced in himself, believing that what he says is true. This is obsession. Being obsessed is fabricating something to deceive others to the extent that eventually one believes it himself.</p><p>Some Christians are obsessed with the matter of giving testimonies. A brother once heard many testimonies from others about answers to prayers, God's blessings to works, and God's deliverance in troubles. These testimonies stirred up a kind of fantasy within him, and he began to think that his prayers also were answered. He believed that God's blessings were in his works and that he had experienced God's deliverance in troubles. Actually, none of these were facts; they were all his imaginations. But whenever he had the opportunity, he would rise up to give his testimonies, and he described them with such detail that they appeared to be very real. In his mouth something ordinary would become an extraordinary event, and something not so wonderful would become something quite wonderful. After he testified this way again and again, he began to believe what he said. At a certain point, he could no longer tell what part was genuine and what part was fabricated. When a man falls so deeply into self- deception, he begins to believe in himself that everything is true. This is obsession.</p><p>Some Christians are obsessed with sickness. They do not have any illness, but they think that they are sick with this and that kind of disease. Many such illnesses come from self-love. They are not really sick, and their sicknesses are not recognized by medical doctors. But they love and protect themselves too much. If they have a slight discomfort, they say that they are sick of this or that. When their heart beats a little faster, they say that they have heart disease. When they cough a little, they say that they have tuberculosis of the lungs. If a doctor truthfully tells them that they are not sick, they say that the doctor is not a good doctor. If the doctor agrees with them and says that they are sick, they say that the doctor is good. They say that they are sick, when in fact they are healthy. This is self-love to the point of obsession. In the beginning, they say that they are sick in order to gain the sympathy of their relatives, friends, and family members. But in the end, they truly believe that they are sick. Their heart has created the sickness out of nothing. This is obsession. Being obsessed is deceiving oneself with something fabricated to the extent that one does not realize that he has been deceived by himself.</p><p>Some Christians are obsessed with fear. They fear in their heart, but there is no actual cause for fear. They might have been apprehensive at the beginning about certain things. But in the end, they become genuinely afraid of these things. Even if you give them all kinds of reasons to not be afraid, they still cannot believe you. If anyone tells them that they need not fear, they fear all the more. This is being obsessed.</p><p>Some Christians are obsessed with speculations. Because of the lack of light, they often take speculation as fact. First they speculate that certain people would do certain things, go to certain places, and say certain words. Later, they believe that the person has indeed done these things, been to those places, and said those words. They can become so obsessed that they consider that something is there when it is actually not there. It may clearly be a case of wrongly blaming a person, but they believe that they have the facts. This is obsession. It is obsession to think that a person is a certain way when he really is not, or to believe that a certain person has done certain things when he really has not. Being obsessed is taking speculations as reality.</p><p>There is another kind of obsession. Some Christians are very seeking and are very desirous of going on in a proper way before the Lord. Yet they do not have any light. Something may not be wrong, yet they think that they have done wrong, and they constantly worry about it to the extent that they say the Lord will no longer forgive them and the blood will no longer cleanse them. In God's eyes, they have not sinned. Yet they are very certain that they have sinned. They think that they have done an irreparable wrong and committed an unforgivable sin. They are full of sorrow, and they weep. Thinking that one confession is not enough, they confess ten times or even a hundred times. Even while they are confessing continuously, they feel that their sin is still present. What is this? This is obsession. One can be obsessed with more than just bad things. It is even possible to be obsessed with the sense of sin. If a seeking Christian does not have the light, he will condemn what he has not committed. This is obsession. Being obsessed is believing that something is real when in fact it is not.</p><p>Isaiah 5:20 says, "Woe to those who call good evil,/And evil good;/Who make darkness light,/And light darkness;/Who make bitterness sweetness,/And sweetness bitterness!" A man can be so obsessed that he calls good evil, and evil good; makes darkness light, and light darkness; makes bitterness sweetness, and sweetness bitterness. He can be obviously wrong and yet be still very confident that he is right. This is very pitiful. The worst thing that can happen to a Christian is to have sinned and be ignorant of it. To have sinned is a matter of defilement, but to be ignorant of sin is a matter of darkness. Defilement is dangerous enough, but if it is complemented with darkness, the danger is even greater. If a Christian lives in darkness, it will not be easy for him to go on, because he does not see.</p><p>There are many different symptoms of obsession. It is possible for a Christian to be obsessed with his own thoughts, others' thoughts, his own words, others' words, his own spiritual condition, his own sins, or anything he has. Obsession is also a very common thing, and it can happen to any Christian. Of course, some are obsessed to a smaller degree, others are obsessed to a greater degree, while some are obsessed to a very serious degree. Therefore, we must pay attention to this matter.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REASONS FOR OBSESSION</h2><p>There are always reasons for Christians to be obsessed. We must now find a few basic reasons for obsession from the Bible.</p><h2 class="head2">Love of Darkness</h2><p>One great reason for obsession is the fact that men love darkness and do not love light. When a man does not prefer light but prefers darkness, there is bias in his heart, and it becomes easy for him to be obsessed. A man may try at first to avoid difficulties, troubles, and the light by saying that he is right. But in the end, he begins to believe that he is right and good, and he becomes obsessed. The Israelites rejected the Lord Jesus because they loved the darkness rather than the light (John 3:19). They did not have the light, and they dwelt in darkness. Therefore, they considered it justified to reject and hate the Lord Jesus. The Lord said, "If I did not do among them the works which no one else has done, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated both Me and My Father" (15:24). This is because they were obsessed. They hated the Lord Jesus without cause (v. 25). We must realize that wherever there is darkness and wherever there is a lack of light, there is a wrong view, wrong confidence, wrong self-trust, and wrong judgment. Everything that is wrong has the element of obsession in it. The result of not loving the light is obsession.</p><h2 class="head2">Pride</h2><p>Pride is another great reason for obsession. Obadiah 3 says, "The arrogance of your heart has beguiled you." This shows us that another reason for self-deception is pride. Those who are self-deceived to the point of obsession are probably proud ones. A Christian may start out with the intention of gaining vainglory and position before men, and then may begin to pretend and deceive others. Gradually, he begins to deceive himself, and he becomes obsessed in the end. Once a Christian becomes proud, it is easy for him to fantasize that he has something, that he possesses something, and gradually he will regard his fantasy as reality; the result is obsession. Brothers and sisters, do not think that pride is a small sin. Pride can easily lead to obsession. This is why we have to learn to be humble.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Receiving the Love of the Truth</h2><p>Another great reason for obsession is not receiving the love of the truth. Second Thessalonians 2:10-11 tells us that God sends to those who "did not receive the love of the truth...an operation of error that they might believe the lie." This is a terrible end. When a man believes in lies, the result is obsession. To believe in lies is to believe that there is something when there is actually nothing. When a man does not receive the love of the truth, surely he believes in lies, and when he believes in lies, he is obsessed.</p><p>Proverbs 23:23 says, "Buy the truth, and sell it not; / also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding." Truth is something that we have to buy, something that requires a price. We would be blessed if our hearts were ready to love and receive only God's truth at any price. But men often do not have a heart to receive the love of the truth. On the contrary, they twist the truth and annul the truth; they hope that this and that are not the truth. They end up believing that this and that are not the truth. They make the truth untruth and the untruth truth, and they appear to be very confident about it. This is being obsessed. We must realize that if a man does not receive the love of the truth once, it will be difficult for him to see the truth later.</p><p>A brother who studied in a seminary once went to a theological professor to ask about the matter of baptism. The brother said, "I saw before the Lord that I have been crucified with Christ, that I have died, and that I should be buried. Therefore, I ought to be baptized. What would you say?" The professor said, "I had a similar experience when I was in the seminary. I was about to graduate, and I saw that I was dead and that I ought to be buried and baptized. But if I had been baptized, I would no longer have been able to work in my denomination. I prayed and felt that I would wait until I graduated and was a pastor. Many years have passed since I graduated and became a pastor. I am still not baptized, and everything still seems okay. You should concentrate on your study. After you graduate, you will be a pastor and such questions will not bother you anymore." Disobeying the truth and thinking that one can live in peace is obsession. Fortunately, the brother did not follow the professor's advice. Brothers and sisters, when our hearts are not absolute, it will be easy for us to be obsessed.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Seeking the Glory That Is from the Only God</h2><p>Another reason for obsession is not seeking the glory that is from the only God. The Lord Jesus said, "How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that is from the only God?" (John 5:44). This shows us that the Israelites rejected the Lord and lost eternal life by seeking for another kind of glory. How pitiful this is! The Israelites' lust for glory turned their hearts towards lies. As a result they believed the lies, began to think highly of themselves, and were obsessed.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEING LIGHT IN GOD'S LIGHT</h2><p>Obsession is a tragic thing. God's children must not be obsessed. Those who are obsessed do not see the true nature of things. In the following paragraphs we will consider the way to see the true nature of things and the way to be saved from obsession.</p><p>Isaiah 50:10-11 says, "Who among you fears Jehovah;/Who hears the voice of His servant;/Who walks in darkness/ And has no light?/Let him trust in the name of Jehovah,/And rely on his God./Behold, all of you who kindle a fire,/Who surround yourselves with firebrands,/Walk into the light of your fire/And into the firebrands which you have lit./You will have this from My hand:/You will lie down in torment."</p><p>Verse 10 is not that easy to understand. If we change the punctuation according to the following way, the meaning may become somewhat clearer: "Who among you fears Jehovah; who hears the voice of His servant&mdash;who walks in darkness and has no light? Let him trust in the name of Jehovah, and rely on his God." This means, "Is there anyone among you who fears the Lord and obeys the voice of His servant?" If someone wants to obey the voice of the Lord's servant yet walks in darkness and does not have the light, what should he do? He should "trust in the name of Jehovah,/And rely on his God."</p><p>Verse 11 says, "Behold, all of you who kindle a fire,/Who surround yourselves with firebrands,/Walk into the light of your fire/And into the firebrands which you have lit./You will have this from My hand:/You will lie down in torment." When the Israelites were walking in darkness and did not have the light, it was natural for them to kindle a fire and surround themselves with firebrands. Is it not good that they walked in the light of their fire and in the firebrands that they kindled? No, the result was that they would lie down in torment. Spiritual darkness cannot be removed by human fires. Light comes from God alone and does not come from man. Man's fire will never bring about genuine spiritual sight.</p><p>Our own fire can never be the source of spiritual light. Some Christians have said, "How can you say that I was wrong? I do not think that I was at all wrong. I do not feel that I was wrong at all." You may think that you are not wrong, you may feel that you are not wrong, and you may believe that you are not wrong, but are you reliable? Some Christians have said, "I have considered a certain matter for a long time. I can say for sure that it should be done this way or that way." Can you make judgment just because you have thought a matter over? According to God's Word, this is not the way for Christians to know things. You can try your best to think, but what you come up with is just human fire. A Christian cannot go on in the spiritual pathway by his own fire. He should trust in the name of the Lord and rely upon his God. Only then will he see and only then will he be able to go on in the spiritual pathway. Many times, the more we think by ourselves, the more confused and deceived we become. We must see that spiritual light does not come from our feelings or our thoughts. The more a person searches inwardly for light, the more he will not find light, because light is not there.</p><p>Let us read Psalm 36:9: "For with You is the fountain of life;/In Your light we see light." This shows us that through God's light, a man sees light and the true condition of things. "In Your light we see light." The first light is the enlightening light, and the second light denotes the true nature of things. This means that we can only see the true nature of anything when we are in the light of God. One only sees the true nature of something when he lives in God's light.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, it makes a great difference where we live. We must live in God's light before we can be one who sees. Some Christians command our respect not because they are good men, but because they live before the Lord. First John 1:5 says, "God is light." All those who know God know the light. We can find God from those who know the light. Once we meet a person who knows God's light, he will know our true condition, and he will be able to point out our error. He is not fastidious; he is merely sharp with his inward eyes, and he can discover the true condition of things easily. Those who do not have the light may consider some things very good. But those who have the light will discern the true nature of these things. Only those who live in God's light will see light. Only those who live in God's light will see the true nature of things. When a man is under the strong light of the sun, there is no need for him to use a torchlight. Those who are under God's light have no need of human fire. If a man lives in God's light, the true nature of things will be as clear and bright as light itself. If a man is under God's light, he will discern the intrinsic nature of things. The only time a person genuinely knows himself is when he knows himself under God's light. If we are not in God's light, we may sin, but we will not feel the evil of sin. We may fail, but we will not feel the shame of failure. We may perform well outwardly, but inwardly we will not know how deceitful we are. We may be humble outwardly, but inwardly we will not know how proud we are. We may appear gentle outwardly, but inwardly we will not know how stubborn we are. We may appear spiritual outwardly, but inwardly we will not know how fleshly we are. When God's light shines on us, our true condition will be exposed, and we will see and admit how blind we have been!</p><p>The difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament is that the Old Testament shows men what is right and what is wrong through outward laws, while the New Testament shows men the true nature of things through the Holy Spirit dwelling within. We often see our error through doctrines, but we do not see our error through God's light. We have to realize that it is superficial to see our error through doctrines. Only when we see our error through God's light is there a thorough seeing. When we are in God's light we see what God sees. This is seeing the light in the light.</p><p>In order to not be obsessed, we need to live in God's light. But the greatest temptation for us is to light our own fire. Whenever we encounter problems, we try to search inwardly to find out what is right and what is wrong. Brothers and sisters, this is not the way God wants us to take. We have to humble ourselves and admit that we are not trustworthy, that our judgments are not trustworthy, and that our thoughts and conduct are not trustworthy. It is possible for us to make mistakes. What we consider as right may not be right, and what we consider as wrong may not be wrong. What we consider as sweet may not be sweet, and what we consider as bitter may not be bitter. What we consider as light may not be light, and what we consider as darkness may not be darkness. We should not replace God's light with our own light; we should receive our light from God.</p><p>The Lord said, "The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light; but if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!" (Matt. 6:22-23). Once a Christian loses the inward light, he will become obsessed. It is very pitiful to fail to see what we should see and fail to know what we should know. We must ask God to enlighten us so that we can touch Him. The Christian life should not be one that is filled with questions, doubts, or uncertainties. We should see if something is right or not right. If we see, we will not be obsessed.</p><p>The Lord said, "If anyone resolves to do His will, he will know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself" (John 7:17). The condition for receiving the light is seeking after God's will. Whenever we are faced with any situation, we should not be so confident to say whether it is right or wrong. We need to ask God for His mercy, so that we may have an absolute desire to do His will. Stubbornness, selfishness, and self-justification can all shut out God's light. If we want God's light, we need to be gentle and not selfish or self-assured. We must be humble. May the Lord save us day by day to live in His light, so that we know what is real and what is true. May the Lord deliver us from lies and obsessions.</p></body></html>
