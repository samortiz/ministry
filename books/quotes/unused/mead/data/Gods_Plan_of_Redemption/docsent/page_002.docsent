   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Part 1 GOD'S PLAN OF REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The following suggestions to Bible teachers are the result of years of prayerful thinking and careful testing in various Bible classes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Owing to the fact that comparatively few persons, even in our churches, have plainly perceived the complete cycle of Redemptive Truth, it has seemed wise to group our studies around the Cross of Calvary in such a manner as to clearly reveal God's Plan of Redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Under this head we will consider</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Those conditions which make Redemption necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second God's Plan of Redemption fully executed at Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Third The results of Redemption appropriated and manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In starting a Bible Class do not spend time in the endeavor to prove the Bible to be the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Take it for granted that the persons who have gathered for study believe the Bible to be God's Written Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If there are any present who do not believe this, it is illogical to read to them passages from a book which they do not believe to be infallible to prove its infallibility.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And do not argue with them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Simply ask them to study the Book for themselves and then proceed to present its truths in such a manner that the lessons will prove the Bible to be God's Word indeed; even as we prove the truth of a disputed question by a mathematical or chemical demonstration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The most logical way to read a book is to open to the first page; therefore, without apology, ask your class to read the first five words of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>GOD THE CREATOR</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"In the beginning God created."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Call attention to the fact that God, the Creator, was not created; therefore we may speak of Him as Uncreated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ask the class to think of God, the Creator, in His Uncreated existence before Creation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lead them to see that He was as perfect, as complete before Creation as after; that His creative acts did not add to His uncreated perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not hasten over this subject, for the value of all subsequent lessons will depend upon the clearly perceived difference between Uncreated Life and that which is created.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>UNCREATED LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lead the class to see that Uncreated Life has no beginning and no end; that it is self-existent and unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ask them to draw or to name some geometrical figure that may symbolize such Life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Doubtless they will suggest the circle.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If practicable have some member of the class draw this symbol upon the blackboard or paper.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At this point it will be well for the teacher to produce her own symbol, which in the charts used to illustrate this course of study is a piece of white cardboard, fourteen inches in length and eleven inches in width, to which is affixed a large disc of gilt paper with the words "The Triune God" printed at the top of the card and "Uncreated Life," below.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>See Fig.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the eyes of all are fixed upon the golden disc, which has "no beginning and no end," call for Psalm 90:2 and Psalm 102:27 to be read or repeated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now have the entire verse Gen 1:1 read.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"In the beginning God created the heaven or heavens and the earth," i.e., the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Suggest the thought of the impossibility of God's creating the universe without a definite purpose concerning each atom of the same.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Illustrate by the fact that the work of human hands is first carefully planned.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nothing worthwhile is fashioned apart from a plan a pattern a formula.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Enlarge upon the thought that God created the universe because He wished it created, and He created it as He wished it to be.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Read Rev 4:11, last clause.</S>
