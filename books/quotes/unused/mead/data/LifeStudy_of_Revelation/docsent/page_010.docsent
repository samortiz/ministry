   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST IN HIS COMING BACK A. Secret as a Thief</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No book reveals Christ s coming back as clearly as the book of Revelation does.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This book reveals that Christ s coming back has two aspects a secret aspect and a public aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is possible because Christ is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Firstly, Christ will come back secretly as a thief 3:3b; 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No thief tells you in advance the time of his arrival.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In His secret coming as a thief, Christ will come to steal the precious things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No thief steals things that are without value.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thieves only come to steal what is valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ tells us to be watchful, saying, If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you 3:3b .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The time of His secret coming is unknown.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all must ask ourselves, Am I precious?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Am I worthy of being stolen by Christ in His secret coming?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. Open on the Cloud</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the close of the great tribulation, Christ will come openly on the cloud 1:7; 14:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Among Christians, there are two concepts of Christ s second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to one concept, Christ will come before the tribulation, and according to the other concept, His coming will be after the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because many Christians have not seen the two aspects of Christ s coming the secret aspect and the open aspect they have been fighting amongst themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Both the coming before the tribulation and the coming after the tribulation have some basis in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But, having tunnel vision, most Christians have not seen the whole view of Christ s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Firstly, Christ will come secretly and then He will come publicly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His secret coming will be for the overcoming saints, and His public coming will be for all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, 1:7 says, Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Christ comes on the cloud, the earth will see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must be clear that Christ s coming back will firstly be concealed and eventually it will be manifested openly and publicly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>CHRIST IN HIS JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In a very positive sense, the book of Revelation is a book of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ, God s Administrator, will judge everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Firstly, He judges the church, and afterwards, He will judge the world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A. On All the World</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ will judge all the world by the sixth seal, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls 6:12-17; 8:1-2, 12; 11:14-15; 15:1, 7-8; 16:1-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During the more than nineteen centuries since Christ s ascension, the world has been punished by natural calamities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But from the opening of the sixth seal, the world will be punished by supernatural calamities.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Revelation 6:12 and 13 say, And I saw when He opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became as blood; and the stars of heaven fell to the earth as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The sun becoming black as sackcloth, the moon becoming as blood, and the stars falling to the earth are supernatural calamities.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The seven trumpets will also be supernatural calamities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first four trumpets will bring forth judgment on the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun, moon, and stars.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The great tribulation will begin with the fifth trumpet, continue with the sixth trumpet, and be concluded with the seven bowls of the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All these are the judgments executed by Christ on the world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>B. On the Great Babylon</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Revelation 17 and 18 we see the judgment on the great Babylon, which is apostate Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Besides His judgment upon the whole world, the Lord will execute a special judgment upon Christendom, Babylon the Great.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>C. On Antichrist, the False Prophet,</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Satan, and Their Followers</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ s judgment will also be upon Antichrist, the false prophet, Satan, and their followers 19:11 20:3, 7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Antichrist is the man of sin 2 Thes 2:3 and the little horn Dan 7:8 , and the false prophet is the one who works with the Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Antichrist, the false prophet, and Satan are devilishly triune and form a counterfeit trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because the Antichrist will be so enticing and attractive, he will have a great following.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But all his followers will be destroyed along with the Antichrist, the false prophet, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ will judge the Antichrist and the false prophet by means of supernatural calamities: the earth will open and they will fall directly into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They will not die, be buried and resurrected, and then face the judgment at the great white throne.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In their case, there will not be the need for these procedures.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They will fall into the lake of fire supernaturally.</S>
