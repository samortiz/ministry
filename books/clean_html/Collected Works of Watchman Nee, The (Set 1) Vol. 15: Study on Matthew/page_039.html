<P>Verse 16:"And He charged them not to make Him known." Those who came because of His fame or because of their curiosity were not necessarily trustworthy. Hence, the Lord did not want them to make Him known.</P><P>Verses 17-21:Here the Gentiles are mentioned twice. Thus, we can see that God has put the Israelites aside and has turned to the Gentiles. This is to show in particular how God has turned to the Gentiles. Isaiah 42:1-4 seems to refer to the millennium, but here the Holy Spirit especially uses this prophecy that refers to the future to signify this age.</P><P>Verse 18:"Behold, My Servant whom I have chosen, My Beloved in whom My soul has found delight. I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will announce justice to the Gentiles." In the entire Bible, whenever it says "behold," its intention is to get people's special attention. The servant mentioned after Isaiah 40 refers in particular to the Lord Jesus. What is mentioned in Acts 8 is also a proof of this. "Chosen" is a matter of will, "Beloved" is a matter of position, and "delight" is a matter of the emotion.</P><P>Verse 19:"He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets." How quiet is the Lord!</P><P>Verse 20:"A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench until He brings forth justice unto victory." A bruised reed cannot produce a sound, yet the Lord will not break it. The Gentiles are already bruised; they are like dogs. However, the Lord still turns to the Gentiles; He still expects to hear music from the bruised reeds. Israelites often put flax in a bull horn and poured oil upon it, using it as a torch for their walking. When the flax began to smoke, they quenched it. "Smoking" Christians not only cannot help others to see, but actually prevent others from seeing. It is easy for them to cause problems in the meetings. However, the Lord will not quench such ones; He still expects them to give light again.</P><P>According to the strict interpretation of the Bible, this section refers to the Gentiles. According to teaching, it also refers to us, the believers.</P><P>Verses 22 through 32 form the third subsection. This section advances further than the previous section. In the first section the sign of the covenant was put aside. In the second section the Pharisees plotted to destroy Jesus. In the third section they not only plotted to cause Jesus to suffer physically; they also blasphemed the Holy Spirit.</P><P>Verse 22:"Then there was brought to Him one possessed by a demon, blind and dumb, and He healed him, so that the dumb man spoke and saw." The Bible speaks of different kinds of demons, such as a weak demon, an unclean demon, and a blind and dumb demon. In man's eyes, blindness and dumbness are of natural causes, but here we are told that they are caused by demon possession. When the demon is cast out, the symptom caused by the demon will also be cast out.</P><P>Verse 23:"Is this not the Son of David?" This means that if this man is not the Son of David, then who is He? From this we can see that the crowds in general had some faith. "The Son of David" is an honorable and great title. Therefore, such an address implies honor. This fits the significance of this book.</P><P>Verse 24:"But the Pharisees, hearing this, said, This man does not cast out the demons except by Beelzebul, ruler of the demons." "But" indicates that what was expressed here is just the opposite of the thought in the preceding verse.</P><P>Verses 25-26:Here the Lord Jesus brought up a very great matter. A demon casting out another demon simply means that one demon goes and another demon comes; it is merely a change of demons. This is like a first robber coming to kidnap a person, and a second coming to negotiate for his release after the first one is gone. In essence, both are from the same source. What the Lord spoke is concerning the fact. Therefore, that the Lord's authority was from God also is a fact. A kingdom requires unity; otherwise, even the unlawful kingdom of Satan will not be able to stand.</P><P>Verse 27:"And if I, by Beelzebul, cast out the demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges." This is the reason given by the Lord in His argument.</P><P>Verse 28:"But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you." What is the outward manifestation of the kingdom of God? The kingdom of God is the sovereignty of God. Where the sovereignty of God is, there the demons have no sovereignty. There are two main things in the Bible: one is the kingdom of God, and the other, the power of God. The kingdom of God represents the sovereignty of God, whereas the Spirit of God represents the power of God. God has authority because there is power behind His authority; the Holy Spirit is the power of the kingdom of God. How does the kingdom of God come? It comes through power. If the King has power here, then the kingdom of God has come, because power is behind authority. The casting out of the demons is the most important matter in the manifestation of the kingdom of God.</P><P>Verse 29:"Or how can anyone enter into the house of the strong man and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will thoroughly plunder his house." All spiritual works are open plundering, not secret stealing. It is the same in dealing with Satan. The term "goods," strictly speaking, refers to all those who are demon possessed. Broadly speaking, it refers to all unbelievers (1 John 5:19). The "strong man" is Satan, a mighty one. Every demon possessed person and every unbeliever have become the goods in Satan's hand. Therefore, he will guard them. The Lord sees such power of Satan, so He plunders openly. To rescue an unbeliever, to release one who is demon possessed, or to heal one who is sick is to openly snatch people out of Satan's hand. One thing has to be done first before demons can be cast out, and that is to bind the strong man. To plunder is to seize by force what someone is unwilling to give. If one casts out demons by the ruler of the demons, he must first make peace with the ruler of the demons.</P>
