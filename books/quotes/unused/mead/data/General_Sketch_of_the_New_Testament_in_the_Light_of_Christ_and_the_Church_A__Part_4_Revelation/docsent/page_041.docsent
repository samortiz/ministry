   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Walking on the Way of the Divine Nature</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 21b says, And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After entering through the gates, we begin to walk on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After we are regenerated, we have the divine life and nature within us as our way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To walk on the street of gold after being regenerated is to walk on the way of the divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We know this from our own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever we have a revival, we renew our experience of Christ s death and resurrection, and we begin again to walk on the street of gold, on the way of God s divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is the Lord s way?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Himself is the gate, the door, and He is the way John 10:7; 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By His death and resurrection, we enter into the spiritual realm, into God Himself, and into His kingdom, the realm and sphere of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By this we have the life and nature of God which becomes a way for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After entering into the spiritual realm, we walk on the way of the divine nature and live, act, and behave according to the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may apply this in the following way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A brother may ask us what kind of shirt he should buy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we truly know how to walk on the street of gold, we will not tell him what to buy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should simply say, Do not come to me; I am not your way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The street of pure gold, the divine life and nature within you, is your way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now you must walk on that way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is only one way, and no one can get lost on this way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our way is the Lord Himself as the divine life and nature within us, and this way is our leading.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we have the way, we have the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In America today there are freeways and expressways.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Wherever we want to go, we simply get on a freeway, and it takes us there.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This illustrates that the way is the leading itself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Himself must be life to us, and He must be our nature within.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then He will be our way, and if He is our way, He will be our leading, and it will be easy for us to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the New Jerusalem, in the church, in the spiritual realm, there is only one way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Walking on the One Way toward the One Goal</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are three gates on each of the four sides of the wall of the New Jerusalem, and at the center of the city there is the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we were young, we spent much time to study how twelve gates could have only one street which leads to the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First we must point out that the wall of the New Jerusalem is a hundred and forty-four cubits high, but the city proper is twelve thousand stadia in height Rev 21:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That the wall is lower and the city is higher indicates that the city proper is like a mountain, like the city situated upon a mountain in Matthew 5:14.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moreover, the throne of God is in the center on the top of this mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, the one street must be a spiral that reaches all twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Regardless through which gate we enter, we are on the same street.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On this street there is no left lane, right lane, or multiple lanes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are all in one lane, following one after another as we march to Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether we come from America, Africa, Australia, Europe, Asia, or any other direction, we are all on the same street.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this way we become one army, one church, one people, marching in the same lane toward the same goal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This lane is God Himself in His divine life and nature as the way of pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A Real and True Picture of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The entire city of New Jerusalem is nothing other than God Himself wrought into and mingled with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a full and true picture of what the church must be today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more we experience God in Christ as our life and nature, the more we are on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On this way there is the flow of living water, and in the flow of living water there is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From our experiences we can testify that all the things we have said here are true.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have experienced these things, and we are still experiencing them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we passed through the pearl gates, the death and resurrection of Christ, we received the divine nature, and we began to walk in and live by this nature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the same time the Holy Spirit is working within us to transform us into precious stones for the building up of the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Through the work of the Son and the Holy Spirit with the nature of God the Father, the Triune God dispenses Himself into us to transform us into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No human words can exhaust the telling of these wonderful matters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have ministered from Revelation 21 and 22 many times, but I have never once finished.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you would give me more time, I would still not be able to finish.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What is in these two chapters is too rich.</S>
