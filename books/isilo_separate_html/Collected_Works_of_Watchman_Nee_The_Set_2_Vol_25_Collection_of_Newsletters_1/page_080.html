I felt very bad about mentioning the work in Tsingtao. I arrived in Tsingtao at the end of last year, and I could not stay for very long because the Chinese New Year was approaching, so I had to rush home. When I was in the meeting in Shanghai, I was not very clear about the matter of being called. Brother Nee also mentioned the conditions and principles for the work. I suddenly realized my previous failures. In the past my work was really "disjointed" and did not have Christ as its center. I felt very ashamed before the Lord and dared not move hastily. I have decided not to be a co-worker in the formal sense. Since returning home, I have been sick much and have had many frustrations (I wrote Brother Nee once and mentioned it to him). My coming to stay in Chefoo has definitely been with the Lord's leading. As for the work in Tsingtao, I can only pray for it much in my prayers. The Lord willing, I can go and see a little. I dare not decide yet if I will go or not. The matter of going to Tsingtao occupies a great place in my heart and has become a serious issue to me. Now I am dealing with the Lord about this matter. If I can go to Tsingtao, I will definitely let the brothers know. But in the matter of the work (preaching), if I put it aside, it seems to be a case of stubbornness and hard-heartedness on my part. Please pray much for this matter. May the Lord cause us to walk in His will, so the whips and rods of discipline do not come upon us. May the Lord bless your way with grace!</P><P>Your little brother,<br>Chang Tze Chieh<br>July 20</P><P>Greet Brothers Nee, Lee Teh Hsiu, and Witness Lee. Greet Brother Shih, the pharmacist (I have been thinking about him recently).</P><P>The Meeting in Chefoo:<br>Responsible Brothers: Lee P'ei Ling, Chao Ching Hai, Chao Pi Ch'en.<br>Meeting Address: 11 Shuang Ho Li, Fourth Road, Chefoo, Shantung</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM CH'ANG-CH'UN, MANCHURIA</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>One</H2><P>Peace to my fellow member of the Body of Christ,</P><P> Brother Hung Pin:</P><P>It has already been half a year since we parted in Shanghai. Time really flies. This has caused us to really count our days. We want to glorify God more in the time remaining. Amen.</P><P>Miss An's telegram arrived at my place around noon today. I discovered that you had already arrived in Chefoo. There is an elderly brother from Ch'ang-ch'un, Brother T'ien P'ing Fang, who is at the meetings there with you. I hope you can give him much help. Moreover, I hope you can take a trip through Manchuria because there is a desperate need for laborers to come here and work. You can find out about our condition by talking to Senior Brother T'ien. I hope you will remember the work here often. Time is running out. We can discuss this later! I bless you with good health in spirit and body!</P><P>Your brother in the Lord,<br>Chiang Shun T'ien<br>The nineteenth, under the lamp</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_079.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_081.html">Next</a> </body></html>
