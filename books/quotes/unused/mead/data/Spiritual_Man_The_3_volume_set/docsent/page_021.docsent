   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In addition to the spirit, the organ with which he communicates with God, man also has a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This soul is where man's own consciousness lies.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man is conscious of his own existence because of the activity of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The soul is the organ of man's personality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Everything included in man's personality, that is, every element that constitutes him a man, is a part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His intellect, mind, ideals, love, stimulations, judgment, will, etc., are all parts of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have said that the spirit and the body are merged into the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is why the soul becomes man's personality and the center of his being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For this reason the Bible calls man "a soul," as if man has nothing but a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, Genesis 12:5 speaks of the souls that went forth from Haran.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Jacob brought his household down to Egypt, the Bible says that "all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten" 46:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are many other instances like these in the original language, where "soul" is used to denote persons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The reason for this is that the soul is the location of man's personality and the chief element of his personality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The way a man behaves is governed by his personality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A man's existence, characteristics, and life all come from his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, the Bible calls man a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The three main elements included in a man's personality are his will, his mind, and his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The will is the deliberating organ; it is where the power of judgment lies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It makes decisions on whether or not one will do something and whether or not one wants something.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without the will, man would be a machine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The mind is the thinking organ; it is our intellect.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our intelligence, knowledge, and everything that has to do with our mental capacity come from the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without the mind, man would become totally foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The emotion is the organ of love, hatred, and sentiments.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can love and hate and feel joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness through our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without the emotion, a man would be senseless like wood and stone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we study the Bible carefully, we will find that the three main elements of man's personality belong to the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are all parts of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because there are too many verses, we will just quote a few to serve as illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The soul includes the will:</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"Do not give me over/To the desire lit., soul of my adversaries" Psa 27:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Do not give him over to the desire lit., soul of his enemies" Psa 41:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Delivered thee unto the will lit., soul of them that hate thee" Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>16:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"You shall let her go wherever she wishes lit., according to her soul " Deut 21:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"Do not let them say in their heart lit., soul " Psa 35:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"When a man vows a vow to Jehovah or swears an oath to bind himself by a pledge" Num 30:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"Now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God" 1 Chron 22:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"They desire and lift up their soul to return to dwell there" Jer 44:14, Amplified Bible .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"The things that my soul refused to touch" Job 6:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life" Job 7:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The words "will" and "desire" in the foregoing verses show that they refer to the human will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The setting, the lifting up, the refusing, and the choosing are all functions of man's will, and they all issue from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, we see that the soul includes the will.</S>
