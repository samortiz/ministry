   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT FEARING THE STORMS,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>STANDING BY AND RELYING ON THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord sent us to Taiwan in 1949, and we formally began the work in August of that year.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We were as one man in the first few years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The gospel was prevailing everywhere we went.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The number of saints was multiplied a hundredfold.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, this wonderful situation lasted only six to seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Problems soon came.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the ten years between 1956 and 1966, there was a big storm among us, bringing in no small difficulty and frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then three years of peace came in 1968 through 1970.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By then the Lord s recovery had already spread to the Western world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For more than ten years, the churches in both the East and West were quite stable and were in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the storms have come again in the last two years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This may be considered as the second set of waves since the Lord s recovery moved from mainland China to overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know that the Lord Jesus and the apostles met storms while fulfilling their ministry on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, all who were used by the Lord throughout the ages also had storms along their path.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to history, there is no storm in which the Lord is not in its midst.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From what I saw in Brother Nee s life and from my own experience, I realize one thing: everything is under the Lord s sovereign control, and there is nothing to fear.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>None of these storms can defeat our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, we can say to the enemy who stirs up the wind and waves, All these have been tried on our Pioneer, the Lord Jesus, and they have failed to defeat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now they will not defeat us either.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Young brothers and sisters, if the Lord delays His coming, your way of serving the Lord is still very long.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You are being trained here, so I feel that I should give you this training lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You should know that the Lord s recovery and the Lord s new way are God s ordained way according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our Lord has passed through it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the Lord s followers throughout the generations have also walked in it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No one who follows the Lord and who is used by Him to release His ministry can avoid the same storms.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his lord Matt 10:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From the beginning I have prepared myself this way in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You too should prepare yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT OF THE FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believe that although my words are not so perfect, they can give you a good inoculation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You should be able to apprehend and receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I hope that this light will establish the goal in your way and will shine brighter as the days go by.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, you should pray more and go onward positively.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul urged Timothy in 1 Timothy 6:12 to fight the good fight of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even up to the time of his death, he still charged Timothy one he had raised up by the Lord s appearing and kingdom to be faithful to fulfill his ministry of the word 2 Tim 4:1-2, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord s appearing is for judgment, to reward every one of us Matt 16:27; Rev 22:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord s kingdom is for Him to rule with all His overcomers Rev 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These two should be our warning, our encouragement, and the aim of our living and work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Later Paul declared, For I am already being poured out, and the time of my departure is at hand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith 2 Tim 4:6, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And again, The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto His heavenly kingdom v. 18 . This was the reward that Paul gained.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It was also the testimony and encouragement he gave to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I would likewise encourage and equip you with these words.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May you be one spirit and one soul, striving together in this way of warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei, Taiwan on May 24, 1988</S>
