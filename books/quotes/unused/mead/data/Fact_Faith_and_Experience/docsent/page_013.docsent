   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX FAITH IN PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are many promises in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All of these promises are real and can be enjoyed by every saint.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our God is very powerful and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the stories in the Bible, we see how God worked for His children and stretched forth His mighty arm to save, protect, and guide.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God never changes, and the words of His promises never change.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both God and His promises stand forever.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After considering all the work that God has done in the past, we realize that all of His promises in the present are faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the promises in the Bible rest on God s power, love, and faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If God can change, His promises in the Bible can cease.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if God does not change thank and praise Him that He never changes , the promises in the Bible will stand forever.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The present error of the saints is that not many of them expect God to do something for them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many people think that the age of miracles is over.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the Bible is a book for this age.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since it is for this age, the miracles recorded in the Bible are not merely past events.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many young believers, influenced by the unbelieving environment around them, consider that miracles were only possible and only occurred during biblical times; consequently, they no longer expect to see miracles today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The only reason we think this way is because of a lack of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to realize that all the miracles in the Bible can be repeated today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The most important issue, however, is the believers faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many people are not inattentive to the question of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They talk about faith very much and say with their mouth that they believe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the most important question is how they believe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Faith is something that can be put into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reality of faith can only be proved by practice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Faith is not something obscure, but something practical.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not merely talk about faith with our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should put our faith into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Faith is not merely a spiritual term.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen Heb 11:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Faith is a substantiation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is a conviction.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Faith is truly a practical expression of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We speak about faith and say that man ought to have faith in God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But how should one have faith?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have faith in God through the daily things around us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Faith is a heart that believes in God through ordinary circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Faith is not abstract; it can be practical.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we have faith in God, we should not just believe in Him when we encounter extraordinary events and face impossible tasks or absolute perils.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the way the Gentiles take.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not the way God s children should take.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not only should we know God as our sovereign Lord, but we should know Him like children know their father.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are constantly under His care and protection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The powers of the heavens are behind us and backing us up so that in all things we can overcome through the divine power.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Faith needs to be put into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But where should it be put into practice?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Surely it should be practiced in difficult and perilous circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, even during ordinary times, we should put faith into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If God s children cannot commit their bodies to God when they are sick, who will believe that they have faith?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If believers cannot trust in God for their material riches, can their faith be found?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If believers cannot trust in God s arrangement concerning their occupations, can their professed faith help them?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If believers cannot trust in God for problems arising in their families, what use is their faith to them?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If believers cannot trust in God in their work to save the sinners, but instead exercise their own strength and other worldly methods, what kind of faith do they have?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Faith is something that has to be practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Faith can be applied.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can apply all of God s promises to us through faith and make the promises manifest in us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God promises that He is Jehovah-Ropheka Heb ; He is our Healer Exo 15:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If this is so, why are the believers medical bills not reduced?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many people say that they are not trusting in their doctors and that they are really trusting in God to heal their sicknesses through medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But this is a question of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In our heart, who do we trust?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The best test is to ask: if we really have faith, would we be willing to trust solely in God without medicine?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we cannot, I am afraid it is not realistic for us to say that we trust in God in spite of the medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we cannot trust in God without medicine, we cannot trust in Him with medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many times in our sicknesses, we have not thought about God and sought healing apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even if medicine is not harmful in itself, it is harmful to man in this respect.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we cannot trust in God in our sicknesses, when will we trust in God?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many people do not dare give up their present position for the Lord s sake.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They are afraid that if they give up their position, they will not be able to secure another position.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Is the hand of Jehovah so short and the Most High God not able to plan for you?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many faithful children of God have tried God in this matter and realized that He is trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Money is another big issue.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The biblical teaching is that believers should not be in debt Rom 13:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But how many times have men put themselves under debt at perilous times?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we have faith in God, practical faith, how can we do something that is contrary to scriptural teaching?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Why are we unable to wait quietly for God to open up a way for us?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If God is the God who feeds the sparrow and cares for the lilies, can He not take care of our food and clothing?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If He cared for millions of Israelites in the wilderness and provided warmth and food for them in desperate circumstances, can He not care for us?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Are there no more manna and quails today?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In reality, God s ravens are flying everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The real problem is that the saints are either in their fat years or their lean years and have not looked to God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore, they do not see God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We should either not mention faith at all or put into practice the faith that we mention.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>A family encounters numerous problems and difficulties!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Yet how many saints trust in God for their family affairs?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If, as Job said, When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Job 34:29 , why would we not trust in God?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>How many times has a saint come to God by faith through prayer to commit his family affairs to Him?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If we truly believe in God, why are we so fearful and lost in difficult and dangerous situations?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Is not our Lord the Lord of all things?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If the universe operates according to His command, will He not have a way to deliver us?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we examine our daily lives, we will find out how much faith we have!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Empty professions of faith will not help us at all.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Faith is manifested in the small things in our daily lives.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The Bible is full of promises.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>For every matter, there are promises in the Bible which guarantee that God will work for us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>As long as we have faith, God will work for us.</S>
