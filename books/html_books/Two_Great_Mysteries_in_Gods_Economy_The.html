Without the heavenly vision in the spirit we may read through, study, and even research the Bible, yet still not see it. The word mystery is used many times in the New Testament. Ephesians 3:4 speaks of the mystery of Christ. Colossians 2:2 mentions the mystery of God. In Romans 16:25, Paul refers to the revelation of the mystery. In addition, the Apostle Paul even writes concerning the economy of the mystery (Eph. 3:9). How great are all these expressions! This economy is related to grace. God&#8217;s grace has an economy called the economy of the grace of God which is to dispense God Himself in Christ into us. This is the mystery in the Bible.<p>The book of Genesis reveals that God created the heavens and the earth. It also reveals that God created man and records the history of the man created by God. Man&#8217;s history began with Adam then continued through Abel, Enoch, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, etc. The record of creation and human history is the structure of the book of Genesis, but hidden there is something that the Bible calls the mystery. The entire Bible, the Old and New Testaments, contains many stories, doctrines, and even a number of visions, yet we may still not see the mystery buried there.<h2 class=head1>THE MYSTERY OF THE UNIVERSE</h2><p>All thoughtful people realize that the whole universe is a mystery. By looking at all the planets, you have to admit that there must be something. There must be some significance to all the birds, animals, flowers, and pleasant plants. Even a human being is wonderful. Throughout all the generations, many scholars and philosophers have spent their entire lives trying to find the meaning of this whole universe and the meaning of human life. We all realize that there is a human race on this earth, and there is human society. Although we are so small, we are so meaningful. In the libraries you can read things written during the past four thousand years, but you cannot find one page that tells you the meaning of human life. Philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Confucius did not know. Even if you were to go to Moses or Abraham, they could not tell you. They were speaking for God and speaking forth God, yet the meaning of this universe, the human race, and even the nation of Israel was hidden to them. Do not think that Moses, Elijah, or David knew. They did not know because Paul in Ephesians 3 said that this mystery was not made known to the sons of men in other generations. The word generation is a much better translation than ages. Ages means times, periods, or centuries, but generations not only means the times, but the people. In the past generations, the generations of Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, Elijah, Isaiah, etc., this mystery was never made known.<p>Ephesians 3 tells us that this mystery was concealed, hidden in God from the beginning of the ages. The ages here means eternity. This is the same word for eternity. From the beginning of eternity, this mystery was hidden in God. God did not tell Adam or the Patriarchs. Moses and David were not told. God never told anyone. This was never made known to the sons of men. It was altogether hidden within God. Ephesians 3:9 in the King James Version says that, it &#8220;hath been hid in God, who created all things.&#8221; But before the word God you need the article, the, the God who created all things. Yes, God created all things, but He never told anyone of the human race what was His purpose in creation. Furthermore, in verse 9 the King James Version says, &#8220;To make all men see.&#8221; However, this is not the right meaning. The proper meaning in Greek means &#8220;to bring it to light.&#8221; Although I may be here with you day and night for three hundred sixty-five days, not one of you may know what I have until the first day of the next year when I bring it to light. Until the apostles, especially until the Apostle Paul was raised up, this hidden mystery was not made known. Here, Paul tells us clearly that it was not until his generation, the generation of the apostles.<p>Paul calls the apostles the holy apostles (Eph. 3:5). This means that they were separated ones, not common people. Confucius, Socrates, and Plato were common, but here are some apostles who are holy, not ordinary, regular, or common. They are special. They are not angels, but neither are they human beings in a common way. They are the separated ones, because they have seen something which human beings and the saints of God have never seen. They have seen the mystery! Paul could boast to all the angels that even though they knew how to serve and to do things by fulfilling God&#8217;s commandment and God&#8217;s orders, they never realized the purpose of the universe.<p>If you have the universe without God, the universe will be empty. Without God the universe is only worthy of weeping. If there were no God in this universe, we would all have to weep for its emptiness. There would be a big container, but no content. The planets are here because of God. The flowers are so beautiful because of God. The animals are so wonderful because of God. Human beings are here because of God. God is the answer. The atheists may say that this is altogether superstitious and nonsensical. However, we know why there are the heavens and the earth. All of the flowers, grains, animals, and birds exist because of God. There is a universe because of God. This is not superstition.<p>Not only did the apostles know, but today we also know the mystery. We know that the mystery of the universe is God. We know the mystery of God&#8217;s creation. We know the mystery of human life, and we know the mystery of the Bible. However, this mystery is still a mystery today even to so many Christians. They only realize the need of God&#8217;s salvation so that they will not perish in hell but be rescued and brought to heaven. They feel that while on earth they are here just to display good Christian behavior to glorify God and to help people. However, God&#8217;s intention is not just to bring a group of sinners into heaven.<p>The book of Romans begins in chapter one with fallen sinners, even a fallen people and goes on to chapter twelve where they have become the Body of Christ. The book of Ephesians is different. It begins with God in eternity. Your condition makes no difference. God began this mystery long before you were born, even before the world was created. God began this mystery from the beginning of eternity. Nearly all Christians would consider themselves according to Romans 1 as sinful and fallen, but if you come to Ephesians, you have to forget about yourself. This book has such a term-the eternal purpose (Eph. 3:11). In Greek this term means the purpose of the ages. The purpose of the ages was a mystery until the apostles were raised up. God opened His own bosom to show the mystery hidden within Him to His apostles.<h2 class=head1>THE MYSTERY OF GOD</h2><p>We must then ask, what is God&#8217;s mystery? Where is God? The Jews and Moslems all believe in God. Upon this earth, no one dares to declare that other things are God. They know that all those things are not God, but idols. There is only one God. The Jews believe in the Old Testament, and the Moslems believe in the Koran. The Koran is an imitation of the Old Testament. They all believe in the unique God, but they do not know that this God is a mystery. Neither do they know that this mystery of God is Christ (Col. 2:2).<p>The divine mystery is first the mystery of God and second the mystery of Christ. We need to read, study, and pray over Colossians and Ephesians, for they unveil to us the mystery of God, Christ. The Jews have God in name, but they do not have God in reality. They have God in a mystery. They do not have God in reality because they do not know the mystery of God. The mystery of God is Christ! If you do not know God, and if you have not met God, just come to Christ, because God is embodied in Christ. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily in this Christ (Col. 2:9). If you do not believe in Christ, you miss God. Without Christ, although you may say you believe in God, you believe only in terms. You believe God as a mystery. You could never realize God. You could never touch God, get God, or get into God except through Christ. The Moslems and Jews have God without Christ, but eventually they have nothing. The very God is in Christ. If you do not have Christ, you do not have God. Christ is wonderful because He is the mystery, the answer, the definition, the embodiment, and the reality of God. He is nothing less than God, but He is God with something more. Christ is God-plus. It is hard for us to explain. He was a little man who came from a despised region called Galilee, yet this man is the mystery of God. Outside of Him and without Him you could never see God. Whether you believe it or not, He is God. He is just God! In the whole universe, God is in Christ. Where Christ is, there is God. Apart from Christ, you could never find God.<h2 class=head1>THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</h2><p>Christ is the mystery of God. Where then is Christ? In history there has never been a name so wonderful as Jesus Christ. Whether they are for Him or not for Him, today all the nations use the calendar of Jesus. This is the year of Jesus. Every year is the year of the chronicle of Christ, of that little man. Is not this Christ wonderful? There is no man so big. There is no name bigger than the name of Jesus. Yet where is He? Some say that He is in the heavens. He is not only in the heavens but right on this earth. He is right here in this room. The mystery of the universe is God, the mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church (Eph. 3:4-11). For years and years I have been ministering Christ and the church, and the more I minister, the more I have to minister. Over fifty years ago I learned that the church is not a Western bungalow with a belltower. I learned that the church is the gathering of God&#8217;s called ones. However, even to say that the church is the gathering of God&#8217;s called people is too superficial. The church is the Body of Christ. The church is an organism, not an organization. Do not consider the church as an organization, but an organism. For so many years I never saw that the church is a mystery. The church is the mystery of Christ. In other words, the church is just Christ in a mysterious way. The church is Christ (1 Cor. 12:12). So, when we say that we are the Christ, this is not too much. Hallelujah, we are the Christ here! On one hand, we are wonderful persons, and on the other, we are Christ in a mysterious way. Within us we have a mysterious part, and that part is Christ. Christ today is right here.<h2 class=head1>THE ECONOMY OF THE MYSTERY</h2><p>This mystery has an economy. To us today the mystery is no longer mysterious. The mystery is no longer hidden. It is an open mystery. We do know that the whole universe is the mystery of God, this mystery of God is just Christ, and this mystery of Christ is the church. We are the mystery of Christ, Christ is the mystery of God, and God is the mystery of the universe. Surely we are a mysterious and universal people!<h2 class=head2>Dispensation</h2><p>The word economy in the English language is an anglicized word borrowed from the Greek. It contains the matter of dispensing, as in today&#8217;s modern economy. In modern economy, a kind of dispensing is implied. If we have billions of dollars worth of capital, we have to dispense it. Hence, in God&#8217;s economy, the first aspect is to dispense Himself into His chosen ones.<h2 class=head2>Stewardship</h2><p>In dispensing anything, you need a steward to take care of the dispensing. This taking care of the dispensing is a stewardship, a kind of service. When God is dispensing Himself into His chosen people, He uses the apostles. All of the apostles are stewards, but they are not taking care of U.S. dollars, British pound sterling, or French francs. They are taking care of God in Christ as a mystery dispensed. The apostles are stewards dispensing Christ as the mystery of God to the Jews and to the Gentiles. The stewardship is just one aspect, the dispensing service, of God&#8217;s economy.<h2 class=head2>Administration</h2><p>The first aspect of God&#8217;s economy is dispensing, the second is stewardship, and the third is administration. If you dispense anything, you need the service. To carry out the service, you need a kind of administration. The one word economy in Greek implies dispensing, stewardship, and administration.<p>None of us were saved in an accidental way. According to our feeling, our conversion might have been an accident, but it was actually part of God&#8217;s economy. In God&#8217;s economy He wanted to dispense Himself into His called ones. Praise the Lord that we are one of the many! Our conversion was a part of God&#8217;s dispensing, and this dispensing was carried out by the stewardship. God has given this stewardship to some of His chosen ones, such as the apostles who have been much used by the Lord. Through their kind of ministry, this dispensing got into us. Hence, our conversion was a part of God&#8217;s dispensing, and this was carried out by the stewardship. Right after our being converted, we were under the administration of the mystery. This administration is a part of the economy, and now we all are in this wonderful administration. In every meeting there is the dispensing, the stewardship, and the administration. The more we meet together, the more we fellowship, the more dispensing we receive. As a result, the more that we are in the stewardship, the more we are under the administration to carry out God&#8217;s mystery. This mystery eventually is just the very embodiment, reality, and expression of the Triune God. Hallelujah, we are the mystery of Christ!<p>Among us we have God&#8217;s economy, and God&#8217;s economy is just to carry out God&#8217;s mystery. Whenever we meet together we have God&#8217;s dispensing, we have the stewardship, and we are under the administration. Then, the reality of God, the embodiment of God, and the expression of God will be carried out. Do not think that one day when we get into the New Jerusalem we will be surprised. When we get there, we will have been in this for years and years. Even now we are in the foretaste of the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is just God&#8217;s expression, God&#8217;s administration, God&#8217;s stewardship, and God&#8217;s dispensing. This is altogether God&#8217;s economy, and this economy is the economy of the mystery. We are here enjoying the dispensing of God, the stewardship of God, and the administration of God. Now we are the reality, the embodiment, and the expression of the Triune God. Praise Him!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE ECONOMY OF GOD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:26; Isa. 9:6; John 1:1, 14, 29; 14:9-10, 17-20; Matt. 28:19; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Eph. 3:14-19; 2 Cor. 13:14; Rev. 1:4-5; 22:1-2</h1><p>We have covered these two points-the mystery and the economy. We have seen that this economy is to carry out the mystery. Without the economy, God&#8217;s mystery could never be brought forth.<p>The first aspect of God&#8217;s economy is to dispense Himself into all of us. Dispensing does not mean primarily a period of time but a kind of doing, a kind of action. God is doing a wonderful work to dispense Himself into His chosen ones. Hence, the first aspect of God&#8217;s economy is the aspect of dispensing.<h2 class=head1>THE TRIUNE GOD IN GENESIS</h2><p>It is so strange that on the first page of the Bible God is revealed as the Triune God. If we would study Genesis chapter one in Hebrew, we could see that the title used for God is not a singular noun. It is a triple noun. &#8220;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth&#8221; (Gen. 1:1). God in this sentence is triple in Hebrew. Furthermore, in verse 26 of the same chapter, God used the pronoun &#8220;our&#8221; to denote Himself. This means something very mysterious. There is one God, yet He is triple. This is a mystery! In Genesis 1:26 we see that first He said, &#8220;Let us.&#8221; He was talking to Himself and called Himself &#8220;us.&#8221; That was a time before the creation of man. He did not talk to the angels. Surely the angels would not be implied here. He called Himself &#8220;us.&#8221; &#8220;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.&#8221; Then verse 27 says, &#8220;So God created man in His own image.&#8221; &#8220;Our image&#8221; eventually is &#8220;His image.&#8221; Now, is God plural or singular? When God came to the point where He was related to man, He revealed Himself in such a triune way, denoting that He is the Triune God. This is the initial stage in Genesis.<h2 class=head1>THE FATHER IN ETERNITY, THE SON IN TIME</h2><p>We then come to Isaiah 9:6 which tells us, &#8220;Unto us a son is given.&#8221; This is no more objective; now God becomes quite subjective to us because a Son is given to us. A Son is given to us, yet this Son is called the Father. This Son given to us is called &#8220;the Father of eternity.&#8221; This is the proper translation according to the Hebrew. The Father, the everlasting Father, is the Father of eternity. This Son given to us in time is the very Father who was there in eternity. There in eternity He was the Father, and here in time, in our age, He is given as the Son. Now, is He the Father or the Son, the Son or the Father? At that end of eternity He was the Father, and at this end of the age He is the Son. He is both because there are two ends.<p>There is hardly anything which can exist with just one end. For example, a lampstand has a bottom end and seven lamps on the top. The bottom end is one, and the top end is seven. This is why in the Bible there are eventually seven Spirits, and these seven Spirits are just the seven lamps. On the one hand, the lampstand is one, on the other hand it is seven; so it is both. On the eternal side or end, God is the Father, and at this end of the age as the One given to us, He is the Son. The Son is always the expression, and the Father is always the source. When we pray, we do not pray, &#8220;Son,&#8221; but we pray, &#8220;Father.&#8221; We receive the Son, yet we call Him Father. A Son is given, and His name is called the Father. We Christians do not say, &#8220;We believe in the Father, and we receive the Father.&#8221; No! We say, &#8220;We believe in the Son, and we receive the Son.&#8221; Yet 1 John 2:23 says that he who has the Son has the Father. We believe in the Son, and we receive the Son, yet whosoever receives the Son has the Father. After you receive the Son and pray to the Father, you should not leave the Son. The Son is given to you, and the Son brings you to the Father. In our Christian experience we don&#8217;t pray to the Son, we pray to the Father. The Son given to us is called the Father of eternity. This is the way that God dispenses Himself into humanity. He was the very divine source, so He was the Father in eternity. He is called the Father of eternity, but for Him to dispense Himself into humanity, He must be a Son given to us. Hence, John 3:16 says, &#8220;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.&#8221; God has given His Son. Do not consider that this Son is separate from God. This Son given to us is none less than God Himself. When you receive the Son, you just receive God, and in your prayer you do not call Him Son, but you call Him Father.<h2 class=head1>GOD IN THE NEW TESTAMENT DISPENSATION</h2><h2 class=head2>Incarnation</h2><p>When we come to the New Testament, the Gospel of John says, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&#8221; (1:1). This Word which was God &#8220;became&#8221; flesh (1:14). The King James Version renders it &#8220;was made,&#8221; but He was not &#8220;made&#8221; flesh, He became flesh (Gk.). He actively took the initiative to become something. He was the Word and took the initiative to become flesh. In other words, this very God who was the Word became a man. He became a man to be the Lamb of God. How wonderful that this very God who was the Word took the initiative to become a man that He might be the Lamb to take away our sins! This was not merely for redemption. Praise the Lord that this was also for dispensing through the divine redemption!<p>Because we all are sinful, we are not suitable persons for God to enter into us. For God to get into such sinful people, He has to be a redeeming Lamb to take away our sins. We must see that this taking away of people&#8217;s sins is one step of God&#8217;s dispensing. In order to dispense Himself into sinners, He must become a man to be the redeeming Lamb to take away our sins. Then this very God could dispense Himself into His redeemed ones.<h2 class=head2>Resurrection</h2><p>After accomplishing redemption, the last Adam who was the very flesh and the very man became a life-giving Spirit! (1 Cor. 15:45b). In order for this wonderful God to carry out His dispensing, He took two steps. By incarnation He became a man, the last Adam, to be the redeeming Lamb. After this, He took another step, resurrection. In resurrection He became something further. He became a life-giving Spirit! At the end of the Gospel of John, He came back in resurrection to His disciples, but not as the Lamb. In the beginning of John&#8217;s Gospel, He was introduced to people by John the Baptist as the Lamb of God (1:29). At the end of this Gospel, after His resurrection, He came back to His disciples in a very mysterious way. Even though the room where the disciples were was closed and no door was open, all of a sudden He was in their midst. All the doors were shut, yet He came in with a physical body that could be touched. Eventually He breathed into all of them and said, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (20:22). We can never receive the Lamb into us, but we can receive the Spirit, the pneuma. Pneuma in Greek means the breath, the Spirit. After His resurrection He appeared to His disciples, not in the sense of the Lamb, but in the actuality of the breath, the Spirit. Now, whenever we would call on Him, He as the heavenly pneuma, the very breath, will come into us. This is the dispensing of the very God into our being in His Trinity-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father is there in eternity, and after incarnation and before resurrection the Son is right here in front of us, but the Son is not in us yet. He had to take another step to become the life-giving Spirit, the very breath that we breathe in.<p>If we read the New Testament carefully we can see that when we receive the Son we get the Father, and when we call on the name of the Lord, we receive the life-giving Spirit. When we receive the Son, we have the Father. When we call on the name of the Son, we have the Spirit. No one has ever seen the Father, but the Son declares the Father to all of us (John 1:18). The Father is still hidden, but the Son is given for all of us to receive. The Son has been crucified, buried, and resurrected, and now He is the life-giving Spirit! Hence, whosoever calls upon the name of the Son, gets the Spirit into him. We must all see that the very God is not just the Father hidden in eternity, not just the Son appearing to human society, but also the Spirit who has come into us. This is why the Lord Jesus was on the earth. One day He was going to be crucified, die, be buried, and be raised up to become the life-giving Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Spirit of Reality</h2><p>In John 14 while the Lord was talking to His disciples, one of the disciples, Philip, asked, &#8220;Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us.&#8221; The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father&#8221; (vv. 8-9). The Lord was saying, &#8220;Do you still ask Me to show you the Father? Do you not know that when you see Me you see the Father because I am one with the Father?&#8221; At that moment the disciples received the revelation. They realized that this very Jesus, who is the Son given to us, is one with the Father. He is not only the Son; He is also the Father. After this clear vision, the Lord Jesus went on to say, &#8220;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter&#8221; (v. 16). He was the first Comforter coming to be among them, but they needed another Comforter to get into them. John 14:17 reveals that this other Comforter is the Spirit of reality who came first to be among the disciples and then to abide in them. The Lord then said, &#8220;I will not leave you orphans.&#8221; Here we can see in verse 17 the pronoun &#8220;He&#8221; and in verse 18 the pronoun &#8220;I.&#8221; The &#8220;I&#8221; is the very &#8220;He,&#8221; and the &#8220;He&#8221; is the very &#8220;I.&#8221; So, this Spirit of reality is just &#8220;I, Myself.&#8221; Then, Jesus said, &#8220;In that day [the day of resurrection] you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&#8221; (v. 20). Through this second step the Lord comes into us. These two revelations are found in John-one concerning the Son being the Father and the other concerning the Son being the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>Baptizing the Disciples into the Triune God</h2><p>After His resurrection, on the mount at Galilee He told His disciples, &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&#8221; (Matt. 28:19). After He took the two steps of incarnation and resurrection, He had the full position to tell His disciples to baptize people into this Triune God. How could we baptize people into the Triune God except by putting them into the very life-giving Spirit? The very life-giving Spirit is the issue of the Son who is the embodiment of the Father. The Father is in the Son, and the Son becomes the Spirit. Now we baptize people into the Spirit. This means that we put people into the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Is this not marvelous! Now we all can see that the Father in the Son becoming the Spirit has come into us, and we all have been put into the very Triune God. Now the very God and we, we and the very God, are just one spirit. It is in this way that the Triune God has been dispensed into our being. This is the first aspect of God&#8217;s economy. In God&#8217;s economy the first step that He has taken is to become a man. The second is to become the life-giving Spirit that we may call on Him, that the Spirit may get into us, and that we may be put into Him. We must realize that today He is right within us and that we are all in Him. He is in us, and we are in Him. This is neither a tradition nor a superstition. This is a fact. Who can deny that this very God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-is right now within us, and we are right now in Him? This is the very mystery carried out by the first aspect of His economy.<p>Paul prayed to the Father that we might be strengthened by the Spirit into our inner man that Christ may make His home in us (Eph. 3:14,16-17). Here we have the Father, the Spirit, and Christ. Could we see the Trinity here? The Apostle Paul prayed to the Father that He might strengthen us into our inner man by His Spirit that Christ may make His home in us to take full possession of our being. He prayed that eventually, we may be able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth. In other words, with all the saints, we can apprehend the dimension of the whole universe, which is just the capacity of the Triune God in His Christ. Could anyone tell us what is the breadth of the whole universe? Could we tell what are the depths and the heights? No one can tell. This is the dimension of the whole universe, and this is just the capacity of our God in Christ &#8220;that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God&#8221; (Eph. 3:19). I just cannot explain this to you. This is not a moral teaching. This is not an ethical teaching. This is not anything philosophical. This is just to pray to the Father that He might strengthen our inner man by His Spirit that Christ might make His home in us. Then eventually we will be filled unto all the fullness of God. We all have to shout that we are one with God in a mysterious way! This is not evolution into God, but this is immersion, that is, all of the redeemed human beings are immersed into God. We all have been immersed into God. We are all filled with God, possessed by God, permeated, soaked, saturated, immersed, and mingled with God. God and we, we and God, all become one. Do not think that this is too much. How wonderful! We all are soaked, permeated, immersed, infused, and mingled with God. God is in us, and we are in God. Hallelujah! God is one with us, and we are one with Him. This is the mystery, the mystery carried out by God&#8217;s economy.<p>Most Christians today only know the Bible on the surface; they do not know things under the surface. They know the Bible in black and white, but they do not know the mystery. What we are touching now is the mystery hidden underneath the black and white. Hallelujah! We do have the subjective, personal experience to confirm that the more we call on His name, the more we are immersed, saturated, permeated, and infused with Him. Our whole being will be soaked in His Being. The more we pray to Him, the more we call on His name, the more we feel that He becomes one with us, and we become one with Him! What is this? This is the dispensing of the Triune God into our being. This is not a Christian religion. This is the reality of the Triune God dispensing Himself into our being. Then we will be so nice, so good, and so loving yet without any realization. People may say that we are so nice, yet we do not feel that we are nice. People may say that we are so loving, yet we do not feel that we have any love. This is not the human love. This is not the human niceness. This is just the issue of the divine dispensing. This is absolutely different from ethical teachings or any kind of philosophy. This is a divine fact, a divine reality, wrought into our very being by the dispensing power, the dispensing operation, of the Triune God.<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&#8221; This is just the dispensing. It is the immersion of our being in all the attributes of the Godhead. The love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Spirit be with you all. We all are soaking ourselves in such a &#8220;big ocean.&#8221; We are soaking in the divine ocean. Day after day all the divine attributes will be soaked up by our being.<h2 class=head2>The New Jerusalem</h2><p>The Bible is more than consistent. In the first chapter you have the Triune God. In the last chapter the Triune God is also revealed. The last chapter mentions God, the Lamb, and a river of living water (Rev. 22:1-2). No doubt God is the Father, the Lamb is the Son, and the river of living water signifies the flowing Spirit. Here we see the Triune God again, but very much developed. In chapter one of Genesis the Triune God was just called God. In the last chapter of the Bible this God is the fountain on the throne; the Son is the redeeming Lamb, and the Spirit is the flowing river of the water of life to reach every part of the whole city of humanity. The New Jerusalem represents the whole body of humanity which is watered by the flowing river. The flowing river issues out of the redeeming God, who is the Son with the Father. Now the created man not only bears the image of the processed and dispensing Triune God, but this humanity is fully saturated and permeated with the flowing river, the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God.<h2 class=head1>IMMERSED IN THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>Do not listen to all the inaccurate teachings concerning the Triune God. In the Vatican in Rome there is a big painting on the wall. An old man is sitting there with a long beard, a young man is standing there as the Son, and a dove is soaring above as the Spirit. They call that the painting of the Trinity. There is also another painting there that is very similar to this one. The old father is sitting, the young son is standing, and the dove is soaring. Right in between them there is a lady. They add one into the Trinity-Mary. That is devilish! That is the leaven added into the pure revelation of the divine Trinity.<p>The divine Trinity today is right within us. The Father is here, the Son is here, and the Spirit is here. Right now we all are in the Trinity. Praise Him for such a mystery! This is a mystery, yet it has been carried out by God&#8217;s economy through His way of dispensing. First He became a man to be the Lamb to accomplish redemption and take away our sins. Then in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is the realization of the Son, and the Son is the embodiment of the Father. So, today when we believe in the Son, we have the Father. When we call on the name of the Son, we get the Spirit. Now we are one with Him. Praise Him! This is the divine mystery carried out by the divine economy through the steps of the divine dispensing.<p>In the last chapter of Revelation this Triune God is the One on the throne, the One who redeemed us, and the One who is flowing in a spiral way through us to water us with all that He is. Here we have the quenching of thirst. Here we have the nourishment of the tree of life. Here we have satisfaction, and here we have rest.<p>The most impressive thing is that we become one with God in a mysterious way. Hallelujah! We can shout that God is no more merely God, He is now God with humanity. He is now God wrapped up and mingled with us. And we are no more merely human beings; we are now human beings saturated, immersed, and infused with the Triune God.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:7; Zech. 12:1; Job 32:8; Prov. 20:27; 1 Thes. 5:23; Heb. 4:12; John 3:6b; 4:24; Rom. 8:16; 1:9a; 2 Tim. 4:22a; 1 Cor. 6:17; Rom. 8:4; Eph. 3:5; 2:22; Rev. 1:10; 21:10</h1><p>The mystery of the universe is God, the mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church. The church is altogether centered on man. It is wrapped up with man; so man becomes very crucial in God&#8217;s mystery. God&#8217;s mystery is carried out by His economy, and His economy is just to dispense Himself into man. Man is so crucial to God&#8217;s mystery.<h2 class=head1>MAN AS A VESSEL</h2><p>What is man? I do not ask, &#8220;Who is man?&#8221; I do not ask, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; but &#8220;What are you?&#8221; We may say that we are a man. Then, what is a man? The Bible tells us that man is a vessel (Rom. 9:21, 23). A vessel is different from an instrument. Man is not an instrument; he is a vessel. A vessel is a container to contain something. As a container this vessel needs the content, and according to the Bible the content of man is the very God. Man is just an empty vessel to contain God as his content. We all must realize that these vessels are living ones. We are living vessels with a mind, with emotions, and with a will. Man today is a living vessel to contain God as the content. For such a living vessel to receive God as the content there is a recipient, a receiver within man. The radio serves as an illustration of this. Radio waves in the air can get into a radio and a voice will come out. It is just a little radio, but music and announcements come out of it because something is in the air. The radio waves in the air need a receiver. We are just like little radios. We have to consider ourselves as little radios, vessels to receive the divine waves that bring in the divine music, the divine announcement, and the divine declaration. Once we tune our receiver within, the heavenly music comes in.<h2 class=head2>Man&#8217;s Body</h2><p>What is this receiver within man? We all have to realize that man as a living vessel is not so simple. Do not consider that we are so simple. This little vessel created by God is very complicated. Several medical doctors have told me that most medical students spend two years studying the physical body. These doctors all told me the same thing: that after they studied this human body for two years, they had to admit that there is an Almighty One in this universe. All of the organization and arrangement of the human body is too marvelous! We have to believe that this body is created by God. Who designed such a beautiful face? Suppose the nose were designed with the holes upward. Then rain would come in, and we would be troubled with the rain water. God created two eyebrows as breakwaters to turn the salty sweat away. God also created the hair within our throat upward but all the rest of our hair throughout our whole body downward. If the inner hair were downward, we might choke on our phlegm. All these prove that our little, marvelous body as the shell of God&#8217;s vessel is created by the Almighty God.<h2 class=head2>Man&#8217;s Soul</h2><p>Man is not so simple. What I have been talking about is the physical body, but man is not just the physical body. Within this physical body we have all the things denoted by the term, the heart. Do you know how many hearts we have? We must realize that we have two hearts. One is so bad, and the other is so good. Without such a good heart we could not be here. If you ask a medical doctor to check my chest, he may say that I am so strong because I have such a strong heart, a good heart. But I would say that my heart is poor, sinful, and ugly. Actually, we are talking about two hearts. The doctor is talking about the physical heart, and I am talking about my psychological heart. Do you realize that we have a psychological heart? The physical heart does not have the ability to love; it only has the ability to pump the blood. The medical doctors do a lot for the physical heart, but not for the psychological heart.<p>Then we have a mind to think with and to consider with. We have the emotions, the will, and the conscience. In addition to this, according to the Bible we have the soul, the spirit, and the inner man. A surgeon could only find the brain. He could not find the mind. Where is the emotion? Where is the will? Where is the conscience? Many times human beings say that their conscience testifies that they are so good. But what is the conscience, and where is it? Man is not so simple. We have the heart, the mind, the will, the emotion, the conscience, the soul, and the spirit. There is such a thing within us that is called the soul. It is also called the psyche. Psuche, the Greek word for soul, is the base word for such words as psychology and psychological.<h2 class=head2>The Spirit of Man</h2><p>Then we have the spirit. What is the spirit? It is hard to tell. If you check with the thoughtful people, every one realizes that there is an emptiness within man. What is this emptiness? It is the appetite. The appetite is a kind of hollowness. We have such a hollowness within us which is the desire for eating, and this desire is termed the appetite. Every thoughtful person realizes that besides the physical appetite there is another kind of appetite. After a man is filled up with the best food, he feels strongly that something within is still so empty. Regardless of whether we are old, young, rich, poor, high, or low, with every human being there is the sense of emptiness. After animals fill up their hunger, they go to sleep; they do not have any other appetite. When all the monkeys, tigers, and lions in the zoo are filled up, they are satisfied.<p>But the more human beings are filled up physically, the more they become hungry within. This is the very reason why religions have become so prevailing. Strictly speaking, on this whole earth among the human race there is not one atheist. All the atheists are self-deceivers. In their mentality they say that they do not believe that there is a God. While arguing with you that there is no God, deep within they ask, &#8220;Suppose there is a God, what should we do?&#8221; When they return home to their bedroom, they would think that probably there is a God. They would think, &#8220;I should not run the risk to say so strongly that there is no God.&#8221; This proves that there is not one real atheist. All the atheists are liars. They lie to themselves because, in fact, every human being has an appetite other than the physical appetite. What is this appetite? It is a deep desire after God. Every human being has something within him. Whether we call that the spirit, the appetite, the receiver, or the hollowness, whatever we call it, there is such a thing.<h2 class=head1>THE TRIPARTITE MAN-SPIRIT AND SOUL AND BODY</h2><p>There is such a thing called the human spirit within every human being. God created us in this way. Genesis 1:26 says, &#8220;And God said, Let us make man in our image.&#8221; God did this in the way of forming a physical body with the dust. Our physical body is just dust. It is a composition of chemical elements such as salt, sulfur, copper, iron, and other things. God formed a physical body with the dust. Then God did something which He had not done with any of the animals. God breathed something into man. Here we have two kinds of materials-the dust and God&#8217;s breath. The dust was used as material to form man&#8217;s physical body.<p>Besides this, He breathed the breath of life into man. We need to be clear that this was not God&#8217;s divine life. This was just some breath out of God&#8217;s mouth. After this breath entered into man&#8217;s dusty body, man became a living soul. So in Genesis 2:7 we have the body formed with the dust and the soul as an issue that came out of the combination of God&#8217;s breath and the physical body. Now we have the body and the soul. No doubt the breath of God which was breathed into the physical body is the human spirit.<p>In the original Old Testament text, the word for breath in Genesis 2:7 is the very word in Proverbs 20:27 which is translated in the English version as spirit, the spirit of man. The spirit of man is just the breath out of God&#8217;s mouth. The dust with which our body was formed is a material matter, but the breath which is the very element for our spirit is spiritual. So we have two kinds of elements. One is the material element, the dust for the body; the other is the spiritual element, the breath of God for our spirit. When this breath comes into the dusty body, the issue is the human soul. In this one verse (Gen. 2:7) we have these three things-the body, the soul, and the spirit.<p>So the Apostle Paul told us clearly in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 that a human being is composed with three parts-the spirit and soul and body. We have a body, a spirit, and a soul. God created us this way with a purpose. Just as a jacket was designed to fit the physical body, so man was made, not by accident but according to God&#8217;s design. Man was made according to God&#8217;s fashion with a soul, and the soul is of three parts: the mind, the emotion, and the will. How wonderful is man&#8217;s mind! The mind can remember so many words and syllables. The mind also works with the will to make decisions and choices. The emotion, being our inner organ to love, to hate, to be happy or sorrowful, goes along with our mind as well. These three-the mind, the emotion, and the will all go together. However, man has a deeper organ called by the Bible the spirit. This organ is solely, wholly, and simply for us to receive God. The little receiver within a radio is made purposely for one thing-to receive the electrical waves in the air. We also have such a single-purposed organ within us. That is our spirit to receive God as the spiritual waves from the heavens.<p>After we were born, we did not use our spirit. We used our body in bodily exercise and our mind for education and schooling, but we were never taught to exercise our spirit. This is a new language, yet this has to be used in our daily life. Sometimes a brother and his wife quarrel and exchange words. Both should just be quiet and exercise their spirits! Do not charge the other party to exercise their spirit; you just do it.<p>The Bible says that the very God is the One who stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man (Zech. 12:1). This word shows us that three things are crucial in this universe-the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man. The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man with his spirit is for God. This is altogether for God&#8217;s economy, so the Bible says that there is a spirit in man. It goes on to tell us that the spirit of man is the lamp of God (Prov. 20:27). We all know that the lamp here refers to an oil lamp. The lamp itself does not give light; it is the oil that burns within the lamp. God is the oil, and our spirit within us is the lamp. As the oil burns to shine through the lamp, so God shines through our spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE DIVINE SPIRIT AND THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h2><p>In the Bible there are two spirits-the divine Spirit and the human spirit. Three verses tell us that there are two different spirits. John 3:6b says, &#8220;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&#8221; The human spirit is born of the divine Spirit. The King James Version even indicates the difference by capitalizing the first Spirit in this verse. Then in John 4:24, the Lord says, &#8220;God is Spirit [the divine Spirit]; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit [the human spirit].&#8221; God is Spirit, and we have a spirit within us as an organ for us to worship God, contact God, commune with God, receive God, and contain God.<p>The third verse is Romans 8:16 which says, &#8220;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.&#8221; These two spirits are working together. The Holy Spirit works together with our spirit to testify that we are the children of God. This one verse proves that now the divine Spirit is one with our human spirit, and our human spirit is one with the divine Spirit. Hence, 2 Timothy 4:22 says, &#8220;The Lord be with your spirit.&#8221; Today Christ is the life-giving Spirit. When the Bible says, &#8220;The Lord be with your spirit,&#8221; it means that Christ as the life-giving Spirit is with our spirit. This is why 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, &#8220;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&#8221; Hallelujah! We have the divine Spirit, and we have the human spirit. Eventually these two spirits are mingled as one.<h2 class=head1>THE MINGLED SPIRIT</h2><p>In many verses in the New Testament the word spirit is used to denote not merely the Holy Spirit nor simply the human spirit, but the human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit. Romans 8:4 says, &#8220;Walk according to...spirit.&#8221; The spirit here is the mingled spirit. Surely it denotes our human spirit, but in Romans 8:4 our human spirit is not merely the human spirit. Our human spirit has become mingled with the divine Spirit. This is just like tea. It was pure water, but once tea gets into the water, we have two elements mingled together as one drink. We even call this drink tea. Actually, this is not merely tea; it is tea mingled with water. Two things have been mingled together as one entity. Today the spirit within us is a mingled spirit. As Christians, if we are honest and faithful to the Lord, we have to walk according to this mingled spirit in everything every day. We must walk according to spirit, not according to religion, doctrine, or any opinion. Then we will fulfill the righteous requirement of the law. It is here, in this mingled spirit, that the holy apostles received the revelation of the mystery of God (Eph. 3:5). The mystery of God could be revealed only in such a mingled spirit.<h2 class=head1>A HABITATION OF GOD IN SPIRIT</h2><p>Ephesians 2:22 tells us that God&#8217;s dwelling place is the church. Today the church is to be built up into a dwelling place of God in spirit. It is in our spirit that the church is built up to be God&#8217;s dwelling place. We are here for the Lord&#8217;s recovery, and the Lord&#8217;s recovery is focused on the church which is the mystery of Christ. This church is built up as God&#8217;s dwelling place in our spirit. So in the last book of the Bible, the Apostle John tells us that in spirit he saw the vision of the local churches with Christ walking among them (Rev. 1:10-13). It was also in his spirit that John saw the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:10). It is altogether a matter of the human spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit. God dispenses Himself as the Spirit into our human spirit first by the way of regeneration (John 3:6). We all have to realize that we have been regenerated. We have the second birth, a rebirth. Now we have to learn how to worship the Spirit in our spirit, learn how to contact Him, learn how to fellowship with Him. To worship God implies to contact Him, to fellowship with Him, to commune with Him, to receive Him, to take Him in, to contain Him, and even to assimilate Him. We have God within us. We have to digest Him into our very organic tissues. This all transpires not in our mentality, or in our will, or in our emotion. It is altogether accomplished in our spirit. Our God is the Triune God, and the Triune God is the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit as the ultimate expression of the Triune God has entered into our human spirit to make Himself one with our spirit. Now we and He are just one spirit. It is here that we have been reborn. It is here that we contact Him, receive Him, contain Him, assimilate Him, and take Him in. It is here that we have the church built up which is the focus of the mystery. How crucial and how important is our spirit!<h2 class=head1>BE FILLED IN SPIRIT</h2><p>In Ephesians 5 there is a verse telling the wives to submit and a verse telling the husbands to love, but there is another verse (v. 18) that says, &#8220;Be filled in spirit.&#8221; Firstly, be filled in spirit with God. Be filled in your spirit with the Spirit. When you and I are filled in spirit, surely we can love. If the wives are filled with God in their spirit, surely they can submit. Young men do not need to force themselves to love their wives but should come back to their spirit, exercise their spirit, and be filled in their spirit.<p>The subject of the book of Ephesians is Christ and the church. Without Christ, apart from the church, we cannot love our wives. I have never found one who really loves his wife without Christ, but I have met a number of husbands who all loved their wives in the church and by Christ. How could the husbands have such good wives in the church but by Christ? We do not need to try to love. We do not need to try to submit. Just live in the church by Christ and in your spirit. It is in the spirit of man that we are one with the life-giving Spirit. It is in our spirit that we see the vision concerning God&#8217;s eternal purpose. It is in our spirit that all the mysteries become open to us. It is in our spirit that we are built as God&#8217;s habitation. It is in our spirit that we can see the New Jerusalem. It is in the spirit that we fully realize that the best, the top portion, of God&#8217;s blessing is with the church. We can see this because we are in the spirit.<h2 class=head1>WALK ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Now, we all can grasp the importance, the vital point, of the human spirit. God today is the life-giving Spirit, and He created us with a spirit. Second, He has regenerated us in our spirit. Third, He indwells our spirit. Fourth, His Spirit and our spirit, these two spirits, are mingled into one spirit. Is this  not wonderful! No union, no mingling is so dear, so real, as this mingling of the divine Spirit with the human spirit. Here we enjoy Christ. Here we partake of all the riches of Christ. Here we are built up together. Here we have the church life. Here we have God&#8217;s habitation. This is the real economy of God&#8217;s mystery. God&#8217;s mystery is carried out in His economy in our spirit. So we must learn all the time to come back to our spirit. While we are gossiping we have to come back to our spirit. Before we become angry at some brother, we have to come back to our spirit. While we are so happy, we have to come back to our spirit. When we are going to say something to our wives, come back to the spirit. Always remind yourself to come back to the spirit. We have to walk according to spirit.<p>This word walk in Greek means to have our being, to do things, to say things, and to go places according to this spirit. Forget about religion, rituals, regulations, forms, teachings, sermons, concepts, and anyone&#8217;s opinion. In everything we must walk and have our whole being according to the spirit. We do have such a wonderful spirit. We just walk, have our being, and live day by day according to this spirit. There will be no burden, no problems, and no strain. We will be rested all the time because we have everything in this mingled spirit. It is really wonderful!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>FOUR ASPECTS OF BAPTISM</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19; Gal. 3:27; 1 Cor. 12:12-13; Eph. 4:4; Rom. 12:2-5, 11; Eph. 4:23; 3:16-18</h1><p>God&#8217;s mystery is to have the church, and God&#8217;s economy is to bring forth the church. Both God&#8217;s mystery and God&#8217;s economy are just to have the church. We must see how this has been done and how this is still being done.<h2 class=head1>BAPTIZED INTO THE NAME OF THE FATHER, SON, AND SPIRIT</h2><p>First let us look at Matthew 28:19. This verse has been altogether misused by Christianity, mainly due to an inadequate translation. The King James Version says, &#8220;baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.&#8221; The Greek preposition here for in actually means into. It does not mean baptizing them in the name but baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Spirit. The preposition into is crucial, and the name is also crucial. This verse does not say, &#8220;baptizing them into the Father, into the Son, and into the Holy Spirit,&#8221; but rather, &#8220;baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; These two words into and name are hard for Christians to understand.<p>This kind of composition, baptizing into, is used in the New Testament several times. Besides Matthew 28:19, this phrase baptizing into is used in Romans 6:3 where it says that we have been baptized into the death of Christ. This verse also says that we have been baptized into Christ Jesus. The same kind of verb and the same kind of preposition are used to reveal that we are baptized into the name, into Christ, and into the death of Christ. Galatians 3:27 has the same phrase, &#8220;baptized into Christ.&#8221; First Corinthians 12:13 says that &#8220;we were all baptized into one body.&#8221;<p>We have to baptize people into four things: into the name, into Christ, into the death of Christ, and into the Body. Physically speaking, we baptize people into the water, but we all know that the water is not the real thing. The water denotes something. When we baptize people into the water, it denotes that we baptize them into the name, into Christ, into His death, and into His Body.<p>In Christianity I never heard that we should baptize people into the name. I heard just a little about baptizing people into Christ. It was after I was saved and had advanced much in the Lord that I read some books which told me that baptism is to put us into the death of Christ. Also, I never heard that to be baptized is to be baptized into the Body. Have you ever heard this? To baptize people is to baptize them into the name, into Christ, into His all-inclusive death, and into His Body.<p>After the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the first mention of baptism is not to baptize people into the water, into the tomb, or into death. The first mention of baptism after Christ&#8217;s resurrection is to put people into His name (Matt. 28:19).<h2 class=head1>BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST</h2><p>The New Testament goes on to tell us in Romans 6 that to baptize people is to put them into Christ. This Christ in Romans 6, into whom we baptize people, is no more just the Lamb. We can never baptize people into a Lamb. This Lamb has been crucified, buried, and resurrected into the Spirit! Now the very Christ in Romans 6 is no more just the Lamb but the life-giving Spirit.<p>One day while I was speaking in Indianapolis, a sister interrupted my speaking and asked how we could abide in the Lord and the Lord in us. She had tried and tried to abide in Christ, but could not make it. I told her that it was so easy for us to abide in the air and for the air to abide in us. Right now we are abiding in the air, and the air is abiding in us. After Christ&#8217;s resurrection, He became the pneuma, like the air. He is the pneuma. Pneuma means the Spirit, the breath as the air. Christ is the living pneuma. We have our being in Him just like we have our living in the air. If you take away the air from this room, after five minutes we will all be dead. We have our life in the air. We are abiding in the air, and the air is abiding in us. Hence, we can easily baptize people into Christ because Christ today is the Spirit. The Spirit is the pneuma and the pneuma is like the air.<p>How could we be baptized into the death of Christ? Where is the death of Christ? I have read some books which told me that we have to reckon this death by faith. I reckoned and believed that I was baptized into His death, but it never worked. In Brother Watchman Nee&#8217;s book, The Normal Christian Life, there is a chapter on reckoning. However, those messages were given by Brother Nee in his earlier ministry, before 1939. Those were elementary. After 1942 he learned that to experience the death of Christ is not just a matter of reckoning. After 1942, Brother Nee gave messages telling us that the real experience of Christ&#8217;s death is not in Romans 6 but in Romans 8. What Romans 6 says is just an objective fact. If we are going to experience this fact subjectively, we must be in Romans 8. The real death of Christ today is not in the tomb. The real death of Christ today is in the all-inclusive Spirit.<p>In the Bible, in the typology of the Old Testament, the compound ointment signifies the compound Spirit (Exo. 30:23-33). In this compound ointment, Christ&#8217;s divinity, Christ&#8217;s humanity, Christ&#8217;s death, Christ&#8217;s resurrection, the power of His death, the power of His resurrection, and the ascension of Christ are all included. This is a compound, an ointment, compounded with all kinds of spices. The Spirit of God before Christ&#8217;s crucifixion was not a compound. It was just a divine Spirit without humanity in it, without the very element of the effective death of Christ in it, without the resurrection in it, and without Christ&#8217;s ascension in it. After Christ was processed through death, resurrection, and ascension, He came down to descend upon us. Now He is the compound Spirit. We have all these good elements compounded in this one compound Spirit. This compound Spirit is Christ as well as the life-giving Spirit! When we baptize people into this compound Christ, we put them into His death. There is no need for us to reckon. We put them into the name, into the compound Spirit, and into the death of Christ which is one of the compounding elements of the Spirit. When we put them into the name, into Christ, and into His death, at the same time we baptize them into the Body.<h2 class=head1>BAPTIZED INTO THE NAME</h2><p>Matthew 28:19 was spoken after Christ&#8217;s resurrection. In other words, Christ spoke this word in His resurrection. While He was speaking this word, He was the resurrected One. As the resurrected One, the life-giving Spirit, He is the ultimate issue of the Triune God. We have seen that God is triune-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-not for doctrine but for dispensing. The Father was in the Son, and the Son became the life-giving Spirit. Whatever the Father is and has is embodied in the Son. The Son is the embodiment of the Father, and this Son through the process of crucifixion and resurrection became the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.<p>If, at the time the Lord spoke this word in His resurrection, He had said to baptize people into the Father, into the Son, and into the Spirit, this would have caused a misunderstanding. This would have caused the disciples to think that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are separate. This is why some Christians argue for three immersions-one immersion in the name of the Father, another in the name of the Son, and the third in the name of the Spirit. They neglect to realize that the Lord never used the plural word names, that is, baptizing them into the names of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. If this were the case, it would be right to immerse people into three names, but the name is singular in number, that is, three with one name. Matthew 28:19 says, &#8220;the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Is this the Father&#8217;s name, the Son&#8217;s name, or the Spirit&#8217;s name? If the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three distinct Persons, how could three distinct Persons have just one name? The Lord wisely spoke in this way. If He had said, &#8220;baptizing them into the Father and the Son and the Spirit,&#8221; this would have caused the disciples to understand that these are three separate Beings.<p>Furthermore, if we had only Romans 6:3 and Galatians 3:27 telling us to baptize people into Christ, we would think that baptism has nothing to do with the Father. Many Christians think that to baptize people into Christ means only into the Son, that is, into the Lord Jesus, and that it has nothing to do with the Father or with the Spirit. If we did not have the Greek text of Matthew 28:19, we could not understand that our being baptized has very much to do with the Father, as well as with the Son and with the Spirit. The baptism is to put us into the Father, into the Son, and into the Spirit. To be baptized into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Spirit is not a small matter. This means to put us into the Triune God who is from eternity past to eternity future. We have been baptized not only into Christ; we have been baptized into the Triune God. These Three have only one name.<p>The name of the Father and of the Son and of the Spirit is the Person, and the Person is the reality. To baptize new converts into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Spirit means that we put them into the reality of the Triune God, into the Person of the Triune God. So here we can see the wisdom and the profoundness of the Lord&#8217;s word. To baptize people is just to put them into the reality of the Triune God, into whatever the Triune God is. We put people into whatever the Father is as the source, whatever the Son is as the course, and whatever the Spirit is as the flow. This reality is altogether embodied in Christ. Christ is the reality of the Triune God. In other words, to baptize people into the reality of the Triune God is to baptize them into Christ. This is why in Matthew we have the baptizing into the name of the Triune God.<p>In Romans we have the baptizing into Christ. To baptize people into Christ is equal to baptizing people into the name of the Triune God because Christ is the reality of the Triune God. The Triune God is embodied in Christ. Also, it is equal to being put into His death because His death is one of the elements of His compounding. To baptize people into Christ, and spontaneously into His death, is to terminate their past. Yet this is not the end. To baptize people into the Triune God is not only to baptize them into Christ and into His death negatively, but also, positively, into the Body. Hence, in baptism we all have been put into the reality of the Triune God. We all have been put into Christ. We all have been put into His death to have a thorough termination. On the positive side, we have also been put into His Body. This is altogether a matter of the wonderful Spirit!<h2 class=head1>BAPTIZED INTO ONE BODY</h2><p>First Corinthians 12:13 says, &#8220;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body.&#8221; Again, this is something too profound and too deep. The Body today is just the church. This is an interchangeable term for the church. The church is the Body, and the Body is the church. The Body is something altogether in the Spirit. We all have been baptized in the Spirit, into one Body. In one Spirit, Peter, John, James, Paul, Stephen, Martin Luther, John Nelson Darby, Brother Watchman Nee, you, and I-we all have been baptized at the same time in the same place. Do not think that we were baptized at a different time or in a different place than Martin Luther or Peter.<p>We must all realize that the Body of Christ is the church. By baptism, the Body is produced, brought forth, and constituted. In this universe in the sight of God there is something wonderful called the baptism. Many Christians do not realize this universal baptism.<p>The Bible tells us that we the believers have all been crucified with Christ. Actually, that word crucified should be translated co-crucified. We all have been co-crucified with Christ when He was crucified at Golgotha. We were crucified and resurrected before we were born. We were even seated in the heavens before we were saved. This is the gospel. The glad tidings are that before we were born we were already crucified, terminated, and buried. Before we were born we were even resurrected. The good news tells us that before we were born, before we committed any sin, we were crucified, buried, terminated, resurrected, and in the heavens. After crucifixion we have resurrection, ascension, and baptism. He came down from His ascension to immerse all God&#8217;s chosen ones. This is baptism. We, the God-chosen ones, were all immersed in the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and descended Christ. We were immersed in the all-inclusive Christ for the Body. After He accomplished everything, He came down and immersed all God&#8217;s called ones. By this baptism, by this immersion, all God&#8217;s called ones have been baptized into one Body. Christ&#8217;s descension has immersed us into the Body.<p>We are not only enjoying Christ&#8217;s crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, we are now experiencing His immersion. This means that we are experiencing His Body. Now we are no longer individual persons. We are members of His Body. By His immersion, we were made members of His Body. We are no more only men. We are members. So we all have to pray, &#8220;Lord, show us Your Body.&#8221; We were made a part of the Body in Acts 10. In the whole universe, there was a time when the ascended Christ came back to immerse all God&#8217;s chosen ones. Before we were born we were baptized and made members of the Body of Christ. We must forget about our mentality and believe the good tidings. We have to believe the good news. We are no more sinners, no more a complete entity, no more individual persons, but members of the Body. We all have been baptized into the Body because of this wonderful Spirit. Two thousand years ago we all were baptized in Him. With God there is no clock. There is no before or after. In the eyes of God there is no element of time. There is only the fact. In the whole universe there is the immersion, the baptism.<p>We have to realize that we, who believe in Christ, have all been immersed into the Body of Christ. How are we going to realize this? First Corinthians 12:13 says, &#8220;We were all baptized into one body...and were all given to drink one Spirit.&#8221; To realize what has been accomplished is to drink. Drinking has not been accomplished. Immersion has been accomplished, but drinking is our job. Immersion was Christ&#8217;s accomplishment, but drinking is our daily, hourly job. The simplest way to drink is to call on the Lord Jesus. If we call on the Lord Jesus for a few minutes, we will love Him more. Then we will desire to have the church life. Some may say that the church is not so good or so satisfactory. However, the more we say, &#8220;O Lord, the church is not so good,&#8221; the more the Lord says, &#8220;Go to the church.&#8221; We may say to the Lord, &#8220;I do not like the church.&#8221; The Lord says, &#8220;I like it; I love it so much.&#8221; No one can criticize, condemn, or accuse the church when calling on His name. When we called on the name of the Lord, we did not have the intention to drink Him, yet we drank.<p>Similarly as long as we get into the open air and shout, we breathe the air in. Whether we like it or do not like it, the air gets into us. This all-inclusive Spirit is here. When we believe in the name of Christ, we recognize all that He has accomplished. When we say, &#8220;Lord Jesus, we believe in You,&#8221; we do not know how much that implies. Just to say such a simple word is to sign a contract; it implies everything. This signature implies His crucifixion, His resurrection, His ascension, and His coming down to immerse His whole Body.<p>To drink is just to experience what Christ has accomplished. The more we drink of this one Spirit, the more we are saturated and permeated. Romans 12 tells us that we have to be transformed in our mind. To be transformed in our mind means that a new element comes in to replace the old. By transformation the element of God&#8217;s divine nature gets into us. The divine nature gets into our being and permeates our mind, not to change our mind, but to transform it. Hence, Ephesians 4:23 says that we are being renewed in the spirit of our mind. Our mind has been soaked with the Spirit, and the Spirit, which was separate from our mind, now becomes the spirit of our mind. By now our spirit has permeated our whole being. Our mind, emotion, will-the way we think, the way we love, and the way we make decisions-have all been permeated by this spreading spirit. So this spirit has become the spirit of our mind, the spirit of our emotion, and the spirit of our will. This is the full transformation and also the growth in life.<p>The more we are permeated, the more we are in the church life. The more we are soaked with all the divine attributes, the more we are in the Body. It does not mean much to say that we would like to be in the Body and that we are one. This is good to say, but it does not mean much. What counts is that we drink of the one Spirit by calling on His name. To drink is not to think. The more we think, the more we do not drink. To drink is just to call, to forget about our thinking and to forget about our mentality. We all have been baptized into this one Body and positioned to drink. Now we are drinking and drinking. Eventually, we can do everything, not by our self, but by what we have drunk. This is the church life. Hallelujah! Here we also have the building because the building is by such a drinking.<p>Eventually, Ephesians 3:17 tells us that Christ will make His home in our heart. He will take full possession of our whole being. This means that we are really one with Him. Then we can say that we are the church, we are the mystery of Christ, and we are parts of Christ in a mysterious way. Here is the testimony of Jesus. This is the church, and this is the Body life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>EXERCISE YOURSELF UNTO GODLINESS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 1:3-7; 3:15-16; 4:6-8; 2 Tim. 1:7; 4:22</h1><h2 class=head1>A CLEAR VISION</h2><p>The Bible is a book with many items, but within the many items there is a center, the kernel. When we look into the whole Bible, it may be very hard to find the kernel if we stay with our mentality and do not exercise our spirit.<p>It is just like the physical life in our body. We can see the parts of the physical body such as the skin, the meat, the bone, and the muscle, but we cannot see the physical life. Regardless of what kind of instrument we would use, we could never see that life with our eyes. Humanly speaking there is no way to see it and no way to make it manifest to our view. However, we all know that this does not mean that there is not such a thing as physical life. The human physical life is more than real. If it were not real, we could not speak and move. We have all the parts, but our ability to move is not in the physical, visible realm. It is in something that is invisible. The Bible is exactly the same. This is why many top scholars after reading the Bible see nothing of the kernel. They see history and part of science. Others see some doctrines, stories, and prophecies, such as the big image with a golden head in Daniel. The things concerning God&#8217;s mystery and God&#8217;s economy can only be revealed in our spirit. When we exercise our spirit, then all these things will rise up within us as a vision.<p>In my path of over fifty years of Christian life, I have passed through many things. I am grateful for God&#8217;s mercy that His grace has kept me in His presence. But I can testify that one thing which preserves me all the time is a clear vision. A clear vision is the real preserving power. The Bible has so many items, and Christianity has such a long history of nearly two thousand years. The Christian religion has many books with thousands of opinions and concepts. We are in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, and sooner or later some of the opinions will touch us. For instance, suppose you meet a Christian teacher. He may talk with you in a very nice way and ask if you know what the seventy weeks are in Daniel 9. You may be quite interested and like to listen, but this will cause you to be trapped. This dear one may be a very eloquent speaker with a phonetic presentation to attract you to the seventy weeks. Fifty years ago I heard many messages on the seventy weeks. Also, messages were given on the 1,260 days, the 1,290 days, and the 1,335 days. These are all in Daniel. This is in the Bible, and this is the holy Word, but we may be trapped by a hunger for knowledge.<h2 class=head1>THE MYSTERY OF GODLINESS</h2><p>The two books to Timothy must be put together as one. The verses we have read are the very kernel of these two books. In these verses we have the word mystery mentioned again, but here the mystery is of godliness. This is not another mystery; this is the same mystery which is the mystery of the universe, the mystery of God, and the mystery of Christ. All of these are different aspects of one mystery, and this mystery in the two books to Timothy is called the mystery of godliness. This word godliness means god-likeness, likening God, or like as God; that is, we have the appearance, the expression, and the manifestation of God. The manifestation of God is called godliness. So the mystery of godliness means that God in His mystery can be manifested and expressed. First Timothy tells us that godliness is God &#8220;manifested in the flesh&#8221; (3:16). The mystery of godliness is God manifested in human beings. The mystery of God and the mystery of Christ are just God manifested in humanity. God manifested in humanity is the mystery of godliness. How much is implied and expressed in such a short word!<h2 class=head1>NOT TO TEACH DIFFERENTLY</h2><p>We also have the word economy in 1 Timothy 1:4. There it says that some kinds of teachings stir up questions rather than God&#8217;s economy, which is an economy to dispense God into His chosen people. The Apostle Paul warned us in these two books that among so-called Christians there are many other teachings. He even charged Timothy, his young co-worker, to take care that some not teach differently. To teach differently does not mean to teach a wrong doctrine, or to teach heresies, but just to teach things different from what we have been taught concerning the economy of God.<p>If we read 1 Timothy, we can see clearly that these things include the law of Moses. Some taught the law, and some taught the genealogy which is the history of the Old Testament. The law of Moses is in the Bible as well as the history. Both are in the holy oracle and are not wrong. The law of Moses is built upon three columns, three pillars. One is circumcision, the second is the Sabbath, and the third is the levitical diet. As a young male of the race of Israel you must be circumcised on the eighth day and this is once for your whole life. Then, after this, every seventh day you must keep one day as the Sabbath. Not only so, every day you have to keep the holy diet three times. These are all in the Old Testament, but in the New Testament these three pillars have all been removed. First, the Lord Jesus removed the pillar of the Sabbath (Matt. 12:1-8). Second, Paul was so bold to remove the pillar of circumcision (Gal. 5:6; 6:15). Finally, the pillar of the holy diet was removed in Acts 10. All these things are in the Bible, but they are not the kernel.<p>The kernel of the Bible is this: the mystery of the universe is God, the mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church. This God is triune, dispensing Himself into our being that we may become members of the Body of Christ, which is the church; and we are tripartite, having a human spirit as a receiver to receive the Triune God. Day after day and morning and evening, we can drink of Him for the church life. Paul charged Timothy to take care of some and tell them that they should not teach differently, but speak the same thing. The same thing is Christ and the church, the mysteries of God&#8217;s economy.<p>We can find different teachings other than God&#8217;s economy in the Bible, even in 1 and 2 Timothy. Many other doctrines such as the seventy weeks with the seven last years in Daniel can raise question after question. Then we will argue and be snared. This is the very reason many Christians are divided.<p>What is the Lord&#8217;s recovery? The Lord&#8217;s recovery is to bring us back to the beginning, to a beginning without any questions, and to a beginning without any division. At the very beginning all the apostles spoke the same thing. Peter, John, and Paul all spoke the same thing. We must be recovered back to the beginning to speak the same thing which is Christ and the church. We care for Christ and the church. We care for our daily and hourly drinking of the one Spirit. We care for a living testimony to our in-laws, our cousins, our neighbors, our classmates, our schoolmates, and our colleagues. We care for the complete gospel of God to be preached to the sinners, for the proper church life, and for taking Christ as our life and person. We care for these kinds of things. We do not care for the ten horns in Revelation or the ten toes in Daniel. These are in the Bible, but we do not care for them because they are not the kernel of the Bible. We only care for Christ and the church as the mysteries of God&#8217;s economy.<p>In the first chapter of this book, Paul urged Timothy to charge some not to teach differently (1 Tim. 1:3). He said that some have missed the goal, misaimed (1 Tim. 1:6). What is the goal? The goal is the church. We may say that the goal is Christ, the goal is the church, and the goal is the New Jerusalem. This is altogether the same thing. We are in the central lane, driving the car toward the goal, but there are many distractions. Some have missed the goal, thinking that they are teachers who can teach people this doctrine and that doctrine. Paul charges us not to care for these kinds of doctrines but always to be preserved in the central lane. The central lane is the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ. The central lane is Christ and the church. The central lane is that the Triune God today is altogether the compound Spirit, that we have a regenerated spirit mingled with the divine Spirit, and that we can enjoy Him in our spirit as our everything to have a practical, present church life. Only such a clear vision can preserve us all the time in the central lane.<h2 class=head1>EXERCISE UNTO GODLINESS</h2><p>Paul goes on to tell us that we have to exercise ourselves unto godliness (1 Tim. 4:7). This word exercise is a translation of the Greek word which means all kinds of exercise in the Olympic sphere. In the ancient time, in the Olympic games there was much bodily exercise. However, we Christians need to have another kind of exercise, exercise unto godliness. To exercise ourselves unto godliness is to exercise our spirit that the mystery of godliness might be touched. In order to prove that this exercise is the exercise of our spirit, we have to go to 2 Timothy where Paul says that God has given us a spirit that is strong, loving, and sober; such a spirit is with a strong will, a loving emotion, and a sober mind (2 Tim. 1:7). We all have to exercise ourselves unto godliness. We have to exercise our spirit because the very mystery of godliness is right in our spirit, as 2 Timothy 4:22 tells us that the Lord is with our spirit. The Lord Jesus is the very mystery, and this mystery is in our spirit! If we are going to express this mystery, if we are going to practice this mystery, then we all have to exercise our spirit.<p>What is it to exercise ourselves unto godliness, and how can we exercise ourselves unto godliness? Let us suppose that while a few single brothers are living together, one comes in and starts to talk about some worldly things. While this brother is talking about worldly things, right away the others have to exercise their spirit not to join that talk. If they join that talk, they will fall into a snare. By saying, &#8220;O Lord Jesus,&#8221; they exercise their spirit. Right away, this exercise unto godliness will help that brother come back to his spirit.<p>Another illustration is with a husband and his wife. We all know that there is nearly not one couple on this earth that has never exchanged words. All the husbands are experts and all the wives are specialists in exchanging words. In exchanging words between husband and wife, no one would lose the case. The more they say, the more they have to say. The more they argue, the more they have to argue. Learn to exercise yourself unto godliness. Suppose that after a meeting a married brother goes back home, and his dear wife suddenly becomes unhappy with him. He should not ask her, &#8220;Why are you unhappy?&#8221; This is not exercising unto godliness. This is exercising unto the exchanging of words. He should not use his tongue, but use his spirit! Then he will be exercised unto godliness, and after two minutes his wife will be happy.<p>If the elders in the churches do not know how to exercise themselves unto godliness, there will be many things which will cause them to be unhappy with others All the elders have a lot of opportunity to be offended by others. In the church life, nothing is so troublesome, so burdensome, as the eldership. To be an elder is not an easy thing; it is a heavy task. The elders have to learn to exercise themselves unto godliness. If one elder would say to another that he did not agree with what the other mentioned, then this elder does not exercise himself unto godliness. The other elder right away has to exercise his spirit. Otherwise they will argue, fight, and kill the spirit. Eventually the church life will be deadened. For the church life, all the elders have to learn how to exercise themselves unto godliness.<p>Before we say anything, we have to exercise our spirit. Before we say anything, we have to exercise ourselves unto godliness. Then our spirit will lead us. Whatever we say will be a kind of godliness. Whatever we say will be God manifested in the flesh. This is the exercise unto godliness. We all have to learn this. In everything we have to exercise ourselves unto godliness. Before we go shopping, we have to exercise our spirit unto godliness. We have seen clearly that we have a mingled spirit. So we must walk, have our daily life, and have our whole being according to our spirit. This is one aspect.<h2 class=head1>CALLING ON HIS NAME</h2><p>The other aspect is more practical. Before doing anything we have to exercise ourselves unto godliness. Even if we are going to put on our necktie, we have to exercise ourselves unto godliness. In practice, just to walk according to spirit is not so adequate. We all have to exercise ourselves unto godliness. The most prevailing way is to call on His name. I assure you from my experience that this really works. We must practice this in our daily life. Even if we are going to comb our hair, we have to say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus, I am combing my hair.&#8221; If so, there will be a kind of godliness with our hair. Godliness is God manifested in humanity, and this is worked out by exercising ourselves. This is practical and can be practiced in our daily life. If all of us exercise ourselves unto godliness in such a way, we will be a real testimony; we will have a harmonious church life which will be prevailing.<p>Do not be occupied with doctrine. Be preserved in the central lane, which is Christ and the church, the mystery of God, the mystery of Christ, and the Triune God dispensing Himself into our being in our regenerated spirit. We only care for this. We are drinking all the day of this Triune God in our spirit, and whatever we do, we exercise ourselves unto godliness. This is the practical way to live out Christ in our daily walk for the church life. This will be our practical testimony, the harmony in our church life, and a shame to the enemy. This will be a real glory to our Christ. This will bring in the kingdom. This will pave the way for the Lord to come back, and this will tell the whole universe that this is not a religion, but a practical Christ lived out of all His lovers. This kind of church life is what the Lord is after today.<p>Our burden, commission, and mission is to have such a church life upon the earth today in all the major cities. We do not expect to have a big number or a mass movement. We do expect, however, that in the major cities a good number of Jesus lovers will live by Christ in such a practical way, exercising themselves unto godliness. In every aspect of their life, in every aspect of their daily walk, God is manifested. There is godliness in every aspect of their daily life.<p>Spend time to fellowship and pray; then you will get the enlightenment and a type of eternal warning. Never be trapped or distracted by any other teaching. We only care for God&#8217;s mystery, God&#8217;s economy, Christ and the church, and the Triune God dispensing Himself into us. We only care for drinking Him. We only care for the exercise unto godliness. Brothers and sisters, this is what the Lord is after today. This is the real recovery that the Lord wants. The full recovery of the Lord today is just a proper church life in which we live by Christ and exercise ourselves unto godliness.</body></html>
