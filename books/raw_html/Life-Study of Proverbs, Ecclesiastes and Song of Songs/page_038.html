<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Terminating the Fallen Old Man</H2><P>The Bible shows us that man has become fallen and needs to be redeemed. In God's redemption the first part is to terminate, to destroy, the fallen old man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Rescuing the Humanity Created by God</H2><P>The second part is to rescue what was created by God, the God-created humanity. Something remains of the humanity created by God, and God is not willing to give it up. He created it, and although it has become fallen, He will maintain it and bring it back to Himself. Thus, in His redemption, God, on the one hand, destroys what is fallen and, on the other hand, rescues what was created by Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Uplifting the Redeemed Part of Created Man</H2><P>In the third part of His redemption, God uplifts the redeemed God-created humanity. Sometimes when a certain thing which we have made becomes lost and damaged, we find that thing and repair it, making it better than it was originally. This is what God has done in His redemption. He made the man created by Him better than he was in the beginning. This means that God uplifted the redeemed humanity by dispensing Himself into it.</P><P>The God-created humanity was very good, but it did not have anything of God's nature. It was only human, without divinity. After this humanity became fallen, in His redemption God destroyed the fallen part, rescued the God-created part, and then dispensed Himself into this redeemed humanity.</P><P>At this juncture we need to point out that, according to the Bible, God's redemption includes not only death but also resurrection. Without resurrection, God could not bring back to Himself the lost created man. To bring back the lost God-created man is actually to resurrect the God-created man. In resurrection God used His own life, nature, and element as the substance to uplift the redeemed created man. Furthermore, in resurrecting the dead humanity, God put Himself into man. Now this man is regenerated and uplifted, having all that God is within him. The entire God has entered into this resurrected, regenerated, and uplifted man. This man is what the Bible calls the new man (Eph. 4:24).</P><P>God's intention is no longer with the old man. In the sight of God, the old man has been finished, terminated, and thus he no longer exists. In His redemption God's eyes are always on the new man. We all need to see this.</P>
