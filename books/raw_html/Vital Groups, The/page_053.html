<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Christ Being Transfigured into the Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>Christ, the Son of God as the second of the Divine Trinity, after completing His ministry on the earth, became (was transfigured into) the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection. This life-giving Spirit is signified by the water that flowed out of the pierced side of Jesus on the cross (John 19:34). Through His death and resurrection, Christ released the divine life that was confined in the shell of His humanity and dispensed it into His believers, making them the many members which constitute His Body (John 12:24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Life-giving Spirit Being the Pneumatic Christ</H2><P>This life-giving Spirit who is the pneumatic Christ is also called the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7), the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9), the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19), and the Lord Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18). The Lord Spirit may be considered a compound title like the Father God and the Lord Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Regenerate the Believers for His Body</H2><P>First Peter 1:3 reveals that Christ regenerated all of us who believe in Him in His resurrection. With God there is no time element. According to our human perspective, we were regenerated at a certain time, but in God's view all of His many sons were regenerated through the resurrection of Christ. In Revelation nearly all the predicates are in the past tense. In the eyes of God the New Jerusalem has been completed already. We say that we are consummating the New Jerusalem, and this is correct according to our view in time. But according to God, He has already consummated the New Jerusalem. Revelation 13:8 says that the Lamb was slain from the foundation of the world. In the eternal view of God, from the time the created things came into being, Christ was crucified.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Many Sons of God Born with Christ as the Firstborn Son in One Universally Big Delivery</H2><P>The purpose of Christ's being begotten to be the firstborn Son of God and becoming the life-giving Spirit was for the regenerating of the believers, making them the many sons of God born of God with Him in the one universally big delivery. Christ's resurrection was a big delivery of Himself as the firstborn Son and the believers as His many brothers, His millions of "twins." This was for the composition of the house of God, even the household of God, and the constitution of the Body of Christ to be His fullness, His expression and expansion, to consummate the eternal expression and expansion of the processed and consummated Triune God. All the believers of Christ in this one Spirit have been baptized into the one Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13a). Furthermore, all the believers who are baptized in this one Spirit are given to drink this one Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13b). Through baptism we were immersed in the Spirit, and by drinking the Spirit gets into us. The best Christians are the ones who are in the Spirit and have the Spirit in them to make them completely one with the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Giving the Spirit without Measure</H2><P>The Christ in resurrection gave Himself as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit without measure through His speaking of the words of God (John 3:34). The more we receive the Lord's words, the more we are filled with the immeasurable Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Being Built Up into a Dwelling Place of God in Spirit</H2><P>All the believers in Christ are built up into a dwelling place of God in their spirit indwelt by Him as the Spirit (Eph. 2:22) through dispositional sanctification (Rom. 15:16), renewing (Titus 3:5), transformation (2 Cor. 3:18), and conformation (Rom. 8:29).</P><P>In order to get into the details of the outlines we have released on Christ in His three stages, I would like to recommend the practice of the saints in Taipei. They come together in small groups to pray-read the outline. After pray-reading they study it. Then they learn to recite the entire outline, word by word. Then they prophesy. We may feel that we cannot do this, but if there is a will, there is a way. This practice of pray-reading, studying, reciting, and prophesying has become the best way for the saints in Taipei to digest all these new outlines. After they practice this, they are fully nourished, and they can go to nourish others.</P><P>The content of one outline concerning Christ in one of His stages is like ten meals. We should nourish people with a meal. Each member of the vital groups should present a meal to people for their nourishment. It is hard to see a group among us today which is really vital. Our groups are not vital because we are not nourished. If we want to enter into the intrinsic significance of the Bible, we need to digest these outlines we have released to enable us to nourish others with the unsearchable riches of Christ in His full ministry in three stages.</P>
