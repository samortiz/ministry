THE SPIRIT BEING CONCEALED IN THE SOUL<br>AS THE MARROW IS CONCEALED IN THE JOINTS</H2><P>Hebrews 4:12 shows that the spirit is concealed in the soul just as the marrow is concealed in the joints. Our spirit is like the marrow, and our soul is like the joints. In other words our spirit is altogether wrapped up, enveloped, in our soul. The soul is the envelope that hides our spirit. So to discern our spirit from our soul, we must know where our spirit is. It is within our soul. Here we can also see the situation of our spirit. Our spirit is surrounded, enclosed by our soul. To discern our spirit from our soul, we need to see the position and situation of our spirit.</P>
