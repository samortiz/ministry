The Passover portrayed in Exodus 12 is a clear, adequate, and even all-inclusive type of the redemption of Christ
Although the New Testament reveals the various aspects of redemption, these aspects are not systematized in a doctrinal way
If you were asked to list the items of the Passover in Exodus 12, you would probably mention the lamb, the flesh, the blood!
In Genesis 4 Abel 'brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof' and presented them to the Lord
Anyone who does not have a sacred age as well as a civil age is not a genuine believer in Christ and cannot share in Christ as the Passover
According to Genesis 8:4, Noah's ark landed on the mountains of Ararat on the seventeenth day of the seventh month
On the day we first called on the name of the Lord, believed in Him, and were saved, life began to bud and sprout from within us
We enjoy the eighth day, the first day of the week, the beginning of a new week, a new beginning in resurrection
The fact that the Passover was held on the fourteenth day of the month means that it was held at the end of two complete weeks
After a lamb had been selected, it was examined for four days to test it, to find out whether or not it had blemishes
The feast of Passover takes place on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, which lasts a total of seven days
In 123 the children of Israel were commanded to take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for a house
If a man's house was too small for the lamb, he and his neighbor were to come together to take one lamb according to the number of the souls
Verse 4 indicates that the lamb was both according to the number of the souls and according to every man's eating
The extent to which He can be enjoyed is both according to the number of people and according to our capacity to eat Him
Exodus 12:5 goes on to say that the lamb had to be 'a male of the first year,' taken either 'out from the sheep, or from the goats'
At the time of His crucifixion, He was both a sheep and a goat, depending from what angle His crucifixion is considered
Speaking of the Passover lamb, 12:6 says, 'The whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening'
They tied two legs of the lamb at the foot of the cross and fastened the other outstretched legs to the crossbar
They slew the lamb so that all its blood was shed, for they needed all of the blood to sprinkle on their door frames
The type of the Passover foreshadowed both the date and the way Christ would be put to death for our redemption
As the children of Israel applied the Passover lamb, they were in houses that had been sprinkled with the blood of the lamb
Once we are in Christ as the house, we are redeemed by the blood that has been sprinkled upon the lintel and doorposts of the house
In John 6:53 the Lord Jesus says that we must eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and in verse 55 He declares, 'My flesh is true food'
In 12:8 the children of Israel were given the proper way to eat the flesh of the Passover lamb: roasted with fire
To eat of Christ as if He were 'boiled with water' is to regard His death on the cross, not as death for redemption, but as martyrdom
According to their concept, He was persecuted by man and died as a martyr, having sacrificed Himself for His teachings
If you believe that Christ died on the cross as a martyr because of man's persecution, then you eat the Passover lamb by boiling it in water
If you believe that He died as our Redeemer, being roasted by the holy fire of God, then you eat Him as the Passover lamb roasted in fire
The head signifies wisdom, the legs signify activity and move, and the inwards signify the various inward parts of Christ's being
According to 12:8, the children of Israel were to eat the flesh of the lamb with unleavened bread and bitter herbs
When we believed in the Lord Jesus, many of us received Him as our life supply and also gave up everything sinful
The fact that Christ's legs were not broken signifies that in Christ, the Passover lamb, there is something unbreakable and indestructible
The Roman soldiers and Jewish people could come together to put Christ on the cross, but they could not break His eternal life
In the same principle, Christ's unbroken bone signifies His unbreakable and indestructible eternal life that imparts His life into us
In Christ as our Passover lamb there is such an unbreakable and indestructible life that can impart life into us
The children of Israel were told in 12:46 that none of the bones of the lamb used in the Passover were to be broken
The Passover lamb is wonderful, but if we do not know how to apply it, the lamb will have little meaning in our daily subjective experience
The prevailing concept seems to be that anyone who believes in the Lord Jesus should be placed in a palanquin and carried away to heaven
According to the picture in the book of Exodus, the redeemed ones applied the Passover in such a way that they could become God's army
When you heard the gospel, were you told to repent, believe in the Lord Jesus, receive Him, and then gird yourself up?
Perhaps you did not have words for it, but the Holy Spirit did equip you in such a way and did lead you into a journey of fighting
Because they had to flee from the land of Egypt that night, they were required to eat the Passover lamb hastily
Even by the exercise of such a small amount of hyssop, the blood will be applied to him, and the entire Passover will be his
We should simply maintain our identification with Christ, with a constant realization that we are nothing and that He is everything
The greatest problem among believers today is that in their experience, they are outside of Christ, apart from the oneness with Christ
If you read the book of Galatians, you will see that the Galatians had been distracted from the standing of redemption
Once we are saved, we need to remain in the very place where we have been redeemed, in the place where the blood has been sprinkled
The principle of redemption is that there is no need for us to do anything other than to exercise our hyssop, our faith, to apply the blood
If you are enlightened by the Lord, you may realize that even now, in your experience, you are outside of the house, outside of Christ
When we endeavor in our natural energy to please God, we leave the standing of the redeeming blood and are outside of Christ
The more we endeavor to do things, the more displeased He becomes, for our endeavors do not give Him any enjoyment
Most Christians are outside of the house trying to do things for the Lord; they are not in the house feasting unto the Lord
When some hear this, they may point out that the children of Israel left the house in order to make their exodus out of Egypt
It is sufficient to usher us into the house and to keep us from the judgment of God, but it is not sufficient to equip us
We have seen that Christ is not only the Passover lamb, but also the unleavened bread, the bitter herbs, and the house
The blood of the lamb was put on the lintel and the doorposts of the houses and all the lamb including the head legs and inwards was eaten
Continuing from the feast of the Passover, there was another feast, the feast of unleavened bread, which lasted seven days
Concerning the Passover, the emphasis in the Bible is mainly on the eating of the Passover, not on the keeping of the Passover
According to 12:19, no leaven was to be found in the houses, and according to 13:7, no leaven was to be seen with the children of Israel
Eating unleavened bread indicates that God's people should not live in sin, that is, should not live a sinful life
The function of sin is similar to the function of yeast; it softens things that are hard and makes them easier for us to take in
The children of Israel were to observe the feast of unleavened bread as a continuation of the feast of Passover
We have pointed out that when the children of Israel ate the Passover lamb, they were also required to eat unleavened bread
We have seen that the feast of the Passover lasted one day, whereas the feast of unleavened bread continued for seven days
From the time we received Christ and were saved and had a new beginning in life, we began to live a life without leaven, a life without sin
Although it is not possible for us to be without sin, we must deal with any sin that is manifested, with any sin that is seen
At the time of their conversion they were joyful But this enjoyment did not last because they did not observe the feast of unleavened bread
As soon as we refuse to deal with any sin that has been exposed, we no longer keep the feast of unleavened bread
Due to our serpentine nature, immediately after we were saved or revived, we made up our mind to do certain things
Even many zealous Christians are cut off from spiritual fellowship simply because they are engaged in so much work
As soon as a word is spoken against eating the Lord, it is followed by a suggestion that we work or engage in a certain activity
After you arrive, however, you spend a great deal of time working for him You mow the lawn, trim the trees, and wash the windows
Romans 4:4-5 says, 'Now to the one who works, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt
To the one who works not, but believes on Him Who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness'
If we remain in the natural man or regard ourselves as hired servants who work for recompense, we have no right to partake of the Passover
Although strangers and hired servants could not partake of the Passover, the purchased and circumcised servants were qualified to eat of it
If we are hired by a certain person to work for him, we are willing to work as long as we are happy with our employer
To be a hired one is, spiritually speaking, to work in our natural life for the purpose of receiving recompense
A purchased one is a person who has been lost, who has been bought back, and who has been dealt with by the cross
Exodus 12:44 says, 'But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof'
When a new believer has this realization, he is conscious of the fact that he has been purchased and circumcised
Many of today's Christians have received God's salvation blindly, not realizing that they have been purchased and circumcised
Thank the Lord that we are the purchased and circumcised ones and that we eat the Passover according to God's principles
We need to continue our enjoyment of salvation by getting out of the world and becoming part of the army of the Lord
When we apply Christ as our Passover today, we need all the principles given in the account of the Passover in Exodus
Exodus 1212 says I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast
We cannot apply the Passover in a full way, because God does not allow the old man or the natural life to participate in His Passover
These items are not only portrayed in the picture of the Passover in Exodus, but they also are clearly revealed in the New Testament
When we keep the Passover according to the detailed principles ordained by God, then we apply the Passover in a proper way
