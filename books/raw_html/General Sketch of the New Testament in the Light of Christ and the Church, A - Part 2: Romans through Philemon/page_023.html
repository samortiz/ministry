<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE PRINCIPLES AND CASES IN 1 CORINTHIANS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:2, 9, 23-24, 30, 7; 3:1-3; 2:14-15; 1:12-13; 5:1; 6:7; 7:32; 9:1, 4-5; 10:17, 23; 11:3, 29; 12:12-13; 15:3-4, 54; 16:1-2; 5:7; 10:3-4; 9:24; 3:12, 15, 9</h1><p>First Corinthians is composed of basic principles and a number of cases. In order to know its real content and insight, we must first grasp its principles and then see its cases, which illustrate the principles in many ways. There are eleven cases in this book, and in addition to the main principles and cases, there are several secondary principles.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AND HIS CROSS</h2><p>As we examine the cases in this book, we must keep the main principles in mind. As we saw in the previous chapter, the first principle is Christ on the positive side and the cross to deal with the negative things. In the church life these two matters are very basic. If we do not have a vision from God that Christ is everything, it is very difficult to understand what the real meaning of the Christian walk and church life are.  Christ Himself is the reality, center, and central vision of our Christian walk and church life. He is the portion to us from God.<p>God does not intend to give us anything other than Christ. If God has given us other things, those things are not for themselves; they are for us to realize Christ. All things, such as forms, knowledge, gifts, and functions, are to help us realize Christ, know Christ, partake of Christ, apply Christ, and experience Christ. God’s intention is to give us Christ as our full portion. Christ is both theirs and ours (1:2), and we have been called into the fellowship, that is, the participation, of Christ (v. 9). Moreover, God has made Christ wisdom to us, including righteousness for our past, sanctification for the present, and redemption for the future (v. 30). In God’s salvation, purpose, and plan Christ is everything to us as power and wisdom (v. 24). Now we must learn to know Him in such a way. In our daily walk and in the church life, we must learn how to apply Christ as everything and to experience Him. This is on the positive side.<p>On the other side, there are many negative matters. Sin, self, the natural life, the old man, the worldly things, Satan, and darkness all must be dealt with by the cross. Christ is not Christ only; He is “Christ crucified” (v. 23), that is, Christ with the cross. To experience Christ today, there must be the application of His cross. His cross is the only way to prepare the ground for Him to be everything to us. In order to experience Him, apply Him, and take Him as everything, we must experience the cross of Christ to deal with all the negative things.<p>The first main principle in this book is Christ and the cross. After Paul gives us a general sketch of the Christian life in Romans, he gives us the book of 1 Corinthians to show us the main principles for the life and walk of the universal man—Christ with His Body. This Body of this universal man must realize how to take Christ as everything on the positive side and how to experience the cross daily on the negative side.
