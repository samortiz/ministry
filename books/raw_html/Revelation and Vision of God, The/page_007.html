<h2 class=head3>2. Concerning the Development of the Theology of the Trinity in the Latin Language—Personae, Essentia</h2><p>When the theological studies entered into the Latin language, the term personae was used to refer to the aspect of the Divine Trinity’s being three. This word has three meanings: first, it was used in the ancient Roman Empire to refer to the masks put on by an actor in playing different roles; second, it refers to a role in a play, and by extension, to the role of one with an important position in a government or to the role of a significant member of a family; and third, it denotes “person.” With regard to the aspect of the Divine Trinity’s being one, the word essentia in Latin is used; it denotes “essence,” “intrinsic nature.”<h2 class=head3>3. Concerning the Development of the Theology of the Trinity in the English Language—Hypostases, Persons, Substance, Essence</h2><p>Hypostases, which is the Greek word hupostases anglicized, means “substantial, dependable supports”; stasis is equivalent to the English word substance, referring to something real and substantial. Out of the Latin word personae came the word persons, and the Greek word ousia became the word essence.<h2 class=head3>4. Concerning San-wei-i-t’i in the Chinese Language</h2><p>When the Western missionaries came to China, they used a simple expression, san-wei-i-t’i, to express the concept of the Divine Trinity. Wei denotes “person,” “substance”; t’i refers neither to a physical body nor to a corporate body, but to an entity, to the essence of a substance. Therefore, san-wei-i-t’i means that although the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three in person or in substance, They are one in essence.<h2 class=head1>FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT FOR THE TRUTH</h2><p>Fifteen years ago in Hong Kong I released some messages on the person of Christ. These messages were later compiled into a book entitled, Concerning the Person of Christ. This book clearly outlines six heresies throughout the ages and one proper explanation concerning the person of Christ. This is altogether based upon the research done by the theologians in the past. Recently, a publication was put out in Hong Kong that covers exactly the same things in the same sequence. I would like to speak a word to all of you who are learning to serve the Lord: The way of the Lord’s recovery today is a way that completely repudiates the traditions of Christianity, including Catholicism. Of course, those who are in Christianity are not happy with us since we renounce what they teach. Formerly, in mainland China Brother Watchman Nee was the target of the attacks from Christianity. Afterward, when I was sent abroad, I also became a target, even though that was not what I wanted to be. In America because of our proclaiming the truth, we were libeled and slandered and were therefore forced to file two lawsuits. In one case there was a settlement, and the opposing party issued a public apology in the newspapers. In the other case the opposing party, after losing, intentionally declared bankruptcy. By presenting the truth, we have quelled the waves; now there is no more scornful reviling. However, in the East the situation is still unclear. In the future wherever you go, whether in the East or in the West, you will meet people who are in Christianity. The most important thing is that you should be able to present the truth concerning the Triune God. Therefore, I feel that I should help you to have a clear knowledge to understand the pure revelation of the Holy Scriptures.
