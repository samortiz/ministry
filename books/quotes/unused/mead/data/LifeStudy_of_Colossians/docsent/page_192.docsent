   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT DISTRACTED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word therefore in 3:1 indicates that we need to look back at chapters one and two, since Paul s word in chapters three and four is based upon what he has covered in the first two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to Colossians 1 and 2, the Colossians had been distracted and were paying their attention to the elements of the world 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These elements included Judaistic observances, Gnostic philosophy, mysticism, and asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul wanted the Colossian believers to see that all these isms are elements of the world and that the saints should not be distracted by them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since Christ has been wrought into us to be our life, and since we have been brought into God, where our life is hidden with Christ, we should no longer be occupied with the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, we should remain in God and seek the things above.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is our sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since He is the realm in which we live and walk, we should no longer care for the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>PECULIAR PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From Paul s writings we can see that Christians are peculiar people who do not need religious teachings or ethical admonitions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What makes Christians peculiar is that we have Christ in us as our life and we have God, the living Person, as our realm.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Confucius was ethical, but he was not peculiar in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should praise the Lord that we are not common, but peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The young people may need to testify to their parents that they are young people with Christ in them and that they are with Christ in God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we see the vision, the revelation, that Christ is in us as our life and that we are in God as our sphere, we shall be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We would realize that we have no need for religious or ethical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What need do we have for the elements of the world, for Judaism, Gnosticism, mysticism, or asceticism?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are not common we have Christ, and we are in God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How good it would be for a husband and wife to testify to one another that they are peculiar because they have Christ and are living in God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a husband and wife would have such a realization and speak about it to each other, there would be no room for quarreling or for the expression of opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Oh, may we all realize that according to the Bible, Christ is in us as our hope of glory and that with Christ we are hidden in God!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we must live and walk in God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What revelation could be higher or more precious than this?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Day by day may we enjoy and experience having Christ in us and being with Christ in God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE TWO MINISTRIES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>With this as a foundation, we are now prepared to consider what it means to be one with Christ in the things above.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The things above are related to the second of Christ s two ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first aspect of Christ s ministry was His ministry on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Lasting thirty-three and a half years, this ministry began with Christ s incarnation and was concluded with His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During the years He was on earth, Christ accomplished much in His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through His death on the cross, He accomplished redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All Christians are familiar with the earthly ministry of Jesus and value it very highly, for it is through this ministry that we have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As important as Christ s earthly ministry was, it is not the main aspect of His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The primary part of His ministry is His ministry in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By His earthly ministry He redeemed us, saved us, and regenerated us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But by His heavenly ministry, He is building the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Body of Christ needs the heavenly ministry of Christ, the ministry of Christ above, in order to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today Christ is more busy in heaven than He was when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Years ago, I was taught by some that when Christ finished His redemptive work, He ascended to heaven where He is now resting, waiting until His enemy is made His footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to this teaching, Christ s work is finished, and He has nothing more to do.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although I accepted this teaching at first, I later learned that it presents only part of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yes, as far as Christ s earthly ministry for redemption is concerned, the work is finished, and He is at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no need for Him to do anything further in order to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, the Lord s goal is not merely to redeem us and regenerate us; His goal is to have the church, the Body, the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This goal is more difficult to attain than the goal of accomplishing redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ s work on earth for redemption took, at most, thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But His work for the building up of His Body has been going on for more than nineteen centuries, and still it is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ certainly has much to do in heaven.</S>
