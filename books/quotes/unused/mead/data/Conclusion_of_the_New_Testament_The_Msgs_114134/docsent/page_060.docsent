   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINE THE BELIEVERS THEIR PRESENT 13 8.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Made a New Creation</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning the believers present, we have covered God s calling, the Spirit s sanctification, and our repentance, our believing, and our being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have also seen that the believers have been joined to the Triune God and redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we need to see that, as believers in Christ, we have been made a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, God called us, separated us, and turned us to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then we repented, believed, and were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a result, we have been redeemed and joined to the Triune God to be made a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The most crucial matter in God s full, all-inclusive salvation is His making us a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our being made a new creation is, therefore, a vital part of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may even say that God s making us a new creation is the lifeline of His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The term new creation is not a symbol.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, this is an expression conveying the plain and real fact that we have been saved to be made a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, this new creation, like the old creation, is not something individual but something corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the old creation God did not create millions of men; on the contrary, He created one man, Adam, who includes all men.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The principle is the same with God s new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the new creation we all are parts of the new man Eph 2:15 , the church, composed of the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God s intention is to make us a new creation, and this new creation is composed of sons.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In a very practical sense, the corporate sonship is God s new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those in the old creation are sons of Adam in the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But through God s redemption, regeneration, and dispensing of Himself into us, we who once were sons of Adam have now become sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here in this divine sonship we are corporately the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is a basic difference between the new creation and the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s life and nature are not wrought into the old creation, but the new creation does possess the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although the old creation came into being through the work of the mighty God, He Himself does not reside in it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, the first creation has no divine content.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The divine nature does not dwell in the old creation, and that is why it has become old.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Adam did not have the life of God or the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can receive the divine life and nature only by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ and being regenerated by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we believed in Christ, God s life and nature were imparted to us and caused us to become a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second Corinthians 5:17 says, If anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Anyone who is in Christ is a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The old things of the flesh have passed away through the death of Christ, and all has become new in Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be in Christ is to be one with Him in life and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is of God through our faith in Christ 1 Cor 1:30; Gal 3:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The words, Behold, they have become new, are a call to watch the marvelous change of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word they refers to the old things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation, the believers born again of God, does John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, the believers are a new creation, not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Galatians 6:15 says, Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The old creation is our old man in Adam Eph 4:22 , our natural being by birth, without God s life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The new creation is the new man in Christ Eph 4:24 , our being regenerated by the Spirit of God John 3:6 , having God s life and the divine nature wrought into us, with Christ as its constituent Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is this new creation that fulfills God s eternal purpose by expressing God in His sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whereas circumcision is an ordinance of the law, the new creation is the masterpiece of life with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Circumcision is of dead letters; the new creation is of the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, it avails.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Son of God who has been revealed in us Gal 1:16 enlivens us and makes us a new creation, and the Christ who lives in us Gal 2:20 affords us the riches of His life to live the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything, but a new creation with Christ as its life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The new creation spoken of in Galatians 6:15 is the old creation transformed by the divine life, by the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The old creation was old because God was not part of it; the new creation is new because God is in it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We who have been generated by the Spirit of God are still God s creation, but we are now His new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, this is real only when we live and walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever we live and walk by the flesh, we are in the old creation, not in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Anything in our daily life that does not have God in it is the old creation, but what has God in it is part of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we would be in the new creation, we must enter into an organic union with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Apart from such a union, we shall remain in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But now, by the organic union with the Triune God, we are in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Here in the new creation neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything or avails anything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As believers in Christ, we are the new creation through an organic union with the Triune God.</S>
