   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Whole House Being Circumcised</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis 17:12-13 says, Every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God called Abraham and made a covenant with him, saying, I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee v. 7 . The sign of the covenant between God and Abraham was circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All who were circumcised belonged to God, and all who were not circumcised were not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God also told Abraham that his whole household needed to be circumcised, including those who were born in his house and those who were bought with his money.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the promise of circumcision was not given to Abraham alone but to his whole household.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Circumcision takes the household as a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s promise came to Abraham s house, not to him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A Passover Lamb for Each Household</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Exodus 12:3-7 says, Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a house...and they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Passover lamb was clearly given to a household, not to an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Again we see the importance of a household before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Passover lamb had to do with a household; it was not an individual matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A lamb was not prepared for each person, but for each household.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The blood struck on the doorpost and side posts was to protect the whole household.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The angel of destruction would pass over a whole household.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is marvelous to see that the salvation prepared by the Lord Jesus Christ is not for an individual alone but for the whole household, just like the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If one man eats the lamb, it means that only he is being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if the whole household eats the lamb, it means that the whole household is being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Salvation is for the whole household.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The whole household eats the lamb, and similarly the whole household strikes the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The whole household enjoys these things together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>May God open our eyes to see that salvation is a matter of the whole household, not individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Priesthood Being for the Household</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s promise of the priesthood was also for a whole house.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was not for one or two individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Numbers 18:1 says, And Jehovah said to Aaron, You and your sons and your father s house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 11 says, This also is yours, the heave offering of their gift, all the wave offerings of the sons of Israel; I have given them to you, and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual due; every one who is clean in your house may eat of it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God gave all the sacrifices and offerings to the house of Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The sacrifices were for the house of Aaron, not for Aaron alone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is because God accepts the house as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Please remember that the priesthood was for Aaron s house, not for Aaron alone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The priesthood took the household as a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Household Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Joshua 2:19 says, Anyone who goes forth from the doors of your house into the street, his blood will be upon his own head, and we will be innocent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>And whoever is with you in the house, his blood will be upon our heads if a hand should come upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Joshua 6:17 says, And the city shall be devoted to Jehovah for destruction, it and all that is in it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in her house, because she hid the messengers we sent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here we see Rahab the harlot and her household being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What did she do?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She received the spies.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When she received the spies, God gave her a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She was to tie a line of scarlet thread in the window.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All who were in the house which had the scarlet thread were spared, while the rest of the inhabitants of Jericho were killed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The scarlet thread signifies salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The scarlet-thread salvation saved Rahab s household; it did not save just her.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to be very clear about the scope of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Chapter two of Joshua gives the promise, and chapter six gives the actual execution.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Both the promise in chapter two and the execution in chapter six show us that Rahab s whole household was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All who were in the house which had the scarlet thread were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God s salvation is for the whole household, not for individuals.</S>
