   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A VOICE COMING OUT OF THEIR WINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As the living creatures moved, Ezekiel heard the voice of their wings 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that as they moved in such a coordination, a voice came out.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This voice was their testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The voice of the testimony of any local church must come out of the proper coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It should not be the voice of any individual believer; it should be the voice of the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The voice comes out of the wings joined one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before the day of Pentecost, Peter was one who often spoke something by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What he spoke was nearly always rejected by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is because he spoke something by himself Matt 17:4-5, 24-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But after the Lord's ascension, on the day of Pentecost, Peter stood up with the Eleven Acts 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I do believe that when the Twelve stood there, they were like the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The voice which came out was not the voice of an individual Peter, but the voice of a corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The four living creatures stretched their two wings for coordination and for moving and for giving the voice.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>TWO WINGS COVERING THEMSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the same time, they used their other two wings to cover themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that in the church life, in the coordination, we all must learn to hide ourselves under the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not display yourself, but rather hide your- self.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hide under the eagle's wings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There should be no manifestation of any self or any individual.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Regardless of how great our portion is, we must hide ourselves under the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should never boast in ourselves, but in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>AS THE SOUND OF GREAT WATERS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a local church will then be qualified and adequate to sound out the voice and to give a strong testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The voice will not be like that of an individual person, but like the sound of great waters 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all must look to the Lord that the testimonies of all the local churches would be like the sound of great waters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One individual brother should not always speak something for the local church, but a coordinated body should sound the voice and give the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>People will be astonished at this kind of voice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They will say that the voice of this local church is like the sound of great waters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>AS THE VOICE OF THE ALMIGHTY</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It says also that this voice is the voice of the Almighty 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It becomes the voice of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is the voice of a corporate body, but it becomes the voice of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>AS THE VOICE OF AN ARMY</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually the voice is that of a fighting army 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sometimes, the atmosphere in the local churches may not be like this because they do not have such a clear, expanding, and stable heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When they do not have a proper fellowship and coordination, they may try to vindicate themselves and claim to have something.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If they have something real, they do not need to claim anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If they are always claiming that they are rich, it indicates actually they are poor.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A millionaire does not need to claim that he is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only a poor beggar would claim that he has a million dollars in the bank.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Can you see this wonderful picture?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Look at the expanse.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Look at the move.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Look at the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Look at the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the voice of great waters, the voice of the Almighty, and the voice of an army.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please remember that this cannot be accomplished in us overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must begin with the blowing wind from the north and pass through all the experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The experience of all these things brings us to the crystal-clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the local churches must come to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All must follow one another to get to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the New Jerusalem there is only one way, one street.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to follow one another to come to this one point.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need a clear sky with a wide expanse which is awesome and terrible in the eyes of other people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we arrive at that stage, we will have a proper testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We will have a voice like the sound of great waters and like that of the Almighty God and like that of an army fighting the battle for God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>LETTING DOWN THEIR WINGS</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>TO LISTEN TO GOD'S VOICE</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Notice, however, that the living creatures do not move all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Sometimes they stop and stand still.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When they stand still, they lower their wings 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When they hear a voice out of the clear sky above their heads, they stop and let down their wings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This means they know how to listen to God's voice.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They know not only how to speak and sound forth their own voice, but also how to listen to God's voice.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>While they listen to God's voice, they stop moving, they stand still, and they lower their wings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Is this the situation in your local church?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I am afraid that the local church where you are may not know how to lower their wings, to stop and listen to the voice from the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I am afraid that in your church there may not be the proper coordination, but rather a one-man show.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The coordination of the four living creatures is not a one-man show.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One person does not decide everything.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is a coordination of all the living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In some of the local churches it is really like a one-man show.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>That one person insists that everyone and everything must be under his control.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is why that local church is weak and narrow and poor.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>No matter what that local church claims to have, in fact it has nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is no voice from the wings.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We all must have a clear picture of what is the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The first chapter of Ezekiel has the clearest picture in the whole Bible concerning the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The coordination shown there is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>All the experiences in a wonderful sequence bring the living creatures to a point that they are under a crystal-clear, expanding, and stable heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Thus, they have a proper move on this earth and they can give the whole universe the proper voice and testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Here they learn to stop and listen to God's voice.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They know how to give the voice by moving and they know how to listen to God's voice by stopping.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>May the Lord cause all the local churches to be brought into such an experience.</S>
