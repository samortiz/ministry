   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN LIVING A GRAFTED LIFE WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We reign in life not only in dying with Adam, living with Christ, and being overcoming in all circumstances but also in living a grafted life with Christ Rom 11:17-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. To Live the Life of the New Creation</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>in Our Being Grafted with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We reign in life to live the life of the new creation in our being grafted with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that we become a new creation in Christ 2 Cor 5:17 , walking by the Spirit according to the rule of being a new creation Gal 6:15-16; 5:25 that we may put on the new man Eph 2:15; 4:23-24 and experience the renewing of the new man Col 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. To Reign in Eternity</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>in Our Being Grafted with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We reign in life not only to live the life of the new creation but also to reign in eternity in our being grafted with Christ 2 Tim 2:12; Rev 20:4, 6; 22:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This word concerning our being grafted with Christ may be simple, yet what is involved includes the heaven, the earth, and many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here it says that we have been grafted into Christ, yet this Christ is the God who dwells in unapproachable light 1 Tim 6:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since we cannot touch Him, how can we be grafted into Him?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why Christ needed to pass through various processes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first process that He went through was His becoming flesh John 1:14 to be the seed of David Matt 1:1 , the branch of David Zech 3:8; Jer 23:5; 33:15 , that we might be grafted together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As human beings we are branches, pieces of wood; in like manner, Christ came as the branch of David, as a piece of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is exactly the same as we are; hence, He and we can be grafted together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The process by which Christ became a piece of wood was not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And His becoming a piece of wood did not by itself mean that He could be grafted with us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A grafter knows that in order to have a successful grafting, both of the grafting parts need to be cut and die.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First, the part to be grafted has to die, and second, the part to be grafted into has to die also.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only when both sides die can the grafting be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On Christ s side, one day, as the branch of David, He died on the cross; however, although He died in the flesh, He was resurrected in the Spirit 1 Pet 3:18b .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through death and resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By becoming such a Spirit, Christ was ready for the grafting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On our side, as sinners, we need to repent and receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once we repent and receive Him, He as the life-giving Spirit enters into our spirit and puts the divine life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This life is a life of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, He brings the key to death and resurrection into us who have believed in Him and have died and resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, in this death and resurrection we are grafted together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After we have been grafted together with Christ, we should no longer live by ourselves; rather, we should allow the pneumatic Christ to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, we should no longer live by our flesh or our natural being; rather, we should live by our mingled spirit, a spirit grafted with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, first, we are united with Him; this is a union.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we are mingled with Him; this is a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, we are incorporated with Him into an incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This incorporation is the New Jerusalem, the great universal incorporation of the mingling of God and man for us to reign in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brothers and sisters, I hope that you not only get these words into you but also repeat them like tape recorders.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I often pray for you at my home.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have been a slave of the Lord speaking for Him for over sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am like a tape recorder speaking for the Lord again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I truly hope that when I speak, others will be tape recorders.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is my prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord answered my prayer, saying, With men it is impossible, but with Me everything is possible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With all these believers who are under your leading, I can make every one of them such a tape recorder.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I hope that all the brothers and sisters can enter into such a word, be constituted with such a word, and clearly speak such a word.</S>
