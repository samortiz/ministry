   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The First Priest of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Abel was the first priest.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He did not hire a priest to offer his sacrifice for him; he did it himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every Abel is a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not ask others to offer your sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do not go to a father in the Catholic Church, to a priest in the Anglican Church, or to a minister or pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You must be the priest, presenting the sacrificial offering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everyone in the church life is a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We offer Christ to God continually.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>D. Persecuted by the Worshippers in the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Abel was persecuted and killed by Cain because he worshipped God in God's way, not like Cain who worshipped God in his own way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Cain was in the flesh, trusting in the fruit of his labor, but Abel had no trust in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He put his trust in his offering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Typically speaking, Abel trusted and boasted in Christ, having no confidence in the flesh Phil 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The worshippers in the flesh always oppose and persecute those who worship by the Spirit Gal 4:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>E. A Type of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Abel was a type of Christ Heb 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is a type?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A type is a shadow or a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although Abel was not Christ, he was a picture of Christ showing some of the aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For instance, Abel was a feeder of sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus was the real feeder, the true shepherd of God's people John 10:11, 14; Heb 13:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although not many people in the Bible are called righteous, both the Lord Jesus and Abel are called righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Matthew 23:35 Abel was called "righteous Abel"; in Acts 7:52 and 22:14 the Lord Jesus is called the Righteous One.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Abel was killed by his brother in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jesus also was killed by His Jewish brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, both the blood of Abel and the blood of Jesus are speaking bloods.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Genesis 4:10 says that the voice of Abel's blood cries unto God from the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The speaking of Abel's blood, however, was only a type of the speaking of the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Hebrews 12:24, the fulfillment of the type in Genesis 4:10, we are told that the blood of Jesus is the "blood of sprinkling, which speaks better than that of Abel."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have the speaking blood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We not only have the redeeming blood, the cleansing blood, and the covering blood, but also the speaking blood.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Abel's blood spoke from the earth; Jesus' blood speaks from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It speaks better things than the blood of Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Praise the Lord!</S>
