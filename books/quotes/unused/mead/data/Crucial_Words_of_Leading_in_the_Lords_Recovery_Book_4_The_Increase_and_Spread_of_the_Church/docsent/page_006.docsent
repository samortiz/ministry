   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Through the Economical Spirit Whom the Lord Poured Out upon His Body in His Ascension</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The spread of the Lord s propagation to the uttermost part of the earth is carried out through the economical Spirit, whom the Lord poured out upon His Body in His ascension 2:4, 17, 41, 47; 4:4, 31; 5:14; 6:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Bible readers pay attention only to the receiving of power in the first part of Acts 1:8, but they overlook the part concerning being His witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This part is related to being the Lord s propagation unto the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The economical Spirit of power is not for our personal living and enjoyment but for God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is only when we enter into God s economy by going out to work for His economy that we can enjoy the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, if we continue to live a set and settled life, it will not be very easy to experience the outpouring of the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I absolutely believe that if some are willing to receive a burden to spread the Lord s propagation as His martyrs and witnesses, they will surely experience the economical Spirit being poured out upon them so that they can testify for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through the Announcing of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>from House to House by the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The spread of the Lord s propagation involves the believers meeting and announcing the gospel from house to house 5:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we must set up small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The gospel should be preached in every house.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through the Prayer and</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>the Ministry of the Word by the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The spread of the Lord s propagation also depends upon the apostles prayer and the ministry of the word 6:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although we pay considerable attention to truth and life, the responsible brothers and full-timers do not pray enough, and the words that are spoken are not rich enough.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the day of Pentecost three thousand people believed in the Lord and were saved because there was much prayer and the ministry of the word by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through the Scattering and Moving</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>of the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The spread of the Lord s propagation also occurs through the scattering and moving of the believers 8:1, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is migration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not easy for people to move.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, Acts 8 says that God raised up persecution in Jerusalem so that almost all the believers in Jerusalem were scattered to other places; only the apostles remained in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the believers were scattered to other places, they brought the gospel with them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through the Traveling and Preaching</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>of the Evangelists</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The spread of the Lord s propagation was furthered by the traveling and preaching of the evangelists vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>5, 12, 26-30, 39-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Philip went out to preach the gospel, the Lord s angel was with him, and the Lord s Spirit was also with him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord s angel guided him, and the Lord s Spirit spoke to him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through this, the gospel spread greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through the Preaching of the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The spread of the Lord s propagation involves the preaching of the believers 9:19-22, 28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Acts 9 records that right after Saul of Tarsus was saved, he started to preach that Jesus was the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a good pattern to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Saul was appointed as an apostle by God thirteen years after his salvation, but prior to this appointment he was a believer and a pattern to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to 1 Timothy 1:15-16, he considered himself the foremost of sinners, but he also recognized that the Lord had saved him to make him a pattern to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul s pattern shows that once a person is saved, he should immediately preach Jesus to others; that is, he should speak of the One in whom he did not believe, whom he opposed, and whom he even slandered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through the Traveling and Preaching</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>of the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The spread of the Lord s propagation is carried out through the traveling and preaching of the apostles Acts 8:14, 25; 9:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although the apostles remained in Jerusalem, Peter, John, and others were sent out, and they traveled around without settling down in a particular place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today many of our co-workers do not want to move once they have gone to a particular place.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, Peter still looked for opportunities to travel and to preach even though he bore important responsibilities in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through the Specific Sending</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>of the Apostles for the Work</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The spread of the Lord s propagation was advanced by the specific sending of the apostles for the work, as recorded in Acts 13:2-3.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When some prophets and teachers were praying and fasting in the church in Antioch, the Holy Spirit told them to set apart Barnabas and Saul and to send them out to do a specific work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Surely, this was not an easy thing to do at that time, but they went out boldly to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They first went to the synagogues of the Jews to speak to the Jews v. 5; 14:1; 17:1-2 , but later they turned to the Gentiles 13:46-48 . This was not permitted by the customs and practices of the Jews, but the apostles went against their traditions and preached the gospel to the Gentiles.</S>
