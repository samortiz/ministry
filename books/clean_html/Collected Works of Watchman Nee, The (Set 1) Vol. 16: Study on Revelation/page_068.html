<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Q. Revelation 18:20</H2><P>"Be glad over her, O heaven and saints and apostles and prophets, because God has judged judgment for you upon her."</P><P>"Saints" may refer more to men of the Old Testament; "apostles," to Christians; and "prophets," to those from the second Pentecost.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>R. Revelation 18:21</H2><P>"And a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, Thus will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence and shall be found no more at all."</P><P>Although it is not known how God will destroy Babylon, it is possible that this will be done by an earthquake because in 16:19 He remembers the great Babylon after a great earthquake. Wherever there is an earthquake, there is usually fire; hence, the kings of the earth and the merchants see the smoke from afar but cannot help (18:9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>S. Revelation 18:22-24</H2><P>"And the sound of harp-singers and musicians and flutists and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in you, and no craftsman of any craft shall be found any more at all in you, and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in you, and the light of a lamp shall shine no more at all in you, and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall be heard no more at all in you; for your merchants were the great ones of the earth, for by your sorcery all the nations were deceived. And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been slain on the earth."</P><P>The words "no more" or "any more" appear six times in these verses (vv. 21b-23). In 18:23b-24 three reasons (they are actually sins) are given for God's judgment of Babylon:</P><P>(1) "For your merchants were the great ones of the earth."</P><P>(2) "For by your sorcery all the nations were deceived."</P><P>(3) "And in her was found the blood of...all who have been slain on the earth."</P><P>The error of today's commerce is that, instead of balancing the wealth, it entices people. Therefore, it is sinful. Sorcery is to communicate with the demons. In the future, Rome may become the center of such activity. Rome will also be preeminent in shedding people's blood.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE PRAISE IN HEAVEN<br>(REVELATION 19:1-6)</H2><P>Revelation 19:1-6 is a continuation of 18:24.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 19:1</H2><P>"After these things I heard as it were a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah! The salvation and the glory and the power are of our God."</P><P>"After these things" means after the complete destruction of Babylon. This "great multitude" includes all saved ones (not only those saved during the dispensation of grace).</P><P>Hallelujah means "Praise the Lord" in Hebrew. Why "Hallelujah"? It is because salvation and glory and power have now come.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Revelation 19:2</H2><P>"For true and righteous are His judgments; for He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and He avenged the blood of His slaves at her hand."</P><P>"For true and righteous are His judgments." This matches "righteous and true" in 15:3. They are "true" because God judges according to the real situation; they are "righteous" because God judges according to the proper method. The verses which follow cite God's judgment of religious Rome (the great harlot) as a proof that God is righteous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Revelation 19:3</H2><P>"And a second time they said, Hallelujah! And her smoke goes up forever and ever."</P><P>Naturally, the smoke of Rome will cease, but her punishment will last forever and ever.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Revelation 19:4</H2><P>"And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God, who sits upon the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah!"</P><P>This is the last time that the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures are mentioned in the Bible. The great multitude in heaven is the first to say, "Hallelujah!" (19:1); then the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures join them, saying, "Amen, Hallelujah!" This shows that they are different from the great multitude in heaven. The great multitude in heaven speaks of salvation, glory, power, and so forth, clearly indicating that the church is included. This shows that the twenty-four elders do not represent the church. From this point on there is no more mention of the twenty-four elders, because they resign from their office at this time.</P>
