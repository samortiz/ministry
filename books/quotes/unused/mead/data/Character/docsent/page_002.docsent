   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE CHARACTER THE FIRST GROUP GENUINE, EXACT, STRICT 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genuine</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The opposite of genuine is false.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He who pretends is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genuineness forms one s foundation and base.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A person who is not genuine is baseless and cannot be entrusted with great responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Genuineness in character is the ability to sacrifice for others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Merely to be an honest person is not sufficient; one must be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One who is not genuine may be welcomed by others initially, but the welcome will not last.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Over time, it is genuineness which gains people s hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To inspire others confidence, one must possess a genuine character.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Exact</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most people are loose; few are truly exact.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One who is punctual does not procrastinate.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One who is accurate in his words is dependable, and one who is precise in his work is trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rare and precious is a person who is perfectly accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Strict</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Genuineness and tightness make up exactness, which in turn is manifested in strictness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Looseness leads to inaccuracy; he who is exact is always strict.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The secret to a punctual person is his strictness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only by being strict can one be genuine and exact.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE SECOND GROUP DILIGENT, BROAD, FINE 1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Diligent</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Few people are diligent; most prefer leisure to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once a person becomes lazy, he can accomplish nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 12:11 says, Not slothful in zeal, and Proverbs 6:6 says, Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why do laziness, gluttony, and sleep go together Titus 1:12 ?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is because all lazy people pity and love themselves, and thus naturally love to eat and sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, 2 Thessalonians 3:10 says, If anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All four points mentioned above are related to dealing severely with oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Broad</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is easy for one who possesses the foregoing character traits to become narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He must therefore pay attention to having a broad character.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Chinese language uses an expression meaning ocean to illustrate a person s capacity to be as large as the ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And God gave Solomon...largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore 1 Kings 4:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since sand encompasses the sea, the biblical requirement concerning broadness is greater than that conveyed by the Chinese expression.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The impact of a person s life-work has much to do with his being either broad or small.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A petty person can never accomplish great things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Fine</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A person with a broad capacity often fails to be fine, leading to negligence and inevitable loss.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One ought to be broad but not rough, fine but not small.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE THIRD GROUP STABLE, PATIENT, DEEP 1.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Stable</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be stable is to be solid and not easily moved, not panicky, hasty, or anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Stability, however, differs from slowness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Being slow means not acting when there is time to act, while being stable means allowing time to do its work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A stable person does not make decisions lightly or carelessly, nor does he easily praise or condemn others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When a situation is not entirely clear to him, he stops and does not speak or express his opinions carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Neither does he proceed casually in matters that are serious, uncertain, or incomprehensible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul, a stable person, said to the Corinthians, Our word toward you is not yes and no 2 Cor 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Patient</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Patience here does not refer to endurance but to the ability to wait, as mentioned in James 5:7, The farmer awaits the precious fruit of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Patience differs from slowness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To be slow is to miss a present opportunity, whereas to be patient is to anticipate a coming opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One should not be slow, but one should be able to wait, working diligently without ever losing hope.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Merely to hope, however, is vain; one should trust in his own ability to accomplish things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A patient person is able to remain still when he is in pain.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The farmer who patiently awaits his harvest from the earth is allowing time to do its work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Patience is not passivity; it is aggressiveness without anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Deep</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To be deep is to be not shallow or superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is to base one s judgment on evidence rather than appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is neither to be nagging nor to be bothersome, but simply to be serious.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In any case, one should be deep but not overly inquisitive, since a prying person is useless.</S>
