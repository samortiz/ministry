(Chung, Shanghai)</P><P>Answer: This psalm is David's confession of his sin of adultery with Bathsheba. Although he had sinned against Uriah, and although he had sinned against Bathsheba, his deep regret before God caused him to consider the way he had grieved God and fallen short of His glory. In such deep self remorse and regret, he considered that he had sinned against God Himself. It is a pity that believers today for the most part are sorry for themselves and do not have such a contrite spirit! If a man does not weep after he sins, he will probably sin again.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WOMEN CUTTING THEIR HAIR</H2><P>Question: Is it scriptural for a woman to cut her hair? (Ho, Foochow)</P><P>Answer: No, it is not. First Corinthians 11:2-16 gives two reasons: (1) long hair is the glory of a woman, and (2) it is a sign of submission to authority.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SELF-EXALTATION</H2><P>Question: How does one explain Matthew 23:9 and 10? (Chung, Shanghai)</P><P>Answer: In order to understand the Bible, we have to read the context. Here, prior to these verses, the Lord was rebuking the scribes and the Pharisees, because they exalted themselves in the seat of Moses, but did not have any good works. Yet they wanted to be the leaders-to be called rabbis. After these verses, He said that we should humble ourselves and should be one another's servants. After reading the context of this passage, we will realize the intention of our beloved Lord. He does not mean that we should not call our physical father "father," or that teachers should not be called "teachers" by their students. This is not what the Lord means. The Lord points out clearly His reason for teaching this: "You are all brothers" (v. 8). "For One is your Father, He who is in the heavens" (v. 9). "Because One is your Instructor, the Christ" (v. 10). All these are spiritual relationships and have nothing to do with their titles according to the flesh. In considering the word brothers, we know that it concerns matters within the church; it does not concern fleshly matters outside the church. The Lord's teaching is twofold: one should not be called, and one should not call others. The Lord does not want us to follow the conduct of the Pharisees, who did many things only for the praise of men. We should not have any motive other than fulfilling our duty. Today the church behaves in just the same way as the Israelites did in the days of old! There is a group of people who stand between the heavenly Father and the brothers, who assume authority upon themselves. Actually, besides the Bible, the church has no authority of its own. It is a pity that God's children not only tolerate this kind of teaching, but promote it as well. In the Lord's eyes, everyone in the church is His child, and there is no distinction of class. It is the poison of Catholicism to separate the "pastors" from the "laity." In reading the New Testament, we see that apostles and shepherds are only gifts of God (Eph. 4:11). A gift has no authority attached to it; its only function is to build up the brothers. Although there were such things as excommunications in the apostolic churches, such matters belonged to the whole Body (1 Cor. 5:13) and were unlike today's hierarchical practices. As to Timothy's receiving of Paul's charges, his rebukes and exhortations, they were all the exercise of personal gifts. We should make a clear distinction between gift and hierarchy. The former is what God is after, whereas the latter is what man has created. When the voice of the church becomes too loud, God's word is seldom consulted. We should realize that before God we are all equal. Hence, all those who desire to uplift themselves are disobeying the command of the Lord and will be humbled (Matt. 23:12). It is a pity that many people have disobeyed the instructions in these two verses because they do not understand the teaching of the Bible! Yet, God's children should realize that not only is God not happy with our receiving titles from others, but He is also not happy that we address others with any title.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RISING OF THE MORNING STAR</H2><P>Question: How does one explain the second half of 2 Peter 1:19? (Chung, Shanghai)</P><P>Answer: This verse is difficult to understand according to the present punctuation. How can the morning star rise in our hearts? If we look at the punctuation and order of phrases in the translations of two great Bible scholars, Tregelles and F. W. Grant, the meaning will be apparent. "And we have the prophetic word made more firm, to which you do well to give heed as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts" (2 Pet. 1:19). The morning star does not rise in the believers' hearts. Instead, the believers should give heed to the prophetic word in their hearts. The prophetic words are like a lamp shining in the present dark world, until the appearance of the Lord Jesus to His saints.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 07: The Christian (5) &nbsp; pg 36</div><br></body></html>
