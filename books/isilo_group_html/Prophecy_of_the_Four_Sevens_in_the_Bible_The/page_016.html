The Second Seal&#151;<br>a Red Horse and Its Rider,<br>Signifying the Spreading of War</H2><P>The second seal consists of a red horse and its rider, signifying the spreading of war. Revelation 6:3-4 says, "And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, another, a red horse went forth; and to him who sits on it, to him it was given to take peace from the earth, and that they should slay one another; and a great sword was given to him." "Red" here signifies the shedding of blood. The red horse is a symbol of the raging of war, which is altogether a matter of shedding blood.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a.

Revelation 6:5-6 says, "And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, a black horse; and he who sits on it having a balance in his hand. And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying: A choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenixes of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine." "Black" here indicating the dearth (Jer. 14:1-4), signifies the color of the visage of famished people (Lam. 4:8-9; 5:9-10). The black horse is a symbol of the spreading of famine, which causes a black visage.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a.
