Through the Renewing of Our Mind</h2><p>Romans 12:2 says that we are to be transformed by the renewing of our mind. The mind is the main part of our soul. The second part is the emotion, and the third is the will. To transform us is to metabolically change our soul. Verse 2 and the chorus of hymn #750 (Hymns) say:<p class=hbody>God hath us regenerated In our spirit with His life; But He must transform us further- In our soul by His own life. Lord, transform us to Thine image In emotion, mind, and will; Saturate us with Thy Spirit, All our being wholly fill.<p>First, God regenerated us and now He is transforming us by the renewing of our mind, emotion, and will.<h2 class=head3>3. Into the Image of the Glory of the Firstborn Son of God</h2><p>Eventually, we will be fully transformed into the image of the glory of the firstborn Son of God (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29). This requires much explanation, but the explanation has already been released in the Life-study Messages. For this reason I would encourage all of us to obtain a set of these messages and get into them.<h2 class=head3>4. The Jasper Stone Signifying the Appearance of God</h2><p>All the stones of the holy city&#8217;s wall and the first layer of its foundations are jasper (Rev. 21:18a, 19a), and the jasper stone signifies the appearance of God (4:3a), indicating that the entire city is in the appearance of God in His glory (21:11). The entire city expresses God.<h2 class=head2>D. Built Up Together to Be One Complete Wall</h2><p>While the transformation work of the Spirit is going on in the divine life, we, the transformed precious stones, are being built up together to be one complete wall with its foundations. We are built up together through the work of transformation. Transformation is the proper way to build up the Body of Christ. If we do not see this, how can we build up the Body of Christ? Many speak of the Body of Christ, but where is the practicality of the Body? How can the Body of Christ be built up? It can be built up only by our being transformed into precious stones. While the transformation work is going on, we, the precious stones, are being built up together.<h2 class=head2>E. The Functions of Its Wall and Its Foundations</h2><p>Now we want to see the functions of the holy city&#8217;s wall and its foundations (21:12a, 14).<h2 class=head3>1. Separation</h2><p>The first function is to separate, to sanctify, the city unto God from all things other than God, thus making the city the holy city (21:2a, 10b).<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Application of the Interpretation of the New Jerusalem to the Seeking Believers &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
