   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LIMITED JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all know that Jesus of Nazareth is God incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In other words He is God clothed with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If God had not clothed Himself with flesh, He could never have accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the reason He was incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the minute He put on the flesh, He was limited in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was limited in time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If He remained merely God, He would not be within the bounds of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the minute He put on humanity, He was trapped by these two factors.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He became the same as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How is the flesh bound by time and space?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you are in Tientsin, you cannot be in Peking at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you appear in China, you cannot appear simultaneously in England.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as you have a body, you are confined by distance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You can only be in one place at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Human beings are bound by the body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, you are also limited by time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You cannot exist at two different times simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I can only know you as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I cannot see what you will become tomorrow or next year.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Often I would be talking to someone one minute.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The next instant he was no longer available to me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That person to whom I talked was limited; he could only appear to me at one time but not at another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the bondage that time puts on our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can be together, but not forever.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Time puts an ultimate end to all human relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ who clothed Himself with human flesh, was also confined by the two conditions of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All that God could do then was to reckon us as attached to Christ and accomplish redemption this way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There was as yet no way for us to be actually in Him, because we could not get into another body of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order for us to be in Christ or Christ in us, there was the need for Him to be something other than merely in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He had to come in another form before He could be one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Fire can become one with iron because it is something that has "proceeded forth."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is impossible to blend a piece of wood into iron.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He had to appear in another fashion before He could come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>NO LONGER ACCORDING TO THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Second Corinthians 5:16 says, "So then we, from now on, know no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here the apostle revealed one of the most elementary doctrines in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Christ that we preach is no longer the Christ in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is very different from the One whom the twelve disciples knew in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then Christ walked with them, ate with them, lived with them, and traveled together with them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They saw His face and touched His hands; they heard His voice and watched His miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everything they knew about Him was after the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But this amazing passage tells us that we know Him no longer after the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The fleshly relationship is no longer valid.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why is there the need for such a verse?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is a very strong reason for it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If Christ were still in His flesh, He would still be encumbered by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We could only contact Him some of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He would be available at one place only.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everyone who was not at the same place and the same time as He could not touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Please give your full attention to this peak of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the Christ that we preach today were still in the flesh, imagine what would happen!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If at this moment He was in Jerusalem, He would not be available here in Tientsin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If He came to Tientsin, the ones in Jerusalem would miss Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then He would become a prisoner of space like us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What if He wanted to stay permanently in Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How could we see Him?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Perhaps once in a while we would have to pay the expense to travel to Jerusalem to visit Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At least we would have to make this pilgrimage once a year to behold the incarnated God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In Jerusalem we might be able to stay very close to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But the minute we left Jerusalem, we would be separated again from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hence, if Christ were still in the flesh, our faith would be a materialistic religion.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christianity would have a universal center on earth from which it would control and direct all the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the twelve disciples were with Christ, He still had His flesh with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When He talked to three disciples, the other nine missed it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When He walked with eleven, one was left out.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even when they all dined together, some were closer to Him than others.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Not everyone could recline on His bosom as John did.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He was limited by time and space.</S>
