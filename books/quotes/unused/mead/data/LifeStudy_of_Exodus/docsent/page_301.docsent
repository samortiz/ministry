   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Before God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The table of the bread of the Presence was set up before God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is why the bread on the table is called the bread of the Presence the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that the priests enjoyed Christ as a feast before God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In contrast, many of those who ate manna did not eat in God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They could eat manna in any place, whether or not they were in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The table, on the contrary, was before God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was not far from the ark of the testimony in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. Within the Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The table of the bread of the Presence was inside the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This signifies that the table is within, or among, the builded saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although it may seem unusual to express it this way, I would like to ask this question: Who is the tabernacle today?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I do not ask, What is the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, I ask, Who is the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The answer to this question is that those believers who have been builded together in an actual and practical way are God s present tabernacle as His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Within this tabernacle, the saints who have been built together, there is a table.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The tabernacle was a building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that it was built of many pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this reason, we can say that the table was within a building.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We who have been in the church life for a period of time can testify that the enjoyment of Christ as a table for our nourishment cannot be found anywhere else.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Apart from the church life, we cannot enjoy Christ in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yes, Christians may experience manna everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if they enjoy Christ as their manna when they are doing something worldly, Christ will supply them to turn away from that activity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, some who still go to the movies may contact Christ as their daily manna.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a result of this contact with Him, they know they must stop going to movies.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A husband or wife may touch the Lord as manna even in the midst of an argument.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then one of them may stop quarreling, go to another room, and pray to the Lord and be supplied by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the experience of manna, not of the table.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Certain Christian teachers say that this table typifies Christ as the nourishment for God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In their application, however, they make the table too general.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The table is not general; rather, it is particular.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In contrast to the table spoken of in Psalm 23, the table set up on the battlefield before the enemy, this table was near the ark in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Praise the Lord for this particular, precious table!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I repeat, according to typology, this table signifies the enjoyment of Christ as our nourishment for serving.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, this table is located next to God s embodiment in the midst of the builded-up saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose certain believers meet together week after week, yet there is no building among them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As long as they are not built up together in a practical way, they cannot have the experience of the table, for the table is located within the tabernacle, God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since these believers do not have a tabernacle, they cannot have the table.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I wish to emphasize the fact that the enjoyment of the table requires the building of the tabernacle the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then in the tabernacle we may enjoy the table.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that we must be those believers who are built up together as God s present dwelling place in an actual and practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then within this building there will be the table of the bread of the Presence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our experience in the church life proves that this is true.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From my experience of Christ and the church I have learned that this table is found only within the tabernacle, only in the midst of the builded saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I studied the typology of the tabernacle many years ago, I did not realize that the table was among the builded saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At that time I did not have any experience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But now I can strongly testify that I enjoy my Christ as a particular portion, the table, within the tabernacle and close to the ark as God s embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Oh, how rich is this enjoyment of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>C. To Be Their Daily Life Supply</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The table of the bread of the Presence was also to be the daily life supply for God s priests.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By means of this supply, they were able to live and serve in God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our living and serving of the Lord should not be in any worldly place, nor even restricted to our home.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our living and serving must be in God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this, we have the daily supply from the table of the bread of the Presence.</S>
