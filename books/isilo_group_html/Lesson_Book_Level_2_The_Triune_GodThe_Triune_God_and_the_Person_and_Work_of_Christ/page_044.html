He did a complete job; nothing was left unfinished. After His crucifixion and burial He resurrected. Neither death nor the tomb could hold this One since He Himself is the resurrection (John 11:25). His life is a death-conquering and death-subduing life. It is even a death-swallowing life (1 Cor. 15:54): the more death it encounters the more living it becomes. Therefore the Lord Jesus says, "I am...the living One, and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever, and I have the keys of death and of Hades" (Rev. 1:17-18).</P><P>This living One who went into death was both God and man. Even after His resurrection, He is still God and man. His resurrection is of tremendous significance. In this lesson we will see that Christ's resurrection is His vindication and victory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. GOD'S VINDICATION OF AND SATISFACTION WITH<br>CHRIST'S PERSON AND WORK</H2><P>On the one hand, Christ is God; as God He laid down His life and took it up again (John 10:17-18). On the other hand, this One is a man whom God raised from the dead (Acts 2:32; 3:15). The raising of the man Jesus Christ shows God's approval of His Person and work. From His youth Jesus found favor with God (Luke 2:52). God vindicated Christ's crucifixion by raising Him up from the dead. This means that all that Christ did was accepted and honored by God the Father.</P><P>In Adam we were condemned to die because the wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23). But Christ died as our substitute: He fully paid the price for our sins. How do we know that God has accepted Christ's payment? His resurrection is our "receipt," which proves that God has fully accepted Christ's payment for our sins. Suppose a criminal is sentenced to a certain prison term. How do we know whether he has served his sentence? We know when he is released. Resurrection therefore ends death. By believing in Christ, we are no longer pitiful sinners. We are fully justified, approved by God according to His own standard of righteousness. Not only so, but, as the resurrected One, He is also in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and is always acceptable to God. Therefore, Romans 4:25 says that Christ was raised because of our justification. In fact, for our salvation, the primary thing that we believe in is Christ's resurrection (Rom. 10:9).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 2: The Triune God-The Triune God and the Person and Work of Christ &nbsp; pg 44</div><br></body></html>
