   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD BEING THE SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the one hand, human beings have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the other hand, the Lord is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The fact that the Lord is the Spirit implies three things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first thing it implies is that, according to God s nature, God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is similar to saying that the nature of a table is wood or that the nature of a metal pipe is iron.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The second thing it implies is that, according to God s economy, God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In God s economy, which is God s way to accomplish His work, first, God is the Father; second, He is the Son; and third, He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the One who enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The third thing that this fact implies is that, according to God s plan of redemption, the Lord Jesus was incarnated to become a man, the last Adam, and that one day the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, after the Lord Jesus accomplished everything on the cross, God s plan of redemption is still a matter of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the entire Bible can be summarized by the statement the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit includes God Himself, God s economy, and God s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why we can say that the Spirit is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today the God we worship and the Lord we serve is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In fact, everything related to our God and our Lord is a matter of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit who is within us today is truly a treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man is different from the beasts, because man has a spirit inside of him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, those who are saved are different from those who are not saved, because those who are saved not only have a human spirit, they also have received the Lord as the Spirit into them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, as saved ones, we truly have reason to shout, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have something that the unbelievers do not have we have the Lord Himself in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How do we know that the Lord, who is the Spirit, has come into this particular part of our being?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We know this because the Bible clearly says, He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord is Spirit, and as the Spirit, He enters into and lives in our spirit, causing us to be joined to Him as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible also says, The Lord be with your spirit, and the Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit 2 Tim 4:22a; Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These verses prove that the Lord as the Spirit is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE OUTER MAN AND THE INNER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let us now consider the difference between the outer man and the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have already stated that man is composed of three parts body, soul, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now we must ask, which of these three parts is our real person?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Neither our body nor our spirit is our real person; our real person is our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can see this in Genesis 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This verse begins, Jehovah God formed man with the dust of the ground....</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This refers to the way in which God formed our body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then this verse continues, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life....</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This refers to the creation of man s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Finally, this verse ends, and man became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This final expression indicates that man s person is the soul, for man became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In addition, there are also other verses in which the Bible uses the term souls to refer to persons.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the seventy members of Jacob s family went down to Egypt, Exodus 1:5 refers to them as seventy souls lit., Hebrew rather than as seventy persons; and when three thousand people received the Lord and were baptized on the day of Pentecost, Acts 2:41 says, There were added on that day about three thousand souls.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From these verses we can see that a person is a soul, and the soul is the person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In other words, the soul is the self and the personality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our body is an outward organ for contacting the physical world, and our spirit is an inward organ for contacting the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only our soul is our person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Originally, our spirit is merely an organ, but when Christ comes into our spirit, He comes into us as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now we have a person in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As a result, our spirit, which now has a person and a life within it, is no longer only an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It has become a person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Formerly, we had only one person inside of us the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, now that the Lord has entered into our spirit to become the life of our spirit, our spirit has become a person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, today we have two persons within us our soul is the old man, the outer man, and our spirit is our new person, the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since we now have two persons within us, I would pose the question, Is it better to have one person or to have two persons within us?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Consider what it is like for two people to live together in the same room.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Is it better to have one person or to have two persons live in one room?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nearly all would say that it is better to live alone.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why do we prefer to live alone?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We prefer to live alone because when we live alone, we have more freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we live alone, we have no one to bother us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can open or close the doors and the windows as we please.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As soon as two persons begin to live together, however, there is trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One person wants to open the window, but the other person wants to close the window.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Right away there is the question of who should listen to whom.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the one hand, we cannot deny that it is a blessing that we are saved, for the Lord has come into us as a genuine treasure 2 Cor 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But on the other hand, it is also true that because the Lord has come into us, we experience some trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Before we were saved, it may have been very natural for us to tell a lie now and then, to occasionally play mah-jongg with our friends, and to curse when we lost our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This may have been the situation before we were saved, but what is our experience now?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On the day that we were saved, Christ as the treasure came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now if we want to tell a lie, we do not have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we want to lie, He does not want to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Moreover, to do something like playing mah-jongg is now entirely out of the question.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we want to play mah-jongg, the Lord is not only unhappy about this, He even gets angry.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Who can deny that this is troublesome?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Faced with this troublesome situation, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Bible reveals that it is not good for us to have two persons within us at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Thus, we must get rid of one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we must do this, which one should we get rid of?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Surely we must get rid of the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Romans 6:6 declares that our old man has been crucified with Him, and Galatians 2:20 states, I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When the old man is crucified, the new man is enlivened.</S>
