   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE VISION OF THE ECONOMY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HIDDEN IN ISAIAH'S PROPHECY Scripture Reading: Isa 22:19-25; Rom 6:6; 11:17; John 15:5; Gal 2:20; Col 2:16-17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message I would like to give a word concerning a very crucial matter the vision of the economy of God hidden in the first twenty-three chapters of Isaiah's prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now that we have covered twenty-three chapters of Isaiah, I would like to ask a question: What is the main thing covered in these chapters?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Putting the question another way, I would ask: Have you seen the vision of God's economy concealed in these chapters?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My burden in this message is that we would all see this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THREE IMPORTANT MATTERS The Forgiveness of Sins</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A number of important matters are covered in Isaiah 1 23.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For instance, 1:18 speaks concerning our being cleansed from our sins: "Come now and let us reason together,/Says Jehovah./Though your sins are like scarlet,/They will be as white as snow;/Though they are as red as crimson,/They will be like wool."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This word is related to the word in 38:17: "You have cast behind Your back/All my sins."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God has forgiven our sins and has cast them behind His back.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although the forgiveness of sins is wonderful, it is not the economy of God hidden in the prophecy of Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Sign of the Virgin</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Conceiving and Bearing a Son</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Another matter of great importance is the sign in 7:14 of the virgin conceiving and bearing a son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This verse says, "Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This sign covers not only the past and the present but also eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible of sixty-six books consummates in the New Jerusalem Rev 21 22 , and the New Jerusalem is the aggregate of Immanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The sign of Immanuel consummates in the New Jerusalem the totality of God being with us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Receiving and Enjoying God as Our Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A third important matter is found in chapter twelve of Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This chapter shows us how to receive God Himself as our salvation and enjoy Him as salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We enjoy God as our salvation, drawing water with rejoicing from the springs of salvation, by praising the Lord, calling upon His name, crying out, and giving a ringing shout vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>3-4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, we may enjoy God as our salvation but still not see the vision of the economy of God hidden in the first twenty-three chapters of the book of Isaiah.</S>
