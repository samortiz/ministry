Return to the Ground of the Church</h2>
<p>When some brothers and sisters who love the Lord see that the denominations are wrong, they endeavor to change or eliminate them. However, the revelation in the Scriptures reveals that neither the Roman Catholic Church nor the Protestant denominations will be changed or abolished. Therefore, we should not expect them to change, because this expectation will never be realized. We can only hope that individuals will depart from them and return to the ground of the church (Rev. 18:4). For example, not one denomination in China has changed in the last thirty years. The Presbyterian Church has not changed, the Baptist Church has not changed, and the Methodist Church has not changed; no denomination has ever changed. Although some of them admit that they are wrong, they remain unchanged and have not been abolished. On the contrary, they have become stronger, and their condition has worsened. Thus, there is no need for us to hope that they will change. Frankly speaking, all such hopes are wild and false hopes that will only disappoint. All effort to change the denominations is a futile waste of energy. It is clearly shown in Revelation that the church in Thyatira (2:25), the church in Sardis (3:3), and the church in Laodicea will remain until the Lord comes. This means that the Roman Catholic Church, the Protestant denominations and sects, and even the lukewarm Brethren will remain until the Lord comes. They are all deeply rooted, and there is no way to change them. Hence, we can only hope that some, like Martin Luther, will come out of the Roman Catholic Church, and others, like the brothers and sisters throughout the generations, will come out of the various organizations of Protestantism and return to the ground of the oneness of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Believing That Any Form<br />
of Union That Preserves the Ground<br />
of the Denominations and Is Reluctant<br />
to Forsake Such Ground<br />
Is Not Absolute, Is of No Value, and<br />
Is Unprofitable to the Testimony of the Church;<br />
Such a Unity Dividing While Uniting<br />
and Uniting While Dividing</h2>
<p>In today&rsquo;s Christianity denominations and sects are reluctant to forsake their ground but desire to be united with one another. They either organize joint evangelistic meetings and joint choirs, or they exchange ideas concerning their work. The pastor of one congregation may preach in a second congregation, and the pastor of the second congregation may lead the first congregation. It seems as if everyone is united in the Lord and not divided, yet in fact, this is a kind of &ldquo;shaking hands over the fence.&rdquo; Apparently, they are shaking hands and communicating, but in fact, there is a tall fence between them. Although they are standing on either side of the fence, they are joined by shaking hands over the fence. They are willing to shake hands, but they are not willing to tear down the fence. This kind of union that divides while uniting is totally unprofitable to the testimony of the church and is even harmful. This is not an absolute union. It seems to be a union, but it is not actually a union. We should not participate or approve of this kind of union; we should strictly condemn it.</p>
<p>This kind of union brings in confusion and damages the principle of being &ldquo;according to their kind&rdquo; as spoken of in the Bible (Gen. 1:11-12, 21, 24-25). This is an obscure situation, a condition of being divided yet united and united yet divided, a condition of being neither black nor white. They might as well be what they are&mdash;divided and not united. God&rsquo;s law ordains that everything should be according to its kind. If they are divided, they should be divided; if they are united, they should be united. Being divided while seeking unity and promoting unity when they are divided is confusion. This is sin upon sin. If unity is desired, why is there division? Unity should condemn the sin of division. If being divided is right, why is there a need for unity? The desire to unite after being divided proves that division is wrong. Since division is wrong, it should be dealt with thoroughly. However, having no desire to deal with it thoroughly, they attempt to be united. This can be compared to a woman who marries someone she should not have married and later wants to marry someone she should have married; yet she is reluctant to leave the first. On the one hand, she is reluctant to leave the first, and on the other hand, she wants to unite with the one she should have married. This is sin upon sin. But this is the situation in today&rsquo;s Christianity. The situation of being divided yet wanting to be united is a great confusion in God&rsquo;s eyes. We dare not have any part in it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Believing That All the Work<br />
outside of the Church That Is Not<br />
for the Building Up of the Local Churches<br />
Should Not Exist; Thus, Not Being Willing<br />
to Have Any Part in It</h2>
<p>In the sphere of today&rsquo;s Christianity much work is being done outside of the church that does not result in the building up of the local churches. Concerning God&rsquo;s plan for the church, we feel that this work is a contradiction and damage; hence, we do not wish to have any part in it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Even with Such an Attitude,<br />
Our Still Confessing That Our Great God<br />
Has the Sovereign Authority to Use People<br />
Who Are Different from Us;<br />
His Being Able to Use<br />
Even Those in the Catholic Church,<br />
Which Is Condemned</h2>
<p>We acknowledge that although there is much work that is not carried out in the church and is not for the building up of the local church, there are still some who have received some blessings from God. Because God is gracious and merciful in this age of grace, wherever there is an opening, an opportunity, God&rsquo;s grace will flow, just as water seeps through the cracks. We cannot, however, approve of such works based solely on this supply, concluding that God fully delights in such works and workers. In the book of Daniel, Nebuchadnezzar was a Gentile king who worshipped idols. We cannot say that God delighted in him, but God used him to accomplish His will. The book of Job shows that God can use even His enemy, Satan. Oh, the Lord is great! He can use all kinds of people, even those whom He dislikes quite much. Thus, it is one thing to be used by the Lord, and it is another thing to be well pleasing to and approved of by the Lord. We cannot approve of a work based on God&rsquo;s use of it. Nevertheless, because the Lord is great, even though we do not approve of these works or wish to take part in them, we should not interfere with them. We want only to serve the Lord in lowliness, with a pure conscience, and according to His shining and pleasure in order to bear the testimony that He has committed to us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_077.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_079.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lessons for New Believers &nbsp; pg 78</div><br></body></html>
