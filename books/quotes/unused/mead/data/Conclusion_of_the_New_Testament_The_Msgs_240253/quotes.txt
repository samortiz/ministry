[1]  The Conclusion of the New Testament #240-253 CONTENTS
[2]  Thus far in these messages on the conclusion of the New Testament we have covered five persons: God, Christ, the Spirit, the believers, and the church.
[3]  In this way God rules His creation by authority and power.
[4]  In Adam s paradise the kingdom of God was there, ruling over Adam.
[5]  This was the reason the Lord said to Nicodemus, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God v. 5 . Hence, to see, or to enter into, the kingdom of God requires regeneration with the divine life.
[6]  The man here is the Lord Jesus as the Sower, and the seed is the seed of the divine life 1 John 3:9; 1 Pet 1:23 sown into the believers of Christ, indicating that the kingdom of God is a matter of life, the life of God, which sprouts, grows, bears fruit, matures, and produces a harvest.
[7]  You may wonder why John the Baptist told people to repent for the kingdom had drawn near, since the kingdom of God had been present with Israel in Old Testament times.
[8]  The kingdom of God in the sense of life is the reality of the church life.
[9]  Romans 14:17 says, The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
[10]  This verse is a strong proof that the church in the present age is the kingdom of God, because the context here is dealing with the church life in the present age.
[11]  In this verse Paul does not say that the kingdom of God shall be; he uses the present tense and says that the kingdom of God is.
[12]  According to the context of Romans 14, which speaks of receiving the believers, the kingdom is today s church life.
[13]  When we live in the reality of God s kingdom, righteousness, peace, and joy will characterize our daily life.
[14]  The kingdom of God, the main and basic aspect of the kingdom, is first God s reign in a general way by power and authority and then God s reign in a particular way in the sense of life.
[15]  When the prodigal son returned to his father, he repented and said, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you v. 21 . Against heaven equals before you God the Father . Sinning against heaven is sinning before God, because God the Father is in heaven Luke 11:2 . After we received the call from the heavens, we became another kind of people, people no longer of this earth but of the heavens.
[16]  If we consult the chart printed in message two hundred forty, we shall see that the kingdom of the heavens is a specific section within the kingdom of God.
[17]  As a particular section of the kingdom of God in the way of life, the kingdom of the heavens comprises two ages or dispensations: the dispensation of grace and the dispensation of the kingdom.
[18]  It is in the second parable, the parable of the tares, that the Lord said, The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man sowing good seed in his field v. 24 . The reason the Lord began to say, The kingdom of the heavens was likened to in this parable is that the kingdom of the heavens began to be established when the church was built on the day of Pentecost, the time when the second parable began to be fulfilled.
[19]  We have seen that the kingdom of the heavens is the ruling of the heavens, that it is a specific section within the kingdom of God, that it drew near at John the Baptist s preaching and at the preachings of Christ and His disciples, that it began at the church s beginning, and that it is wrapped up with the church.
[20]  The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the inward content of the kingdom of the heavens in its heavenly and spiritual nature, as revealed in chapters five through seven.
[21]  In Matthew 13:24-43 the appearance of Christendom as the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is revealed through the parables of the tares, the mustard seed, and the leaven.
[22]  Only the overcomers who are in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today will have a share in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the future.
[23]  Therefore, at His coming back, the Lord will deal first with the appearance of the kingdom, and then He will transfer the reality of the kingdom into the next age to become the manifestation of the kingdom.
[24]  In the millennium the overcomers in the heavenly part of the kingdom will reign with Christ over the earthly part, which will be the restored kingdom of David, where Christ as the Son of Man, David s royal descendant, will be the King over the children of Israel.
[25]  The kingdom of the heavens should be an incentive to our Christian life and an exercise to our church life.
[26]  If the kingdom of the heavens is our incentive and exercise today, then in the coming age it will be a reward to us.
[27]  For this reason, we should be burdened to take care of this matter, first being exercised by the kingdom of the heavens in this age so that we may receive it as a reward in the future and then carrying out the burden to preach the gospel of the kingdom to the whole inhabited earth according to Matthew 24:14.
[28]  The kingdom of the Son of God s love comprises three ages: the present age, in which the church is; the coming age, in which the millennial kingdom will be; and the eternal age with the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth.
[29]  The stress in Colossians 1:13 is the kingdom of the Son of God s love in this age, which is the reality of the church.
[30]  We, the believers, all have been transferred into this delightful kingdom of the Son of God s love.
[31]  God the Father loves the delightful part of the kingdom just as He loves His delightful Son as His own.
[32]  So, the church, as the delightful part of the divine kingdom, is considered a great blessing to God s redeemed people by the Apostle Paul in the book of Colossians, a book which is on Christ as the all-inclusive portion of God s people Col 1:12 .
[33]  Christ has redeemed the church with His blood through His death that it may become the kingdom of God in the church Rom 14:17 and the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ in the millennium Rev 11:15 .
[34]  The kingdom of Christ and of God, the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is the kingdom received by Christ from God and brought back by Christ s coming Luke 19:12, 15a; Dan 7:13-14; 2:34-35, 44; Heb 1:8 .
[35]  The Father s kingdom is the heavenly part of the millennium, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, in which the Lord will drink with us after His coming back.
[36]  It is significant that in Matthew 13 the Lord reveals the Father s kingdom in verse 43 and His kingdom, the kingdom of the Son of Man, in verse 41.
[37]  In this message we shall cover two further aspects of the kingdom: the kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world and the millennial kingdom.
[38]  In the millennium there will be three realms: the first will be the realm of the earth, where the blessing of God s creation, as mentioned in Genesis 1:28-30, will take place; the second, the realm of the nation of Israel in Canaan, from the Nile to the Euphrates, in which the saved Jews will rule over the earth Isa 60:10-12; Zech 14:16-18 ; and the third, the heavenly and spiritual realm 1 Cor 15:50-52 , where the overcoming believers will enjoy the kingdom reward Matt 5:20; 7:21 .
[39]  The blessing of the first realm in the millennium, the blessing of God s creation, was prepared for the sheep from the foundation of the world, whereas the blessing in the third realm, the blessing of the heavenly and spiritual kingdom, was ordained for the believers before the foundation of the world Eph 1:3-4 .
[40]  The gospel of grace Acts 20:24 brings eternal life into the believers John 3:15-16 that they may live by God s life, whereas the eternal gospel brings the sheep into eternal life Matt 25:46 that they may live in the sphere of God s life.
[41]  The millennial kingdom will have two sections the heavenly section and the earthly section.
[42]  In Revelation 3:12 the Lord says, He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.
[43]  The earthly section of the millennial kingdom will be the restored kingdom of Israel the kingdom of David Acts 1:6; Mark 11:10 .
[44]  Before we go on to see the new heaven and the new earth, we shall consider God s governmental judgment upon His rebellious creatures.
[45]  The millennial kingdom and the new heaven and new earth are two positive aspects of the kingdom.
[46]  God s governmental judgment upon all rebellious creatures will include His judgment of the demons.
[47]  In this message we shall begin to consider the last aspect of the kingdom of God the new heaven and new earth.
[48]  Since the creation of man, there have been four dispensations: the dispensation of the patriarchs, that is, the dispensation before law, from Adam to Moses Rom 5:14 ; the dispensation of law, from Moses to Christ John 1:17 ; the dispensation of grace, from Christ s first coming until the restoration of all things at Christ s second coming Acts 3:20-21 ; and the dispensation of the kingdom, from Christ s second coming to the end of the millennium Rev 11:15; 20:4, 6 .
[49]  Although the dispensation of the kingdom will be the dispensation of restoration, it will nevertheless take place in the old heaven and old earth because God s perfecting and completing work in His chosen people will not be fully accomplished until the end of that dispensation.
[50]  When God finishes this work, by the dispensation of the kingdom, the old heaven and old earth will pass away through fire and be renewed into the new heaven and new earth 2 Pet 3:10-13 , where the New Jerusalem will come for the eternal expression of the processed Triune God.
[51]  The new heaven and new earth will be the new universe as the realm of God s ruling in eternity.
[52]  Hence, it will be the realm for God to administrate His government for eternity, and this divine administration is considered the eternal kingdom of God in which righteousness dwells forever with the New Jerusalem the composition of all the redeemed of God as the center.
[53]  God s Work of Restoration in the Old Creation
[54]  to Produce the Restored Nations to Be the People
[55]  The new heaven and new earth also involves God s work of restoration in the old creation to produce the restored nations to be the people on the new earth around the New Jerusalem Rev 21:24, 26 .
[56]  The main thing we see in John s writings is God s love expressed in His life; in Paul s writings, God s grace distributed in His dispensing; and in Peter s writings, God s righteousness maintained in His government.
[57]  Revelation 21:3 says, I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be His peoples, and God Himself shall be with them.
[58]  In the new heaven and new earth the nations who will be blessed to be the people will inhabit the new earth as their dwelling place around the New Jerusalem, which will be glorified with God s glory and illumined with the divine light as the excellent glory of God in Christ.
[59]  OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FORTY-NINE THE KINGDOM ITS ASPECTS 10
[60]  In this message I have the burden to give a further word on the new heaven and new earth.
[61]  God s way to perfect the saved Jews will be to put them during the millennium into the position of priests of God to learn of God and to teach the nations.
[62]  All of God s rebellious creatures will be punished and tormented in the lake of fire as the expression of God s unlimited righteousness, whereas God s life and glory will be manifested in the new heaven and the new earth, and especially on the new earth, through the New Jerusalem.
[63]  In this message and in the messages following, we shall consider the kingdom in its reality, its nature, its expression, its relation to God s glory, and its unshakableness.
[64]  We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that the kingdom of God is wholly a matter of life Christ Himself as the seed of life, the seed of the kingdom, sown into our being.
[65]  Eventually, it will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God, an eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God s eternal life for all God s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity Rev 21:1-4; 22:1-5 .
[66]  Now we come to the nature of the kingdom.
[67]  We shall use six adjectives to describe the kingdom in its nature: divine, heavenly, spiritual, human, pure, and eternal.
[68]  The nature of the kingdom is divine because it is the kingdom of God with the divine attributes.
[69]  In the foregoing message we covered the kingdom of God in its reality and in its nature.
[70]  The Father has regenerated His elect, imparting His holy nature into them 1 Pet 1:3 ; the Son has redeemed them with His blood from the vain manner of life 1 Pet 1:18-19 ; and the Spirit has sanctified them according to the Father s holy nature, separating them from everything that does not fit in with God s holy nature so that they, by the holy nature of the Father, may become holy in all manner of life, even as holy as God Himself is.
[71]  Whereas holiness is related to God s inward nature, righteousness is related to God s outward acts, ways, actions, and activities.
[72]  Matthew 5:5 says, Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
[73]  God s intention in His New Testament economy is that all the believers become a reproduction of Christ, the God-man, who lived a life in which the attributes of God were expressed in the virtues of man.
[74]  According to Matthew 5:21-26, not being angry with a brother is higher than not murdering.
[75]  In Matthew 5:21 and 22 the Lord Jesus says, You have heard that it was said to the ancients, You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment.
[76]  Matthew 5:38 and 39 say, You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.
[77]  But I say to you, Do not resist one who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.
[78]  In this message we shall cover one other aspect of the kingdom in its expression in the divine attributes and with human virtues the shining as the light.
[79]  In verse 14a the Lord Jesus says, You are the light of the world, Here we see that the people of the kingdom of the heavens live a kingdom life to shine in the darkness of the world.
[80]  We come now to the relation of the kingdom to the glory of God.
[81]  That you should walk worthily of God, who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.
[82]  Contrary to what many Christians think, God has not called us to a heavenly mansion but to His kingdom and glory.
[83]  When we live worthily of God, living a life in the Lord Jesus Christ, there is with us a particular kind of atmosphere, and this atmosphere is God s kingdom.
[84]  In the coming age, the entering into the kingdom of God and the entering into the glory of God will take place simultaneously.
[85]  This indicates that God s glory goes with His kingdom and is expressed in the realm of His kingdom.
[86]  Daniel 2:44, referring to the toes of the image, says, In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.
