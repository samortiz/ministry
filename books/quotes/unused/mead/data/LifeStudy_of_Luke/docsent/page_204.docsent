   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A PICTURE OF HOW GOD SAVES MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM THE ISSUE OF MAN S FALL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Certain types in the Old Testament show how God saves man from the issue of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first of these types is the feast of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Feast of the Passover</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the children of Israel were in Egypt, they were in bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They had no rest, no satisfaction, and no enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But God came in to rescue them, to save them from their fallen situation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God saved His people by the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Bible the Passover is called a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The feast of the Passover was the first of the seven annual feasts observed by the children of Israel Lev 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word feast implies a holiday, a time of rest, satisfaction, and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A holiday is a day without labor, a day of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In all nations, when a holiday comes, people cease from work and have a time of rest, satisfaction, and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The feast of Passover was such a time for the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was a time for God s chosen people to rest from their labor and to enjoy God as their satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Life in the Wilderness</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, through the Red Sea, and into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During the years in the wilderness, the people did not have any industry or employment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What, then, did they do for forty years?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may say that they had a very long holiday.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For forty years, they did not labor; instead, they rested with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They did not sow or reap but simply gathered the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, what they gathered was not the result of their labor but was something of God s gift.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the children of Israel rested with God and enjoyed His gift.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is unique in history that a people numbering more than two million spent forty years without industry or farming.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>During these forty years, the children of Israel rested with God day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we consider the history of the children of Israel in the wilderness, we see that actually they did not know how to rest with God or enjoy His gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They still tried to labor, that is, to do something for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This labor was offensive to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After coming into the wilderness, the children of Israel should have done nothing except praise the Lord, enjoy Him, and rest with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, they still struggled to do something for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whenever they labored in this way, they caused problems.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Good Land</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the forty-year holiday in the wilderness, the children of Israel were brought into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God gave a portion of the land to each family, and the people rested on their portion of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They lived on that portion, enjoyed it, and received satisfaction from it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The good land is a type of God as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Concerning God being our portion, Psalm 16:5 says, The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, the real portion of the land on which we rest, which we enjoy, and with which we are satisfied is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God is the real land flowing with milk and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course, eventually this God is Jesus Christ and ultimately, the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The very God who is Jesus Christ and the life-giving Spirit is our good land flowing with milk and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I can testify that my Christ is flowing with milk and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is our portion; He is our rest, satisfaction, and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Need for the Jubilee</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>as a Repetition of the Passover</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, many of the children of Israel did not live on the land in the way of rest and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the contrary, they lived in such a way that they became poor.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First they sold their land; eventually they sold themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once again they experienced the two results of man s fall: the loss of enjoyment, and bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This made it necessary for God to set up the year of jubilee, according to the type in Leviticus 25.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Actually the jubilee was a repetition of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By the Passover the children of Israel were delivered from bondage into rest and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But some, after entering into the enjoyment of God, became poor again and lost everything.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, there was the need for the jubilee as the repetition of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the year of jubilee there was the proclamation of liberty: And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family Lev 25:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This liberty was a release; it denoted freedom, liberation from bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to Leviticus 25:10, in the year of jubilee a person could be returned to his own possession and to his own family.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What does this signify?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This signifies a return to rest, satisfaction, and enjoyment, a return to the condition and the state into which the people had been brought by the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Passover had brought them into a condition and state where they could possess God as their good land for their rest and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But they lost this possession and fell into bondage again.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Their condition became like that of the children of Israel in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, there was the need of the jubilee as the repetition of the Passover to proclaim liberty to all those who had lost their possession and who were in bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the year of jubilee the people could be returned to their possession and to their family in order to have rest, satisfaction, and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the picture portrayed in the type in Leviticus 25.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As we shall see more fully in the following message, this type is a picture of what the Christian life should be.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Christian life is a life of liberty, freedom, and release, a life full of rest, satisfaction, and enjoyment.</S>
