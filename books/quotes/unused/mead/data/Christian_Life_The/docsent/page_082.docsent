   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To Walk in Christ's Resurrection,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>through His Crucifixion, and</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>by the Compound Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To walk by the Spirit is to walk in Christ's resurrection, through His crucifixion, and by the compound Spirit Phil 3:10; 1:19b .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ's resurrection, Christ's crucifixion, and the compound Spirit are one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is impossible to separate these three.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This simply means that the compound Spirit in us is the reality of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, in brief, this compound Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In a more simple way, the compound Spirit is just the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This Spirit can never work in anything without the crucifixion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, this Spirit always puts us to death 2 Cor 4:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we desire to have the first kind of walk, we need to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, if we would have the second kind of walk, we need to be crossed out, to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Crucifixion always ushers us into resurrection, and that resurrection is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These three things the Spirit, Christ's crucifixion, and Christ's resurrection are always together.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To walk by being crucified, to walk in resurrection, and to walk by the Spirit are the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our walk by the Spirit is a walk by being crucified and a walk in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whether we are walking by the Spirit or not is determined by whether we are crucified or not.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We know whether we are walking by the Spirit by knowing whether we are crossed out or not.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you are not crossed out, even if you feel that you are full of the Spirit, you should not do or say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without crucifixion there is no filling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we must immediately take the cross to receive Christ's crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we take Christ's crucifixion, instantly we are in resurrection, and the reality of resurrection is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I can testify that I am learning this kind of lesson every day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Very rarely do I answer people's letters immediately after receiving them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we receive letters, we should ask, "Who will answer me or the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we have the assurance that we are crossed out, immediately we are in resurrection, and the reality of that resurrection is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then, whatever we do, we walk by the Spirit through Christ's crucifixion and in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the Christian life.</S>
