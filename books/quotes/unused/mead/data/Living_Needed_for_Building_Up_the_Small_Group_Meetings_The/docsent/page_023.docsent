   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD DESIRING THAT ALL MEN BE SAVED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND COME TO THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although I have expounded all twenty-seven books of the New Testament during the past twelve years, and although my exposition has been printed and published in volumes totaling over 10,000 pages, I am afraid that it is difficult to find one in a hundred among us who has come to a full knowledge of these truths.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we have not learned these truths and have no deposit within us, then when the time comes to speak, we will have no words; we will have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This deposit was mentioned by Paul in 2 Timothy 1:13-14.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There he charged Timothy to hold the pattern of healthy words which Timothy heard from him, and he entreated him to guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all know that it is not enough for a young person to receive an education from textbooks alone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Other than the textbooks, he still must read many other books.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more books he reads, the more deposit he will have.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do not read the Bible every day, we will have no deposit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I hope that you would read carefully through the books and Life-study messages that we have published.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Read them every day and everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You do not need to spend too long each time in reading them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just spend five to ten minutes each time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Gradually, you will accumulate a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Any page is good for reading.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am happy when I see that the brothers in Texas have their homes filled with Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They have Life-study messages on the coffee table in the living room, on the counter in the kitchen, by the sink, and on the dresser in the bedroom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You can simply pick up any message and receive the supply and the nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all desire that the Lord would have a way in His recovery, and we all desire to grow in life and be filled with the Lord within.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to have this, we must read the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must let the word of Christ dwell in us richly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word let is very appropriate here.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It implies that the Lord is knocking at the door, and that His word is waiting at the door.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to let the Lord and His word come in.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everyone who believes in and loves the Lord treasures the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But many times we do not understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Either we do not understand the meaning of the words, or we fail to grasp their content.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have put together my experience of over fifty years and expounded in detail every book of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My purpose in doing this is to unlock the riches in these books.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now the Bible is here, and the Life-study messages are here.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The word of the Lord is waiting outside the door.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let this word of Christ come in and make its home richly in you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE LIFE-STUDY MESSAGES FOR THE SMALL GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How can we make the small group meetings rich, strong, fresh, and living?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After much investigation, I found out that for many, to use the Bible alone is not sufficient to unlock its riches; there is the need for the Life-study messages to serve as an aid.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We treasure the Bible, but the words of the Bible must be opened up before we can receive light from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The same is true of the food that we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, wheat must first be ground into powder and kneaded into dough or made into noodles before it can be consumed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the small group meetings, not only do we need to put before others the Bible; we need to put before them the books that explain the Bible in a most simple and clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Life-study messages are not meant to replace the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, they are meant to help people to unlock the Bible, and to supply them with spiritual life and nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we love the Lord and His recovery, we should follow His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the present stage, the Lord s leading is the recovery of the small group meetings in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the way of meeting that was initiated by the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost Acts 2:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After many centuries, all the other ways have been proven to be unfruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only meeting in the homes affords the Lord a way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For this reason the Lord is recovering this way of meeting among us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every brother and sister who meets with us in the Lord s recovery should pursue the way of the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You will do this if you love the Lord and His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As we have said in other occasions, The heavens may pass away, and the earth may be removed, but the small group meetings should never be forsaken.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whenever you come to a small group meeting, do not come in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, prepare yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Come with prayer and with the deposit which you have picked up in your daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everyone must come with his loins girded and his mind refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Leave all the oldness and forms behind.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Open your mouth, release your spirit, exercise faith, and demonstrate the power.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this way the small group meetings will surely be rich, strong, fresh, living, attractive, and able to support people.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>May we all strive in this matter, and may we all learn and practice together, so that the Lord may have a way among us.</S>
