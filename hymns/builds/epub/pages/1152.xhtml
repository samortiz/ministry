<div class='line'><b>1</b> To Jesus every day we find our hearts are closer drawn;</div>
<div class='line'>He's fairer than the sons of men and fresher than the morn;</div>
<div class='line'>He's all that we can say of Him in fairest words and more,</div>
<div class='line'>And every day He's dearer than He was the day before!</div>
</div>
<div class='chorus'>
<div class='line'>The half cannot be fancied of such a treasure-store,</div>
<div class='line'>And every day He's dearer than He ever was before!</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> His glory broke upon us when we saw Him in the church,</div>
<div class='line'>For here are all His riches, here we've given up our search;</div>
<div class='line'>'Tis here He satisfies our longing spirits o'er and o'er,</div>
<div class='line'>And every day He's dearer than He was the day before.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> Now He's the living Spirit who within our spirit dwells,</div>
<div class='line'>And by His sweet anointing, how His life within us swells!</div>
<div class='line'>As with the saints we're meeting, full released our spirits soar,</div>
<div class='line'>For now our Lord is dearer than He ever was before.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> The Lord has made us one with Him for His recovery:</div>
<div class='line'>The riches of this Christ, the church His fullness, men must see.</div>
<div class='line'>Yes, all we have and all we are, we every day outpour</div>
<div class='line'>For His tremendous purpose, ever dearer than before.</div>
