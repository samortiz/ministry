   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Partake of the Lord's Table</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord's table is a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Corinthians 10:21b uses the term the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must tell the saints that the table here means the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We come to the Lord's table to enjoy a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To Eat the Lord's Supper</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First Corinthians 11:20 refers to our eating the Lord's supper.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not a breakfast or a lunch, but a supper, a dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Lord established the table, He did it in the evening of the Passover, so it was a supper.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here we must stress that the Lord's table is not only a feast but also a supper.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A feast is mainly a kind of enjoyment, and a supper is a kind of restful eating.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After a day's work, after a day's labor, people restfully eat their supper.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, we come to the Lord's table not only to enjoy it as a feast, but also to take it restfully.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After we eat breakfast, we labor, but the Lord's table is a supper for us to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No labor is implied here, but rest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Generally speaking, supper does not imply any kind of work, any kind of labor, or any intention to work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Supper indicates that the work is over, and now is the time for rest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To Remember the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we must say a strong word to correct a wrong concept.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many Christians think that to have the Lord's table is to remember His death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not going to remember the death, but we are going to remember the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord told us to do this in remembrance of Him, not of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We remember the Person, the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the central point of the Lord's table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>a. The Focus of the Lord's Table</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord's table meeting is to remember the Lord, so any hymns, testimonies, or messages that distract people from the Lord, the Person, are not appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Lord's table meeting, someone may call a hymn on fighting the battle, or in the midst of the Lord's table, someone may give a testimony of how he was rescued from his suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That might be good in another kind of meeting, but it is not fitting at the Lord's table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A brother may come to the Lord's table with a good verse which he enjoyed in his time of morning revival.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He might come with that good verse to give people a good teaching concerning repentance and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a teaching is not for the Lord's table meeting but for a gospel-preaching meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord's table meeting is concentrated on the Person of the Lord, so all the hymns, all the praises, and all the speaking should be concentrated on the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All distractions from the focus of the Lord's table should be avoided.</S>
