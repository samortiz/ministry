<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. If Any Man's Work Is Consumed,<br>He Will Suffer Loss</H2><P>Verse 15 says, "If anyone's work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire." Wood, grass, and stubble are not good for building materials but good for being burned. Today many Christians are producing fuel for a burning to come. The more they do, the more they have something for burning.</P><P>If anyone's work is consumed, he will suffer loss. Loss here means that he will lose the reward. He will lose the richer, higher, and greater enjoyment of Christ. The Word says clearly, however, that he himself will be saved, yet he will be saved as through fire. This indicates some kind of punishment and discipline, not just a loss.</P><P>We saw in the previous lesson that we must avoid anything of strange fire in our service. Also, all the work of wood, grass, and stubble must be avoided. We must build with gold, silver, and precious stone.</P>
