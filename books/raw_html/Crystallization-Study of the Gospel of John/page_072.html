<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Constituents of the Body of Christ<br>and of the New Jerusalem</H2><P>These God-men, who are children born of God, not only constitute the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15; 1 Pet. 4:17; John 14:2) but also are the constituents with which the Body of Christ is built up, and the Body of Christ will consummate the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God and of Christ (1 Cor. 6:9; Eph. 5:5; 2 Pet. 1:11; Rev. 11:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE BLOOD AND WATER</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Condition of Fallen Sinners</H2><P>We sinners became fallen and were then against God's righteousness and estranged from God's life (Gen. 3:24; Eph. 4:18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Need to Be Redeemed Judicially<br>and Saved Organically</H2><P>As sinners, we need to be redeemed judicially from God's condemnation according to the righteous requirement of His law (Gal. 3:13) and to be saved organically by His life from the death brought in by sin (2 Tim. 1:10; Rom. 5:10, 12, 17, 21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. God's Full Salvation</H2><P>God's full salvation for us is judicial according to His righteousness and organic through His life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Christ Being our Redeemer and Savior</H2><P>Christ, as the Redeemer and Savior of fallen man, redeems and saves us through His death and resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Blood and Water</H2><P>In His crucifixion, after He was pierced by a soldier, blood and water, two elements which are critical to human life, came out of Him (John 19:34).</P>
