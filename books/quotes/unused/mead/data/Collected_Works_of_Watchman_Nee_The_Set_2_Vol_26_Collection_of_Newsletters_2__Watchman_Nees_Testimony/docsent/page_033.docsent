   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To my dearest brother in the Lord, Mr. Nee:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thank the Lord who cares for us!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I did not have a place to live in August of last year, He suddenly prepared a place in P'o Nan Shih Yang of P'ing Yang for me to live.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no meeting here in the Lord's name, but there are a few brothers who live with me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every evening we meet, and I speak something of the truth to them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have been doing this for about a year.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After the brothers received a little light of the truth, they still went to the denominations, but they felt that it did not help them as much as it once did.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They wanted to leave the denominations to meet in the Lord's name, but there was no one to bear the responsibility because I travel often .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I was afraid that they did not have the assurance of the truth and were only leaving the denominations to follow their emotions, so I was not really confident about them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I could only place this matter in the Lord's hands.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thank God!</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He walks in the same way we do and is very gifted.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The brothers prayed about this matter earnestly, and the Lord's grace worked in their hearts; they really saw the error of the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They boldly left the denominations and began to meet in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the so-called pastors and teachers in the denomination tried to hold them back with warm words, they could not make them look back.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He causes His children not to fear angry looks, rolled eyes, or rudeness but to only care about faithfully going on for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our first meeting was in September.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although they have partially obeyed the truth, their spiritual life is still weak and immature.</S>
