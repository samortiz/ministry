   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Incarnation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Long after God accomplished the work of creation, the first step toward the dispensing of Himself into us, God took the second step incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One day, the infinite God, the very God who created the universe, became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to John 1:1 and 14, the Word, who is God, became flesh; that is, God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the words of Isaiah 9:6, a child has been born to us whose name is called the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The baby born in a manger in Bethlehem was actually the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus lived on earth in a lowly way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was raised in the home of a carpenter, and He Himself worked as a carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Who would have thought that the very God dwelt in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the age of thirty He came forth to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Certain of the things He did caused people to wonder about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His words were far more philosophical than anything uttered by the greatest philosophers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some of those who heard Him marveled and said, How does this man know letters, having never learned?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 7:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Others were offended and claimed to know His mother, brothers, and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, the Lord Jesus went to the cross and died.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Crucifixion</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By incarnation the Lord took on humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man is the head of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Adam, the representative of the entire creation, fell, the whole creation fell and became old.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When God put on humanity, He put on the entire old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, when Christ was crucified, the creation was crucified also.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, by His death on the cross, the Lord terminated the entire creation, including you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through this wonderful, all-inclusive death, Christ redeemed us; He brought us back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only did He terminate us and bring us back to God, but in resurrection He replaces us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the Lord has terminated us, brought us back to God, and is replacing us in resurrection with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord as resurrection is the element with which we are replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, in resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Resurrection is actually the living Person of Christ, the One who is God incarnate, who lived on earth as a man, who died on the cross for our redemption, and who in resurrection has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, Christ is both the resurrection and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He has become the Spirit, and the Spirit is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now He as the Spirit and as the resurrection is our replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After Christ became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, it was possible for Him to come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He, the divine electricity, can come into our receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, it is necessary for us to receive Him by repenting, believing in Him, and calling on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A sinner may pray, Lord Jesus, I am sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But, Lord, You are my Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now I open myself to You and receive You.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever a person prays in such a way, this dear, excellent, wonderful One, the very One who is the Spirit and resurrection, enters into him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not mere theology it is a marvelous fact.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every genuine Christian can testify that when he believed in the Lord and called on His name, something unusual happened to him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord as the life-giving Spirit came into him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once we have received the Lord into us, He will never leave, even if we sometimes regret that we have become a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After you have believed in the Lord Jesus, you will not be able to stop believing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once He has come into you, He will never leave.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now we can see by what way God dispenses Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do you realize what kind of God is dispensing Himself into you?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The One whom we have received is Christ, the Redeemer, the Savior, the life-giving Spirit, and the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All these are different aspects of one Person.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The One in whom we believe, whom we have received, and who has entered into us should also be the One upon whom we call.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, many Christians today pay no attention to this matter of calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As we have seen, Paul speaks of this in 1:2, when he refers to all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here the Greek word for call is epikaleo.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This word means to call aloud.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To pray in a soft, gentle way is very different from calling aloud on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Suppose a sinner hears the preaching of the gospel and is persuaded to believe in the Lord and call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He may pray quietly, Lord Jesus, I am a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I thank You for dying for me.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I believe in You.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Your blood cleanses me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You give me eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A person who prays like this can be saved, but he may not be saved in a strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Suppose another person is convinced that he should believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But instead of praying quietly, he calls aloud on the name of the Lord, declaring that he believes in Him and receives Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If he calls on the Lord in this way, his experience of salvation will be very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the One whom we have received, He becomes ours.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This means that He becomes our portion, even our all-inclusive portion.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As our portion, Christ is our life, our life supply, and everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He is whatever we need: comfort, patience, righteousness, holiness, power.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then He becomes wisdom to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This Christ who is our portion is both theirs and ours.</S>
