        <h2 class="head1">BEING STRONG IN SPIRIT TO SUPPLY LIFE</h2>
<p>In 1950 I went to a certain locality. During one meeting a leading one, who later became a dissenting one, said, &ldquo;On behalf of all the co-workers, I hand over all the work to Brother Lee.&rdquo; Another one, who likewise became a dissenting one, then stood up on behalf of the elders and said, &ldquo;We hand this church over to Brother Lee to be under his leading.&rdquo; Then a group of deacons said, &ldquo;We hand over everything here to be under the leading of Brother Lee.&rdquo; In response, I said, &ldquo;Well, if this is the case, we will have no change in personnel; the co-workers will still be co-workers, the elders will still be elders, and the deacons will still be deacons, but our ways should be different. From now on we should renew our ways of serving, working, and meeting and discard all our old ways.&rdquo; I then made arrangements for two sisters to be responsible for the church business office. I stayed there for several months, but as soon as I went back to Taiwan, the leading brother went into the business office and changed everything back to the way it was before. When I went back to this locality, the two sisters in the business office said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, we could not work because all your arrangements were changed after you left.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Be patient. They changed it, but we can start over again.&rdquo; This went on for a decade. I knew in my heart that they did not want me to do much, but the Lord still sent me there to supply life. My spirit was strong, and I supplied life positively.</p>
<p>My speaking in the meetings there was always strong in spirit, and I was never affected by what they did. I knew only to supply life even more strongly. During those years the meetings grew to over three hundred people; this was the issue of the supply of life. The church in Hong Kong is different from the church in that locality: The church in that locality had people with ulterior motives, but the elders in the church in Hong Kong do not have ulterior motives. Instead, they are unable to keep up with the flow of the age. The younger ones in Hong Kong should obey on the one hand, but they should strongly exercise their spirit on the other hand. In the last age, there is a need for an even more intensified operation of the Spirit; thus, Revelation speaks of the seven Spirits (1:4). We need to be intensified sevenfold, to have the sevenfold intensified Spirit, in order to serve in our various localities.</p>
<p>I had no confrontation with the dissenters and no contention with the elders during the ten years I served in that locality. Whenever I stood at the podium, my spirit was strengthened. They changed the ways every time I left, but since they had handed everything over to me, they could not do anything but hand the things over to me when I came back. During this time my anger was not kindled; I simply told the sisters in the business office that I was back and that they should follow my instructions. The dissenters complied because they had handed everything over to me. They took some opposing action only when they realized that they would never have their way.</p>
<p>Our way today involves obeying absolutely and being strengthened in our spirit. Those with sight will recognize a strong spirit. As long as our spirit is living, people will have a proper evaluation of us. I can testify that even though some condemned and opposed me, they still had to admit that I have something real. If we have something, we have something; hence, we do not need to be discouraged or sad. Rather, we should thank the Lord for an opportunity to learn obedience. The elders should be willing to have fellowship with the younger ones, and the younger ones should be in an obedient condition. Furthermore, we must actively supply life. We should not be afraid of &ldquo;our goods being compared&rdquo;; we should only be afraid of &ldquo;not having an eye for the goods.&rdquo; Perhaps, one day the elders will say, &ldquo;We need the younger ones to function; please speak.&rdquo; If the younger ones have the &ldquo;goods,&rdquo; then the situation will be good, regardless of who speaks. We should always have some &ldquo;goods&rdquo; in our bag, and when we take them out according to the need, others will have nothing to say.</p>
<p>Every time we speak is a good opportunity to display our &ldquo;goods&rdquo; by supplying life. People will say, &ldquo;I came to hear a message today and did not get much initially. But those younger ones had something in them.&rdquo; This would be very good. Hence, there is no need to oppose the elders. If the elders let the young ones speak, they are helping you and giving you an opportunity to present your &ldquo;goods.&rdquo; I have experienced this same process; only the people involved were different. The situation that the younger ones face in Hong Kong is not difficult because the elders in Hong Kong are fully one with you. The situation there is like an elderly father being one with his son. It is just that one has an old view, and the other has a new view. Nevertheless, the young ones must not blame the elderly father; he was born in an older generation and is naturally different from you. There is no reason to make the elderly father angry or to oppose him; instead, you should obey him. You must do this until everyone knows that your family is blessed because you are able to properly deal with the old things in the family without contradicting your father.</p>
<p>The younger ones must be strong in spirit. You must exercise your spirit, but do not rely on methods or ways. The only way that matters is having a strong spirit and a clear vision. Quarrels and confrontations are useless; as long as you have the opportunity, use your spirit. Once the opportunity arises, use it to remove the oldness and to supply life. Do not oppose anyone; instead, receive a commission from the Lord and supply life properly. We must all learn this. The way ahead of us is glorious. There is no reason to be disappointed; rather, we should be encouraged.</p>

  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
