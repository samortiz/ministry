 <h2 class="head1">THE INTRINSIC GROWTH OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The essence of the church is the divine life which is the processed and dispensing Triune God. We all have been regenerated with this divine life. The church is now growing in this life, by this life, with this life, and through this life. The growth of the church is its intrinsic growth, its organic growth. This organic growth has nothing to do with organization.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Through the Feeding on the Guileless Milk<br />
and the Solid Food of the Word<br />
by the Members of Christ</h2>
<p>The intrinsic growth of the church is through the feeding on the guileless milk and the solid food of the word by the members of Christ (1 Pet. 2:2; Heb. 5:12-14). An infant does not grow by self-effort. He does not grow by stretching out his feet and crying, &ldquo;Let me grow!&rdquo; He grows by eating. The more he eats, the more he grows. One of my grandchildren was very small at birth and had to be sustained by the use of an incubator. Today, however, he is a strong, big boy because he has been eating all these years. He has been taking in all the rich, nourishing American food. He has been drinking milk and eating all the rich produce of America.</p>
<p>As members of the Body of Christ, we should drink the guileless milk of the word that we may grow. Then we must eat the solid food of the word so that we may grow even more. Our eating of the word causes us to grow in a strong way. The Word is full of food, but some only get knowledge according to the letter when they read the Bible. This is a shame because the sixty-six books of the Bible are a menu of Christ. Christ is our real food and every page of the Bible is a description of this rich Christ. He is either expressed or implied throughout the whole Bible. Actually, the implied Christ is richer and more nourishing than the expressed Christ. When we come to the Bible, we should come with a seeking heart after Christ. We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, I come to Your Word. I do not care for teachings alone, but I care for You. Lord, feed me with Yourself through this Word.&rdquo; We all should have such a prayer.</p>
<p>The Bible is full of Christ. Without Christ, this book becomes empty. The Bible is like a peanut shell. It contains Christ as its kernel. Without Christ, the Bible is like an empty shell. If we have a heart toward Christ, He will nourish us with Himself when we come to the Word. When we come to the Bible, we must have the full faith that God exists and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him out (Heb. 11:6). In the whole universe the most wonderful One is God. He is Spirit; He is invisible, yet so real (John 4:24), and He is the content of the Bible.</p>
<p>I have studied the Bible for more than sixty years. I have also studied world history, and I have been observing the world situation very closely all these years. As a serious student of the Bible, I have come to understand many of the prophecies concerning the history of the world, including many things that are presently occurring. I have seen many of the biblical prophecies fulfilled in my lifetime. The fulfillment of these prophecies shows how wonderful and marvelous the Bible is.</p>
<p>When I was a young man of about nineteen in 1925, I found out about the prophecy in the Bible that the nation of Israel would be restored (Matt. 24:32). I knew that the Jews had lost their homeland and that they were scattered throughout the earth. They were dispersed and scattered to such an extent that they had become citizens of many different countries. I believed the Word of God, but still in my mind there was a question. How could such a race be recovered to become a nation once more? This seemed to be impossible, yet the Bible clearly indicated that this would happen. In 1948, forty-one years ago, I was working in Shanghai when the news said that the nation of Israel had been restored. I was very excited when I heard this news because I knew that it was a fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy.</p>
<p>The Bible also prophesied in Luke 21:24 that the city of Jerusalem would eventually be returned to the people of Israel. Jerusalem was taken over by the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, about twenty-six centuries ago, in approximately 600 B.C. The Lord Jesus prophesied in Luke 21:24 that &ldquo;Jerusalem will be trampled by the nations until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.&rdquo; From the time of Nebuchadnezzar, Jerusalem was trodden under the feet of the Gentiles throughout the centuries. I wondered how it would be possible for the Jews to regain Jerusalem. Nineteen years after the nation of Israel had been restored, in 1967, the city of Jerusalem was reclaimed by the Jews. This was another wonderful fulfillment of biblical prophecy. When I heard this news, I was greatly excited, for I knew the prophecy in Luke 21:24.</p>
<p>Another wonderful fulfillment of prophecy can be seen in the interpretation of the image in Daniel 2, which was a part of King Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream. Daniel&rsquo;s interpretation of this image is actually a prophecy concerning the nations of the earth. Daniel 2:31-34 says, &ldquo;Thou, O king, sawest, and behold, a great image. This great image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the aspect thereof was terrible. As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass, its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay&rdquo; (ASV).</p>
<p>All biblical students who are familiar with prophecy know that the image illustrates the world political situation beginning with Nebuchadnezzar. The head of gold symbolizes Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and thus the Babylonian Empire (vv. 37-38). The breast and arms of silver symbolize Medo-Persia (v. 39). The belly and thighs of bronze symbolize the empire of Macedonia and Greece under Alexander the Great (v. 39). Following the Greek Empire, is the Roman Empire (v. 40). It is symbolized by the two legs of iron, indicating its tremendous strength. The two legs signify that the Roman Empire was divided into two parts, the eastern Roman Empire and the western Roman Empire.</p>
<p>The four kingdoms are symbolized by gold, silver, brass, and iron. The first is gold, indicating that its beginning is more glorious. The glory reduces with each succeeding metal, yet it remains very strong. Finally, the feet of the image are part iron and part clay signifying the nations in the period after the fall of Rome and before the second coming of Christ. These nations would be part autocracy and part democracy.</p>
<p>In the early part of this century, communism crept into human society. The Soviet revolution occurred in 1917. After World War II, communism took control in China. The philosophy of communism was their boast. Actually, they simply practiced dictatorship, or autocracy. Today it has been about seventy years from the time communism had its beginnings in Russia. Communism is like the iron in the feet of the image. It is strong to crush whatever stands in its way, but God has a way to weaken the iron. His way is to mix it with clay. In these days the people of eastern Europe, who are the clay, the dust, are rising up to deal with and weaken the iron of communism. Eventually, the iron cannot deal with the dust, and it becomes paralyzed, crippled. This demonstrates the fulfillment of prophecy in eastern Europe, and that we are in the iron-clay stage of the image. Millions are rising up in eastern Europe. Recently, millions rose up in Red China in a desire for freedom. As the clay rises up, the strength of the iron is weakened.</p>
<p>At the end of Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream, a stone, cut out without hands, smote the image upon its feet, which were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces (Dan. 2:34). This is a prophecy concerning Christ. He is the stone, cut out without human hands, which will come down from heaven to smite the image, the kingdoms of the earth, and break them into pieces. Then He will become a great mountain, the kingdom of God, which will fill the whole earth (Dan. 2:35; Rev. 11:15).</p>
<p>Whatever is recorded in the Bible is eventually related to Christ. Even when we read these prophecies, we can find nourishment. Christ, as the content of the Bible, is food to us. The Bible is a book inspired by God. This means that any time we come to the Bible with a seeking heart, the Spirit of God will be with us.</p>
<p>The Triune God is involved with the Bible. This is why this book is so unique. I recall a story that occurred in the past century. An unbelieving American citizen was visiting a country in Latin America and observed a native of that country sitting and reading a Bible. The American began to ridicule that person because he was reading the Bible. That native had been a cannibal before being saved, and he responded in this way: &ldquo;Sir, if this Bible had not gotten into me, you would have been inside of me already.&rdquo; His eating the Word of God had transformed him, and he was no longer a wild cannibal. Only the Bible could do this!</p>
<p>There are many cases of people being changed just by reading one portion of the Bible. This was the situation with one brother who eventually became a co-worker among us. When he was young, he was a very patriotic, active, and capable nationalist. He hated the foreign countries and their foreign religion, Christianity. One day, he went sightseeing to a certain mountain and entered an idol temple. To his surprise, someone had left a large Bible there. It had been there for a long time because it was covered with dust. This Bible was opened to Psalm 1. He began to read Psalm 1 out of curiosity. As he read, he thought, &ldquo;Is this what is in the Bible?&rdquo; As he read on and on, he eventually began to weep, and rolled on the ground repenting. Reading the Bible caused him to get saved. He was changed to such an extent that he decided to drop his political associations and become a follower of Christ. He became burdened to take the Bible throughout China in order to preach the gospel of Christ. He told this to me personally, and he later became one of our co-workers. This shows the effectiveness and wonder of the Bible!</p>
<p>Many Christians can testify that the Bible has had such a wonderful impact on their lives. For us to grow, we need the milk and the solid food that is in this book. If we do not eat physical food for a period of time, we will starve and eventually die. If we do not read the Bible for a whole week, we will starve spiritually. When we read this book with a desire to seek after Christ, we will be fed. Thousands of Christians can testify that when they read the Bible, they do not receive mere knowledge according to the letter, but they get Christ into them. This Christ, as the life-giving Spirit, is food to us (John 6:57; 1 Cor. 15:45b). As the life-giving Spirit, He is dispensing Himself into us and supplying us with Himself as life.</p>
<p>When we open any page of the Bible, we should read with a seeking heart and pray, &ldquo;Lord, I love You, so I come to Your Word. Be my drink and be my food.&rdquo; When we pray in this way, we will realize that Christ, who is now the life-giving Spirit, is within us dispensing Himself and supplying us with Himself as our food. This supply of life will cause us to grow. I believe we all can testify to this. This is the wonder of the Bible. It is not just a book. It is a book filled with Christ. It is a book in which our God is fully involved. When we touch this book with a seeking heart for Christ, we touch the Spirit, we receive the very life-giving Christ, and we grow organically.</p>
