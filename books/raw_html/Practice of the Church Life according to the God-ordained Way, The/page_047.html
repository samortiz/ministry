<P>When we come to the meetings, as Christians we must move as transformed persons, not as persons who act. When he acts, an actor dresses himself and conducts himself in a manner that is different from what he is normally. When a young actor portrays an old man, he alters his appearance so that he looks like an old man, and he moves, gestures, and speaks to people like an old man. That is acting. But we need to drop everything that is false and simply be what we are. However, we should not be what we are in the natural life. We should be what we are in transformation. Formerly, we might have been a clever person who hid himself all the time, but the Lord has transformed us, so we act, move, walk, and work as a transformed member in the Body. Thus, when we come to the meeting, we must be active; this is not only our duty and our responsibility but also our obligation. This is the reason that we all need to be trained.</P><P>When they prophesy, those who are timid must get out of their timidity. However, their speaking in a bold way should not be a performance. They should conduct themselves in this way all the time.</P><P>Some saints like to begin their speaking by saying, "Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!" This has become a slogan in the recovery. We should avoid this, especially in the beginning of our speaking. To begin our speaking we should have a fitting noun as a subject and a proper verb as a predicate. This will make our speaking more meaningful.</P><P>As an illustration of the proper way to begin a speaking, we may open in this way: "As Christians we need to be transformed in everything. Formerly, we thought that in the matter of meeting we did not need to be transformed. Actually, we need to be transformed even more in the way of meeting." This is a good beginning. With such a proper beginning, many things will come out in the remainder of our speaking.</P><P>At times we may have a proper thought with the proper line and the proper points for our speaking, but we also need to learn how to compose our speaking. The opening word in our speaking is very crucial because it controls the speaking that follows it.</P><P>If we use an outline in our speaking, when we stand up to speak, we should not drop our head to look at our outline. That kills our speaking. Before 1974 I did not use an outline in my speaking. I began to use an outline when I conducted the life-study trainings. For each of those trainings I wrote a set of outlines. Brother T. Austin-Sparks always spoke from points he had written in a notebook. Once while I was interpreting for him during a visit he made to Taiwan, I noticed that he spoke everything according to his notes, but a person sitting far off could not realize that he was using notes. He had a skillful way to use the notes but not let people notice. When we speak with an outline, we should avoid dropping our head and looking down at the outline before speaking.</P><P>We all have our natural way, and we not only allow our natural way to act, but we also trust in our natural way. In learning how to meet, we should continually annul our natural way and learn the God-ordained way. It is easy to meet in a natural way. To do this we do not need to learn or be dealt with. However, to meet in the God-ordained way, we need to be dealt with; our natural way must be dealt with. We need to drop our natural way and learn to be crucified in relation to speaking by our natural way. Then we will be transformed.</P>
