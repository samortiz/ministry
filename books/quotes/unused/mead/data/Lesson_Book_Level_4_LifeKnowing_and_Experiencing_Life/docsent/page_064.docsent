   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INDIVIDUALISM A. Definition</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's intention is not only to have many individual sons, but to also have a Body for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Individually, we may grow in life and express the Lord in our daily living, yet that is not the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesians 1:22-23 says, "The church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.''</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Individual Christians are not the fullness of Christ, the church is the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ephesians 3:18-19 says, "May be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.''</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Again, individually we cannot apprehend the dimensions of Christ nor are we able to be all the fullness of God, but corporately we can.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On one hand the Lord died for us individually, on the other hand He died for the Body Eph 5:25b .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many Christians like to say that Jesus is our personal Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That is correct, but not complete, because He is called the Savior of the Body Eph 5:23b .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not just save us as individuals, but as members of the Body for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Adam took in the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil he became independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible also tells us that men became independent of one another.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This nature of independence is ingrained in us, causing us to be individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we read the Bible, we want to read it our way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If others would not take our way, we would go and read it by ourselves or not read it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In serving the Lord it is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today, many Christians are serving the Lord, yet they serve the Lord independently.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is due to our individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because of individualism, the Body of Christ cannot be built.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to be saved from individualism for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only life can save us from our individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>B. Dealing with Individualism</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since individualism is a result of the fall and is part of the old man, the way to deal with it is the same as mentioned in the previous few points.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reason most Christians do not deal with it is because they do not see the Body of Christ and do not see the evil of individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to pray that the Lord will reveal to us the Body and expose our individualistic thoughts, speech, and actions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As soon as we become aware of any trait of individualism, we must pray, "O Lord Jesus, forgive my independent ways.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am too individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Lord, I repent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Cleanse me and fill me with Your Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I want to be built up with others to be Your Body to express Your fullness.''</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As you are praying this way, you are dealing with your individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You are being cleansed, being filled with the Spirit, and growing in life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever His light shines on you, do not argue, but repent, confess, and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Spirit will operate to work on your individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we are exposed, the Lord has the opportunity to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, do not blame the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, do not blame the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead, you should say, "Lord, how I thank You for this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I love the church, not because it is perfect, but because it exposes me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Lord, lay me on the altar and deal with my mind, emotion, and will so that You can live in me.''</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As the Lord lives in us, He saves us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His saving life works only as He has the opportunity to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then the divine life will save us from being individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As we are saved in His life, we become the Body and members one of another.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May the Lord have mercy upon us that we may see our need to be saved in His life from individualism for the building up of the Body.</S>
