   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD IS EVERYTHING IN THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our seventh thought concerns the matter of light in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The sun and the moon exist in the new heaven and new earth, but they are not needed in the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can illustrate this by pointing out that the moon does shine in the daytime, although it can barely be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, it is not needed, for the sun is far brighter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even so, we will not need the sun or the moon in the holy city, because God is there Rev 21:23; 22:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The light of God is the brightest of all lights.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nighttime will still exist in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that day and night will continue.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But because God is always brightly shining in the holy city, there is no need of the sun or the moon; so there will be no night there Rev 21:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These points reveal the basic principle that all natural things, such as food, water, clothing, sun and moon, are merely figures of what God is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the redeemed ones enjoy God Himself; the unbelievers enjoy only the natural things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the New Jerusalem we will have God as our sun, our light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We will not require any natural thing, for God will be everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This also means that today, when we are redeemed and take God as our life, He is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need nothing apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This thought is quite deep.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we do not have God in Christ, we need many other things; but if we have God in Christ, we need nothing more.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>May this become clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE INHABITANTS OF THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our eighth and final thought concerns the inhabitants of the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are not clearly told who the inhabitants are.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Logically, we could say that God must be the inhabitant, since the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, look again at John 1:14.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Word, who was God, was made flesh to tabernacle among us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that the tabernacle itself dwelt among us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But who was the dweller of the tabernacle mentioned in the Gospel of John?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We know that Jesus was that tabernacle and that Jesus was the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, the dwellers of that tabernacle were God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That tabernacle was composed of the dwellers, and there were no dwellers in that tabernacle except those who composed it God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The same principle is found in Revelation 21.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In eternity, those composing the New Jerusalem will be the very dwellers of that city.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God will be the dweller, and the redeemed ones will be dwellers as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the redeemed with God Himself are the very elements of which the New Jerusalem is composed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, the dwellers are the city itself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here then is a very practical question: Of what is the church composed?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church, as we have seen, is the house of God, the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But who are the dwellers within this house?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is clear: they are the very components of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Apart from the house itself, there are no dwellers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The dwellers are the house, and the house itself is the composition of the dwellers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>So many are not clear concerning the matter of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They conceive of the church as a material building in which the saints gather.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They imagine the saints coming into the house as the dwellers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Likewise, many consider the New Jerusalem as something other than the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They believe it to be a heavenly mansion with some of the saints put into it as the dwellers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This seems quite logical; however, when we study the Scriptures deeply, we discover that the New Jerusalem is just like the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is all the saints composed together as the city.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must be clear that the dwellers composed together are the very dwelling-place.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The dwellers dwell within themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are the church, yet we dwell in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that we dwell in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is all very subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God works upon us because we are the dwelling-place.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are just the inhabitants within the dwelling, there would be no need for God to build us up.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We could simply wait for the building to be completed and then enter into it to dwell there.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, the dwellers constitute the dwelling-place.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus, all Christians must be built up together wherever they are.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We cannot get away from the building.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we would share in the church life, we must be built up in it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You cannot say, "I will wait until the building is accomplished; then I will go to dwell in it."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You can only be built into the dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you are not willing to be built into it, you will never be in it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The dweller is the very component of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This matter is exceedingly deep.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Some even say that it is a heresy to speak of the New Jerusalem as a living composition of all the saints and not to consider it as the heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>One day we will all be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Unless we are built into the New Jerusalem, we will have no share in it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is not a matter of prophecy, but of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Until we are built into the church, we can never have a practical share in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Christianity today is so shallow!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whoever you are, you may just come and be a member of the "church."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In one sense, that is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But in actuality, until we are built into the church, we can never have the reality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Some Christians are told that just as long as they believe in the Lord Jesus, someday they will go to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In a sense, that is also correct, because we may all share in the New Jerusalem by the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Yet, there is still another aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must be built into that city.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Apostle Peter was built into it, for the name of one of the precious foundation stones is Peter Rev 21:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There is a principle here which is quite easily misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Some may ask, "Are you saying that the redemption of Christ is not sufficient?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Do we need something in addition to the redemption of Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>One day we will all be there, and then we will be very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But that day may be too late as far as you are concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>After redemption, we need the work of transformation Rom 12:2 and building Eph 2:22; 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Let us consider a typical case of a new convert.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Last week he was an unbeliever; but a few days ago he believed, and yesterday he was baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>On one hand, as long as he has believed in the Lord Jesus, he has become a member of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But, until the day that he is practically built into the church, he will not share the church life in experience.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Beginning from the time of his regeneration, he must be transformed and built together with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Then he will have a practical share in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Why has the New Jerusalem not yet come?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The Lord Jesus has ascended into heaven and has been there for nearly two thousand years; yet the New Jerusalem has not yet appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The question is, How many redeemed ones have been transformed and built into this holy city?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Do we realize that in this city everything is composed of gold, pearl and precious stones?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>There is no clay there.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Perhaps you have been saved for ten years, but have you been fully transformed yet from a piece of clay to a precious stone?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Are we really fit for the New Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Frankly speaking, even if the Lord should put us there, we would have to say, "No, no; we do not fit here."</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Do you see now that there is more required than just the work of redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>There must also be the work of transformation and building.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Today's church must have the work of transformation and building.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The Apostle Paul clearly tells us that we must be careful to build up the building of God with gold, silver and precious stones 1 Cor 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Immediately after we are saved, we are not pure gold, pearl, silver, or precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We are like an uncut diamond just so much rock.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>How much transformation and building up we need!</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The situation today is very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>It is too objective.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>People say, "Our church is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Come and join us."</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>All the dwellers of the church are the components of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>You must be built into the church; otherwise, you can never be in the church in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>All of these eight thoughts are indeed deep, yet they are very basic.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The main point is that we all must be worked upon, transformed, and built up together; then there will be the new city.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>All the dwellers of the New Jerusalem are the very components of which the city is built.</S>
