<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Chief Priests and the Elders<br>Bribing the Guarding Soldiers to Say<br>That the Disciples of Jesus Stole His Body Away</H2><P>After the Lord Jesus was resurrected, the chief priests and the elders bribed the guarding soldiers to say that while they were sleeping in the night, the disciples of Jesus stole His body away (Matt. 28:11-15). This lie caused confusion. On the one hand, the disciples said that Christ was resurrected. On the other hand, the bribed soldiers said that Jesus' body had been stolen by His disciples. This caused the Jewish society to be confused. Whose word would the people believe&#151;the word of the disciples or the word of the soldiers? They, of course, believed the soldiers' word, and that annulled the news of Christ's resurrection. This surely was another aspect of the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In the Ministry of the Apostles</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Divine Economy</H2><P>The divine economy can also be seen in the ministry of the apostles.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Peter and About One Hundred Twenty Disciples<br>Gathering Together and Praying<br>in One Accord for Ten Days</H2><P>Peter and about one hundred twenty disciples gathered together and prayed in one accord for ten days (Acts 1:12-15). That one accord was a wonderful thing. It is difficult for believers to pray in one accord even for an hour, much less for ten days. In Acts 1 the disciples were burdened to continue steadfastly with one accord in prayer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Spirit Being Poured Out<br>upon the One Hundred Twenty Disciples of Christ<br>on the Day of Pentecost</H2><P>The Spirit was poured out upon the one hundred twenty disciples of Christ on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4, 17-18). That was a great matter. The outpoured Spirit was actually the pneumatic Christ. The pneumatic Christ poured out Himself as the all-inclusive, compound, consummated Spirit upon His disciples so that they could be constituted and built up to be His Body, the organism of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Peter Preaching at Pentecost<br>and Three Thousand Repenting, Believing,<br>and Being Baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ</H2><P>Peter preached at Pentecost, and three thousand repented, believed, and were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ (Acts 2:14-41). Then the church was established. Later the number of men came to about five thousand (4:4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Believers Continuing Steadfastly<br>in the Teaching and the Fellowship of the Apostles,<br>in the Breaking of Bread and the Prayers,<br>Having All Possessions Common,<br>and Increasing with New Believers Day by Day</H2><P>The believers continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers (Acts 2:42). They had all possessions common and increased with new believers day by day (vv. 43-47; 4:32-37).</P>
