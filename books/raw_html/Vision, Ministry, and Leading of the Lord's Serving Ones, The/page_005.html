        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">GIFT AND MINISTRY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:5-9, 18&mdash;4:2, 7-11, 16</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the matter of ministry. In the Chinese language the word for <em>ministry</em> has the same pronunciation as the word for <em>minister. Minister</em> speaks of the person, and <em>ministry</em> speaks of a person&rsquo;s work; the former refers to a person, and the latter refers to a thing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING FIVE BASIC ITEMS IN WORKING<br />
FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>A person who serves the Lord must know five basic items&mdash;calling, vision, gifts, ministry, and leading. Anyone who wants his service to be in line with God&rsquo;s will, that is, God&rsquo;s eternal plan, must have a thorough understanding of these five basic matters. If we serve the Lord without a clear calling, without any vision or manifestation of gifts, without being constituted with a ministry, and without any focus in our leading, at the most we will be a &ldquo;preacher,&rdquo; but we will not be a servant or messenger of the Lord. A servant who is raised up, sent, and used by the Lord will have a specific calling, a clear vision, a manifested gift, a living ministry, and a focused leading. These five items must have considerable ground and bear considerable weight within everyone who serves the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STOPPING ONESELF TO SEE THE LIGHT</h2>
<p>The book of Job speaks of a very God-fearing man, Job, and of his time on the earth (1:1). Of those who lived on the earth, Job was unreprovable. Even God told Satan that there was none like Job on the earth, a perfect and upright man, who feared God and turned away from evil (v. 8). Job&rsquo;s so-called perfection and self-righteousness, however, veiled his eyes so that he could not see God&rsquo;s light. Job was a good man, but the book of Job shows that he had no light and no revelation. Job feared God and was unreprovable, yet he had no light and did not live in God&rsquo;s presence. It is only at the end of the book, after Job meets God, that he said, &ldquo;I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear, / But now my eye has seen You&rdquo; (42:5).</p>
<p>Before chapter 42 Job was merely a self-righteous man who had heard about God but had not seen God&rsquo;s light. In chapter 13, he said, &ldquo;I would speak to the Almighty, / And I desire to argue with God&rdquo; (v. 3). Job was willing to argue with God, because he wanted God to explain his wrongdoing. This shows that Job was indeed perfect and upright; otherwise, he would not have dared to speak in this way. Job&rsquo;s friends told him that God, who is righteous, would have struck him only if he was wrong in some way. Job, however, rejected this argument. This also shows that Job had not found God. Though he was a perfect and upright man, a God-fearing man with righteous deeds, he had no light. God allowed Satan to deal with Job, not because of his faults but because he was too faultless.</p>
<p>God dealt with Job not because he was wrong but because he was so right that even Satan had nothing against him; he was so right that he was willing to challenge God and argue with Him. Those who are upright are often blind. Self-righteousness blinds us, and self-righteousness veils us so that we cannot see light and cannot see God.</p>
<p>Job&rsquo;s self-righteousness was detrimental to him; it was a problem to him and a frustration to God. Therefore, God did not value Job&rsquo;s perfection; instead, He allowed Satan to break, to strike, Job to the point that he became more and more confused. No book in the Bible records such lengthy quarrels as the book of Job. Of the forty-two chapters in Job, thirty-three are a record of his quarrels with his three friends. Job had fierce quarrels with these friends. His first friend quarreled with him in three sections (chs. 4&mdash;7; 15&mdash;17; 22&mdash;24), but Job was not convinced. A second friend also quarreled with him in three sections (chs. 8&mdash;10; 18&mdash;19; 25&mdash;31), but Job was not convinced. Then a third friend quarreled with him in two sections (chs. 11&mdash;13; 20&mdash;21), but Job refuted him as well. Together his three friends quarreled with him in eight separate sections, but Job countered them all. Lastly, Elihu came and quarreled with him in a final section (chs. 32&mdash;37). When Job finally met God, he said, &ldquo;Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?&rdquo; (42:3).</p>
<p>When talking with others, it is best to let them finish. God is very patient, and He let Job and his friends quarrel until they were finished talking and Job was finished refuting. When God came in, He did not say anything in the way of argument; instead, He asked Job questions (38:4&mdash;39:30; 40:15&mdash;41:34). The last chapters of the book of Job present God&rsquo;s questions to Job, none of which he could answer. Through those questions, Job was enlightened and immediately said, &ldquo;Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge? / ...I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear, / But now my eye has seen You; / Therefore I abhor myself, and I repent / In dust and ashes&rdquo; (42:3, 5-6). Job repented for his self. He did not repent for his bad self but for his good self, not for his corrupt self but for his perfect and upright self, which was veiled to God&rsquo;s light.</p>
<p>In order to see God&rsquo;s vision, God&rsquo;s light, we must stop ourselves and finish our &ldquo;talking.&rdquo; Some brothers and sisters cannot stop &ldquo;talking.&rdquo; They think that their views and insights are accurate and commendable. Recently, a brother came to see me and said, &ldquo;We should do this, and we should do that. It would be good if we do this and beneficial if we do that.&rdquo; I often have only one reply when I encounter such speaking. I say, &ldquo;It would be good if you could do it.&rdquo; I say this because a person who does not truly know what he is speaking about loses the Lord&rsquo;s presence when he does something on his own. Even though he thinks that his way is acceptable, he does not touch God. Thus, when he attempts to take his own way, he learns that his views and insights are not accurate.</p>
<p>Before Job touched God, he thought that he was the most proper person in the universe. In his self-righteousness Job said, &ldquo;Oh that I knew where I might find Him, / That I might come to His seat! / I would present my cause in order before Him, / And I would fill my mouth with arguments&rdquo; (23:3-4). This word shows that Job had not met God. Those who have not met God&rsquo;s shining have no comprehension of their foolishness and blindness. But when God came to Job and he saw God, he was subdued. After seeing God, Job&rsquo;s speaking indicated that he had merely heard of God by the hearing of his ear but that now he truly saw God. He realized that his words were without knowledge and that he had been hidden and veiled from God&rsquo;s shining. Thus, he repented even for his perfect and upright self (cf. 42:1-6). This shows that Job saw light.</p>
<p>We see light only when our &ldquo;talking&rdquo; ceases and we are still. I hope that all God&rsquo;s serving ones can see this. When we are still within and quiet without, God can come. When we speak, God does not speak. This is the difference between Mary and Martha. Mary was still, but Martha could not stop (Luke 10:38-42). Consequently, Mary gained the Lord&rsquo;s speaking, but Martha did not. Martha, however, did not miss the Lord&rsquo;s speaking because He would not speak to her; rather, she could not hear the Lord&rsquo;s speaking because she could not stop her self and be still.</p>
<p>In serving the Lord, every brother or sister must learn to be still and to not bring in his or her own opinions, insights, views, and ways. We should be able to say before God, &ldquo;I have stopped my whole being, and I have finished my speaking.&rdquo; When we read the Bible and draw near to God in this way, we will have vision and light, and we will be able to know the way that God wants us to take and the work that God wants us to do on the earth.</p>
<p>If we have no vision and no light, there must be some problem, but the problem is not on God&rsquo;s side, it is on our side. Without a vision we can only serve the Lord with our own opinions, insights, views, and ways. Thus, our &ldquo;work&rdquo; will only be our work, not God&rsquo;s work, because we will not have a vision of God or of our place in His work.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
