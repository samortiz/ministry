   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Subjecting All Things under His Feet,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>and Giving Him to Be Head over All Things</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>to the Church through His Excelling Dispensing,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Making the Church the Organic Body of Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>the Fullness of the One Who Fills All in All</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>for His Corporate Expression in the Universe</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have not only the transformation and the dispensing, but a transmission as well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Electricity is transmitted from a power plant to a particular building.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once the transmission of electricity stops, the lights in the building will go out, and all the electrical appliances will cease to function.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God in the heavenlies is our power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are the object of His transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Between Him and us there is a "transmission line," and a transmission is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to Ephesians 1:19-23, this transmission is in the surpassing greatness of the divine power toward the believers, which the Father wrought in the Son in raising Him from among the dead, seating Him at the Father's right hand in the heavenlies, subjecting all things under His feet, and giving Him to be the Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has wrought something in Christ, and all this work is to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word to v. 22 indicates a transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This transmission is transmitting all the great power God wrought in Christ into us, the church, with the result that through His excelling dispensing, the church becomes the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church becomes organic through the transmission that is taking place between God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This organic Body of Christ is the very fullness of Christ, the One who fills all in all, for His corporate expression in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The existence of the church comes out of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, the church is the issue of this divine transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this we need to experience the divine dispensing plus the divine transmission continually.</S>
