   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What is God's righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's righteousness is God's way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Love is God's nature, holiness is God's disposition, and glory is God's own being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Righteousness, however, is God's procedure, His way, and His method.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since God is righteous, He cannot love man merely according to His own love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He cannot grant man grace merely according to what He wants.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He cannot save man merely according to His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is true that God saves man because He loves man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But He must do so in a way that is in agreement with His own righteousness, His own procedure, His own moral standard, His own way, His own method, His own dignity, and His own majesty.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We know that it is easy for God to save man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But it is not easy for God to save man in a righteous way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Just imagine how easy it would be for God to save us if the matter of righteousness were not a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There would be no difficulty at all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If God had not loved us, nothing could be done for us and everything would be hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But God has loved us and has had mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, He intends to give us grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the issue of righteousness had not come in, God could say, "Have you sinned?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All right, just do not commit the mistake again."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God could then overlook our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He could let us go and send us away.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If God forgives carelessly not judging the sinner's sin and dealing with his sins according to the law, where is His righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here is where the difficulty lies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some time ago, a brother got caught up in a complicated matter and was put in jail by the government.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I knew that though he was not completely without fault, the mistake was really with other people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because of this, I was willing to help him out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I went to Nanking and talked to a few of the people who were involved in the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I told them about the situation and asked if they could help out a little.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There were nine of us there, and all of us were busy people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We held nine meetings together over a period of eleven days, trying to come up with a way to help this man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, all these people admitted that they had the way and the authority to release the man, but that they could not release him without incriminating themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, we had to find a way to release the man that, at the same time, would be legal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Undoubtedly, God is full of love for us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God wants to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But He must do so legally.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If He does not save us legally, He cannot save us at all.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's love is limited by His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God cannot act contrary to Himself and irresponsibly declare that our sins are written off, that everything is fine, and that we can get off free.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If God were to forgive us irresponsibly, what law, what righteousness, and what truth would be left in the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All of these would be through.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God wants to save us, and we need to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The question is whether or not there will be unrighteousness in our being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are many today who accept bribes from others and are partial because of private relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They often help others out, and others often receive benefits from them; but we all agree that these people are not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are not righteous but corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They may have much love, but what they do is not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God cannot save us at the expense of involving Himself in unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God must save us while preserving His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is important for God to save us, but He must do so according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God could save us immediately with His love.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But He must also save us very righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How can this be done?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not an easy matter for God to save us without violating His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How can God justify sinners without getting into unrighteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How can God save sinners without involving Himself in unrighteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How can God forgive sins in a righteous way?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God is willing to save us, but He wants us to be able to say, at the time we receive His life and are saved, that He has justified us in a most righteous way.</S>
