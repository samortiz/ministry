 <h2 class="head2">D. The Termination of Unsettled Matters</h2>
<p>When a person is saved, he surely has many unsettled secular matters at hand. These may easily hinder him from following the Lord. What should he do? &ldquo;Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead&rdquo; (Matt. 8:22). This is another biblical case of terminating the past. Here, a man came to Jesus and said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father&rdquo; (v. 21). The Lord said, &ldquo;Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.&rdquo; The word <em>their</em> refers to the first use of the word <em>dead,</em> whereas the second <em>dead</em> refers to the man&rsquo;s father. The first <em>dead</em> refers to those who are spiritually dead. In God&rsquo;s eyes those in the world are spiritually dead. The Lord was saying that the man should let the dead bury his father, while he should follow the Lord.</p>
<p>I am not exhorting new believers to not make funeral arrangements for their fathers. I am saying that the dead should bury their own dead. We must lay hold of this principle. We should let go of unfinished business. If we wait until we have finished settling them before we become Christians, we will never have the time. There are hundreds and thousands of items of unfinished business in our families, with our fathers, and in our lives. Who then could become a Christian? There is only one word to describe the principle behind all of these things&mdash;these are dead people. Let the dead bury their dead. Let the spiritually dead handle the matters of the dead! This is the principle. This is not to exhort new believers to neglect their family. It means that they should not wait until they have settled all their earthly matters before coming to the Lord. If they do, they will not be able to follow the Lord.</p>
<p>Many people want to settle all of their affairs before they believe in the Lord. If so, they will have no opportunity to believe in Him. We should not be bound by matters of the dead. Instead, we should just regard the unsettled matters as settled. If we want to settle them before following the Lord, we will never make it. Matters concerning idols, improper things, and debts must be dealt with thoroughly. As for other unsettled matters, we should just let them go!</p>
<p>With regard to the attitude of a new believer towards his past, I can only find the above four categories of things in the Word of God. As for many other unsettled affairs, we should regard them as settled. As to family duties, we should let the dead take care of the dead. We have no time to deal with them. We want to follow the Lord. Those things are not for us to settle; they are for the dead to take care of. Let the ones who are spiritually dead handle them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A QUESTION</h2>
<p><em>A brother asked:</em> If I have offended a person and he is not aware of it, must I also confess to him?</p>
<p>Answer: It all depends on whether or not he has suffered material loss. If the other party is aware of this loss, you should deal with the matter by following Zaccheus&rsquo;s example. Even if he is unaware of this loss, you should still confess to him, especially when material loss is involved. It is best to bring the matter to the church and let the more experienced brothers help you solve it because they know what is most expedient.</p>
