<h2 class="head1">EVERY BELIEVER SERVING GOD</h2>
<p>God wants every believer to serve Him. This is a basic matter in the Bible. Most believers have the erroneous concept that God wants man merely to be saved. However, the Bible reveals that God&rsquo;s purpose in saving man is not merely for man to be saved but for man to serve Him. Every believer should serve God. Regardless of our profession, we should serve God. Our worldly professions are secondary; our primary profession is to serve God. First Peter 2:9 says that to be saved is to become a royal priesthood. We need to sense within that we are priests of God. Whether businessmen, doctors, or teachers, regardless of our profession we should have the sense that we are on the earth to be priests. A priest is a person who serves God exclusively. The title <em>priest</em> is not a designation for a minority. Catholics have the erroneous concept that only those who are ordained as priests can serve God. However, every Christian should be a priest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRISTIAN SERVICE BEING A SERVICE OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>According to the New Testament, the believers are members one of another and are coordinated in one Body. A Christian is not a complete entity; he is merely a member of the Body, a part. Hence, when we serve the Lord, we should serve in the position of a member, in coordination with others. Just as a member cannot function apart from the other members in a body, so also we cannot have an individualistic service in the church.</p>
<p>We must be clear that our service in the church is the service of the Body. Once we are separated from the Body, there cannot be any service. Any service that is apart from the Body is abnormal. A nose is very becoming and useful on a person&rsquo;s face, but if it is cut off, it is frightful, unsightly, and useless. A hand is dexterous and becoming on a person&rsquo;s body, but a severed hand that is still moving would be a frightful sight. Such is any service that is apart from the Body.</p>
<p>Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12 are two crucial chapters in the Bible concerning the service of the Body. In Romans we are being saved by the Lord for His service (12:1). In 1 Corinthians we are members of the Body of Christ; hence, we must not act or serve alone (12:14-22). If we see these two points, there will be fewer problems in our service for building up the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRINCIPLES FOR OUR SERVICE</h2>
<p>There are two crucial principles concerning our service for building up the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Serving under the Authority of the Head</h2>
<p>When serving in the church, we must see authority. The matter of authority must be settled if we are to coordinate and serve with the saints in the church. Otherwise, our service will lack the element of building and will eventually cause problems in the church.</p>
<p>Authority in the church does not refer to the establishment of popes, as is practiced among Catholics. Authority concerns order in the Body. Every member in our body has its place. For example, I have shoulders, and my arms are attached to my shoulders, and my hands, including my fingers, are attached to my arms. Every member of my body has a certain position, and this position is its order. Similarly, there is order in our service in the church because it is the service of the Body. If we are subject to the authority of the Head, we will know our position and our order in the church. We will spontaneously know where we should be, whom we are in front of, and who is in front of us.</p>
<p>Some may think that it is difficult to know one&rsquo;s order in the church. They may ask, &ldquo;What is my order, and whose authority should I be under? What should I do if I am in the wrong order or under the wrong authority?&rdquo; Such questions are theoretical; they are not practical. We should question only whether we have seen the authority of the Head and whether we are subject to the arrangement of the Head. If we know the authority of the Head and are subject to His arrangement, we will spontaneously know our position and order in the church.</p>
<p>Those who have touched the authority of the Head and rest in their position in the Body will have spontaneous and harmonious coordination with others. Such ones will not despise their portion or shrink back, nor will they highly regard themselves or put themselves before others. Rather, they will fulfill their function in the church as becoming, beautiful members.</p>
<p>If all God&rsquo;s children knew the authority of the Head, that authority would become the power of the church. Once the authority of the Head is honored, the church will have the presence of the Head and the riches of the Head. The building up of the church depends on God&rsquo;s throne being in the church. For the genuine building up of the church, the first matter that every serving one should touch is the authority of the Head. Those who have touched the authority of the Head will never be disconnected from the church, nor will they serve God in an individualistic way. Under the authority of the Head, there is no room for zealous or capable persons. If zealous and capable persons who do not know the throne serve in the church, they will trample and tear down others. Only those who know authority and are subject to the Head can supply the Body of Christ and build up the church of God.</p>
