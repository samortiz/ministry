Job's Complaint concerning God's Severe<br>Strictness in Dealing with Him</H2><P>In 13:3, 20-28 Job contended with God for his case. In 14:1-22 Job went on to complain concerning God's severe strictness in dealing with him, and then Job made his request of God to look away from him that he might rest.</P><P>As he argued with God Job said, "Man, born of woman,/Is of few days and full of trouble./He comes forth like a blossom and is cut down,/He also flees like a shadow and does not remain./And do You open Your eyes upon such a one/And bring me into judgment with You?" (vv. 1-3). Job's word about God bringing him into judgment implies the notion that there would be litigation involving Job and God in court, with Job as the plaintiff and God as the defendant. Job was wondering whether God would bring him to court so that he could be judged there. Job was expecting this.</P><P>After saying that no one could bring a clean thing from an unclean, Job continued, "Since his days are determined,/And the number of his months is with You;/Since You have appointed his bounds, and he cannot go beyond" (v. 5). Here Job was saying that God had appointed limits that Job could not go beyond. He was altogether under God's control. He wanted God to look away from him so that he could rest. He felt that he was a "hired hand," an employee hired by God and subject to the limits set by God.</P><P>Whereas there was hope that a tree which had been cut down would sprout again, there was no hope for a man who had been laid low. "A man lies down and does not rise up;/Until the heavens are no more, he will not awake,/Nor will he be roused from his sleep" (v. 12). Job said that once a man dies, he is finished. Then he told God, "Oh that You would hide me in Sheol,/That You would conceal me until Your anger has passed,/That You would set me an appointed time and remember me!" (v. 13).</P><P>Job then asked, "If a man dies, will he live again?/All the days of my service I would wait,/Until a change for me should come" (v. 14). The Hebrew word translated "service" also means "warfare" or "distress." To Job's feeling, his life was a war, and his days were days of fighting.</P><P>In verses 15 through 17 Job continued, "You would call, and I would answer You;/You would long after the work of Your hands./For now You number my steps./Do You not watch over my sin?/My transgression has been sealed up in a bag,/And You have fastened up my iniquity." Job thought that God was doing this to him. It seems that Job was too sensitive and that he was deeply troubled psychologically as a result of being in the realm of good and evil.</P><P>Finally, Job claimed that God destroyed the hope of man, prevailing forever against him, changing his countenance, and sending him away. "Only the pain of his own flesh does he feel,/And his own soul mourns for him" (v. 22). All this was part of Job's argument with God.</P>
