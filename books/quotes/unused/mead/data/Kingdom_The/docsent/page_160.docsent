   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ATTITUDE OF THE CHILDREN OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TOWARD RICHES Not Laying up Riches</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We continue with the fifth aspect of the reality of the kingdom the attitude of the children of the kingdom of the heavens toward mammon, or riches Matt 6:19-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What should be the attitude of the children of the kingdom toward riches?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First of all, we should not lay up for ourselves treasures upon the earth Matt 6:19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You may ask: "Are not savings accounts the laying up of treasures on earth?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It depends on your motive.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is nothing wrong with making some preparation for next year or for your children's education.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In fact, in the Epistles we are told that parents should lay up something for their children 2 Cor 12:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must educate them in a proper way, and this will be expensive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As parents, we are responsible to care for our children.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not a matter of outward regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all need to pray concerning these things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord's wisdom will then be with us, and we will be clear how much we should save for the future and for our children.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are faithful to the Lord, He will show us what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The basic matter is to check our motive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The governing principle is that to lay up treasures on earth is against God's economy and expresses a kind of unbelief in His mercy and care.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May the Lord's wisdom be with us in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not Serving Riches</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The second aspect of the children of the kingdom toward riches is not to serve both riches and God Matt 6:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although we may have a savings account, we must not serve it as we would serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God, not money or riches, is the only master whom we should serve.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should serve God and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Trusting Our Father for Our Living</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The third point is that we are trusting our Father for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The children of the kingdom trust in their Father for their living even as the birds of the heaven and lilies of the field do Matt 6:25-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus was wise.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He used the birds to illustrate the Lord's care for our eating and the lilies to illustrate the Lord's care for our clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus said, "Look at the birds of the heaven, that they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns, and your heavenly Father nourishes them" Matt 6:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They have no field or barn, but so many servants are serving them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the rich people serve the birds in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The birds enjoy what the rich people do for them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The rich people have a few barns, but the birds have many barns.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord continued by saying, "Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not toil, neither do they spin; Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed as one of these" Matt 6:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Who gave the lilies this clothing?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God did!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should be like the birds in the air and the lilies on the earth, trusting our Father in the heavens to take care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some who are loose and lazy may find this suitable to their natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They may say, "This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is no need for us to work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God will feed and clothe us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are like the birds of the air.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no need for us to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God will take care of us."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, if they take this attitude, God will not take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Never forget that there are some following verses.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Matthew 6:33 says, "But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must seek the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not be loose or lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we seek first the kingdom of God and the righteousness of God, He will certainly take care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, we must not be loose, but serious in seeking God's kingdom and righteousness.</S>
