Paul deals with the matter of the Christian life and the matter of the Christian service in the book of Romans
If you have the Body with the Body practice, the Body expression, and the Body life, then you have the Christian service
The first aspect is a matter of the Christian life a life matter and the second aspect is a matter of the Christian service a service matter
Immediately following this parable, the Lord gave us the parable of the talents, which is something related to our service
We have to use the talent, the gift, which the Lord has given us, to do some business and to make some profit for the Lord
We have to grow in life with the oil, with the light, and with the going out of this world to meet the Lord in His coming back
He realizes the fact that the old man has been put to death and the fact that with the old man there is nothing good
In chapter twelve so many redeemed ones who are walking in the Spirit are composed together in the Spirit as one Body
The little children can do many things, but they cannot serve, because they simply do not have the adequate growth in life
Even if you have life, but are short of the growth in life, still young, childish, even like a babe, you cannot serve
Without the building up of the church, there is no possibility of having the church service, the Christian service
The hand is good, quite useful, but if it is cut off from the body, it becomes not only dead, but also ugly, terrible, and even terrifying
The members of the body are beautiful as long as they are attached where they belong in the body, but in any other place they are terrible
The Body life is in Romans 12, and the church service is in this Body life with the members of the Body, of the church, functioning, serving
If we could give up the service of the Lord, there would be no need for us to talk about the Body, the church life
We know that all the believers are priests, and that the function, the duty, the responsibility, of the priests is to serve the Lord
According to the spiritual reality, the priesthood is the building up of the priests, the coordination, the cooperation of all the priests
When we are built up together as a spiritual house and have the coordination of the priests, then we can preach the gospel
The first gospel preaching was on the day of Pentecost, when one hundred twenty people were built up together, coordinated
Rather they preached the gospel in a prevailing way, in a coordination of all the saints, all coordinated as one
In the Old Testament types there are two different orders of priests, the order of Aaron and the order of Melchisedec
To be holy simply means to be sanctified, and to be sanctified simply means to be separated from the common things unto the divine things
We all need to go to the Lord and pray for a period of time, like those one hundred twenty in Acts who prayed for ten days
After those ten days, when they came out to the people to tell them that Jesus is the Lord, the Savior, they did this in a royal way
When they came out from the presence of the Lord with the heavenly authority, they were kings, they were royal
When we are built up together, separated from the world unto the Lord, and we pray before the Lord, we will be the holy priests
We come out to tell the people something about the Lord as royal priests, kingly priests, with the heavenly authority
When we as a Body go to the Lord and remain in His presence, we are the holy priests, the holy, separated ones before God
What comes out is not just preaching of the word, of the gospel, but preaching the gospel with the kingly, heavenly authority
If we are going to serve the Lord in the way of the church service, we must pay our full attention to these three matters
We will be qualified, empowered, to minister the Lord to others as the royal priests, the kingly priests, with the heavenly authority
The message, the word, the ministry, will be weighty because there is the heavenly authority of the royal priest
The coordination, the separation, and the authority-these three are the qualifications, the equipment we need to minister
You have to check whether you have been built up in the Body, whether you are in the coordination of the priesthood
In Acts 19:13-16, the seven sons of Sceva attempted to cast out the evil spirits by using the name of the Jesus that Paul preached
The real service, the prevailing service, does not depend upon knowledge, ability, eloquence, or so-called gifts
If you would be willing to be built up together with others, simply lose yourself; let yourself be lost in the building of the church
You realize the separation with the saints from the world unto the Lord, and you do have the authority of the heavens
On the day of Pentecost Peter was one in the coordination and was one with the separation and one with the heavenly authority
When those one hundred twenty people stayed in the presence of the Lord for ten days, all of them were the holy priests
Because they were royal priests, even the highest power on this earth was afraid of them because of their authority
