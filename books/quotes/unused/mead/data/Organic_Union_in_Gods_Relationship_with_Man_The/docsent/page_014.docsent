   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THAT HE MAY BE ONE WITH THE BELIEVING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After entering into His believing people, God becomes one spirit with them 1 Cor 6:17 in the organic union of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this organic union God and man are one person, signified by the true vine in John 15:1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the organic union the vine and the branches coinhere; the vine abides in the branches and the branches abide in the vine v. 5 . The first, the vine, lives in the second, the branches Gal 2:20a , and the second lives in the first to manifest Him Phil 1:20-21a .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE ORGANIC UNION IN INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may think that the incarnation lasted for only nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the incarnation of God for Him to enter into man has been going on for two thousand years, from the first century to the twentieth century.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One afternoon in April 1925, at the age of nineteen, I heard the wonderful gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a result, I opened myself and received God into me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I became a different person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that juncture God was incarnated into me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although at times I even tried to deny that God was in me, I cannot deny that from the hour of my conversion God has been in me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is still going to be incarnated into many thousands of people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How fast could this take place?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It depends on us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we would go and disciple the nations quickly, God would be incarnated in a fast way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's incarnation is just to carry out God's desire with His good pleasure to be one with man in the organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through God's incarnation man is in an organic union with the organic God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God created man, and then He came to be a man in incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After passing through the processes of human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension, He as the life-giving Spirit, who is the consummated, compound Spirit, entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the completion of His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now we are here in a completed union with God organically.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is God's creation, this is God's incarnation, and this is our conversion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He created us six thousand years ago, He became us two thousand years ago, and He entered into us to be us today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, we are a part of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A counterpart of God is just a part of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What He is, we are.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is the Head and we are the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot say that the Head is God and that the Body is not God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Body and the Head are one and the same.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be a Christian is not only to be moral with a high standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be a Christian is to be God, to be a part of God, to be a counterpart of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As Christians, we should live God, express God, and manifest God by walking and doing everything in the Spirit and according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The very God whose counterpart we have become is the life-giving, compound, all-inclusive Spirit, who is the consummation, the totality, the aggregate, of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a Spirit is the great blessing to all the nations on this earth in Jesus Christ.</S>
