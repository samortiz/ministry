   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The same principle can be applied to our reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many people are pressing upon the Bible, but few touch the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You can touch God's Son through Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You can also touch God's Son through the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The problem with many people is that they only see the Bible; they have not touched the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, men knew Him according to two different realms.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In one realm men heard His voice and observed His movements but did not know Him at all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In another realm one person touched His garment and was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many people saw Him, but only one knew that God was with this Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am afraid that when we introduce Jesus of Nazareth to others, we are merely introducing them to the Jesus of Nazareth who was in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the same way, I am afraid that when we introduce the Bible to others, we are merely presenting a book to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should remember that those who pressed upon Jesus of Nazareth did not receive any benefit from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many sick ones were not healed even though they pressed upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Likewise, those who are pressing upon the Bible do not receive anything from this book.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They receive nothing, just as the pressing crowd received nothing from Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But some receive the light within, and they touch the Son of God within the book.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word that the Lord speaks to us is spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As soon as we touch this, we touch the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What we present to men should not be just a simple book.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In presenting the book, we should also present the Son of God to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A minister of the word is one who, while serving others with the word of God, also serves them with the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We serve men with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only as we present men with Christ can we serve as a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some people only know the historical Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They do not know the Son of God at all.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When many people read the Bible, they only see the historical Jesus; they have never touched the Son of God within the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible is not merely a book, inasmuch as Jesus was not merely a man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Within the Bible we find Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a man only touches the book without touching the Son of God, he does not have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Luke 24:13-31 the Lord Jesus met two disciples on the way to Emmaus, and He walked with them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>While they journeyed, the Lord asked them questions and they answered, or they asked and the Lord answered.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The conversation was not short, and the Lord expounded the Scripture to them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When they were near Emmaus, they constrained Him, saying, "Stay with us, because it is near evening and the day is already gone by" v. 29 . The Lord went in and stayed with them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They even invited the Lord to their meal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During this long conversation, they did not recognize the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only when the Lord took the bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them were their eyes opened.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then they recognized the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This shows us that even when a man walks with the Lord side by side, he still may not know who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even when he talks with the Lord, he can still be ignorant of who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brothers and sisters, even if the Lord were to speak to us, we still might not know who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even if He were to stay with us, we still might not know who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should know something about the Lord that is far deeper than the knowledge we can gain from staying with Him, walking with Him, or talking to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We will only know who He is when He opens our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Walking with Him, talking with Him, and having Him expound the Scripture to us are not enough to guarantee that we will know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must realize that genuine knowledge of the Lord is deeper than these things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may lament in our heart that we were not with Him when He walked on the earth, but we should realize that even if we had been with Him, we would not have known Him any more than we would today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today, one of the least or weakest of brothers knows the Lord Jesus as much as Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, the twelve disciples knew Him but not in a way that was greater than the weakest among us can know Him today.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not think that we will know Him just by staying with Him for a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to realize that the Lord the disciples knew in their spirit is no different from the Lord we know in our spirit today.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The fundamental question is what constitutes real knowledge of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Real knowledge of Him does not come from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need God's revelation before we can know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord has to open our eyes and show us something before we can know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord has to open our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is what being a minister of the word is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A man may spend much time studying.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He may recite all the verses in the Bible and may be clear about all the doctrines in the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He may answer every question quickly, but it is possible that he does not know God's Son at all.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One day when God opens his eyes, he will see the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When God opens our eyes, we see Jesus of Nazareth and we see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the same way, when God opens our eyes, we see the Bible and the Son of God revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is not to say that the work of the Lord Jesus on earth was not important.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are saying that a man has to believe that Jesus is the Christ before he can be begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If a man believes that He is the Son of God, he is begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We not only must see that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, but we must see the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One cannot take away Jesus of Nazareth and still have the Son of God or Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God; He is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the same way, one cannot take away the Old Testament or the New Testament and say that he knows Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He cannot take away the Bible and say that he knows the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Through the Bible, God gives us the knowledge of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we do not have revelation, we may read the book but only have knowledge of doctrines; we will not know the Christ contained in the book.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is a very fundamental issue.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We can understand everything about this book and yet have not seen Christ at all.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is possible for us to touch this book without ever touching Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What makes Christianity so complicated is the fact that there are two different realms.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If all the outward things were taken away and only inward things were left, the situation would be much simpler: Those who have it would clearly have it, and those who do not have it would clearly not have it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But the problem is that there is a realm of "pressing" and there is also a realm of "touching."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Some are pressing, while others are touching.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The two are completely different.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Pressing upon Jesus is absolutely different from touching Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Can we see the difference between these two?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There are two different realms.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The pressing ones are in one realm, and the touching ones are in another realm.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Those who are in the pressing realm experience nothing, while those in the touching realm are healed of all their sicknesses and relieved of all their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In one realm there are intellectual ones who can understand the Bible, the doctrines, and the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But in the other realm, one encounters light, revelation, and the anointing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Brothers, do we see this?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There are two different realms.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In one realm there are the teachers of letters.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In the other realm there are the ministers of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We can only preach what we know.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>God has to bring us to a point where we touch the inner realm.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We cannot know the Lord Jesus in the realm of "pressing"; we cannot know the Bible in that realm either.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We must get into the realm of "touching" before we can be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Only in that realm do we find God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Only that realm will issue in any results, and only that kind of "touching" will yield any results.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The amazing thing is that the Lord did not feel anyone pressing upon Him, but He was very conscious of someone touching Him.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>A simple brother who has nothing and who knows nothing may come to the Bible and contact the word in fear and trembling, and in the Lord's presence, he may see light.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Another brother may be well acquainted with the Greek and Hebrew languages.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He may be very good at Chinese and English and may have read the Bible from cover to cover many times.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He may even have memorized the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>But if he has never received any light from God, he cannot be a minister of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The most he can do is pass on Bible knowledge to others.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>He cannot minister Christ to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The Bible is living; it is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In fact, it is the Son of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If we do not touch this living word when we read the Bible, whatever we know will not yield any fruit.</S>
