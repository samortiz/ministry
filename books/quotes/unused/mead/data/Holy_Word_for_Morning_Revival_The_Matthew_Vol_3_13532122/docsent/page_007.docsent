   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 11 DAY 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 15:8-9, 11-14, 18-20</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>8 "This people honors Me with their lips, but their 1 heart stays far away from Me;</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>9 But in 1 vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>11 It is not that which enters into the mouth that defiles the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this 1 defiles the man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>12 Then the disciples came and said to Him, Do You know that the Pharisees were stumbled when they heard this word?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>13 And He answered and said, Every plant which My heavenly Father has 1 not planted shall be rooted up.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>14 Let them be.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are 1 blind guides of the blind; and if a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>18 But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those defile the man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>19 For out of the heart come 1 evil reasonings, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, blasphemies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>20 These are the things which defile the man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile the man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>8 1 The heavenly ruling of the kingdom requires inward reality, not mere outward practice.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such ruling deals with the real condition of the heart, not with the expression of the lips.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>9 1 This reveals that some worship offered to God may be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The main cause of this is to consider as teachings the commandments of men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must worship God according to His word, which is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>11 1 I.e., makes the man common, unclean Acts 11:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So in vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>18 and 20.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the kingdom life, defilement is not an outward matter but an inward matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>13 1 This word from the heavenly King indicates that the hypocritical Pharisees had not been planted by the heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because of their rejection of the heavenly King, they were uprooted from the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>14 1 The self-righteous and arrogant religionists thought that they were clear concerning the way to serve God, not realizing that they were blind guides of the blind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Their eyes were veiled by their religion with their traditions; hence, they could not see the reality of God's economy and thus were not able to enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Their blindness led them to "fall into a pit."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>19 1 In the kingdom of the heavens, defilement is not related to material things but to moral matters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Material things have nothing to do with the heavenly ruling, but moral matters do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That so many evils issue from our heart proves that we are not under the heavenly ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The problem between the Pharisees and the Lord Jesus and His followers was that the Pharisees cared only for outward tradition, ritual, and practice, for example, the washing of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They cared nothing whatever for inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus pointed them to the inward matter of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord seemed to say, "Don't care for this outward practice of washing of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The dirt that needs to be cleansed away is within you."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Lord's recovery today we likewise do not care for outward things; rather, we care for inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is an insignificant matter whether our hands are dirty; it is the condition of our inward parts that is important.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we speak without reality, we are more than pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Tradition is a matter of utterance from the lips without reality in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who follow the traditions are blind guides of the blind.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is true today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They may claim to know the Bible, but actually they are completely blind and have no light at all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I feel very sad about all those who are being misled.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They have missed the blessing and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>537-541</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>537-541; Hymns: #744</S>
