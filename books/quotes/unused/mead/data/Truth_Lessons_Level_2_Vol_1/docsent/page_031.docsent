   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>G. If His Seed Would Commit Iniquity,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God Would Chasten His Seed,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>but His Lovingkindness</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Would Not Depart from His Seed</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God promised David that if his seed would commit iniquity, He would chasten his seed, but His lovingkindness would not depart from his seed 2 Sam 7:14b-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This word was fulfilled in Solomon and in his descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Solomon succeeded to the throne of David and built the holy temple for God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, in his old age, lusting after his foreign wives, he forsook God and followed his foreign wives to worship idols, thus committing a grievous sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, God raised up adversaries to him, Hadad the Edomite and Rezon the king of Syria; Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Solomon s servant, also lifted up his hand against him 1 Kings 11:14, 23, 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Moreover, God was angry with him, and He tore the kingdom from him and gave it to his servant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, for David s sake, He did not do it in his days; He tore the kingdom out of the hand of his son, but He gave one tribe to his son for the sake of David and of Jerusalem which He had chosen 1 Kings 11:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although God chastened Solomon with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men, His lovingkindness did not depart from him as it did from Saul, whom He rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>H. His House and His Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Would Be Made Sure before God,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>and His Throne Would Be Established Forever</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God promised David that his house, his kingdom, and his throne would be established forever before God 2 Sam 7:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This refers to Christ inheriting the kingdom and throne of David His father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the house of David, only the kingdom of Christ and His throne will last forever Dan 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word of God conveyed by the archangel Gabriel also confirmed that the covenant of David was fulfilled in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This word says, The Lord God will give to Him the throne of David His father; and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of His kingdom there shall not be an end Luke 1:32-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, God s promise to David that his house and his kingdom would be made sure and that his throne would be established forever was fulfilled in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE RESULT A. Solomon His Son</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Succeeding Him to the Throne</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>and Building the Holy Temple for God</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the covenant which He made with David, God caused David s son Solomon to succeed David to the throne 1 Kings 1:39 to build the holy temple for God 1 Kings 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before his death, David gave to Solomon his son the pattern for the building of the holy temple 1 Chron 28:11-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After Solomon succeeded to the throne of David, he built the holy temple according to the pattern that his father had seen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This temple became the proper and firm dwelling place of God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At this point, God not only obtained a kingdom to express His authority, but He also gained a house to express His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>B. Solomon Lusting after Foreign Wives</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>and Following Them to Worship Idols</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Solomon succeeded to the throne of David and built the holy temple for God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, when he was old, he lusted after foreign wives and thus turned away from Jehovah, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice and had commanded him that he should not go after other gods.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But he did not keep Jehovah s commandment and did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah 1 Kings 11:6, 9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Besides taking the daughter of Pharaoh for his wife, he loved many foreign women.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The foreign wives turned away his heart after other gods, and he rebuilt the high places for the foreign images 1 Kings 11:6-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is hard to imagine that such a one as Solomon, to whom God had given the surpassing wisdom, and who was such a king who had built the holy temple after God s heart, could lust after foreign wives, allow them to lead him away from God to follow them in worshipping idols, and thus provoke God to anger 1 Kings 11:9 to the extent that God would tear the kingdom away from his son 1 Kings 11:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>C. The Kingdom of David</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Becoming the Tabernacle That Has Fallen</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>and His Throne Thus Being Suspended</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because of his son Solomon s wickedness, David s kingdom lost ten tribes 1 Kings 11:29-36 and the nation of Israel was thus divided into two.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When both parts were carried away to the nations, the kingdom of David became the tabernacle that has fallen Amos 9:11 , and his throne was thus suspended.</S>
