 <p><strong>WEEK 8 &mdash; DAY 2</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>Isa. 9:6 ...A Son is given to us...and His name will be called...Eternal Father...</strong></p>
<p><strong>John 14:9 Jesus said to [Philip]...He who has seen Me has seen the Father...</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 Cor. 3:17 And the Lord is the Spirit...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rom. 8:15 For you have...received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father!</strong></p>
<p>In the New Testament, [two of] the main divine titles used are God [and] Father.</p>
<h2 class="head3">God</h2>
<p>God in Greek is <em>Theos.</em> God, <em>Theos,</em> equals God, <em>Elohim,</em> in the Old Testament, denoting the unique yet triune God (1 Cor. 8:4, 6; 1 Tim. 2:5a)&mdash;the Father being God (1 Pet. 1:2-3), the Son being God (Heb. 1:8), and the Holy Spirit being God (Acts 5:3-4). Theologians have accurately pointed out that the Father, Son, and Spirit are not three separate gods, but three hypostases, or supporting substances, of the one God. Later, theologians began to use the word <em>persons</em> for the three of the Godhead. <em>Person</em> comes from the Latin word <em>persona,</em> which was an actor&rsquo;s mask. One person can have three masks or appearances.</p>
<p>Some have said wrongly that the three of the Godhead, the Father, Son, and Spirit, are separate from one another. I published something pointing out that the three of the Godhead are distinct but not separate. They are always one. When we have the Father, we have the Son and the Spirit because the three are one. When the Son is here, the Spirit and the Father are with Him. The three are not separate. They are distinct, but one....They are one God with three aspects&mdash;the aspect as the Father, the aspect as the Son, and the aspect as the Spirit.<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>God is three yet one. In essence God is one. In economy, in God&rsquo;s move, God is three. This is why the best theology refers to the essential Trinity and the economical Trinity. Essentially God is one, but economically God is three. God the Father sent the Son in His economy, in His move. The Son did things by the Spirit in His move. The Father, Son, and Spirit are three economically in Their move and administration, but not in Their essence. Essentially God is one. This is why the Bible shows that the Son is the Father (Isa. 9:6; John 14:9). Furthermore, Paul said that the last Adam, who was the Son in the flesh, after His death and resurrection became a life-giving Spirit [1 Cor. 15:45]. He said in 2 Corinthians 3:17 that the Lord, the Son, is the Spirit....This means that the Spirit is the Lord and the Lord is the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Father</h2>
<p>Another divine title used in the New Testament is Father. Father, in Greek <em>Pater,</em> denotes that God as the Father is the origin, the source, of all the families of God&rsquo;s creatures (Eph. 3:15). In God&rsquo;s creation there are many families, such as the family of the angels, the family of mankind, and the family of the animals. The source, the Father, of these families is God.</p>
<p>Eventually, there is a particular family, the highest family, which is the household of the faith (Gal. 6:10). God is the Father, especially of the household of the faith, which is begotten of Him. We believers are a particular family. Actually, we are the genuine family because we were not only created by God as the Creator, the origin, the source, but also regenerated, begotten by God....We have a Father in life who regenerated us, who imparted His very life essence into us.</p>
<p>The Father is also called Abba (Aramaic) Father (Greek). In the Gospels, the Lord Jesus addressed God as Abba Father (Mark 14:36). The apostle Paul also told us we cry Abba, Father in the spirit of sonship (Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:6). <em>Abba Father</em> is an intensified expression of intimacy. When we say Father, this is sweet. When we say Abba, this is sweeter. But when we say Abba, Father, this is the sweetest.<sup>20</sup></p>
