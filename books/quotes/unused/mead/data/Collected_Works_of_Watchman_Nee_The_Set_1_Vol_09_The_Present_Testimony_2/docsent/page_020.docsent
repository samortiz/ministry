   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRINCIPLE OF BEING THE SECOND Issue No. 21 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:46-47; Gen 17:18-19; 25:23; Rom 9:12-13; Gen 48:18-19; 1 Sam 8:5; 16:1; 2 Sam 12:14, 24-25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The message that the Lord gives us this afternoon involves these few portions of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These verses show us a principle that God reveals in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The subject of today's message can be called "The Principle of Being the Second" or "The Law of Being the Second."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the portions that we have read, we can see that God chooses the second and not the first.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Corinthians 15:46-47 says that the first is earthy and the second is heavenly; the first is soulish and the second is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have often considered that it is an amazing thing in the Bible that God always chooses the second one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ishmael was the eldest son and older brother, and Isaac was the younger brother.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Yet God chose Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Esau was also the eldest son and older brother, and Jacob was the younger son and brother.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But God chose Jacob, not Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Manasseh was the first son, and Ephraim was the second; yet God chose Ephraim.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Bathsheba had two sons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God smote her first son and loved the second son, Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God loved Solomon so much that He sent the prophet Nathan to give him the name Jedidiah which means "Jehovah's beloved."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our Lord was born from this lineage according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From the Bible, therefore, we see that God always chooses the second and not the first.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God did not want the first king, Saul; He chose David, the second king.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God said that David was a man after His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why did God reject the older brother and prefer the younger?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why did God hate the first one and choose the second?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is what we have to find out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God not only deals with the Israelites and the believers in this way, He also deals with sinners in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Exodus, why did God want the Israelites to strike the blood on the side posts and on the upper doorpost for their firstborn?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why was the firstborn in danger and the secondborn not?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why did the Bible require the firstborn of the cattle and sheep to be redeemed, and if they were not redeemed, that their neck be broken?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Breaking the neck damages the central nervous system and results in death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why did the firstborn of the cattle and sheep need to be redeemed?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why did the secondborn of the cattle and sheep not need to be redeemed?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even the firstborn sons had to be redeemed, in addition to the firstborn of the cattle and sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The second son, however, did not need to be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the firstborn was not redeemed with a price, he was not counted as one of God's people and had to be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why was God displeased with the firstborn?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why were they not favored?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why were the second sons loved by God?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why was God gracious to them?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why did He also cherish them?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why did God make the whole tribe of Levi the price of redemption for the firstborn of Israel?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the number was short, why did He demand silver to fill up the number?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why did God reject the first son and choose the second son?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We know that the Bible is not a careless record.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The reason the Bible records things in a particular way reveals a very important principle, even though this principle may not be understood by many.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God does not do things in a haphazard way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He repeatedly acts this way because this is His way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All of His acts are controlled by His ways.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, if we can learn from this principle, we will greatly advance in our knowledge of God and spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What is the significance of God choosing the second and rejecting the first?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let us read 1 Corinthians 15:46, "But the spiritual is not first but the soulish, then the spiritual."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>While 1 Corinthians 15 primarily speaks about the resurrection of the body, our purpose in reading this passage is not to focus on the resurrection of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our focus is on the spiritual principle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to this portion of the Scripture, there is first a soulish body and then a spiritual body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The principle here is that everything that comes first is soulish while everything that comes second is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the reason that God chooses the one that comes second and rejects the one that comes first.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is the first?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In John 3:3, "Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then 3:6 says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord Jesus was speaking of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord said that it is not enough to be born once; a man must be born anew.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He said that only one birth is not sufficient; a man cannot see the kingdom of God in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But if he is born anew, he will have eternal life and be able to see the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Following this, the Lord Jesus explained that the first birth is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He also explained that the second birth is of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The first is everything that comes from our flesh, our natural birth, and what we possess at the time of our natural birth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The second is everything that is not of the flesh, that is born of the Spirit, and that comes as a result of the birth of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Let us consider the many things that are included in that which is born of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We inherit these things from our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They include our emotion, talent, intelligence, and all the meekness, humility, love, peace, decisiveness, patience, etc. that come from our natural birth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All the virtues that we possessed before we received the Spirit and were regenerated, and everything that others consider to be most desirable are included in the category which the Lord Jesus calls "that which is born of the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Brothers and sisters, we have to ask ourselves: Is everything that we have, after regeneration, born of God?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Or are there still things that are born of the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should not consider that only sinful and filthy things are born of the flesh and that they are the only things that need to be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should not consider our meekness, patience, loveliness, intelligence, and talent as things that we can retain and that do not need to pass through the process of being born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Do we realize that everything we can obtain and do and which can exist without the Holy Spirit, without believing in the Lord, or without trusting in God is inherited from the first?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Do we realize that they are from the flesh and from our parents?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All these things should be rejected and abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Only the things which we can obtain and acquire and which exist through the Holy Spirit, through believing in the Lord, and through trusting in God are pleasing to God; they are what God desires.</S>
