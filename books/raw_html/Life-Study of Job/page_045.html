JOB'S COMPLAINT AGAINST HIS FRIENDS<br>IN THEIR WRONG REPROACH<br>AND TOWARD GOD IN HIS SEVERE STRIPPING</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. His Complaint against His Friends<br>in Their Wrong Reproach</H2><P>In his complaint against his friends (19:1-5), Job asked them how long they would grieve his soul and crush him with their words. He said that they had reproached him ten times and that they were not ashamed to deal wrongly with him. He continued by saying that if he had erred, his error remained with him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. His Complaint toward God<br>in His Severe Stripping</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Saying That God Had Subverted His Cause</H2><P>Job complained that God had subverted his cause and had compassed him about with His net in violence and without justice (vv. 6-7). In his extreme sensitivity Job felt that God had treated him in this way, but surely God did not do such things to Job.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Saying That God Had Walled Up His Way</H2><P>Job went on to say that God had walled up his way so that he could not pass and that He had put darkness upon his paths (v. 8). I do not believe that God did either of these things to Job. Actually, it might have been Job himself who had walled up his way.</P>
