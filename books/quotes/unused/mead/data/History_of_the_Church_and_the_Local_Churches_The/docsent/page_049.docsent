   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Suffering from Others' Ambition for Position</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Nee also suffered from those who were ambitious for position.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because his health was not good, he often was not able to attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He worked on his publications and took care of the conferences, but mostly he could not take care of the meetings of the church on a regular basis.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He turned over the responsibility of all the meetings to me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I was new in the work, there was a brother among us who was very active and aggressive, expressing that he loved the Lord so much.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I appreciated that brother, and I asked him to give a message in one of the Lord's Day afternoon meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time we had three meetings on the Lord's Day in the morning, afternoon, and evening.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Nee found out about this and told me that I should not have asked that brother to give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I was wondering what was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Nee did not tell me at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, I came to know the situation with that brother.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was the third one to come into the church life in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second one was Dr. Yu, the eye specialist, and the first one was the brother who had been a postmaster.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These three brothers all came out of the China Inland Mission in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That was a strong reason why the Shanghai missionaries went against Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These three were the top ones who were gained by that mission.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From 1927 when this particular brother came into the church, he was always ambitious to be one of the elders, but he truly was not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was not that kind of person, so Brother Nee would not agree with his being a leading one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, in 1948 after he had been in the church life for twenty-one years, he left the church and caused a division.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He started a meeting in his home and hired a traveling preacher, similar to what Micah did in Judges 17 in hiring someone to be his priest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I saw a number of brothers who passed through the church life, expecting to receive some position.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brother Nee always told people that the church is not an organization with position but an organism with living members.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Anything that is positioned on a person's physical body, such as false teeth, is an inorganic item which is foreign to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nearly all the famous preachers among the Chinese who were around my age passed through the Lord's recovery in China.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They came and met with us for a while, expecting to receive some position in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually, they found out that there was no position for them, so they left and became opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brother Nee told us publicly that whoever desires a position in the church life will never get that position.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There was another brother among us who pretended to be the most spiritual person to fulfill his ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the beginning, nearly the whole church in Shanghai was fooled by this young brother, but gradually the "fox tails" came out, one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the responsible brothers believed that he was very spiritual, and some of them even felt shameful that they were not as spiritual as he was.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, however, this young man was exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The leading ones and the co-workers came to know that he was false, and they all agreed to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was ambitious, pretending to be something that he was not.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church called an urgent meeting, and the whole congregation came together.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this meeting one of the co-workers announced something concerning this brother's falsehood, and many others also stood up to condemn him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was condemned by the entire congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then he left and became another cause of division.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After he left, he was hired to be a teacher by the top women's seminary in China.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever trouble came among us, the "arrows" always went to Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was the target.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At that time none of the arrows came to me because I was not qualified to be the target.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I was under the protection of a big "umbrella," and that umbrella was Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes when people attacked him, they would highly appraise me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Within myself I realized their subtlety.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I realized that if Brother Nee were gone, their arrows would be shot at me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I want to say something for the sake of the young brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The ambition of the brothers is a problem in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is a shame to say this, but it is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This ambition caused Brother Nee much suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Brother Nee told us that no one ever gave him a position and that he had no position to give others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Eventually, those who were ambitious for position left.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some of the divisions were caused by this kind of ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The ambitious ones would never admit that they were ambitious.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When they caused a division, they did it with a certain excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They put on a "cloak" of a certain doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They would say that the church was wrong in this certain doctrine, and because they were clear about this they had to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This was altogether a pretense, an excuse, and a cloak for their ambition.</S>
