<h2 class="head1">II. THE DESTRUCTION OF THE THIRTY-ONE KINGS<br />
OF THE THIRTY-ONE NATIONS IN THE HILL COUNTRY<br />
AND THE LOWLAND WEST OF JORDAN</h2>
<p>Joshua 10:28&mdash;12:24 is a record of the destruction of the thirty-one kings of the thirty-one nations in the hill country and the lowland west of the Jordan, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon unto Mount Halak going up to Seir.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah, the God of Israel, Fighting for Israel</h2>
<p>Joshua 10:42 says that Joshua took all these kings and their lands at one time, &ldquo;for Jehovah, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.&rdquo; When certain other kings came together to fight with Israel, Jehovah said to Joshua, &ldquo;Do not be afraid because of them, for tomorrow at this time I will deliver all of them up slain before Israel&rdquo; (11:6a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. According to the Command<br />
of Moses the Servant of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Joshua took all the cities of these kings with their kings, struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them. This he did according to the command of Moses the servant of Jehovah (v. 12). Verse 15 says, &ldquo;As Jehovah had commanded Moses His servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did; he left nothing undone of all that Jehovah had commanded Moses.&rdquo; Therefore, Joshua took the whole land according to all that Jehovah had spoken to Moses (v. 23).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. According to God&rsquo;s Intention</h2>
<p>The destruction of the thirty-one kings of the thirty-one nations was according to God&rsquo;s intention. Concerning this, verse 20 says, &ldquo;It was of Jehovah to harden their heart to meet Israel in battle so that He might utterly destroy them and that they might not receive mercy but be destroyed as Jehovah commanded Moses.&rdquo; From this we see that God&rsquo;s intention was not to have mercy on these kings but to destroy them.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Israel Burning None of the Cities<br />
That Stood on Their Mounds except Hazor</h2>
<p>Verse 13 says that Israel burned none of the cities that stood on their mounds except Hazor.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Some of the Anakim<br />
Being Left in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod</h2>
<p>Some of the Anakim were left in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod (v. 22; cf. Num. 13:33).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE DESTRUCTION OF HESHBON<br />
UNDER KING SIHON<br />
AND BASHAN UNDER KING OG EAST OF THE JORDAN</h2>
<p>Joshua 12:1-6 speaks of the destruction of Heshbon under King Sihon and Bashan under King Og east of the Jordan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. By Moses and the Children of Israel</h2>
<p>The destruction of Heshbon and Bashan was by Moses and the children of Israel (v. 6a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Before Israel&rsquo;s Crossing of Jordan</h2>
<p>This destruction took place before Israel&rsquo;s crossing of Jordan (v. 1a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Given by Moses to the Tribes of Reuben<br />
and Gad and the Half-tribe of Manasseh</h2>
<p>The land of Heshbon under King Sihon and of Bashan under King Og was given by Moses to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh (v. 6b).</p>
