   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCED WORKERS VERSUS LANGUAGE THEORISTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Accurate translation requires more than a knowledge of the two languages in question.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There must be an understanding as well.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose, for example, you have a doctorate in language.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You are asked to translate a manual for a computer you have never seen before.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You read the manual and understand all the words, but you still have no idea how to make the computer work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The technical terms mean nothing to you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You need the help of the one who is experienced in operating the machine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He may not be very familiar with the manual, but he knows the machine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you and he work together, you can come up with quite an accurate translation of the manual.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those seven Western scholars are like the one asked to translate the manual.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their educational background, both in the biblical languages and in Chinese, was superior.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their Chinese assistants were also scholars in their own right.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In spite of such rich literary knowledge, however, they did not know the machine they were working with!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are the simple workers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Though lacking their background, we have been operating this machine for more than fifty years!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we looked at the manual they put out, even while appreciating their scholarship, we laughed at some of their renderings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From our experience we knew that Romans 8:16, for example, must refer to the spirit, not the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We were forced to track down the meaning of the original.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This meant learning a little Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We began to check the reference works too and found out that the Greek word in Romans 8:16 was pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we looked up the word heart, as in 2 Corinthians 3:16, "The veil is upon their heart."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We found out that this word is cardia.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is inadmissible to translate these two different words as though they meant the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In scholarly background and literary style we cannot match those who did the Chinese version; but by the Lord's grace, as far as experience is concerned, we have been touching this machine for many years and are more or less familiar with how it works!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>JOHN 7:39</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Another example of a problem verse is John 7:39: "But this He said concerning the Spirit, Whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Chinese translation of this verse again adds "Holy" before the word Spirit and, like the King James Version, has "was not yet given."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the time of the incarnation, the angel told Mary that the Holy Spirit would come upon her Luke 1:35; cf. also Matt 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the Holy Spirit came upon Mary, why thirty-three years later was the Holy Spirit "not yet given"?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Again, the translators of the Chinese Bible betrayed their inadequate understanding of the Spirit; because of their unfamiliarity with the machine, they misunderstood the manual and therefore mistranslated some of the terms.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ was speaking of the Spirit; it was the Spirit who was not yet, because the Lord had not yet been resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To some of you these words may sound strange.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Are not the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit three in one?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What does the term "the Spirit" mean?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Am I adding a fourth one to the Trinity?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Or, am I saying there were only two in the Trinity until the resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By no means!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thirty years ago we saw this light concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We saw that when the Lord Jesus arose from the dead, He became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Scripture clearly tells us that the last Adam, who is the Lord Jesus, became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Surely this Spirit cannot be one thing and the Holy Spirit another!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For many years I was groping to come to an understanding of this matter of the Spirit and particularly of John 7:39.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To change the translation of the Bible because we do not understand it is inexcusable.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even with the correct translation, however, I still was not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible is God's revelation; it is to be expected that we would find some parts hard to grasp.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To know the Bible only from a literary or linguistic point of view is to remain in ignorance of its true content.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For many things in the Bible, we need God's enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather than lean to our own understanding, we must seek to experience what the Word says.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Year after year I would keep asking the Lord, What is this matter of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why does the Word say, "The Spirit was not yet"?</S>
