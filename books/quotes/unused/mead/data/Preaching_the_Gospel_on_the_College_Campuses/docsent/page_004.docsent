   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In contrast, I have to point out the shortcomings of the present situation in the charismatic movement.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In charismatic meetings, they sometimes use rock music, dramas, and all kinds of performances to attract people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are all gimmicks.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The use of these gimmicks shows that the power of the Spirit is lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we have the real power of the Spirit, we do not need any gimmicks.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The early disciples did not use any gimmicks, but they had power Acts 1:8; 4:33; 6:8, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the island of Taiwan, no Christian work can compare or compete with the work of the Lord's recovery in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is no use of gimmicks, but the power of the Spirit is there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The power of the Spirit is based upon Christ's accomplished work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The crucifixion of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, the ascension of Christ, and the baptism in the Holy Spirit have been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These are all accomplished facts in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are going to receive Christ's redemption accomplished through His death on the cross, we do not need to fast and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We just need to exercise our faith to believe in His accomplished redemption according to the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can say, "Lord, thank You for Your accomplished work of redemption and for Your resurrection and ascension."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we say this by faith according to the written Word of God, we get redemption, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same way, we should exercise our faith to say, "Lord, thank You for the baptism in the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The gospel is constituted with the person and work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to believe that Christ in His person is both God and man to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ's work includes His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and His baptism of His Body in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These are the basic and crucial items of the gospel that we must believe in. The power of the Spirit is based upon Christ's person and His accomplished work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should exercise our spirit to say, "Praise the Lord for the baptism in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This baptism is mine, and I am right now in this baptism."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should go to the campus with this faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regardless of how we feel, we should only care for the accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The baptism in the Spirit has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit today is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is like the air.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not need to fast and pray to experience the air.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just as the air is in us and we are in the air, so the Spirit is in us and we are in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit is here for us to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit is here because the crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension have all been accomplished, and the Spirit has been poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 , and according to Revelation 5:6 the Spirit has been intensified sevenfold and sent into the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We do not need to fast and pray to experience the baptism in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, we should believe in and claim this accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some may argue and say that Peter and the disciples fasted and prayed for ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is true.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, they fasted and prayed before Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost, the disciples simply exercised their faith to get into the baptism of the Spirit whenever there was a need Acts 4:8, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When you go to the campus, exercise your faith to speak and work in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Any proposal to use gimmicks to preach the gospel is a strong proof that we have not exercised our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If I only exercised my mentality in the speaking of my messages, my speaking would be poor.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I must exercise my spirit to believe that I am in the baptism in the Spirit and that the Lord will speak through me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You do not need any gimmicks to preach the gospel, but you do need to deal with your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You do not need to fast and pray, but you do need to open yourself to the Lord and have a renewed consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every day when you go to the campus, you have to say, "Lord, I consecrate myself to You and open up myself anew to You.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Cleanse me from all my sins with Your prevailing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thank You that You are the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am in You, and You are within me."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Make a thorough confession and apply the blood to all your situations.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then exercise your faith to believe that the Spirit is in you and that you are in the Spirit, under the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you do this, you will have such a bold faith, and when you go to the campuses, you will see the difference.</S>
