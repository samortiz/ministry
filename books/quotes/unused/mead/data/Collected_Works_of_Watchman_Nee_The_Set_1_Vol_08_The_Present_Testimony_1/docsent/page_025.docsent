   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRESENTING OF THE BODY Issue No. 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 12:1 says, "I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We can see from this verse that the apostle exhorts the believers to present their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He could command, but he would rather exhort, because if the presenting of our bodies is not willingly done, it will never work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even if it works, it will be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this verse, the apostle did not ask the believers to present their spirits or their souls, but their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is the reason for this?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here we see the importance of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The presenting of the body is "well pleasing to God."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although God does not deal with man directly through his body, He takes up man's spirit as His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He never despises man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although the spirit is the most important part, the body also has its place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although believers should allow the Spirit to take precedence over everything, this does not mean that we should ignore our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After we have seen how much God cares for the intuition, fellowship, and conscience of the spirit, we may easily have a wrong concept that God does not care for the body, and that the body only does us harm.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may also think that as long as the life in our spirit is strengthened and filled with power, we can ignore the outward body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, God does not view it this way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although He cares very much for the life in our spirit, He realizes that the salvation of His Son must also reach the outermost part of our being, our body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The effect of salvation is incomplete if it does not reach our body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, the presenting of our bodies is the presenting of our entire being, because the body mentioned in this verse represents the totality of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The believer's spirit belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no need to present this part anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the believer's soul and body are still estranged from God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, they must be presented.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although here it mentions the body only, without mentioning the soul, in reality the soul is included as well, because our body now is closely interwoven with the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why the Bible calls the body "a soulish body" 1 Cor 15:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To present the body is to present everything that a person has in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's purpose involves not only our inward man, but also our outward man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In fellowshipping with God, only the inward man is needed; the outward man is useless in this respect.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But in other things, the importance of the outward man cannot be neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Otherwise, the Holy Spirit would not have made such a call here.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What is the real meaning of presenting our body?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is to work for the Lord and to live for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must pay attention to the word body before we can understand the meaning in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is a great difference between the body and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The body is a matter of time and space, while the spirit is a not a matter of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The body is outward and, therefore, is particularly related to the outward matters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The presenting of the body is naturally the presenting of time and space because the body is of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is the presenting of everything that is in contact with the natural realm.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The presenting of the body means nothing less than working for the Lord and living for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Of the two, living for the Lord is more important.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people think that living for the Lord is working for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But there is a great difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A man can work for the Lord without living for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But all those who live for the Lord are working for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The meaning of living for the Lord is to give no time to any seeking for oneself, but to give all of one's time to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the meaning of living for the Lord, not working for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Holy Spirit is now calling the believers to present their bodies to live for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now we can consider the meaning of Romans 12:1.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"Brothers" refers to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The presenting of the body is based on God's compassions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because God has graced and loved us, we should present our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This matches 2 Corinthians 5:14-15, which says, "For the love of Christ constrains us...that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What is the purpose of presenting the body?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is to be "a living sacrifice."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All sacrifices are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But God wants our bodies to be a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All the bodies of the sacrifices in the Old Testament were presented to the altar dead.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But God wants our bodies to be presented as a living sacrifice to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that we live in death.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are to be presented as a dead sacrifice for as long as we live.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This kind of sacrifice is "holy, well pleasing to God."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Through the compassions of God, this becomes a "reasonable service."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Brothers, since God has gained the ground within us, He requires that we also present to Him everything outward.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Since He lives in our spirit, He is waiting also for us to present our bodies to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Since we have life by Him, let us also live for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Since our spirit has been renewed, He desires that our bodies would also be fully committed to His hands so that our renewed spirit will have the cooperation of a body in full agreement.</S>
