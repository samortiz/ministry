<H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(e) Rich in Wine and Milk</H2><P>Verse 11 says, "Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes." This verse is extremely difficult to understand. In the Bible an ass, or donkey, signifies one who labors very hard, especially laboring in the matter of transportation. Even the Lord Jesus rode upon an ass into the city of Jerusalem (Matt. 21:5, 7). Although an ass is usually used for labor in travel, in verse 11 the ass is not laboring; it is bound to the vine. This signifies that labor was over, that the destination has been reached, and that the rest has begun. Do not think that the word "binding" in this verse is negative. No, it is very positive. Any ass used for long journeys would certainly enjoy being bound to a vine. Whenever a rider binds an ass to something, even to a stake, the ass will be happy. In the poetic language of verse 11, the binding of the ass depicts rest. According to this verse, even the donkey has stopped his work. The ass here is not bound to a stake, but to a fruitful vine full of vegetation.</P><P>If we consider this picture, we shall see that it signifies that labor is over and that the harvest has come. We know that this verse refers to the harvest because it speaks of wine, the produce of the vine. This implies the riches of the harvest. The latter part of verse 11 says, "He washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes." This indicates that there is an abundance of wine. The supply of wine is so bountiful that people not only drink it, but even wash their clothes in it. Revelation 6:6, speaking of famine, says, "Do not harm the oil and the wine." This warning indicates the scarceness of wine during famine. However, in Genesis 49:11 there is an abundance of wine. The words "the blood of grapes" refer to grape juice. Have you ever seen a country with such riches that its inhabitants even washed their clothes in grape juice? Although America is a rich land, it is not that rich. What a picture we have in verse 11! This picture shows that labor is over and that rest in the enjoyment of the riches has begun, even for the donkeys. Now is not the time for sowing the seed; it is the time of harvest. Verse 11 is a poetic description of the millennium, the coming age of the thousand years. In that age, labor will cease, and instead of labor, there will be rest. If you still choose to labor, you should bind your ass. Do not loose it. According to Leviticus 23, on the day of the feast of Tabernacles, no one was permitted to work. Labor was prohibited because everything had been accomplished. All that remained was to enjoy the produce of the rich harvest. The feast of Tabernacles typifies the millennium. During the millennium there will be no labor because all the labor will have been completed in the preceding dispensations. The asses, the laboring ones, will be bound. Instead of labor, there will be the rich enjoyment of an abundant harvest. There will be so much wine that we shall wash our clothes in it.</P><P>Verse 12 says, "His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk." In the Bible wine symbolizes the joy of God's salvation of life. The first miracle the Lord Jesus performed was that of changing water into wine (John 2:1-11). This wine signifies not only redemption, but also the salvation of life and the salvation in life. When we have the salvation of life, this salvation becomes the wine that constantly stirs us to rejoice. Along with the wine, we have milk. Just as the source of the wine is the vineyards, the source of the milk is the sheepfolds spoken of in verse 14 (Heb.). Milk signifies the nourishment of life that satisfies us.</P><P>When someone is dying of starvation, the area around his eyes becomes greenish grey. But in this verse the eyes are not greenish grey; they are "red with wine." Furthermore, the teeth are "white with milk." The calcium contained in milk produces healthy teeth with the proper color. These figures regarding the eyes and the teeth indicate that, when the asses are bound and labor is over, the produce of the rich harvest will be more than sufficient. It will be so adequate that people will even wash their clothes in wine. Eventually they will have eyes that are red with wine. Also, their teeth will be strong and white.</P><P>This rest and enjoyment depend on Christ as the fighting, resting, and producing lion. As such a lion, He has brought forth us, His baby lions. Because the work has been accomplished, there is no need for us to labor. Instead, we should simply rest and enjoy the rich produce of the good land. Today we are enjoying the wine and the milk. Whenever people look at us, our eyes should be red and our teeth white. This is a picture of the church life today and of the millennium in the coming age.</P><P>Even in today's church life, all the asses should be bound. Often the brothers and sisters bring a laboring ass with them to the meeting. This indicates that they are still laboring and journeying and that they have not yet come to their goal, their destination. But all these asses must be bound. Because we have already entered into rest and have come to our destination, there should be no laboring or journeying. We have reached our destination, our goal, the place where we can enjoy the boundless supply of wine and milk. Do you still need a laboring donkey? Some of the older ones always have a donkey with them. It seems they are still journeying, still laboring. After hearing one of my messages, they expect to labor and journey even more. But verse 11 says that we must bind our ass to the rich vine. This means that we must cease our laboring and our journeying. Today, in the church life, we are in the goal, the destination. Here there is no labor, only rest and enjoyment. I expect to see all the asses bound. Instead of laboring, go home to wash your clothes in wine. Then come to the next meeting with red eyes and white teeth. Come full of milk, full of joy and nourishment.</P>
