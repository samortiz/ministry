On the other hand, organically, the church of God is constituted with the God-regenerated people in the divine life. This organic aspect issues in the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23).</li>	<li>God’s organic salvation needs to be maintained constantly through God’s judicial redemption:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>When the believers’ fellowship with God is interrupted due to their sins, it can be restored through the redeeming blood of Christ—1 John 1:6-7.</li>		<li>When the believers have a case against them before God because of their sinning, Christ, their Redeemer, is responsible for undertaking their case in His status as their Advocate in heaven before God—1 John 2:1-2.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The believers’ ultimate transfiguration in their body to enter into God’s glory is the redemption of their body (Eph. 4:30; Rom. 8:23), implying the element of redemption, because regardless of how spiritual, renewed, and transformed the believers are, their body still belongs to the old creation and therefore still needs God’s judicial redemption that it may receive God’s organic salvation and be transfigured to enter into glory (Phil. 3:21; Rom. 8:30).</li>	<li>God’s judicial redemption as the procedure is purposeless without God’s organic salvation. It would be merely for sinners to be redeemed, have their sins forgiven, and become righteous people justified by God, but the purpose is unclear to the majority of believers who mistakenly consider their going to heaven as the purpose of their being redeemed and are unaware that, according to the revelation of the holy Scriptures, God’s judicial redemption as the procedure is with God’s organic salvation as the purpose, which is to regenerate us, shepherd us, sanctify us dispositionally, renew us, transform us, and build us up into the Body of Christ, which ultimately consummates the New Jerusalem as the ultimate purpose of God’s organic salvation to be God’s enlargement and expression in eternity.</li>	</ol></li></ol>
