There is nothing as vital or as basic to our Christian life and to the church life as the real, practical enjoyment of Christ
Colossians 1:12 says, 'Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light'
In the King James Version the word 'portion' is translated as inheritance, but portion is the proper meaning of the Greek word
God is invisible , yet Christ is the image, the very expression, the explanation, and definition, of the invisible God
Through Him' indicates that Christ is the active instrument through which the creation of all things was processed
How much do we enjoy Him as a portion with God embodied in Him or as a portion with God expressed through Him?
Colossians 2:6-7 says, 'As therefore you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him'
Although the words mentioned in these verses are simple, the thought conveyed reveals many mysteries which are difficult to understand
We should also realize that if He were not the life-giving Spirit, He could not be subjective to us, realized by us, or enjoyed by us
If we are to enjoy Christ, to experience Christ in a practical and real way, we have to know and realize that Christ is such a Spirit
On the one hand, 1 Corinthians says that God has made Christ wisdom to us: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
The practical way for us to enjoy this Christ is to realize that He is such a living Spirit waiting for us to contact Him
He is the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our human spirit, and these two spirits have been mingled together as one spirit
When we are in spirit, we view things one way, and when we are out of the spirit, we view the same things differently
Some would say in a very natural way that we have to trust in the Lord and pray that the Lord would comfort us and grant us His peace within
When we are depressed or 'out of it,' there is no need for us to get out of the spirit because we are out of the spirit already
If we consider our daily walk, day by day, from morning to evening, we will realize that we are often not in the spirit
When we turn to our spirit immediately we are clear about things and we have the guidance the peace the patience and the inner anointing
Rather we prefer to remain in our mind with our considerations asking the Lord to help us in this matter and to do this or that thing for us
When we are in the spirit, we have a certain point of view; when we are in our mind, we have another point of view
We are the same persons with the same environment, yet how we are depends upon where we are-in the spirit or in the mind
The practical way to enjoy Christ is to simply turn yourself to the spirit all the time, remaining there to contact the Lord
Simply remain in the spirit to contact Him, looking to Him, thanking Him, praising Him, adoring Him, and worshipping Him
Romans 8:9-10 says, 'But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you
In Romans 8:10 the Christ who was put on the cross, resurrected from the dead, and ascended to the heavens is in us
In addition, Romans 8:9-10 reveals three divine titles: the Spirit of God , the Spirit of Christ , and Christ Himself
There is the need to combine these books because both of them reveal that Christ Himself is our divine portion
Corinthians tells us that Christ, the portion allotted to us, is our wisdom as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
The regeneration of our spirit has been accomplished through the righteousness of God which is just Christ Himself
Christ is regeneration to our spirit, Christ is the transformation to our soul, and Christ is the transfiguration to our body
The New Testament shows four main items concerning Christ what He is what He has accomplished what He has obtained and what He has attained
All of what Christ is, has accomplished, has obtained, and has attained has been concentrated into the life-giving Spirit
We may often have the human concept that formerly Christ was on the earth and that now He is in the heavens sitting at the right hand of God
When we preach the gospel of Christ, we must realize that at the very moment we are preaching, Christ is present
In Romans 10:6-8 the unbelievers do not need to go to the heavens to bring Christ down or to Hades to bring Christ up
The Christ we believe in is a real, living Person, who is the life-giving Spirit; He is not a system of religion or a set of teachings
All of what Christ is, has accomplished, obtained, and attained is concentrated into this one life-giving Spirit
To be saved does not mean to improve our conduct or adjust our behavior; rather, it means that we must deny our soul
That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit'
Although many brothers say that they are in Christ, they also testify that they have a lot of condemnation within
The reason for this condemnation is that they are walking in the soul according to flesh and not walking in the spirit, according to spirit
We have the doctrine and teaching about Romans 5-8, but how much enjoyment of what is taught about Christ in these chapters do we have?
In the morning, you may be upset with a certain brother, but after a few minutes, you really love that brother
If we would learn to do this one thing and practice it all the time, we will see a change, a difference, in our daily life
Turn yourself to the spirit regardless of where you are, what you are doing, or what kind of situation you are in
If you turn to the spirit, you have peace, light, the inner anointing, and whatever you desire to enjoy of Christ
Learn to turn to your spirit not only in the time of prayer but also before saying anything before going any place and before doing anything
There will be a change in your understanding, you will enjoy Christ, and you will be in Christ in a practical way
In the Gospel of John, the Gospel of life, the Lord Jesus said that He came that we may have life and have it abundantly
While other things are mentioned by the Lord Jesus in the Gospel of John, none are as vital or as basic as these six items
The practical way to enjoy Christ as all these items is in our mingled spirit, which is our human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit
On the day of resurrection, He returned to the disciples, breathing into them and saying, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
Where the disciples were, He was because He had become the life-giving Spirit, and as the Spirit He had breathed Himself into them
Today there may be hundreds of chapters as a continuation of this Gospel because Jesus is still here within us as the life-giving Spirit
Our human spirit has been born of the divine Spirit, and we must worship God, who is Spirit, in our human spirit
If we are to deal with God, contact God, enjoy God, and partake of God, we must contact Him in our spirit, exercising our spirit
God is Spirit, and this God includes Christ as our life, our food, our water, our air, our light, and our abode
If He had not been transfigured into the Spirit, there would be no possibility for us to abide in Him or for Him to abide in us
In order to come into us, He had to be transfigured from the flesh to the Spirit through death and resurrection
Regardless of how much knowledge we have, or how much we read the Scriptures, as long as we are out of the spirit, we are in darkness
On the other hand if we turn to the spirit and remain there immediately we will sense the light and everything will be clear and transparent
Most of the time when we have problems, we exercise the mind to solve them or we go to other people to help us solve them
Christ, the living Lord, is so real; He is the dynamic center of the Christian life because He is the life-giving Spirit
We all must learn not to take care of so many outward things, but we must learn to turn to the spirit all the time
We often need troubles, trials, and painful sufferings, things we cannot get through, to force us to give up and turn back to the Lord
When we read the Bible, it is a good practice to read a little bit, maybe half a verse, and then say a little word to the Lord
The best way to read the Bible is not merely to read, solely exercising our mind, but to read a little and then say something to the Lord
Many who have experienced the so-called gifts of the Spirit have said that they were watered through the practice of the gifts
The more we turn ourselves to the spirit and remain there to contact the Lord, the more we will sense that He is the exhaustless One
As we turn to our spirit, we sense a flowing and springing up within which waters us, and spontaneously we will water others
As we do this we will sense that we are being nourished, satisfied, and strengthened, having something of Christ ministered into us
Many Christians do not have a time with the Lord, and many of those who desire to be with the Lord, do so in a wrong way
If we learn to turn to our spirit, the whole church will be turned, and there will be a great change in the church life
When you are abiding in Him and He is abiding in you , you have the sense that you are one with Him, mingled with Him
Our abiding in Him and His abiding in us are a mystery, yet this mutual abiding is a fact, a reality, to be experienced by us
We must learn one thing and pay our full attention to this one thing, that is, to always turn back to the spirit
Corinthians is a foundation for the book of 2 Corinthians; therefore, 2 Corinthians is much deeper than 1 Corinthians
Christ has been made such a portion to us as the life-giving Spirit that we may contact Him through and by our spirit
The Lord Spirit may be considered a compound title indicating strongly that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Lord Christ
The condition among many in Christianity is not very powerful because there is too much knowledge apart from the living Person of Christ
As human beings, before we were regenerated, we were born and raised by our parents to live by ourselves, that is, by the life in our soul
God's salvation is Christ Himself with redemption, forgiveness, justification, regeneration, and many other items
Many teachings in Christianity focus on different aspects of human life, yet neglect the central aspect of living by Christ
In 2 Corinthians Paul does not refer to them as the soul and the spirit, but as the outer man and the inner man
Of referring to the soul and spirit as mere parts within the human being, he referred to them as two men-the outer man and the inner man
The unbelievers, who do not have Christ in them as their life, do not have the controversy between the outer man and the inner man
Christ has been laid as a foundation within our being, but we are not in agreement with the structure to be built upon that foundation
Now if we are going to build upon this foundation, our outer man must be consumed that we may live not by the outer man but by the inner man
God's intention is that we would put our natural life, the soul-life, aside all of the day and take Christ as our life to live by today
Regardless of the circumstances, our need is to learn to live, move, behave, and have our being by Christ, not by our self
In 2 Corinthians the treasure, the power, and the grace are Christ Himself, who is so precious, sufficient, powerful, and near to us
