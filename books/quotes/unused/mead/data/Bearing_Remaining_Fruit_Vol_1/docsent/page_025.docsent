   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING TO PRESENT THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCISELY TO OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We can apply the above matters practically in the following way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever we fellowship in a home meeting, we must release our spirit every time we open our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever our spirit is released, we are not shy or fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can compare this to a basketball game.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once the players get onto the field, they forget about heaven, earth, and even their own name.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The only thing they know is to win the game.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By being this way, they will surely win.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Likewise, our spirit must be released.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, before we go to lead a home meeting, we should have adequate prayer so that we will be bold in the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the same time, we should also exercise to be equipped with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we exercise well enough, everything will become easy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all should take heed to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not only the young brothers and sisters but also the middle-aged and older ones should endeavor to exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the biggest lack in all of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are many people who love and seek the Lord, but very few know how to lead others and what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is due to the lack of exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I hope we can be strengthened in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The foremost thing is that we need to know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is like teaching mathematics; if we are not good in mathematics, it is very difficult to teach it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The truth that we must know is first the truth concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should help others to know the church in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we teach others, we need to make everything simple.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Again we can compare this to a coach teaching his players.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The coach first needs to teach them the basic movements, expecting that they would practice these basic matters thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When they play on the field, they do not need to perform every move that the coach taught them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They need only to apply them with flexibility according to the real situation with the goal of shooting the ball into the basket.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I hope we all understand these two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On one side, we need to know and be equipped with the truth; on the other side, we need to speak the truth in a simplified and concise way, presenting it clearly to the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can take the meaning of church as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church is God s called-out assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In any place that there are believers like you and me coming together, there is God s called-out assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the first meaning of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If there is a need to explain the Greek text, we can simply mention that the word church in Greek means the called-out assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to avoid difficulties, however, do not be overly concerned with using Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Second, the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everyone has a body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all know that our human body is a composition and that it is not a lifeless organization.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, it is a living organism.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The principle of the Body of Christ is the same as that of the organic members of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The key concept is the life within the body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Like our human body, the church as the organic Body of Christ is full of life within.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The life of the Body of Christ is the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the other hand, a person s body is for expressing him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a person has only a head but not a body, he has no expression.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The body functions with the head to be an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church is the organic expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, the church is the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Fullness is an overflow.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If something does not overflow, it cannot be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once it overflows, the overflow becomes an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>ABANDONING THE SECTS</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every saved one should abandon the sects.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sects are parties which are formed into divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>During earlier years in mainland China, some Christian groups liked to use the word denomination, as in the Baptist denomination and the Presbyterian denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Later the Lord raised up the churches in the Lord s recovery as a testimony that denominations are a party formed into a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Galatians 5:19-20 says that sects are the work of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Paul condemns sects in 1 Corinthians 1, and God Himself condemns them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since we blew the trumpet concerning sects, mainland China has been affected, and it is still affected to this today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now many Christian groups no longer call themselves denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although the word denomination sounds good on the surface, in reality it is condemned by many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, they are not willing to use this term today.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Why should Christians not have sects?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>First, it is because Christ is not divided.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We believe in one Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ is the unique One in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Christ is the universal One and the eternal One.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is not divided, He cannot be divided, and He should not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Paul asked the divisive ones, Is Christ divided?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>1 Cor 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The answer certainly is in the negative: No, Christ is not divided.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Since Christ is not divided, we who believe into Him also should not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Second, the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Everyone has only one body; the body of every human is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A person with two bodies would be a monster.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Likewise, the Body of Christ is also unique.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In Ephesians 4:4 Paul said, One Body, in which is one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In this light we see that the Body is unique, and Christ cannot be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Body of Christ, which is the church, is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, there is no ground, and there should be no ground for division.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Third, to divide Christians into religious sects is the work of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Galatians 5:19 says that the fruit, the works, of the flesh are manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then Paul lists several items, one of which is sects.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Where do sects come from?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Verse 20 connects three things: factions, divisions, and sects.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Initially there are factions and then divisions, which issue in the formation of sects.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is the condition of the whole of Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Without the shining of the light, people proudly claim that they belong to a certain group.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Once the light shines, however, they see that these so-called groups are sects, which are condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Sects are indicated in 1 Corinthians 1.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The church in Corinth was an early church, raised up around A.D. 50.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>By the time 1 Corinthians was written, it was already in a condition of division.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This means that shortly after this church was established, it was divided into different groups.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>What was the basis of their divisions?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The divisions were according to the persons who led them.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Some preferred Paul, so they were of Paul; some preferred Cephas, so they were of Cephas; and some preferred Apollos, so they were of Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Thus, the church was divided into at least three groups.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Still others said that those were wrong and that Christ was best, so they were of Christ; eventually four groups were formed.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>In rebuking them, Paul seemed to say, Is Christ divided?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Why do you say that you are of Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Was Paul crucified for you?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>It was not I who was crucified for you; it was Christ who was crucified for you.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>No, you all were baptized into the name of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Therefore, none of you should be of me.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Then in 3:21-22 Paul seemed to tell them, Do not say that you are of me.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Rather, I, Paul, am yours, for all things are yours, including me.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Paul strictly condemned the sects.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In 1:10 Paul said, That there be no divisions among you, and in Titus 3:10 he also said, A factious man, after a first and second admonition, refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>He pointed out clearly that we should reject and not encourage or promote factions.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>As a result, there should not be factions among Christians; that is, there should be no sects.</S>
