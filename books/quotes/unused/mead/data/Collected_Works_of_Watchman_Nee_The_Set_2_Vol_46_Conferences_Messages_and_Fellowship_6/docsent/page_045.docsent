   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETY-THREE FOUR KINDS OF DISCIPLINE Scripture Reading: Matt 18:15-20; Titus 1:13; 2:15; 1 Cor 5:2-8; 2 Tim 3:1-5, 16; John 15:1-2; Rom 16:17; Gal 6:1; Heb 3:6; 2 Thes 3:6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Timothy 3:16 says, "All Scripture is God-breathed."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The object of Scripture is fourfold: "for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In reading these words we cannot help but notice that the purposes for which the Scripture has been given are chiefly negative.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The negative element outweighs the positive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates the corruption of the human heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The tendency in man is always to go astray, so there is the constant need of correction to bring him back to the way of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man does wrong continually, so he has to be dealt with continually.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes God deals with His children through circumstances, sometimes through His Word, and sometimes through His other children.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today we shall consider four different ways of discipline: 1 discipline by the brothers; 2 discipline by the fathers; 3 discipline by the Son; and 4 individual discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In contemplating the matter of discipline, a thought immediately presents itself: How totally out of place it is for one sinner to discipline another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The more we realize our failures and weaknesses, the more we are convinced that we are altogether unsuited for this task.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet we have to admit that God has committed this very thing to man, which by nature, he is so unqualified for.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before looking further into this subject, let this fact be clearly established: We are weak, utterly weak, and in ourselves we do not have the status to discipline our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we have any part or lot in this ministry of correction, we can never exercise it on the ground of our superiority over those we seek to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The only difference between them and us is that our sin has been dealt with by the grace of God, while theirs has not.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We deal with them in the hope that grace may be shown to them as it has been shown to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE DISCIPLINE BY THE BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Matthew 18:15 shows that the first mode of discipline is that of a brother dealing with a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should note that the one who is exercising the discipline is the offended party.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not a case of one brother wronging another brother, and a third party taking up the case.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No, if your brother offends you, you are the one who is appointed to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the vital question is: How are you going to do it?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On what ground are you going to discipline him?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You can only discipline him on the ground of brotherhood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Your attitude toward him should be one of a brother dealing with a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a brother offends me, there are two ways of dealing with the situation that are according to convenience: I can either lose my temper and vent my wrath on him, or I can forgive him and forget the whole affair.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Getting angry with him is a very simple matter, and forgiving him is also a very simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, both of these ways are far too cheap and easy, and neither of them is the God-appointed way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If I simply flare up at my brother, I am treating him as an enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If I simply gloss the matter over, I am treating him as a stranger.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In neither case am I treating him as a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the first case I am putting myself in a distant relationship to him; in the second case I am putting myself in a superior position to him, that is, I am making myself magnanimous by pardoning him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is not helped any more in this way than in the previous way, because the trouble is not disposed of; it is only covered over.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When he sees me he will remember that he wronged me, and when I see him I will remember that I have forgiven him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We naturally think that passing over an offense committed against us is a sign of strength; as a matter of fact, it is a sign of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is a weakness to treat such a matter as though it did not exist; it is a strength to face it squarely and deal with it fully.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How then should such a matter be dealt with?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should treat it exactly as we would had the offense been committed against another and not against ourselves, that is, we should deal with this case as though we were a third party.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should take our brother aside and seek to point out his fault.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nevertheless, our attitude should not be that of the offended party bringing a charge against the offending party, but of brother dealing with brother for the specific purpose of gaining him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"You have gained your brother" Matt 18:15 is the goal before us in all discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If our brother responds, then we have gained him; if he fails to respond, then we should take two or three other brothers with us and seek him out again.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Remember, in taking two or three witnesses, our attitude should still be the same as it was the first time, that of seeking to win our brother, not of seeking to win a case.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If on this second occasion he is still unresponsive, then bring the matter before the whole assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, we should still seek to gain him as a brother, not as bringing a charge against him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If he refuses to listen to the church, then we should treat him "just like the Gentile and the tax collector" Matt 18:17 , because refusing to heed the church is refusing to heed the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This does not imply excommunication; it merely means that the offending brother is ignored.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even at this stage of the brother's discipline, judgment is not an end, but merely a means to the end. The end is the brother's restoration.</S>
