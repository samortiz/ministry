   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Wave Offering</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the sprinkling of the blood, there was the wave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must remember that when the second ram was slain, its blood was put on the ear, the thumb, and the toe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is still not consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is just the basis of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The sprinkling of the blood is merely a confession of love and of right.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It qualifies us for consecration, but the actual consecration comes after this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the second ram was slain and its blood was sprinkled, the fat and the right shoulder right thigh were taken, and out of the basket, an unleavened cake, a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer were also taken.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All these things signify the two aspects of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The shoulder is the strong part, showing us the divine aspect of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Fat is rich, signifying the aspect of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Bread is of the vegetable life, showing us His highest humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is the perfect man, who is unleavened and unblemished.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is full of the anointing oil, being filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Like a wafer, His nature, the sentiments in His heart, and His spiritual insight are fine, tender, and fragile, being full of feeling and compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All of these things were placed in the hands of Aaron, who took them and waved them before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After this they were burned with the burning of the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here we need some explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Hebrew word consecration means "to have one's hands filled."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Both Darby's translation and Young's concordance refer to this meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Initially the hands were empty, now they are filled.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Aaron's hands were filled with so many things, he was filled with the Lord and there was consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Aaron's hands were empty, there was no consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Aaron's hands were filled and his hands could no longer hold anything except the Lord, there was consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What then is consecration?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God demanded that the household of Aaron serve Him as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But Aaron could not come presumptuously.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, his sins had to be taken care of, and then he had to be accepted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His hands denoting work had to be full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He had to have nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only then was there consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is consecration?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Simply put, consecration is, as Paul said, "I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service" Rom 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before the Lord, we need to see that in this life there is only one way for us to take, that is, serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Serving God is our only way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to serve God, we have to present our entire bodies to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From this day forward, our ears will listen for the Lord, our hands will work for the Lord, and our feet will run for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our two ears will only listen to the Lord's word, our two hands will only do the Lord's work, and our two feet will only walk the way of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are here only to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have consecrated ourselves as an offering, a sacrifice; we have consecrated our all to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, our two hands will be filled with Christ; they will uplift Him and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is what consecration is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only when we have done this, will God say, "This is consecration."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This saturation of Christ is what God calls consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Consecration means that we have touched the Lord's love and have recognized His right.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For these reasons, we can come before God and beg for the privilege to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not just a matter of God's calling us but of our offering ourselves to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should say, "O God!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am Yours.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I have been bought by You.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the past I was under Your table, hoping to eat a little of the fallen bread crumbs, but from this day forward, I want to serve You.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today I choose to serve You.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have been accepted in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May I also be granted a little portion in the great task of serving You?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Be merciful to me so that I can have a part in Your service.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In granting salvation to many, You did not pass me by or reject me; You saved me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now give me a part among the many who serve You; do not reject me."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is how you present yourself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Everything is for Christ and for Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When you present yourself to Him in this way, you have consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is what Romans 12 calls the presenting of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Romans 6 speaks of the consecration of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is like the sprinkling of the blood on the ears, the hands, and the feet.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Romans 12 speaks of the consecration of the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is the filling up of both hands with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This links the Old Testament and the New Testament in a perfect way.</S>
