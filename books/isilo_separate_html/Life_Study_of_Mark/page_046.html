In particular, we have paid attention to the seed of the kingdom as the intrinsic element of the kingdom. Now we shall go on to consider the relationship between the church and the kingdom.</p><p>The church and the kingdom are among the greatest subjects in the Bible. If we read the New Testament carefully and properly, we shall see the importance of the church and the kingdom.</p><p>In Matthew 3, very near the beginning of the New Testament, we have a word concerning the kingdom. John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (Matt. 3:2). John the Baptist&rsquo;s preaching was the initiation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Repentance in the preaching of John the Baptist, as the opening of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, was to have a turn for the kingdom of the heavens. This indicates that God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is focused on His kingdom.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FOUNDATION OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>In Matthew 16 the Lord Jesus brought His disciples into the district of Caesarea Philippi and there asked them, &ldquo;Who do men say that the Son of Man is?&rdquo; (Matt. 16:13). After they responded, the Lord went on to ask, &ldquo;But you, who do you say that I am?&rdquo; (v. 15). Receiving a revelation from the Father, Simon Peter answered and said, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (v. 16).</p><p>According to Ephesians 5:32, there is a great mystery of two parts, Christ and the church. Because the Father&rsquo;s revelation concerning Christ is only the first half of this great mystery, the Lord went on to speak concerning the church: &ldquo;And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (v. 18). This indicates strongly that the church must be something of Christ and for Christ. First, Christ was recognized, known, and even possessed. Then the Lord said that on &ldquo;this rock&rdquo; He would build His church. This rock refers not only to Christ, but also to the revelation of Christ, which Peter received from the Father. The church is built on this revelation concerning Christ. Hence, the &ldquo;rock&rdquo; here is not merely Christ Himself; it is also the realization, knowledge, experience, and possession of Christ.</p><p>Today many claim to recognize that Christ is the foundation of the church. However, they have not seen that the real foundation for the building of the church is the realization of Christ. If we do not realize Christ in our experience, we shall not have the foundation for the building of the church. Therefore, we must know Christ. Then our knowing, experiencing, enjoying, and possessing of Christ will be the foundation upon which He will build the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM</h2><p>In Matthew 16:19, immediately after speaking concerning the church, the Lord goes on to speak concerning the kingdom: &ldquo;I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth shall be what has been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth shall be what has been loosed in the heavens.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo; is used interchangeably for &ldquo;church&rdquo; in the previous verse. I would not say that these terms are synonymous; however, in verses 18 and 19 they are used interchangeably. This is strong proof that the genuine church is the kingdom in this age. This is confirmed by Romans 14:17, a verse that refers to the proper church life.</p><p>The Lord&rsquo;s word to Peter in Matthew 16:19 regarding the keys of the kingdom of the heavens was fulfilled in the book of Acts. We have the first aspect of this fulfillment in Acts 2 and the second aspect in Acts 10. In these two instances Peter used two keys. In Matthew 16:19 the Lord spoke of keys, not of one key. On the day of Pentecost, as recorded in chapter two of Acts, Peter used one of the keys to open the door for the Jewish people to come into the kingdom. Then in the house of Cornelius, as recorded in chapter ten of Acts, Peter used the second key to open the door for the Gentiles to come in. This is the reason that in Ephesians 2 we see that both Jews and Gentiles are built up together into the one church: &ldquo;So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow-citizens of the saints and members of the household of God, being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone&rdquo; (vv. 19-20).</p><p>We need to be impressed with the fact that in Matthew 16:18 we have the church and then in the following verse we have the kingdom. This indicates that when the church is first mentioned in the New Testament, it is mentioned in relation to the kingdom. Furthermore, as we have seen, in these verses the church and the kingdom are interchangeable terms.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> </body></html>
