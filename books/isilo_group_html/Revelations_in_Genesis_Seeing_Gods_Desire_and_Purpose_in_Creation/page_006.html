the First Requirement for Life to Grow</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:14-15 says, &ldquo;God said, Let there be light-bearers in the expanse of heaven to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years; and let them be light-bearers in the expanse of heaven to give light on the earth; and it was so.&rdquo; In the process of restoring creation, God&rsquo;s seventh step was to cause the light-bearers to appear in the expanse on the fourth day. Verse 16 says, &ldquo;God made the two great light-bearers, the greater light-bearer to rule the day and the lesser light-bearer to rule the night, and the stars.&rdquo; The word <em>made</em> here means &ldquo;produced&rdquo; in Hebrew; this is different from <em>created.</em> To create is to bring something into existence out of nothing, but to make is to take something that already exists and produce another thing out of it. On the fourth day God did not create the sun, the moon, or the stars out of nothing; He restored the existing light-bearers that had been judged (Job 9:7-8). On the first day light shined on the earth. This light had to be from the light-bearers. However, only light could be seen, not the light-bearers. On the fourth day God made the light-bearers appear.</p>
<p>Some may ask why God did not create the animal life immediately after He created the plant life on the third day; why did He instead restore the light-bearers? This is very significant. We must see that what God did on the fourth day is still for life, that is, for life to grow. We have said that life is closely related to the shining of light. In order for God to generate life, there is a prerequisite&mdash;the shining of light. Only with the light of the first day is it possible for there to be the generating of the plant life on the third day. When light shines, life comes. Wherever there is light, there is life. Life always follows light. However, the relationship between life and light does not stop with the third day. Not only is the generation of life based on light; the growth of life is also based on light. Just as the beginning of life requires light, the strengthening of life requires light as well. The strength of light determines the strength of life. This is an unalterable law.</p>
<p>The light that God caused to shine on the first day brought in the plant life, which is low and immature. God created only a low and immature life, because the light was not strong. The light of the first day was vague and indefinite, and therefore it could produce only a life that is low and immature, a life without feeling or consciousness. When God wanted life to grow, that is, to be expressed in a higher life, this vague light was not sufficient. Therefore, on the fourth day God made the light-bearers to appear. Then the light became definite, solid, and intensified. The sun, the moon, and the stars were set in the expanse of heaven in order to give light on the earth. Then God could create a higher form of life, the animal life.</p>
<p>The lights that bring forth life have a spiritual implication. We must apply this to ourselves and not take it as doctrine. We must ask ourselves concerning the condition of the light within us. The strength of the light of God within us indicates how much His life within us has grown. In order for our spiritual life to grow, we must receive a stronger shining. Only a stronger shining can cause more growth in life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ruling&mdash;<br />
the Second Requirement for Life to Grow</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:16-18 says, &ldquo;God made the two great light-bearers, the greater light-bearer to rule the day and the lesser light-bearer to rule the night, and the stars. And God set them in the expanse of heaven to give light on the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to separate the light from the darkness, and God saw that it was good.&rdquo; After the sun, the moon, and the stars were restored, God arranged for them to rule over the day and over the night and to separate the light from the darkness. This shows that with the appearing of definite light-bearers, there was a ruling over the day and over the night. Furthermore, the separation of the light from the darkness was strengthened. With the shining of the first-day light, there was a separation of light from darkness and of the day from night. But this separation was indefinite, because the light was not strong. The light of the fourth day, however, was strong; therefore, the separation of the light from the darkness was more definite.</p>
<p>The strengthening of the separation is also a requirement for life to grow. When the shining that we receive intensifies, we are able to clearly differentiate what is of God from what is not of God. The more separation we experience, the more we will be delivered from the earthly to the heavenly and from the fleshly to the spiritual. As a result, the life within us will grow further.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Revelations in Genesis: Seeing God's Desire and Purpose in Creation &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
