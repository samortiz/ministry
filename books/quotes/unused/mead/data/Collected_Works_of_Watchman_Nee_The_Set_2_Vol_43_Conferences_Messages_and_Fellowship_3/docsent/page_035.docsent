   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HEALING THROUGH FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1929 I lived in a place about two hours away from the city of Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At that time we had a sister who had a very serious eye disease.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She went to Foochow to seek medical help.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The doctor told her that her eye disease was very serious and that even if it was healed, she would need eyeglasses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The doctor prescribed a pair of glasses for her and gave her some treatments.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One day she heard me speak on the truth concerning faith and she believed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She went to the Lord and said, "My eye disease is very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every day I have to go to Foochow for treatment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even if I am healed, I will still have to wear glasses for the rest of my life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is time consuming as well as expensive."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>She asked God to heal her.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After she prayed, she believed that God healed her eye disease, and that she had already been healed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She was full of joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, she remembered the appointment that she had already made with the doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What should she do since Christians should not break a promise?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The glasses prescribed to her could not be resold to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, she went to Foochow as scheduled.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They gave her medicine for her eyes and the glasses.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the way home on the ferry, she thought to herself, "If I believe God's promise that He has healed my eyes, what am I going to do with this medicine and glasses?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Within her there was a desire to take these items home so that she could still use them in case her condition did not improve.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, another voice said, "Do you believe that God has already healed you?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you do, what is the use of these items?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Satan also began to talk to her: "You should not be too hasty in doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have already spent so much money on these things."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>She knew that this speaking was from Satan, and she began to praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the same time, she threw the drugs and eyeglasses into the river.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Her heart became very joyous.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She later testified that she had never been so happy in her whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A week later her eyesight was restored.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One day she stood up to give her testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A few days later I heard another story.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Another brother who heard her testimony also had eye problems and was also treated by the same doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The doctor gave him medicine and also prescribed glasses for him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After he heard the sister's testimony, he went to Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On his way back he said to himself, "If God can heal that sister, He can also heal me."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He tried to believe in this way, and he threw the medicine and glasses into the river.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When he came back, he told Brother Faithful Luk that surely God would heal him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One day Brother Luk came to my place and told me that the brother had grown in faith and that he was not seeking treatment for his disease anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I heard it I smiled coldly and said, "The eye disease of that sister was surely healed, but I guarantee that this brother will not get better."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brother Luk said, "How can that be?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I said, "Perhaps you should take him back to the doctor."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brother Luk said, "You are just too much."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I said, "This brother does not have faith."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He said, "How can you say that, when this brother threw away items worth twenty dollars?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He has even stopped going to the doctor and discontinued the medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If this is not faith, what is it?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After four weeks, the eye disease of the brother had not improved; in fact, it deteriorated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He came to see me and asked why God had healed the sister but not him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I said, "You threw away your things too soon.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You do not have faith."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He said, "But I believe that God will surely heal me."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He told me that God had called him to preach the gospel in Ku-Tien and that when he returned God would heal him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I said, "When you return, please come and see me."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When he returned, he was not any better.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>From 1929 until now 1937 , he has been wearing a pair of thick glasses and is still seeing the doctor because he did not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A LIVING FAITH TOWARD GOD'S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A living faith is not one that believes that God will heal but one that believes that God has already healed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not believing that God will listen to prayer but believing that God has already answered prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whenever we believe that God has already answered our prayer, we have received it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The brother believed that God would heal him from the very first day, but that kind of faith is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is only one kind of faith in the Bible: "Believe that you have received them, and you will have them."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Bible does not say that we will receive at a later date.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is useless to believe that we can or will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Friends, will, can, and may are terrible words.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A living faith has no use for these words.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Words of faith are have and already; no other words should be used.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Concerning our being in Christ, we have to realize that we overcome as soon as we believe, just as we were saved as soon as we believed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All of the riches of Christ, all of the heavenly blessings, the power of healing, the outpouring of the Spirit, and the power of the Spirit can be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whenever we receive a word from the Lord and take hold of it, believing that it is ours, it is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Faith apart from God's word is not real faith; it is useless and ineffectual.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must have God's word before we can believe.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Both Romans 8:2 and 6:6 are God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we hold on to God's word and believe His word, we will receive!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord Jesus said, "All things that you pray and ask."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>How all-inclusive is this word!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Everything is included in this word.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Believe and we will receive!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>All of God's promises, the rich promises and the accomplished facts, are ours when we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>May God grant us the light to see what living faith is and what believing is not a kind of false believing but a genuine believing.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Once we have this kind of faith, our most difficult problems will be resolved immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is the first lesson we have to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The blessing it brings is unlimited and sufficient for our whole lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>May God bless us!</S>
