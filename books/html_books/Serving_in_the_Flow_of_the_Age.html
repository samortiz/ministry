TO LEAD THE CHURCH ACCORDING TO ONE VISION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING TO ONE ANOTHER<br />
AND TEACHING AND ADMONISHING ONE ANOTHER<br />
WITH PSALMS, HYMNS, AND SPIRITUAL SONGS</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:18-19 says, &ldquo;Be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&rdquo; In these verses being filled in spirit and speaking, singing, and psalming are mentioned. According to the grammatical structure in Greek, these are not two separate things but two aspects of one thing. It is difficult to say whether being filled comes first or whether speaking, singing, and psalming come first. It seems that either one can be the cause or the effect of the other. On the one hand, when we are filled in spirit, we spontaneously praise God with overflowing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; psalms are long poems, hymns are shorter poems, and spiritual songs are poems that are even shorter. On the other hand, speaking to one another and singing and psalming cause us to be filled in spirit.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.&rdquo; The word of Christ here is a word that is living, fresh, and present; it is not doctrines. Ephesians 5:18-19 mentions speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs first and then singing and psalming. Colossians 3:16 mentions teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs first and then singing to God. In our religious concept, we think that psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are for singing only; however, Ephesians and Colossians show that psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are also for speaking to one another and for teaching and admonishing one another. Hence, we can speak to one another, teach one another, admonish one another, and then sing and psalm to the Lord. If we speak to one another until we are inspired, we will spontaneously psalm to God; this is different from our traditional, religious concept. We must see that psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are useful not only for singing but also for speaking, teaching, and admonishing.</p>
<p>Since it is a concept in Christianity that psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are related only to singing and that singing is related to music, people have studied music in depth. Almost every chapel has a choir leader, but the choir is focused only on the melody and rhythm of the songs, not on the inspiration of the spirit. We are just the opposite. We focus on the spiritual utterance, teaching, and admonition in the words, not on just the music itself. It is not easy to speak, teach, and admonish with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, because we often focus on spiritual things only with our mind as if we were studying mathematics. Therefore, we must call attention to the matter of speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs so that we can turn to be in the Holy of Holies in order to touch the throne of grace. Unsuitable speaking cannot turn a person from wandering in his mind, but speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs will bring us into the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that entering into the Holy of Holies is a matter of turning to our spirit (Heb. 4:16; Eph. 2:22; Rom. 8:10). The Holy of Holies is in the third heaven (Heb. 9:12, 24); however, today the Lord dwells not only in the third heaven but also in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). Our spirit is the Holy of Holies that reaches the heavens. The Lord&rsquo;s throne, which is a throne of grace, is in the Holy of Holies, and a river of water of life proceeds out of this throne to supply us with grace (Heb. 4:16). If we only sit and listen to messages, we will be in our mind most of the time; however, if we speak to one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, we will turn from our mind to our spirit as we speak. Whether we are literate or illiterate, we can all enter into the Holy of Holies and touch the throne of grace. </p>
<p>When we studied Ephesians in a training in Taipei in 1953, I did not see the matter of speaking to one another in chapter 5. In 1968 in Jakarta, Indonesia, however, the phrase <em>speaking to one another</em> shined out to me. I immediately fellowshipped with the brothers about practicing the speaking of hymns to one another. Everyone enjoyed the Lord very much in that meeting. After I went back to Taiwan, I fellowshipped this matter with the churches, but there was not much response; everyone still gave messages according to routine.</p>
<p>Brother Watchman Nee emphasized repeatedly in his Kuling training that if a person gives a message from his mind, it can only touch people&rsquo;s mind; only that which is of the spirit can touch people&rsquo;s spirit. Brother Nee spent a long time to fellowship with us about paying attention to our spirit and releasing our spirit. This is needed in order to touch people and to touch their spirit. Although the co-workers have been paying more attention to releasing their spirit when speaking, much of the time they are still in their mind and do not release their spirit fully. We often speak messages according to our mind; this shows that we are under the influence of the traditions of Christianity. Instead, we should encourage people to speak to one another in spirit. Speaking hymns to one another is the easiest way to release the spirit. If we become experienced in speaking to one another, every hymn will be able to touch us.</p>
<p>Thus, we should not select hymns based on our old experiences but on the present &ldquo;season.&rdquo; This is like choosing some clothes for winter and different clothes for summer. Similarly, our speaking in the church must match the audience as well as the season. Some words are suitable for a father to speak but not for a mother; other words are suitable for a mother to speak but not for a sibling. We should not lead the church only according to our experiences. On the one hand, we cannot lead without experience, but on the other hand, we cannot lead merely according to our experience. Even when we teach, we cannot rely on experience alone. Lastly, we should not be disappointed because we cannot do everything well. Everything is in God&rsquo;s hands; He is able to deliver us from the influence of Christianity.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the help that we receive from others is a benefit to us, but on the other hand, if the help is not rendered properly, it can ruin and even destroy a good piece of material. Although Christianity has passed the Bible and the gospel of the Lord Jesus to us, it has also given us many traditions that have damaged our experience of the Lord. I was born in Christianity and grew up in Christianity; I received the most help from Christianity, yet at the same time I was deeply damaged by Christianity. To this day I must admit that it is hard to be rid of its influence completely.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS HELPING THE CHURCH<br />
TO BE UP TO DATE WITH THE FLOW OF THE AGE</h2>
<p>The elders need to help the church to be up to date with the flow of the age, because the Lord is always advancing. This is not easy, because the ways of the older generation have been cultivated and set, and the younger generation is tender and inexperienced. We are in a transitional period with a gap between the generations in life and experience. Some of our crops are yellowing with age, but at the same time we do not have new green crops. In such a large church as Taipei, it would not be easy to let young brothers in their twenties or thirties be elders, but leaving the church in the hands of older elders also poses difficulties. Thus, the elders must be open to change.</p>
<p>I was born in Christianity and grew up under the influence of the Western culture. I was very Westernized. I learned English sixty years ago, but because of the circumstances and the atmosphere then, I was very cautious about speaking English or wearing Western-style suits. Whenever someone wore a Western-style suit, he would receive harsh criticism from those who considered themselves to be traditionalists. Hence, everyone kept the old way and followed tradition. Eventually, however, some were not afraid, and they took the lead to wear Western-style suits. Gradually, Western-style suits became more common, and on formal occasions they even began to be required. Although the elders in Taipei are older, they must take the lead to &ldquo;wear Western-style suits.&rdquo; Because the Lord has a new leading, the elders must take the lead to keep up with Him. If the elders do not move when they hear something concerning the Lord&rsquo;s new leading, it will be difficult to keep up with the flow of the age.</p>
<p>From what I have seen of the young people recently, I feel that they have a heart for the Lord and that they are willing to spend the time to learn. They can release their spirit, and their spirit is fresh. I also understand that the older ones still want the young ones to follow the old ways; they are not at ease whenever the young ones do not follow the old ways. But we are in a new age, and it is difficult for the young ones to follow the old ways. The older saints must &ldquo;put on Western-style suits&rdquo; and be up to date, and the young saints must be patient and not have intense reactions against the older saints.</p>
<p>The older saints must recognize their actual condition and respect the younger generation, who should eventually surpass them. The elders should not boast in their seniority but should submit to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;I have nothing, and I know nothing of the flow of Your move. Have mercy on me; I would like to start learning afresh.&rdquo; If we do this, we will be blessed. The Lord is advancing in the twentieth century; He cannot go back to the nineteenth century. He is always advancing.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Lord Jesus was born, His parents brought Him to the temple. At that time, two elderly Jews, Simeon and Anna, were in the temple. They were devout people living before the Lord. When they saw the baby Jesus, they knew that He was the Messiah, the coming Christ (Luke 2:25-38). Although they were devout, they were also influenced by the Old Testament age, and they were strongly attached to the temple. If the Lord had called them to come out of the temple and to follow Him when He began to minister, it would have been impossible for them to do so.</p>
<p>Thus, when the Lord Jesus began to call people, He did not call anyone who was too old; He called a group of young men by the Sea of Galilee. The twelve apostles were young men. The Lord Himself was only thirty years old when He began to minister and only thirty-three and a half years old when He was crucified. None of His disciples were older than He was. Peter, Andrew, James, and John were not set in their ways. When the Lord said, &ldquo;Come after Me,&rdquo; they immediately left their nets and followed Him (Matt. 4:18-22). Would Simeon have left the temple and followed the Lord if the Lord had said, &ldquo;Come after Me&rdquo;? I am afraid that he would not have been able to follow the Lord. The Lord knew that Simeon was set in his ways, even though he was devout and loved God. Simeon would have been unable to keep up with the Lord&rsquo;s new way. This was not only the case with Simeon and Anna but even with Joseph from Arimathea and Nicodemus, who helped bury the Lord Jesus. There is no record that either of these two remained in Jerusalem to continue steadfastly in prayer with the twelve apostles (John 19:38-42; Acts 1:12-14). When the church appeared on the earth in Jerusalem, possibly no elder was over thirty years old.</p>
<p>I hope the elders would have the light, sense, and understanding to know that the Lord only goes forward; the Lord is taking a new way in this age. We must consider our service: are we set in our ways, or can we adapt to the Lord&rsquo;s need in this age? Even though the Bible does not explicitly address the matter of how long a brother should serve as an elder, we often assume that it is for life. We need to consider whether our old ways merely correspond to our being old or whether we can advance with the Lord. We did not have this problem twenty-five years ago, but we have it today. The age is new, the flow is new, but we are old. If we are determined to turn from our oldness to become like children, not following old methods or giving old messages, then we can serve in the flow. We need much light and grace to be intensified to the point that we drop our old methods and follow the up-to-date flow.</p>
<p>We all are in about the same situation today; those who are old are too old, and those who are young are not yet able to walk according to the Lord&rsquo;s new flow. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has had a good beginning in the United States, and it is moving very quickly there. Soon it will spread to other continents. Not long ago we had a conference in Europe with at least three hundred saints. There even has been a good beginning in Africa. Furthermore, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has reached Australia and New Zealand; in these places there is a fresh atmosphere that is better than the condition in the Far East. It is easy for the Lord to have a new beginning in places where there are not old roots; with half the effort in the work and in the leading, there are twice the results. Places with old roots, however, get only half the result with twice the effort, because our oldness cancels out much of the effectiveness of our work. This shows that we truly need to be before the Lord and seek to improve. On the one hand, those who are elderly must endeavor to advance in this new age, and on the other hand, the young people need to be burdened but not rash.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING IN SPIRIT<br />
IN ORDER TO LET THE LORD LIVE OUT OF US</h2>
<p>According to Ephesians 5:19, we should speak to one another in &ldquo;psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,&rdquo; and according to Colossians 3:16, we should also teach and admonish one another with &ldquo;psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.&rdquo; These are not ordinary words; this is an exercise involving the release of our spirit. I hope that we would practice this in our meetings and not boast in our seniority, put on airs, or give the same old messages. I am worried that we may be devout Christians who love the Lord but who never use our spirit. This is the influence of Christianity. According to the truth, we should be in spirit continuously, living and walking in our spirit rather than relying on our soul. As Christians, we must exercise our spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s present flow of the age is a matter of being in spirit. Our prayer should be in spirit, our singing should be in spirit, and our speaking to one another should be in spirit. Our mind should not be our most active part; we must exercise our spirit to let the Lord live out of us.</p>
<p>If a person is in his mind, everything that he does will come out from his self. A certain brother, for example, may have a disposition that is naturally suited for cultivating godly characteristics. If he does not exercise his spirit, however, none of his living will be of the Lord. Furthermore, the Lord will not live out of him, no matter how much he testifies of the Lord&rsquo;s mercy in regard to his godly cultivation. The present flow in this age is to let the Lord live out of us through the exercise of our spirit. Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; Every method to cultivate godliness is merely a formula and an outdated routine.</p>
<p>Godly cultivation is not the focus of God&rsquo;s will, but the pursuit of godly cultivation has been a tradition in Christianity since the first century. In contrast to this, the Lord has been doing a recovery work throughout the centuries, and today He is recovering our experience of the spirit. This is a new beginning. We should not give long messages but instead speak in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs directly from our spirit. We can also pray-read. We do not need to compose prayers; we only need to release our spirit. Whether we are speaking hymns to one another or pray-reading verses, we can release our spirit to supply and edify the saints. We do not have to speak hymns rigidly, but in principle, the way that we meet must come out of our spirit. We must flee everything of the mind, knowledge, and routine.</p>
<p>Among the various churches in the Far East, Hong Kong is under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing for two reasons: First, the older saints do their best to give the young saints an opportunity to function. Second, the young saints are able to advance and learn lessons, while still submitting to and cooperating with the older ones. If the older saints believed that the young saints were not sensible enough and kept the service to themselves, the situation in Hong Kong would be finished. Several elders in Hong Kong have been blessed with a realization of their limitations, and they have encouraged the young people to rise up to fill up their lack. In this way the older saints are a blessing to the church, and the church has no problems. If the older saints do not give the young saints an opportunity to function, there will be much loss. Being able to advance is a strength of the young people, but the young people must learn the lesson of submission. The church profits greatly when older and younger saints coordinate with each other.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE CHURCHES ACCORDING TO ONE VISION</h2>
<p>My burden is not related to outward affairs but to our inner vision. If we can see the vision clearly, we will be able to bring the churches into living in the spirit and living one with the Lord. This cannot be achieved in a short period of time. It may take quite a long time to bring the brothers and sisters into the spirit in order to practically experience Christ living in us. This requires that the elders, co-workers, and responsible brothers see the vision and pursue, fellowship, and pray together so that they may be in one spirit to bring the churches into this vision.</p>
<p>If the brothers see this vision, they should bear the burden to bring the saints into the spirit, into the flow of the age. The brothers and sisters who see this vision should come together to fellowship, pray, and pursue the Lord in one spirit. I believe that the Lord will give us a definite leading every day. Then our supply of the word in the meetings will not be the issue of our opinions but of our fellowship. In this fellowship we will have a sense of what to speak on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, who should speak, and what material to use. We do not have a lack of material among us. In both English and Chinese a considerable number of messages have been released. The most important thing, however, is to fellowship and pursue together in one spirit. The brothers in the various churches should not be like public servants who carry out routines and follow old methods. This will not bring in any blessing.</p>
<p>If we fellowship and pursue according to this one vision, the Lord will clearly and practically lead us in the meetings of the church. The Lord&rsquo;s supply is living and constant. We need to draw out the Lord&rsquo;s supply from these messages by entering into them ourselves and by having fellowship with one another in order to bring the saints into them. This is the principle of Paul&rsquo;s charge in 2 Timothy 2:2, which says, &ldquo;The things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also.&rdquo; Paul wanted Timothy to be clear concerning the vision so that he could lead others, who then could teach others as well. Although the local churches are autonomous, there is only one testimony, and everyone should go forward in the flow according to one vision.</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul speaks of not teaching different things rather than God&rsquo;s economy. This indicates that there was a group of people in the church who were not necessarily teaching heresy but who were teaching something different from the central vision of the apostles. Hence, Paul wanted Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones in the church not to teach things that differ from the central vision of God. We should apply this principle in the local churches. The churches need to see the central vision and take it as their way and goal. I hope that we would see this and then fellowship, pray, and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading together with the serving ones in our locality. Then we will provide the whole church with a timely leading in one spirit. We must drop our old methods and set practices; nevertheless, we are not simply replacing old methods with new methods. Instead, we are seeking to be governed by the vision and to advance according to the Lord&rsquo;s present leading.</p>
<p>Wherever the co-workers serve, they should not consider themselves as &ldquo;message-giving&rdquo; co-workers; instead, they should fellowship and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading with the brothers in one spirit. In regard to weekly meetings or the Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings, the co-workers should learn to take the new way in spirit and not give old, routine messages based on old experiences. The revelation that the Lord has shown us is of our living Lord, who passed through death, resurrection, and ascension to become the life-giving Spirit in our spirit so that He can live in us, and we can live one with Him. When we live according to our mingled spirit, we are Christians who are living with the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO BE IN THE SPIRIT<br />
TO BE DELIVERED FROM METHODS</h2>
<p>Although we may study doctrines, methods, and formulas that are proper and even biblical, they can touch only our mind, not our spirit. Even prayer can be a work that is based on mental comprehension rather than on the exercise of our spirit in order to live one with the Lord. The same can be said concerning the giving of a message. No matter how much of our content comes from the Bible, our speaking can fall into a set formula. We should not do this any longer; our messages should come out of our living in spirit, our living and walking with the Lord.</p>
<p>It is not easy for us to stop relying upon methods. For example, we have picked up the practices of Brother Lawrence and Madame Guyon. This is not bad, but it is rather superficial; there is even a sense that we are borrowing someone else&rsquo;s spiritual experiences. Even though we can accomplish something by working according to methods, this is not what the Lord wants today. The Lord wants to live in us. We must let Him live in us, and we must live by Him and with Him. We really need the Lord to save us from relying upon methods and formulas.</p>
<p>In giving a message, we should not repeat the words from reference materials in a rote manner. We must absorb the content in our spirit and release it from our spirit. Only this will provide a living supply. Furthermore, we must reject the concept that we should not repeat what others have spoken, as if it is a shame to repeat the speaking of others. This is a wrong concept. If we have such a concept, it shows that we have a lack of appreciation for what we have received. If our messages are like gold and diamonds, we should not be afraid to &ldquo;display&rdquo; them a thousand times. The American brothers regard the repetition of the ministry messages as an honor. They often imitate one another and practice giving the same messages. They do not have the thought that a message that has been released elsewhere does not need to be released to their locality. It is altogether fleshly to have the thought that following others is a shame.</p>
<p>Some young brothers are in a precarious position before the Lord because they have a different spirit, even though they have some revelation. A different spirit gives opportunity to the enemy. If we let a different spirit develop, there will be serious divisions. The young people need to advance but not be rash. Whoever goes to an extreme will lose the Lord&rsquo;s presence. May the Lord give us the discernment.</p>
<p>May God have mercy on us so that we learn to have a proper spirit. Outward mistakes do not matter so much, but our spirit must be right. It is wrong to see a revelation and then condemn others based on this revelation. Although I may rebuke, I do not condemn. Rebuking without condemning is different from rebuking and condemning. It is better to know how to listen than how to speak. I have heard a different spirit in the words of some brothers. Even though they do not mean to dispute, something is not quite right in their words. Satan is quite deceitful; we must guard against him. If we have a different spirit and allow it to develop, we will get into trouble. This will result in a loss to ourselves and also to the church. If we have a different spirit, we need to be purified by the Lord.</p>
<p>We are not controlled by any method or by any person; instead, we are controlled by the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s present way, the Lord&rsquo;s present flow. Because we have seen this vision, we are burdened to supply this word to every place. Some places follow quickly, whereas others follow slowly, but this is not a problem. The only thing that matters is being in the flow. We should endeavor in spirit to practice the things that we have heard step by step and little by little.</p>
<p>We should not think that these words apply only to others; before the Lord we should apply them to ourselves. It is also dangerous to try to adjust others based on the things that we have recently seen and experienced. Satan can hide behind our &ldquo;adjustment&rdquo; and do a destroying work. The Holy Spirit is never rash; the brothers who have a rash disposition should pray in order to be clear concerning what to say and what not to say. The main cause of car accidents is excessive speed. When drivers lower their speed, the number of car accidents is reduced.</p>
<p>I have learned many lessons over the years in serving the Lord. Those who charge forward too quickly fall more easily into the hands of the devil. We should never charge forward too quickly, because our sense of urgency is often misplaced. Even if we are greatly burdened about a matter, we do not need to act hastily. If something is of the Lord, the Lord will make the best arrangement for it. Anything that is too impulsive will become unhealthy. This tendency can be seen in the Pentecostal movement. We have studied the Pentecostal movement for many years, and we have considered it in relation to the Scriptures. In our study we have found that many of the impulsive and rash elements of the Pentecostal movement are unscriptural. From reading Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, we can see that he did not speak in an impulsive or rash manner; he considered what he wrote in the light of the Lord (1 Cor. 7:25, 40).</p>
<p>Even if we have a specific burden, we should not be impulsive when we contact others. Even if others are not where we are, impulsive and rash efforts will yield only opposite results. We must learn to let the Lord work, and we should simply move forward, walking according to the spirit without a condemning tone. We should avoid being impulsive or rash even in our own movement forward. We should be balanced and avoid being too impulsive. When we sense that we have received some leading from the Lord, we should examine whether it is of the spirit or of the self. This kind of examination applies more to speaking a word of rebuke than it does to speaking a word of supply. We must be careful not to be impulsive or rash when it comes to speaking a word that touches someone&rsquo;s shortcomings. Even if we feel that we must say something, it is best to bring it to the Lord first. After waiting half a day, we may feel that we should not speak in such a way, and after another half a day, we may have a sense to speak of the matter in a different way. In this way we will avoid much trouble.</p>
<p>It seems as if some brothers are bearing the burden of their local church, the burden of churches elsewhere, and even the burden of the whole world. This is too much. They should be quiet in spirit and bring the church in their locality on in spirit until it becomes living and enjoys the Lord richly. There is no need for them to promote their way or to condemn others for not following them. For example, the brothers in the church in Tainan should not touch the problems of the brothers in the church in Taipei. They should just stand on the ground of the church in Tainan and advance steadily to supply the saints in spirit and to cause the young people to grow. Even when there is a conference or a training for all of Taiwan, we should speak positively without any tone of rebuke or condemnation.</p>
<p>It is proper to be burdened but not to the point that we condemn others. Condemnation does not help, and those who condemn are the ones who are hurt the most. It is easy to be short of maturity and to be lacking in the riches to supply the churches. Even if we have seen a little, Satan can hide behind our condition and seduce us to measure others according to what we have seen, while forgetting our own condition. We should never measure others according to a &ldquo;ruler.&rdquo; Instead, we should remain in what we have seen, advance steadily and quietly in our local church in a lowly spirit, experience the Lord, and grow, mature, and be filled with life.</p><h2 class="head1">SIMPLY SUPPLYING LIFE<br />
AND NOT CONDEMNING OR CHANGING OTHERS</h2>
<p>Today a locality that is supplied and blessed by the Lord cannot remain hidden, because transportation and communications are so developed and extensive. Gradually, the whole Body will know what a local church has gained, and its supply will reach the whole Body. When the churches gather together for fellowship, we should just receive the fellowship, and if the Holy Spirit leads us to give a word of fellowship, we should supply others without any flavor of condemnation. If we condemn the churches based on what we have seen, we will fall into danger. It is good to see something, but we also must advance and grow in life in order to be rich in spirit; then we will spontaneously be a supply to the churches. Although there are churches in different localities, we are still one Body. If our locality has truly received revelation, this revelation will become a supply to the Body sooner or later. There is no need for impulsive promotions or rash declarations that others are wrong and only we are right. Such an improper spirit and inappropriate methods will only bring in a negative result.</p>
<p>Our human body is an organism of life, and everything related to life is spontaneous. A good doctor does not prescribe radical treatments, and the best medications are those that the body can absorb slowly in order to heal itself of diseases. Treatments that are too radical can be deadly to the body. If a local church, even in a remote place, has truly learned some lessons and has been richly blessed, the riches that it enjoys will eventually reach and supply other local churches.</p>
<p>We should never be impulsive, but instead, we should bring everything to the Lord and wait on Him. The work of the Holy Spirit does not need our impulsiveness. We should be quiet before the Lord, because the Lord always has a way. Even if churches elsewhere have needs, the Lord has a way for them. We should care for our own locality and receive for our own locality so that the Holy Spirit has the opportunity to infuse our locality with the riches and gradually strengthen the whole Body. The supply that our locality receives is for the Body, and it will spontaneously operate in the whole Body.</p>
<p>Over ten years ago a brother claimed that he saw a vision, and he even asked another co-worker to confirm whether or not he had the ministry of the age. I cannot say that this brother did not see anything, but his vouching for himself had no bearing on whether or not he had the ministry of the age. Only life and the issue of life can vouch for us. If a brother can supply people, then the churches in Taiwan and the churches all over the earth will be supplied gradually. Then, even if he says that he does not have the ministry of the age, others will say that he does. The ministry of the age is the ministry of the age; it does not need to be self-confirmed or proclaimed. If we see something, we do not have to &ldquo;publicize&rdquo; it, and neither should we feel that only we have seen something.</p>
<p>In our work there is no need to rush to change things. If we go to Indonesia, there is no need to touch or change the churches in Indonesia. We should only minister life whenever there is the opportunity. There is no need to change methods or to touch matters of right and wrong. We should simply minister life when we have the opportunity. Even when we minister life, we need to be pure and simple so that people may receive this life. If we do this, even if we live there for a year or two, we will not fall into right and wrong. Our going to a place should never stir up matters of right and wrong or cause problems.</p>
<p>The brothers frequently make the mistake of being too impulsive and rash. Even if we see that a certain church has a need, we do not need to be impulsive. Instead, we should consider our position when we speak. A sister should remember that she is a sister when she speaks, a brother should remember that he is a brother when he speaks, an older one should remember that he is an older one when he speaks, and a young one should remember that he is a young one when he speaks. Some spiritual words can come only from an elderly person, not from a young person. We should not reject the words of another based simply on his human status; there are distinctions of age and position that cannot be annulled absolutely. Furthermore, we should be aware that there are distinctions related to location as well as human status. For example, some words that are suitable for the church in Tainan are not suitable for the situation of the church in Taipei. Similarly, I can speak some words to my family but not the same words to the saints in a meeting.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us that we would learn these matters. Otherwise, haste will result in waste, and we will experience results that are the opposite of our intention. If I speak a strong word, this does not mean that you should go out and speak the same words in the same way, because people will receive what I say but not necessarily what you say. Some words that come from me could never come from you. If you say the same thing, you will get into trouble and even hurt yourself. It is not easy to be a doctor who can effectively treat diseases. First, one needs much study and practice in order to accumulate experience. Furthermore, there is a need for a proper examination and understanding of a patient&rsquo;s condition in order for a proper treatment to be prescribed. It is the same with the church; we must be cautious in every aspect of our service. The church is the Body of Christ; we should not touch it lightly. If we do not touch it properly, we will suffer loss, and others will suffer as well. This can be seen in the history of those who claimed to have seen a vision over ten years ago but who eventually left. Today their work has not produced much fruit. In addition to damaging many people, they also damaged themselves. We must learn these lessons today.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING FILLED IN SPIRIT<br />
AND CONTROLLED BY VISION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED IN SPIRIT, SPEAKING TO ONE ANOTHER<br />
IN PSALMS, HYMNS, AND SPIRITUAL SONGS</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:18-19 says, &ldquo;Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&rdquo; The meaning of these verses in the original Greek is difficult to convey with Chinese grammar. The original Greek text indicates that we are filled in spirit when we speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. According to the grammatical structure in Greek, being filled in spirit and speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs occur simultaneously.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.&rdquo; Although teaching seemingly involves merely speaking words, this verse refers to teaching one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. This emphasizes our need to turn from our mind in order to release our spirit, to speak in spirit, and to teach in spirit. This kind of teaching provides more than doctrines for the mind; it supplies nourishment in our spirit.</p>
<p>Teaching one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs deals with our habit of remaining in our mind, which frustrates the release of our spirit. When we speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, we are simultaneously filled in spirit. Even though it is not easy to turn from our mind to our spirit, we should exercise to speak from our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO PRINCIPLES OF LIVING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A Christian Living in the Calculation of the Mind</h2>
<p>The spirituality of many brothers and sisters often is not the spontaneous issue of living in the spirit; instead, it is the issue of human effort. When we wake up in the morning, our thoughts are often focused only on how we should act, and we begin to calculate and plan what to do and what not to do. Such human effort is based on the mind; it does not come out of living in the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Contacting the Lord in Spirit<br />
and Living by the Lord in Spirit</h2>
<p>Living in spirit is a spontaneous response to contacting the Lord in our spirit and living by the Lord in our spirit; it is not related to calculating what we should or should not do. Everything that we do should be based on the fact that its source is our spirit, not on whether we regard it as right or wrong. A Christian should care only for living in spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Meetings, Messages, and Prayers Needing to Be<br />
the Spontaneous Living Out of the Spirit</h2>
<p>According to my observation, our current practices&mdash;from the leading of the elders to the messages of the co-workers to the activities of the saints&mdash;involve an exercise according to preconceived notions. There is not a spontaneous expression from our spirit. A spontaneous expression from our spirit depends upon the saints&rsquo; living in the spirit before and during the meeting. When everything comes out of the spirit, there is no need for considerations from our mind. Whatever comes out of our mental consideration is fundamentally different from that which comes out of the spirit. At least ninety percent of our living and meetings reflects our mental considerations rather than our spontaneous living in the spirit.</p>
<p>For example, when some brothers are asked to give a message, they write down the content of their speaking, point by point from beginning to end. Then they speak these points in exact order from the podium. Such a speaking is reasonable, but often it is wholly doctrinal. Other brothers follow the spirit in their speaking, even though they have considered what to speak in advance. This kind of speaking is spontaneous and from the spirit.</p>
<p>In the same way, some consider the content of their prayer, and when they pray, it seems as if the content has been prepared in advance. Others who have some prior consideration are willing to drop their original intention after praying a few sentences and to release their spirit according to the leading of the living Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR CHRISTIAN LIVING AND MEETINGS<br />
TO BE ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, the Lord wants our living and our meetings to be spontaneous and according to the spirit. In our Christian living we should not live according to our mind but according to the release of our spirit. If we consider how to live according to the spirit and how to release our spirit, whatever comes out will only be according to our mind, that is, according to the realm of right and wrong. Living according to our spirit is different, because such a living is the actual living of the Lord in us. Everything depends on following our spirit and releasing our spirit, not on the consideration of our mind or the feeling of our emotions. When the spirit rejoices, we should rejoice, and when the spirit does not rejoice, we should not rejoice. When the spirit praises, we should praise, and when the spirit does not praise, we should not praise. The release of our spirit should not be based on human considerations.</p><h2 class="head1">TURNING FROM DOCTRINES TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Almost eighty to ninety percent of our living and meetings involves human effort; it is the result of many years of teaching. Initially, this teaching was like a child-conductor to us, but it is also possible for these teachings to become doctrines to us. The law of the Old Testament was intended to be a child-conductor to conduct the children of Israel unto Christ (Gal. 3:24), yet after much conducting, the Israelites could not let go of the law and come to Christ. They even opposed Christ. It is the same with us. We have been taught many things, yet we remain in these teachings today. As a result, we oppose the spirit and cannot bring the brothers and sisters out of doctrines into the spirit.</p>
<p>We came to Taiwan in 1949 and began a training work in 1952. We could not continue the training after 1960 because there were problems. Ever since then we have been trying to save the saints from being merely doctrinal, but it has been difficult to turn them to the spirit. I absolutely believe that <em>teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs</em> in Colossians 3:16 means that our words of teaching should not come from our mind but from our spirit. Although this verse speaks of teaching, this teaching is based on the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING AND PRACTICING TO LIVE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Our understanding and practice must be based on the spirit. Because we lack experience in living according to our spirit, as soon as we endeavor to practice living according to our spirit, our mind takes over. This is because we are not filled in spirit. Whatever comes out of our mental considerations is never as spontaneous as that which is of the spirit. We do not exercise our spirit enough. We have talked about spirituality for over a decade, but the result has been only an artificial spirituality, that is, a spirituality that comes from human effort. Our spirituality is neither heavenly nor spontaneous, because our spirit has not been filled; instead, it is deflated and weak. What we regard as spirituality is largely a matter of our own efforts, conceived in our mind and executed by our will. This is the true nature of our so-called spirituality.</p>
<p>The Lord does not want an artificial spirituality based on our human effort. We must learn to live in the spirit every day in order to spontaneously live out a genuine spirituality rather than working out an artificial spirituality. As we develop a habit of living in our spirit, we will not need to rely on human efforts; instead, we will spontaneously live according to our spirit, speaking to one another and teaching one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. There will not even be a need for much explanation when we teach in this way because the words of the psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs will convey the teaching of the Spirit in our spirit.</p>
<p>We must wake up and have an inward turn. I am not encouraging us to do something in an outward way, but only that we would wake up and turn. As Christians, we have too much of the element of human work in our living and meetings, because we have not been filled enough in spirit. Thus, our spirit has not been released enough, and we have been left with only teachings. Such teachings are religion. Religion teaches us how to worship God, please God, and serve God, but it has no element of the spirit. Even if we touch a little element of the spirit in our living and meetings, we mainly touch an element of human work. Therefore, we should have a great turn and ask the Lord to have mercy on us and save us from any desire for artificiality in our living, meetings, or service. We need to live the Christian life out from our spirit spontaneously and to function in our meetings spontaneously. This depends upon the continuous exercise of our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT KEEPING UP WITH THE LORD&rsquo;S WAY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not Practicing according to Brother Nee&rsquo;s Vision</h2>
<p>It grieves me to say that our overall situation has been going down, even though we have been working for many years. We are not advancing, because we want to keep the old ways. Even our history in mainland China illustrates this point. Between 1932 and 1950 when I was with Brother Watchman Nee, he changed quite much. His changes were improvements based on seeing new things. When he saw something new, he moved forward according to the vision. However, there were only a few co-workers and brothers in the churches who actually kept up with him. Almost every time that Brother Nee saw something new, he would give new messages. When he gave these messages, those attending would nod their heads and take notes, but almost no one practiced what Brother Nee had seen.</p>
<p>For example, Brother Nee clearly saw some matters related to the practice of the church life in 1940 when he spoke concerning the service of the eldership, the coordination of the service, and the receiving of the believers. He also talked about setting up a church business office for the various services of the deacons, and he started practicing these matters in Shanghai. He made arrangements for the services of the elders and for the various services of the deacons. In 1948, however, only the church in Shanghai and the church in Chefoo were practicing these things. None of the other local churches were practicing these things.</p>
<p>During the Sino-Japanese War in 1940, people fled to regions that were not affected by the war. Many people heard the gospel and were saved, but they were not made aware of these new practices. Thus, even though the co-workers brought the gospel to those unaffected regions, the believers were short in matters related to the practice of the church life. Brother Nee had been practicing these things for several years, but the co-workers seemed to turn a deaf ear and a blind eye to them. When the co-workers went out to work, they still spoke of things from the 1930s.</p>
<p>At the end of 1940, the practice of the church life started in Chefoo, and I made arrangements with two brothers for the services of the elders and the deacons. When I set up the church business office in Chefoo, for example, one of these brothers helped me to handle and arrange many matters. By 1948 there were only two churches&mdash;Shanghai and Chefoo&mdash;that practiced the church life according to Brother Nee&rsquo;s leading. These two churches practiced these matters very successfully, and there was a revival in both places.</p><h2 class="head2">Different Opinions Causing Chaotic Conditions<br />
in the Churches</h2>
<p>Following the revival in the church in Shanghai, some co-workers and I were invited to Canton, Swatow, Amoy, and Foochow at the end of 1947. We arrived in Hong Kong at the end of December, and we left Hong Kong for Canton on January 1, 1948. Then we went to Swatow and arrived in Amoy in February. We reached Foochow by the end of February. Before our visit, none of the churches in the Fukien or Kwangtung Provinces were clear concerning the ground of the church. Although the first meeting outside denominations started in Foochow in 1922, none of the churches in the Fukien Province or in the neighboring Kwangtung Province were clear concerning the ground of the church in 1948. This lack of clarity was the result of these places receiving different opinions from other sources in addition to Brother Nee&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<p>When we had a conference in Foochow, twenty to thirty co-workers and responsible ones from around Foochow came. There was a little revival in Foochow as a result of this conference. After the conference many would not leave, because they heard that a few co-workers and I would be staying at Brother Nee&rsquo;s house for another two weeks in order to have some fellowship with him. When they learned of this, they would not leave, and they asked me to plead with Brother Nee to let them hear his fellowship.</p>
<p>Brother Nee did not agree with their coming to this further time of fellowship, but they would not leave. When I pleaded for them once again, Brother Nee, who had a large living room in his house with a partition wall on one side, said, &ldquo;You and the two co-workers with you can sit and fellowship with me on this side of the wall; the other twenty to thirty co-workers and responsible ones can sit on the other side of the wall and listen. Furthermore, you must guarantee that they will not go out and speak about what they have heard.&rdquo; I took the risk and gave my guarantee to Brother Nee. Only then did he agree.</p>
<p>Brother Nee did not want them to go out and loosely repeat his fellowship, because many co-workers and responsible ones in the local churches had not learned the lessons concerning the practice of the church life. Instead, they were opinionated, and Brother Nee did not want anything to be stirred up among those who held differing opinions by the casual repetition of his fellowship. After I gave my guarantee to him, I said to the twenty to thirty co-workers and responsible ones, &ldquo;You are willing to hear Brother Nee&rsquo;s fellowship, but he is concerned that you will go out and speak of it in a loose way. Therefore, you must not spread his speaking.&rdquo; They promised wholeheartedly to not say anything, because they were hungry and thirsty, and they realized their need for a spiritual supply.</p>
<p>It was really quite a special situation with four of us sitting together and the others sitting behind the partition. During one of these days of fellowship, I said to Brother Nee, &ldquo;When we visited the churches in the Kwangtung and Fukien Provinces, our general impression was that the churches were in a messy condition. What do you think should be done?&rdquo; This question seemingly opened up a fountainhead in him. When he opened his mouth, words that were full of the presence of the Holy Spirit poured out of him like Niagara Falls. This caused us to be quite fearful and sober. He spoke on the line of Jerusalem for a long time, and his speaking was filled with light, rebukes, and even remorse.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Co-working Being Possible<br />
Only through &ldquo;Handing Ourselves Over&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Upon hearing his speaking, an older sister said, &ldquo;Since we have heard Brother Nee&rsquo;s words, we should practice it,&rdquo; and everyone said Amen. Brother Nee responded, saying, &ldquo;If you really want to practice this, you must hand yourselves over completely starting from today. You need to go back and write a note concerning handing yourselves over.&rdquo; This was the beginning of our practice of &ldquo;handing ourselves over&rdquo; to be completely under the direction of the work. Brother Nee was very serious when he spoke of handing ourselves over. We had the sense that we were handing over our very life. If people do not hand themselves over, there is no possibility of co-working with one another.</p>
<p>Brother Nee spoke in this way because of our history and background. In the twenty-six years between 1922 and 1948, many differing opinions and views prevented Brother Nee from going forward. Our history has shown that those who had many opinions also had no light, no revelation, and no commission from God. Now our situation has changed; we can look back over our fifty years of history and see that God indeed entrusted Brother Nee with both light and vision. During that time, however, many opinions filled the sky with clouds and fog. Brother Nee wanted everyone to hand himself over so that there could be a way to go forward.</p><h2 class="head1">KEEPING UP WITH THE LORD&rsquo;S WAY TODAY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Turn to the Spirit<br />
and Live in the Spirit in the Age of the Spirit</h2>
<p>We must admit that the way the Lord is taking today is different from the way that He took twenty or thirty years ago. Today we are in the age of the spirit, and we must turn to our spirit and live in our spirit. When we began to take this way in Taiwan in 1961, I wrote at least eighty-five hymns, and three-quarters of them were on the Spirit and Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Keeping Up with the Lord&rsquo;s Vision</h2>
<p>Regrettably, many among us still adhere to the old ways of twenty or thirty years ago. Even though we have had a new beginning in Taiwan concerning our practice of living in spirit, hardly anyone has kept up. Even though a few dozen brothers tried to stress this matter after having some fellowship in the United States in 1970, nothing definite happened, and no one has paid attention to this matter. For example, hardly anyone sings the new hymns, because the atmosphere here is not according to the flow. Our practice of calling on the name of the Lord is also slowly disappearing, and even though it has not disappeared, we have long departed from our original practice.</p>
<p>In principle, our present condition in Taiwan is not much different from our former condition on the mainland. Although the Lord&rsquo;s vision has advanced, we have not kept up with it. Although we work hard and it seems as if we are endeavoring to go forward, we are, in fact, taking one step forward and then one step backward. As a result, we are back to where we started. In Southeast Asia and Taiwan the churches seem to be in the same condition that we were in twenty years ago.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Reasons for Not Going Forward</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Being Neither for nor against the Lord&rsquo;s Way<br />
but Being Only Spectators</h2>
<p>According to my observation and study, the leading ones in Southeast Asia and Taiwan view the way that the Lord is taking today as if they were only spectators. They are not against it, but neither are they for it. A flock follows the head sheep, but if the leading ones do not go in this direction, the flock will not be able to go on. How can the leading ones expect the flock to go on when they themselves do not take this way?</p>
<h2 class="head3">Behaving as Spectators Resulting in<br />
Difficult Situations and a Loss of the Lord&rsquo;s Blessing</h2>
<p>Because some of the leading ones have an attitude of a spectator, they go back to the old ways as soon as there is a slight problem in implementing the new way. However, when they turn away, they can only go back to the arrangements of previous decades. This causes the saints to lose sight of the goal, and as soon as the goal is lost, there is inevitably some discord. Thus, it becomes difficult to lead the church as well as the work. When there is no goal and no way on our side, there is no ground for the Lord to bestow blessings on His side.</p>
<p>This resembles the situation in Judges 17:6, which says, &ldquo;In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did that which was right in his own eyes.&rdquo; Everyone doing that which was right in his own eyes means that everyone acted according to his own will. This does not sound good, but it is often the case. Without a vision and goal, one brother will rely on his own spiritual experiences, and another brother will rely on his. Thus, both will carry out different things. As a result, there will be many captains on one ship, but there will be no clear way to steer the ship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO REPENT AND TURN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Confessing and Repenting<br />
for Not Going Forward in the Lord&rsquo;s Flow</h2>
<p>Since this is our condition today, we must turn. We must confess to the Lord that we have not moved forward absolutely with His flow in His way. We need the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness. This is more important than confessing other sins to the Lord. We need to repent and turn.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Confessing and Repenting<br />
for Violating the Testimony of Oneness</h2>
<p>When we do not move forward in the Lord&rsquo;s flow, we have no way to go on. This forces us to stay in the things that we learned previously. As a word of warning, I must honestly say that relying on what we have learned in the past will divide the church. Although the brothers have no intention of causing division, the result will be division because some will practice what they have learned and others will practice what they have learned. When everyone follows their past practices, the result will be division.</p>
<p>Apart from considering the many believers who are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we can realize that even a five-member basketball team will be divided if they do not have the same game plan. The team will be divided even if all five are world-renowned experts in their own right. They will be divided over their expertise, their basketball training, and their accomplishments. Even though they are all highly trained and accomplished in basketball, it will be difficult for the team to win, because they are divided. This is not a matter of whether they can play basketball well as individuals but a matter of whether there is one game plan for the whole team. If we are a member of such a &ldquo;basketball team,&rdquo; we must repent for violating the principle of the team. Teammates must be one on the court. A game plan is secondary; oneness is primary. The players must be one no matter how they play. Not being one violates the principle of the team. Our situation today is that we are not one. May the Lord have mercy on us; He knows our situation. The Lord wants us to repent before it is too late.</p>
<p>The principle of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony is oneness. Since we have violated the principle of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, we must confess our sin before the Lord and repent for it. Today it is not possible to be one if there are different ways. Our oneness is based on the ground of the church and on being in spirit. We must be in spirit. If we are not in spirit, we have no way to be one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT ASKING FOR ONENESS OUTWARDLY<br />
BUT BEING CONTROLLED AND GOVERNED BY VISION</h2>
<p>I am afraid that some will hear my speaking and think that I am charging all the localities to repeat the messages that I am giving. If people think this, they are wrong. I have no intention of asking us to just repeat these messages; rather, I hope that we will see the vision that the Lord wants us to live in spirit on the ground of oneness so that He can transform us and have a way to prepare His bride.</p>
<p>If we see this vision, we will not be distracted by other doctrines, nor will we even have a desire to talk about them. We will feel that the other doctrines are tasteless, and we will not be interested in them. We will only know the Lord of all, who is our God, who is our Redeemer and Savior, and who has become the life-giving Spirit in resurrection to dwell in our spirit. He wants to be our life and everything, and He wants us to live by Him and live with Him. In this mingled spirit we are being transformed and built together. This is the vision that the Lord is showing us today. If we have seen this and if we live in this governing and controlling vision, we will not be interested in anything else.</p>
<p>We all must be in spirit; this is a basic exercise. Then we should bring the church, that is, bring the brothers and sisters, to live in the spirit. There is a rich supply of materials among us related to this burden. Hence, I am not asking us to be megaphones that broadcast whatever I speak. I want us to see a vision, to be governed and controlled by it, and to live in it. There is a rich supply of material that can help us in our speaking concerning these matters. If we digest these materials and then release the word in fellowship with a group of brothers and sisters in our localities, the churches will receive a substantial supply.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIVING IN THE SPIRIT<br />
AND STANDING ON THE GROUND</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO INSTRUCT THE YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
CONCERNING THE MATTER OF THE GROUND</h2>
<p>Over the years, &ldquo;Living in the spirit! Standing on the ground!&rdquo; has become a rallying cry among us. When Brother T. Austin-Sparks came to Taiwan in 1957, he caused a problem related to the ground of the church. Since then, however, the matter of the ground has become firmer and clearer among us. Nevertheless, we must not forget to instruct the young people, who have come into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery since then, concerning the ground of the church.</p>
<p>The young people who have moved from the Far East to the United States in recent years have not been clear concerning the ground. There are some from Taiwan who have little realization of the importance of the ground. This shows that the brothers in Taiwan have been short in leading the saints. The responsible brothers in each hall should know who is migrating or studying abroad and fellowship with them before they go. According to my observation, however, the brothers in Taiwan seem to have done nothing. It seems as if no effort has been made to care for the brothers and sisters who have gone abroad. This reveals a shortage in our service. When saints go to the United States, they encounter Christian groups who are focused on gaining Chinese immigrants. These groups say, &ldquo;We are Chinese, we speak Chinese, and we have the Chinese culture. Come and meet with us.&rdquo; The brothers in Hong Kong and Taiwan should tell the saints who are going to the United States about such groups.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters in the Far East must care for the saints who are moving from the Far East to the United States. We must care for each one who goes to the United States, whether it is to reside or to study there. They need some understanding of the truth and also some realization concerning the efforts of such Chinese groups. I hope that the brothers in the Far East will understand and take this matter seriously. Our handling of this matter has been loose, and many people have been drawn away. Despite this history, however, we seem unconcerned. This is wrong. We should not neglect anyone who is moving from the Far East to the United States; instead, we should be cautious and give heed to this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORK IN AMERICA<br />
NEEDING TO BE AMONG AMERICANS</h2>
<p>I cannot spend extra time to care for the brothers and sisters from the Far East in America because the environment does not allow for it. If I spend even a little time or strength to care for the brothers and sisters from the Far East, the Lord&rsquo;s leading among the American brothers and sisters will be affected. According to the burden that I have received from the Lord personally, I must spend a hundred percent of my time, energy, and strength to lead the American brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>In the history of Christianity in America, no preacher from China has ever succeeded in spreading the Lord&rsquo;s work in America. Preachers from China could only do a so-called Chinese work in Chinatowns. History also tells us, however, that a Chinese work in Chinatown has no future, because the older generation of Chinese does not understand English, whereas the next generation of Chinese understands the English language better than the Chinese language. Then, as they become Americanized, they leave Chinatown. As a result, a work in Chinatown cannot produce a succeeding generation. Such a work is gone after one generation, but Chinese preachers work in Chinatown because they have no way to work among the Americans. Nevertheless, as more and more students from the Far East begin to study in the United States, these preachers see an opportunity to work among the Chinese.</p>
<p>Currently, there are at least one to two hundred Chinese students in every state university; some even have three to five hundred. A percentage of these students is saved, and they meet with the denominations or free groups. When they arrive in America, they are unfamiliar with the place and the people, and they are different from Americans in their customs, social relationships, living, and habits. Consequently, they seek out their fellow countrymen, and as Christians, they seek out fellow Christians.</p>
<p>Among the Chinese, there are Christians who are sincere in their zealousness and willingness to establish Christian groups to preach to these Chinese immigrants. This is the basis of the Christian work among the Chinese in the United States. Some young Chinese preachers have gone to the United States to meet this need. Their work in America is actually a work among Chinese students. However, this work has no future because students are very mobile, and they move after they graduate. Thus, it is impossible to establish a foundational work in any locality. Americans do not intentionally shun the Chinese, but if a meeting is thirty percent Chinese, Americans may come to one meeting, but they will not return, because they think that it is only a Chinese meeting. This is a great problem.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that there are many Chinese coming to America, I was not sent to the United States to take care of the Chinese. If the Lord wanted me to work with the Chinese, He did not need to send me to America. The work with the Chinese should be done in Taiwan and Hong Kong. If I had gone to the United States to do a Chinese work, it would have been against the principle of the Bible. We must never seek to establish &ldquo;Chinese churches&rdquo; in the United States.</p>
<p>How can a Chinese preacher work among Americans? The United States is a Christian nation, and if the Americans know what we know, how can we gain them? When we contact the Americans, however, we are able to present things that they have never seen or heard. We are able to speak of the vision of the age that has been entrusted to us as the Lord&rsquo;s special testimony. This draws the Americans and opens up the door for our work among them. We need to devote our time to taking care of this open door. If we spend all our time with the Chinese, our work among the Americans will be affected, and our work in America will not be fruitful.</p>
<p>We are the only group of Chinese preachers in history who have been able to fruitfully work for the Lord among Americans. Now there is a testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in many of the major cities in the United States, from the East Coast to the West Coast and from the north to the south. Currently, there are over thirty local churches in America. Consequently, I do not have a burden from the Lord or the strength to train and lead the brothers and sisters from the Far East.</p>
<p>A brother recently said to me, &ldquo;It may have been necessary in the past to not work with the Chinese in the United States but now may be the time.&rdquo; I disagreed with this word because I cannot start a work among the Chinese in America. If I do this, our work among the Americans will rapidly decline. By God&rsquo;s mercy and grace, we have been able to work and focus entirely upon Americans. This is a strategic development. The Lord led us to the United States, and this strategy has been effective. The results that we are seeing today are the issue of this strategy. It would be wrong for us to sacrifice thousands of Americans to care for the Chinese who are coming to America, because the Lord has not sent us to the United States to do a work among the Chinese.</p><h2 class="head1">CARING FOR BOTH THE SPIRIT AND THE GROUND</h2>
<p>We should not think that we need to care only for the spirit but not for the ground. There are two sides to every matter, including the church. With the church, the ground speaks of the outward testimony, whereas the spirit speaks of the inner content. Although we cannot neglect the inner content by caring only for the ground, neither should we disregard the ground and care only for the spirit. We must care for both aspects.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Refusing to Accept the Ground of the Church</h2>
<p>In order to see the importance of the ground, I would like to give a testimony. In 1957 Brother T. Austin-Sparks came to Taiwan a second time. During this time there was a great contention because a brother among us raised a question concerning the ground of the church. In 1938 Brother Nee went to England and stayed with Brother Sparks for a period of time. After Brother Nee returned in 1939, he told me that the principles of spiritual life that we had seen would resonate only with Brother Sparks and the group who was with him. He also said, however, that they were unwilling to accept many of the matters that the Lord had shown us concerning the practice of the church.</p>
<p>When Brother T. Austin-Sparks came to Taiwan in 1957, I knew that he was not open to the matter of the ground of the church. However, we still invited him to come in the hope that we could receive some spiritual help based on his spiritual portion. We had no desire to contend with him over the matter of the ground. Nevertheless, he said to me, &ldquo;When I saw something the first time I came, I was determined not to say anything at that time.&rdquo; This showed that he had an intention to say something the second time that he came. Then, when a brother raised a question concerning the ground with him, there was a contention.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Desiring to Establish Ministry Centers in Various Places</h2>
<p>As soon as the contention began, I realized that he had no thought of establishing local churches. Instead, he desired to establish ministry centers in various places on the earth. He once told me that he was willing to move to Taiwan, indicating his desire to establish a ministry center in Taipei. In addition, he also wanted to establish ministry centers in Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Singapore. He felt that he could help people by flying to and ministering in places such as New York, Taiwan, and Hong Kong at various times of the year. All those who were helped by his ministry could then spread his ministry among various denominations. Then those who were gained from the denominations would gather together with him during his next visit. This was his strategy.</p>
<p>This strategy, however, cannot work. First, those who were helped by him would be scattered in various denominations doing an underground work. They would not meet regularly together, and they would be dependent upon the limited supply rendered during his conference in their city. This alone would doom the work to failure. Second, the denominations would have a negative feeling toward Brother T. Austin-Sparks, and they would refuse to let some do an underground work in their midst. Various denominations even stated that those who were already doing an underground work would have to leave because they were not like-minded with those in the denomination. Hence, it was not possible for this strategy to ever work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Visiting Brother Sparks</h2>
<p>Brother Sparks&rsquo;s second visit to Taiwan caused a great contention, and it was clear that he did not care for the matter of the ground of the church. When I accompanied him to Hong Kong during his second visit, he invited me several times to come to England, but I did not accept. In 1958 I still had some hope that the brothers among us who had been affected by Brother Sparks would turn. Therefore, I felt that I should go to England, to the place of his ministry, and see the situation of his work. Before I even went, however, those who had been affected by Brother Sparks had already determined to oppose me if my response, upon returning from England, was not positive.</p>
<p>When I came to T. Austin-Sparks&rsquo;s place, I openly told him that I did not come to England with an intention of doing any work but to have a good fellowship with him concerning the Lord&rsquo;s interest on the earth today and the Lord&rsquo;s work. He then took me from London to Scotland for a week. We did not have meetings while I was there; we only fellowshipped over this matter. We talked every day, twice a day. We were polite in our fellowship, with both being somewhat advanced in age. He had his British diplomacy, and I had my Chinese etiquette, but when we sat down to talk, we had substantial fellowship.</p>
<p>One morning as we were sitting outside and before I began to speak, he said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, when I departed from Taipei to Hong Kong in April 1957, the flow within me stopped as soon as my plane took off, and it has not been restored even to this day.&rdquo; He was sincere, and he spoke clearly concerning his actual inner condition. Then he said, &ldquo;I rose up very early this morning to cry out to the Lord in His presence, asking Him why He has not restored the flow. After I prayed, I felt that I needed a little change.&rdquo; I was disappointed because he spoke only of a need for a change by moving to another place. I responded, saying, &ldquo;Brother, I also feel that you need a change, but you do not need a change in place.&rdquo; When he heard this, being an intelligent person, he knew what I was going to say next, which was that he needed a change in his concept related to the ground of the church. He was unable to receive what I said, however, no matter how I tried.</p><h2 class="head2">Fellowshipping over the Ground of the Church</h2>
<p>We talked over the course of a week. The last time we talked, he took me to a large house with a quiet room upstairs. This time I began to speak first, and I asked, &ldquo;Brother, when you go out to work, do you hope that people would be helped by your ministry?&rdquo; When he said, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;After they receive your help, where should they go?&rdquo; When he did not reply, I asked, &ldquo;If they cannot go someplace, how can they meet together?&rdquo; He still did not reply. Then I asked, &ldquo;Brother, can the light and the vision that we have seen concerning the Body of Christ be practiced in the denominations?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo; Then I asked, &ldquo;If it cannot be practiced in the denominations, where can it be practiced?&rdquo; He had no answer. Since I was shortly about to leave, I was quite burdened that he would face the consequences of his thinking.</p>
<p>Then he said, &ldquo;Brother, please do not think that I do not care for the church. I care for the church, but the church must be one hundred percent out of the Spirit; it must be a work done by the Spirit in order for it to be absolutely of the Spirit.&rdquo; This was a serious matter to him, so I responded, &ldquo;Brother, you have been in our midst twice. You have visited Taiwan from north to south, and you have seen over fifty churches among us. Is it possible that all these churches are of the flesh, having nothing of the Spirit?&rdquo; He could not reply, because he had testified in Taiwan that he had never seen believers as good as the ones in Taiwan in his entire life of ministry and preaching. When he returned to the West, he even showed people pictures and spoke highly of the situation in Taiwan. At this point, he knew that there was no way I could change, and I knew that he would not repent. At the end of our talk, we both were clear concerning the position of the other, and we stopped discussing the matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Touching God&rsquo;s Government<br />
by Opposing the Ground of the Church</h2>
<p>In 1964 a group of people in Manila, together with dissenters in Taiwan, invited Brother T. Austin-Sparks to the Far East. He went to the Philippines for four weeks and then planned to come to Taipei. A group in Singapore, who coordinated with the group in Manila, also invited him to speak in Singapore. The dissenters thought that when he came to Taiwan, they would have a great victory, and the church would be finished. They also believed that this would happen when he went to Singapore.</p>
<p>Concerning this situation, the responsible brothers in Taiwan could only cry out to the Lord and pray. Then a telegram came from London for Brother Sparks, saying that his only son, a healthy man about forty years old, had passed away suddenly. He immediately returned, and the potential for turmoil was quickly diffused in Taiwan.</p>
<p>I do not like to speak about such tragic matters, but Brother T. Austin-Sparks told me himself that the flow within him stopped when he left Hong Kong in 1957. According to my personal observation, his high ministry began to decline at this point, and it declined rapidly. I even told the brothers that I was very worried for him, because in his opposition to the ground of the church, he was touching the government of God. If the ground of the church was something only of our doing, it would not matter how much he opposed it. However, if the ground of the church is according to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in this age, it is a tremendous matter. Brother Austin-Sparks did not err morally or in his deeds, but he opposed God governmentally. This is a severe and serious thing. We can see in the decade following the turmoil in Taiwan that there has been no blessing upon the opposers or their work. Instead, there have been repeated divisions among themselves.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STANDING ON THE GROUND AND LIVING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>It is the Lord&rsquo;s mercy that we are standing on the ground today, but we should not think that standing on the ground alone is sufficient to be the Lord&rsquo;s living testimony. We must still have content, which is related to the spirit. If we lack the spirit, there will be disputes even if we are standing on the ground. If we have truly seen the ground and have learned the lessons associated with it, the ground will prevent us from being divided when there are disputes. The ground is the means for the Lord&rsquo;s preservation, but if we continue to dispute because of a lack of the spirit, the Lord will have no way to truly go on.</p>
<p>Thus, we need to practice living in the spirit with the Lord. The leading ones should help the brothers and sisters live in the spirit with the Lord. If the co-workers and elders are not one and in the spirit, our testimony before the Lord is finished. For example, one elder may advocate a practice related to prayer, another to silent prayer only, and still another to a practice related to being broken. All these ideas may be good, but if a local church receives three different opinions from three different elders, there will be no leading in one accord. I am worried that in some places the condition of the church is even lower due to the assertion of natural authority in the flesh. These kinds of situations cause us to lose our testimony before the Lord. Even if we stand on the ground, Satan will mock us, saying, &ldquo;What are you doing on the ground? You are acting in the flesh. You are on the ground of oneness, but you still love the world. Moreover, you also covet men&rsquo;s appreciation, and you hope to gain their support.&rdquo; God knows these things, Satan knows these things, and we know these things. How can we bring the brothers and sisters into living in the spirit with the Lord under such conditions? It is impossible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FLEEING INTO THE SPIRIT TO BE ONE<br />
AND TO BRING IN THE LORD&rsquo;S BLESSING</h2>
<p>If such conditions are not uprooted from our midst, I am not optimistic about the way ahead of us. The ground is right and even precious, but the content of our testimony on the ground is a serious matter. We must go before the Lord and humble ourselves and say, &ldquo;Lord, cleanse me; cause me to repent for all these things.&rdquo; Now we can understand why Paul spoke of fleeing for refuge in Hebrews 6:18. We need to flee indeed; we need to flee from our prejudices, our feelings, our earthly element, our uncleanness, and even our spiritual cultivation and accomplishments. If we do not flee such things, it will not be possible for us to be one with the brothers. Being in such a position is dangerous.</p>
<p>By birth, each of us has his own personality and disposition. How is it possible for us to be one? We must flee within the veil into our spirit. We can be one only in the spirit. When we are in the spirit, there is no insistence on our part for anything related to our natural inclinations. In fact, we do not even have any natural inclinations.</p>
<p>I hope that every brother will go before the Lord and let the Lord thoroughly shine upon him. We may be standing on the ground of oneness, but do we want something else, something other than the spirit? If we bring in other things, we will cause damage. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may flee from these things into our spirit to live within the veil. Once we are within the veil, the life that we live will be the life of the Body of Christ. In every locality we should not only lead the church outwardly but also have a living testimony of the Body in spirit. The Body of Christ is in the spirit, and if the brothers are in spirit, the reality of the Body of Christ will be manifested. We must be in spirit and follow our spirit in our leading of the church. If we do this, God, who is the living Spirit, will confirm and bless our work with His presence among us.</p>
<p>Without this, there can only be different opinions and different proposals on how to lead the church because one brother will feel to do one thing, and another brother will feel to do something different. If we take this way, we will destroy ourselves. Even if we are able to show some self-restraint outwardly, Satan will know that we are not in the spirit and thus not one inwardly. This will surely cause us to lose the Lord&rsquo;s presence and blessing. May the Lord have mercy on us. We need a thorough turn to the spirit so that we all may be one. Then we will be victorious in one spirit. This is what the Lord wants today. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">PUTTING OFF THE INFLUENCE OF TRADITION<br />
AND SUPPLYING LIFE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE INFLUENCE OF TRADITIONAL CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>For many years we have been influenced by Christianity not only in our teachings but also in our practices. The study of education confirms that demonstrative patterns or practices are far more influential than words. Children copy what they see and hear. For example, when children see Western gunfights on television, they respond by playing with toy guns. Before we were saved or even joined a Christian denomination, we had some realization regarding Christian practices, and when we saw the situation with our own eyes, our understanding of these practices became governing concepts. For example, before we were saved, we may have had some realization that Christians should be zealous in their work for the Lord, and after we were saved, we made a determination to be zealous. When we saw other Christians being zealous, we responded in the same way. This shows that we have been under the influence of others, whether we love the Lord or not and whether we are zealous or not.</p>
<p>There are several aspects to the influence of traditional Christianity. First, being a Christian is commonly assumed to involve human effort. Consequently, it is assumed that in order to be a proper Christian, we only need to be taught or to listen to sermons. Whether a particular speaking is high or low, spiritual or unspiritual, or right or wrong, the purpose of a sermon is assumed to be to give us teachings to keep. Even matters such as prayer and the pursuit of holiness are associated with human effort. Thus, to many, being a Christian involves human effort.</p>
<p>Second, we are deeply influenced by the neglect of the exercise of the spirit in Christian worship. No Christian, even you or I, has put off this influence absolutely. There have been many movements in reaction to the neglect of the exercise of the spirit. For example, the Pentecostal movement rose up in reaction to the dull, traditional ways of worship; however, the Pentecostal movement reacted to the point of being completely without order. We must admit that we are still under the influence of the traditions of Christianity in our living and in our meetings. Our living depends on human effort, and our meetings depend on habitual modes of worship. Even in our prayer and in our exercise of the spirit, we follow a habitual mode that is not fully living, and it is easy for us to quickly turn a practice into an inflexible habit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN LIFE BEING A LIVING WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>According to the revelation in the Bible, especially in the New Testament, the Christian living is a living that is one with the Lord. Paul says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). He also says, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21). His living with the Lord was not the result of teaching or human effort; rather, it was the issue of his moment-by-moment and day-by-day contact with the Lord. We all know these verses, but we still do not have such a Christian living. Instead, we are accustomed to habits involving human effort, which do not have much element of the spirit. Although we know that we should live in the spirit, we follow methods in our actual practice. We are rarely in a condition of living in the spirit. Our human effort rather than our living with the Lord proves that we have been very much influenced by Christianity.</p>
<p>Breathing does not involve a conscious human effort; it is part of our spontaneous living. If someone needs to &ldquo;work&rdquo; in order to breathe, I am afraid that he will not be alive for very long. Our breathing is not worked out but lived out spontaneously. According to the revelation in the Bible, our Christian living should be as spontaneous as breathing; when we use our spirit to contact the Lord every moment, we are breathing spiritually. Our meetings should not be according to a set way; they should be an expression that comes out of our spiritual breathing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETINGS NOT HAVING A SET WAY<br />
BUT FOLLOWING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>People have spent considerable time studying the Bible concerning how Christians should meet, but it is difficult to find a set way. Many examples are given, and some even seem to be contradictory. For example, in 1 Corinthians 12:29 Paul asks, &ldquo;Are all apostles? Are all prophets?&rdquo; yet in 14:31 he says, &ldquo;You can all prophesy one by one.&rdquo; Verse 29 in chapter 12 suggests that not everyone is a prophet, but 14:31 says that all can prophesy one by one. Do these two verses contradict each other? There is no clear answer to this seeming contradiction. We can only say that the verse in chapter 12 refers to the person of the prophet, whereas the verse in chapter 14 refers to the speaking activity and action of prophesying.</p>
<p>There also seems to be a contradiction related to women speaking in the meeting. In verse 5 of chapter 11 Paul says, &ldquo;Every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head; for it is one and the same as she who is shaved.&rdquo; According to the context, a woman can speak in a meeting if her head is covered; however, in verse 34 of chapter 14 he says, &ldquo;Women should be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak.&rdquo; This verse clearly says that women should not speak in the church.</p>
<p>According to the truth, it is not fitting for sisters to teach in the meetings. However, it is too legal to forbid the sisters from speaking at all in a meeting. In the past we were influenced by the Brethren, and we felt that the sisters should not preach or even pray. Slowly, however, we began to allow the sisters to pray and testify. Because the gifts of Peace Wang and Ruth Lee were so evident, a place was arranged for them to speak to the sisters. But then the brothers complained that they could not listen; consequently, a folding screen was placed between the brothers and sisters so that the brothers could listen. This shows that there would be a shortage in the meetings if the sisters were not able to speak.</p>
<p>We should be in the spirit with all things. We should be flexible and not care too much for our views and rules. We should not intentionally overthrow our ways, but neither should we keep to rigid routines. We must learn not to follow our old methods in our gatherings, because the Spirit is always fresh. Even in pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word we should not keep to old forms. This requires that we have genuine contact with the Lord and a living relationship with Him. It is easy to follow our old ways, but it is not as easy to be new every day. No one likes to start things again and again, but in spiritual matters we need to have living contact with the Lord daily in order to take the Lord as our new beginning. We should never have an &ldquo;old&rdquo; day, and we should not rely on our former experiences or past teachings.</p><h2 class="head1">HELPING PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We should not use our former experiences to &ldquo;teach&rdquo; others. No one can become spiritual because of teachings, and no one is so spiritual that he does not need to contact the Lord. Spirituality is like breathing. Even though a person may have been breathing for eighty years, he will die if he does not breathe today. When a person is born, he must breathe in order to live, and if he lives to be eighty years old, he still must breathe in order to not die. This principle applies to our spiritual life. When Brother Watchman Nee ministered in mainland China, he fell ill several times, but he still ministered in the meetings and called on the Lord loudly. He overcame his physical pain. He maintained his life and service by constantly breathing, contacting, and eating and drinking the Lord. Brother Nee was a Christian whose living was not a matter of human effort.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HAVING MAN-MADE SPIRITUALITY<br />
BUT LIVING CONSTANTLY IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Brother Nee once said sadly to me, &ldquo;Brother Witness, it is incredible! Christians can lie.&rdquo; He said this because some Christians were incriminating him with lies. It was hard for me to believe that Christians could lie. Gradually, I came to know that Christians are capable of anything if they are not in spirit. Furthermore, I learned that the results that come from the human efforts of Christians are not reliable. There may be some positive results today, but their efforts will fail tomorrow. Being a Christian is a matter of a living, not of human effort.</p>
<p>By the time I was in my sixties, I had seen many things, but I never saw an occasion as wild as what occurred in Hong Kong one year. At that time, about fifty dissenters came to the meeting hall in Hong Kong and stood outside the door. The elders were worried that they would cause a disturbance, so they did not want to open the door. When the dissenters said that they would not do anything, the door was opened. Once the door was opened, however, they came in shouting and striking things; it was like a riot. One of the brothers among them, who specialized in preaching spirituality, even turned off the lights, frightening nearly a thousand people who were left in the dark. When the lights were turned back on, a dissenter rushed onto the platform. Some young men saw this, and they took him off the platform. He responded by striking out at them, and the young brothers had to restrain him. I would have never imagined that Christians could do such things. This shows that man-made spirituality is worthless and unreliable; we have no need for man-made spirituality.</p>
<p>We must look to the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and live in the Spirit constantly. If we are not living in the Spirit, we will depend on our &ldquo;spiritual seniority.&rdquo; However, as soon as we are not living in the Spirit, our doctrinal understanding is worthless. We must bring people to the Lord, who is the living Spirit, and help them to live in this living Spirit. Only this is reliable; everything else is unreliable.</p>
<p>We must no longer try to work out a spiritual living; instead, we should look to the Lord for His mercy so that we may practically live in Him and spontaneously live in the Spirit. If we do not live in the Spirit, there will only be disputes and quarrels; I believe that we all have had such experiences. The only way that can save us and deliver us from ourselves is to live in the Spirit, in our living Lord.</p>
<p>Once we are in the meetings, we must forget about keeping rules or following past procedures; instead, we should simply exercise our spirit and release our spirit. We can read the Bible, sing hymns, testify, or share, but we must never adhere to methods. We just need to exercise our spirit and release our spirit in order to go forward on the right track.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SOME PRACTICES CONCERNING SUPPLYING THE WORD</h2>
<p>Even if we have seen the vision, know the way that the Lord is taking today, and know how to lead the brothers and sisters, we still need the supply of the word. Supplying the word is not something that should be difficult or dull. There are many ways to do it. For example, the churches in the United States are not all the same; they have many different practices. In principle, they use the same material, but they differ only in how the material is used. Although the material is the same, they are not rigid in how it is used.</p>
<p>In some churches all the brothers and sisters read one printed message per week. When they meet together on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, they share what they have read and gained. In such a gathering, the saints stand up one by one to share the supply that they have received from the message. They rarely speak for over a minute, but their speaking is very living and rich. Thus, within an hour and a half, as many as one hundred saints have shared. This practice is very fresh, lively, and rich.</p>
<p>Another church asks four or five brothers to read a message. They not only read the message, but they come together and fellowship over it. Then in the meeting of the church they lead everyone in the reading of the message. They do not necessarily read from the first page to the last. When they finish reading, the brothers take turns to say something about the message, but they do not simply repeat the printed message. Instead, they speak from their spirit, and then the other brothers and sisters share. This is also very living and very good.</p>
<p>Yet another church asks some brothers to read through a message thoroughly and summarize it into an outline. The outline is then handed out to the brothers and sisters during the meeting. Everyone reads and pray-reads the verses, and then they read the outline. After reading the outline, everyone shares. This also is very rich. Sometimes the leading ones may say more, but there is no set rule. In short, the important point is to not rigidly repeat the message but to apply it very flexibly. Nevertheless, the specific center, the basic content, is the same.</p>
<p>If we really see this, we will not act individualistically when we serve in our respective localities. When we lead and supply the local churches, we must fellowship in one spirit and seek the way that the Lord has given to us. In principle, we must be in the center of the vision and keep up with the Lord&rsquo;s flow. The way that each locality takes in practice, however, depends on the responsible brothers in each locality having fellowship in one spirit; it should not be according to anyone&rsquo;s method. A leading from the Lord will come out of the fellowship in one spirit, and then we should lead according to this leading. Only then can the Lord bless us.</p>
<p>When a local church has outside visitors, for example, we have a habit of inviting them to give a message. Inviting visitors to give a message is altogether a dead rule that must have no place in our meetings. When brothers visit, everyone who meets together should exercise his spirit. We should not be focused on whether a certain one speaks or does not speak. Everyone must be in the spirit, and the Spirit should lead; then there will be a supply. Once I was in a meeting, and the brothers invited me to speak after the saints were finished. Although I had something to say, I did not say anything. We should eliminate the thought of always inviting visitors to speak. In our gatherings a person whose spirit is released should speak, and a person whose spirit is not released should not speak. It is not necessary to always invite someone to speak. Neither is it necessary to never invite someone to speak. When a certain elderly co-worker from the Far East went to a meeting of a church in the United States and no one asked him to give a message, he marveled that the church did not invite him to speak. If someone has the leading of the Spirit and a burden, he should speak; being in the spirit in a meeting is all that matters. It does not matter whether one is a local saint, a visiting saint, a new saint, or an experienced saint; living absolutely in the spirit is all that matters.</p><h2 class="head1">KEEPING UP WITH THE FLOW TO TURN THE AGE</h2>
<p>I hope the elderly saints would see that the age has turned. Whether we are an elder or a responsible one, we must realize that there is a flow that is moving forward today. This forward-moving current often may seem turbulent. The modernizing current in Chinese history came at the end of the Ching Dynasty, and no one could stop the current. Those who were wise kept up with it, and those who did not were eliminated. I have studied history seriously, and I know the development of world history, especially over the past hundred years. In my study I see one thing: when the current comes, we must keep up with it, because no one can stop it. It is the same in the Bible. The Lord&rsquo;s move is an unstoppable flow. If the churches want to remain in the way of the past twenty or thirty years, we will fall behind and soon be eliminated.</p>
<p>The truth does not change, but the truth always advances. From Enoch to Noah, from Abraham to David, the truth was advancing. In the New Testament John the Baptist came. His father, Zachariah, was a priest (Luke 1:8-9); hence, John was born a priest. Yet when he came out to serve, he changed the traditions and did everything in a new way. He had a garment of camel&rsquo;s hair and a leather girdle around his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey. He did not live in the temple but in the wilderness; he was altogether new in appearance (Matt. 3:4; Luke 3:2-3). Nevertheless, John intrinsically participated in the reality of the things in the Old Testament temple. Similarly, our spirit is not different, but the exercise of our spirit has advanced. Whenever God&rsquo;s people reach a point of doing spiritual things without the spirit, the Lord must have a new beginning, and this brings in a new flow.</p>
<p>In the Far East today, Japan and South Korea do not yet have this problem, but from Taiwan to Indonesia, all the localities have a problem of not making way for the coming of a newer flow. When the flow comes, it is unyielding and uncompromising; everyone must keep up with the spiritual flow. Those who do not keep up with the spiritual flow will be left behind. No one among the twelve apostles whom the Lord Jesus chose was more than thirty years old. When the Lord came, there was a beginning of a new flow that required the coordination of people without oldness in their background.</p>
<p>All the brothers and sisters participating in the service, whether co-workers, elders, or various responsible ones, must see that they can no longer live according to their old experiences and old statuses. A new age has come, and we should keep up with it if we can. If we cannot keep up with it, we should know our limitations and withdraw ourselves, giving room to the able ones so that the younger generation may move forward. All those who have such feelings should give room. Giving such room comes from the great wisdom of knowing one&rsquo;s inability to keep up with the flow of the present age. When the older generation in a family can no longer handle things, either due to capacity, age, strength, or energy, they hand the family business over to their sons or grandsons. Even though the older ones may not be able to keep up with every matter, their rich experiences can still help the next generation to go forward in a good way.</p>
<p>The older ones should see that the age has turned, but the younger ones should respect and obey the older ones. The young people should also never drop the flow or compromise the flow. Their obedience must strengthen the Lord&rsquo;s flow. No matter what the condition of the older brothers is, the younger ones must release their spirit at the bread-breaking meeting. Even if the older brothers are set in an old method, the spirit of the younger ones must be released. The younger ones must be the Lord&rsquo;s army in the meetings to fight for the proper functioning and to swallow up all death with life. Even if a long message is given on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, the younger ones should still be overflowing and filled with life.</p>
<p>The co-workers should be clear about our current situation and not give long messages. Forty-five minutes is sufficient for a message that used to take sixty-five minutes. Give the younger ones an opportunity to bring in the flow; everyone needs to cooperate in this. If the elders say that a message should still be given on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, then the younger ones should receive this fellowship. At the same time, the co-workers who used to give messages for thirty-five minutes should speak for only eighteen minutes. Their speaking should be strong in spirit as well as simple, concise, and clear in content and expression. The remaining seventeen minutes should be handed over to the younger ones for them to speak. If the younger ones truly have something, everyone will approve. We should take this spiritual way, and the younger ones must be bold. They should not be discouraged if the elders arrange for messages to be given. Our spirit should be strong in order to deal with the old ways whenever they appear. Nevertheless, we should obey the elders, because what they say is good. We must be able to adapt to the situation. In the end I believe that there will be changes, and the age will turn.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING STRONG IN SPIRIT TO SUPPLY LIFE</h2>
<p>In 1950 I went to a certain locality. During one meeting a leading one, who later became a dissenting one, said, &ldquo;On behalf of all the co-workers, I hand over all the work to Brother Lee.&rdquo; Another one, who likewise became a dissenting one, then stood up on behalf of the elders and said, &ldquo;We hand this church over to Brother Lee to be under his leading.&rdquo; Then a group of deacons said, &ldquo;We hand over everything here to be under the leading of Brother Lee.&rdquo; In response, I said, &ldquo;Well, if this is the case, we will have no change in personnel; the co-workers will still be co-workers, the elders will still be elders, and the deacons will still be deacons, but our ways should be different. From now on we should renew our ways of serving, working, and meeting and discard all our old ways.&rdquo; I then made arrangements for two sisters to be responsible for the church business office. I stayed there for several months, but as soon as I went back to Taiwan, the leading brother went into the business office and changed everything back to the way it was before. When I went back to this locality, the two sisters in the business office said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, we could not work because all your arrangements were changed after you left.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Be patient. They changed it, but we can start over again.&rdquo; This went on for a decade. I knew in my heart that they did not want me to do much, but the Lord still sent me there to supply life. My spirit was strong, and I supplied life positively.</p>
<p>My speaking in the meetings there was always strong in spirit, and I was never affected by what they did. I knew only to supply life even more strongly. During those years the meetings grew to over three hundred people; this was the issue of the supply of life. The church in Hong Kong is different from the church in that locality: The church in that locality had people with ulterior motives, but the elders in the church in Hong Kong do not have ulterior motives. Instead, they are unable to keep up with the flow of the age. The younger ones in Hong Kong should obey on the one hand, but they should strongly exercise their spirit on the other hand. In the last age, there is a need for an even more intensified operation of the Spirit; thus, Revelation speaks of the seven Spirits (1:4). We need to be intensified sevenfold, to have the sevenfold intensified Spirit, in order to serve in our various localities.</p>
<p>I had no confrontation with the dissenters and no contention with the elders during the ten years I served in that locality. Whenever I stood at the podium, my spirit was strengthened. They changed the ways every time I left, but since they had handed everything over to me, they could not do anything but hand the things over to me when I came back. During this time my anger was not kindled; I simply told the sisters in the business office that I was back and that they should follow my instructions. The dissenters complied because they had handed everything over to me. They took some opposing action only when they realized that they would never have their way.</p>
<p>Our way today involves obeying absolutely and being strengthened in our spirit. Those with sight will recognize a strong spirit. As long as our spirit is living, people will have a proper evaluation of us. I can testify that even though some condemned and opposed me, they still had to admit that I have something real. If we have something, we have something; hence, we do not need to be discouraged or sad. Rather, we should thank the Lord for an opportunity to learn obedience. The elders should be willing to have fellowship with the younger ones, and the younger ones should be in an obedient condition. Furthermore, we must actively supply life. We should not be afraid of &ldquo;our goods being compared&rdquo;; we should only be afraid of &ldquo;not having an eye for the goods.&rdquo; Perhaps, one day the elders will say, &ldquo;We need the younger ones to function; please speak.&rdquo; If the younger ones have the &ldquo;goods,&rdquo; then the situation will be good, regardless of who speaks. We should always have some &ldquo;goods&rdquo; in our bag, and when we take them out according to the need, others will have nothing to say.</p>
<p>Every time we speak is a good opportunity to display our &ldquo;goods&rdquo; by supplying life. People will say, &ldquo;I came to hear a message today and did not get much initially. But those younger ones had something in them.&rdquo; This would be very good. Hence, there is no need to oppose the elders. If the elders let the young ones speak, they are helping you and giving you an opportunity to present your &ldquo;goods.&rdquo; I have experienced this same process; only the people involved were different. The situation that the younger ones face in Hong Kong is not difficult because the elders in Hong Kong are fully one with you. The situation there is like an elderly father being one with his son. It is just that one has an old view, and the other has a new view. Nevertheless, the young ones must not blame the elderly father; he was born in an older generation and is naturally different from you. There is no reason to make the elderly father angry or to oppose him; instead, you should obey him. You must do this until everyone knows that your family is blessed because you are able to properly deal with the old things in the family without contradicting your father.</p>
<p>The younger ones must be strong in spirit. You must exercise your spirit, but do not rely on methods or ways. The only way that matters is having a strong spirit and a clear vision. Quarrels and confrontations are useless; as long as you have the opportunity, use your spirit. Once the opportunity arises, use it to remove the oldness and to supply life. Do not oppose anyone; instead, receive a commission from the Lord and supply life properly. We must all learn this. The way ahead of us is glorious. There is no reason to be disappointed; rather, we should be encouraged.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KEY TO SERVING&mdash;BEING BLENDED IN SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED IN SPIRIT AND DELIVERED FROM THE MIND</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:18-19 says, &ldquo;Be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&rdquo; If we try to practice speaking to one another but are not filled in spirit, it will be as exhausting as rolling a flat tire. We should never neglect the essential matter of being filled in spirit when we practice speaking to one another.</p>
<p>We have been fellowshipping about the spirit for years, yet we have not been exercising our spirit. The Pentecostal movement still exists and even is spreading to some extent because it pays attention to the Spirit. Although Pentecostals do not have the truth as we do, they do focus on the Spirit. Thus, they have some reality. In contrast, we may have the truth, but we do not exercise our spirit. Whether the Pentecostal movement is genuine or false, their speaking in tongues turns them from their mind to their spirit. This is a principle of the Pentecostal movement.</p>
<p>I have attended Pentecostal gatherings, and to an extent some things there are genuine. Even some things in Catholicism are genuine. However, it is important for us to be able to discern what is genuine from what is not. If a person cannot discern, he will be poisoned. Matthew 13:33 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.&rdquo; The woman in this verse symbolizes the Catholic Church, which took leaven and mingled it with fine flour. Leaven signifies evil, condemnable things. The woman hid the leaven in three measures of meal, making it difficult to discern the leaven from the fine flour. In order to be safe, we could discard everything, but if we discard everything, we will discard some fine flour as well. We need to be like Watchman Nee, who was a very discerning person. He was able to discern the leaven, which should be discarded, and the fine flour, which should be kept. He was able to discern the good from the bad in every denominational and Christian practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CRUCIAL POINTS FOR SPEAKING IN THE MEETING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being Simple and Speaking from the Spirit</h2>
<p>We have been taught so thoroughly by Christianity for so long that whenever we speak, we linger in our mind. However, our speaking in the meeting should come from our spirit and be simple. Unless one really has a message and needs more time, the simpler the speaking, the better it is. We need to practice this. The principle is the same for leading a Bible study. Some do not lead well, so the meeting goes down and the spirit is low. Others lead well, so the meeting is on fire and the spirit is fanned into flame. There is a great difference between the two. The vitality and strength of our spirit depend upon our daily living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Preaching to One Another but Practicing Together</h2>
<p>It is common for the brothers and sisters to speak to one another as if they are preaching. When we speak to one another, we just need to speak the hymns with our spirit; there is no need to preach or explain. Even though we have paid attention to the matter of speaking to one another over the years, we have not practiced it much. In particular, the leading ones do not practice; they only want to study how the young people are practicing it. However, matters of life cannot be studied; study only limits the production of life. We cannot study an egg while a hen is brooding upon it. If we try to study the egg, it will not hatch. Hence, the leading ones should practice, not just study.</p>
<p>Some brothers&rsquo; prayers are like a message. Such ones should learn from the way that Americans process their fish; they cut off the head and the tail and serve only the two choicest fillets. The meeting needs the spirit and the supply of life; the leading ones must take the lead to practice speaking to one another first so that they supply life and lead the saints into this practice as well.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Spirit Needing to Be Strong and Released</h2>
<p>Some have led the saints to walk around in the meetings, but this is not necessary. Our meetings need to be strong in spirit, not strong in physical activity. Our spirits should be released, not our physical bodies. This does not mean that we should not clap our hands in the meeting; even Psalm 47:1 speaks of this. However, we should not be excessive. We must realize that the New Testament is different from the Old Testament. The Old Testament focuses on outward matters, but the New Testament focuses on the spirit. If the spirits of the saints reach a climax and there is no other way to express it, there is no problem with clapping. However, it is not good if clapping turns into a custom. Such practices abound in the Pentecostal movement, but we should not focus on them. We should have a strong and released spirit; there is no need for much physical activity.</p><h2 class="head2">Learning to Be Moderate in Our Exercise</h2>
<p>Moreover, although it is good to exercise to call on the name of the Lord loudly, it is not necessary to be loud every time. Sometimes we do not need to be loud in order to release our spirit. In addition, we need to care for our surroundings. For example, it is not fitting to loudly call on the name of the Lord in the morning if it disturbs others. We should not emphasize only one aspect of any matter. On the one hand, it is too much if someone says, &ldquo;I do not care about anything; I just want to call loudly.&rdquo; On the other hand, if someone says that we should not call on the name of the Lord at all, this is too much as well. In everything we should be moderate. If we do not eat, we will starve to death, and if we do not restrain our eating, we will stuff ourselves to death. Neither is good. It is best to eat set portions three times a day with two snacks at most. Thus, we should focus on eating in a healthy way.</p>
<p>We must learn to be moderate in all things. When we mention calling on the name of the Lord and exercising our spirit in the meetings, the older ones say, &ldquo;The young people are noisy; we cannot stand this.&rdquo; In this case it would be good if the older ones would call loudly, but they do not. In contrast, the young people say, &ldquo;The older ones are too quiet; we cannot stand this.&rdquo; In this case it would be good if the younger ones did not call so loudly. When we exercise our spirit, we often disregard the truth, but when we pay attention to truth, we often disregard our spirit. We do not know how to be moderate. We should never be too strong in any matter; otherwise, it will not last long. Any calling that is based only on being loud will be short-lived; however, if there is no calling, the result will be death. Our exercise must be moderate and fitting in order for us to be continually living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seizing the Opportunity to Supply Spirit and Life</h2>
<p>This does not mean that we should not have certain activities in the meeting but that the activities must be moderate, fitting, strong in spirit, rich, and fresh. If the elders have arranged for brothers to give a message on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, the young people should not oppose this. The young people can seize the opportunity to pray short prayers one after another, each with a strong spirit and in a rich and fresh way. Then the meeting will be uplifted to the heavens. After these prayers the brothers can give a message, and there will be no conflict.</p>
<p>Perhaps the elders have other arrangements, such as having a brother stand up to choose a hymn. The young people should not oppose this either. After everyone has finished singing, the young people can pray. After several pray, I do not believe that anyone will feel that their prayers were a distraction; rather, the saints will feel fresh, living, and supplied. Even after the message is over, the young people can seize the opportunity to share, one after another, for half a minute or twenty seconds with a strong and rich spirit. As a result, some may say, &ldquo;I did not get much from listening to the forty-five-minute message, but the last five minutes truly supplied me.&rdquo; There is no need to oppose anything that is old. If we exercise in this way for several months, those who are used to listening to messages will say, &ldquo;We would like the young people to have an opportunity to pray more. Can the messages be shortened to allow for at least twenty minutes for the young people to share?&rdquo; This is life swallowing up death.</p>
<p>This also applies to the prayer meeting. If the meeting starts at seven thirty, the young people should be there by quarter to seven. When they get to the meeting, they should start praying in a proper, rich, and spiritual way, not in a loud way. In this way, calling hymns and making announcements will not become distractions, and there will be no quarreling and disputes. There will only be a display of &ldquo;diamonds.&rdquo; One prayer after another will be a &ldquo;diamond.&rdquo; There also will be no contention in the meeting, and the atmosphere of the meeting will change. Then the saints, like a skilled basketball team, will learn to never drop the ball. We must change the atmosphere of every meeting by exercising our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Changing Others but Supplying Life in Spirit</h2>
<p>When some co-workers arrive at a meeting, they sit on &ldquo;invisible thrones,&rdquo; and their actions indicate that the elders must submit to them. They may not say this, but this is their intention. Such an attitude is unbefitting. This has not been my attitude in serving in Taipei over the past ten years. We need to change our attitude and lead the church with our spirit; then people will spontaneously follow. If we seat ourselves on &ldquo;invisible thrones&rdquo; and display &ldquo;glass beads&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;diamonds,&rdquo; the saints may tolerate us for a short time but not for very long. When a co-worker goes to a place, he should not sit on an &ldquo;invisible throne&rdquo; or try to change people. He should only supply life in spirit.</p>
<p>If an arrangement is made for me to go to a certain place, I will go with a burden. However, when I arrive, I will not call a meeting. I will attend their meeting first. I will meet in whatever way they meet. If they meet in the morning, I will go; if they meet in the evening, I will still go. I will attend all their meetings and not have any conflict with anyone in the meetings. Nevertheless, whenever the opportunity arises, I will display a &ldquo;diamond.&rdquo; We should not make changes; we should only display &ldquo;diamonds.&rdquo; Outward changes are of no use; the issue is whether or not we are displaying the &ldquo;diamonds.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">Our Exercise Needing to Be Fitting</h2>
<p>The young people need to practice to seize the opportunity in the meetings by praying and sharing spiritual things in a fitting way. If we can only call loudly but cannot display any &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo; in a fitting way, the saints may not receive the &ldquo;diamonds,&rdquo; because our way is unfitting. In summary, we should avoid anything that makes people uncomfortable whenever possible.</p>
<p>Anything that is dead or old in the church should be put aside, but this cannot be done by human methods; it can only be done by the supply of life that causes a metabolic transformation in people. Otherwise, we will go from one extreme to another. We must practice these things and ask the Lord to have mercy on us and to grant us endurance so that we will be willing to continue practicing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Encouraging All the Saints to Exercise the Spirit</h2>
<p>We must change our concept and not put on airs to teach people. On the one hand, we must encourage all the saints to be before the Lord, interact with the Lord, and live with the Lord. On the other hand, we must encourage all the saints to exercise their spirit daily. When we pray, we do not have to do it loudly, but our spirit needs to be released. When we speak to people, our spirit needs to be released. Any activity in the meeting should be a matter of the release of the spirit. Our spirit needs to be strong, living, fresh, rich, bright, and ready to be released at any time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO HAVE THOROUGH FELLOWSHIP<br />
WITH THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>When we fellowship these burdens with the saints in our locality, we should not begin with a big meeting but rather start with five to six brothers. We should fellowship point by point. If anyone brings up a problem with some service in the past, we should learn to stay on that point and not jump to another topic quickly. Even if we spend three hours fellowshipping over just one point in order to get through, this will be very good. If there is not enough time in one day, we do not need to wait for another day next week; we can continue to fellowship the next day. We should work on one point and get through, and then work on the next point. After we have had thorough fellowship with these brothers, we can invite some others until we get through with everyone. Then we can call a big meeting.</p>
<p>The success of this matter lies in whether the brothers in each locality are in one accord, praying together, bearing the burden together in one spirit, and speaking the same thing. After we have thorough fellowship with a few, we can fellowship with more. This will eliminate the need for any &ldquo;special meeting,&rdquo; but in fact, every meeting will be special. Whether or not a meeting is special depends on whether we make the saints feel special. If we call an eight-day conference in a rash way yet merely talk about ordinary things, there will be nothing special about it. In contrast, even a prayer meeting can be special if some &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo; are displayed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KEY TO SERVING&mdash;BEING BLENDED IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Whether or not we can be in one spirit is the key to serving in a locality. The most important thing is being blended in our spirit, not discussing how things should be done. When there is blending, it is possible to take some action. An army must be one before it can be dispatched into battle.</p>
<p>If the brothers in a locality cannot be blended in one spirit, they may be polite in dealing with each other and be able to shout slogans outwardly, but the situation will be altogether futile and political. Satan knows these things the best. When we do not have the one accord, he will regard us as a joke and say, &ldquo;Even I know that you are not one. What work can you do?&rdquo; One time we were casting out demons, and the demon spoke of our failures and asked, &ldquo;Do you think that you can cast me out?&rdquo; We immediately prayed for the Lord to cover us with His precious blood. We must see that we are in a war. The brothers in each locality must be blended in spirit. If we cannot be blended in spirit, living in spirit will be only a slogan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HAVING PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS<br />
BUT BEING BLENDED IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The brothers serving in various localities must not have preconceived notions that the older ones are unwilling to follow but that the young people are willing to follow. We should never have such thoughts. We must treat the older ones and the young people in each locality the same and lead them step by step. We must not regard anyone as an outsider, and we must not distinguish between the older ones and the young people. We must lead both the young people and the older ones into serving.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we must be blended in spirit. If the brothers have many talents yet are not blended in spirit, it will be possible to do only a shallow, superficial work. We will not have a way to do a thorough work that builds up the church. If those who are taking the lead are not blended with each other, how can they build up the church? Instead, they will become hindrances that keep the Holy Spirit from moving forward or from working in a deeper way. Consequently, the advance of the work will stop. The brothers must be blended with each other.</p><h2 class="head1">GENUINE FRUIT BEING WITH GENUINE BLENDING</h2>
<p>The extent of the blending among the brothers in each locality will determine the extent of the work in that locality. If there is no blending, the work will be on the same level of the work in a denomination. The depth of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s work in a locality depends on how much the brothers are blended in one spirit. Merely learning skillful cultivation and tolerance is useless; we must be blendable in spirit. It is certainly not good to quarrel, but if we cannot be blended in spirit, tolerating one another will still not yield any fruit. At the best there will only be some superficial damage. Genuine fruit depends on genuine blending.</p>
<p>Today the Lord&rsquo;s way is not with spiritual giants but with every brother and every sister, because each one is a member in the Lord&rsquo;s Body. It is a fact that some members have more function in the Body, but there are no giants in the Body. In the Body everyone is a member, and every member must be blended. Whether or not a church manifests a condition of being built up and coordinated together depends entirely upon whether the brothers can be blended in spirit. Without being blended in spirit, our messages and fellowship are completely useless. Having fellowship in spirit, being blended in spirit, entering into the feeling of the Body, and spreading the work according to the feeling in the Body are the most important matters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BLENDING BEING THE LIFE PULSE<br />
FOR THE CHURCH TO GO FORWARD</h2>
<p>Blending is the life pulse of the church in its going forward. If the brothers in every locality cannot be blended, it will be very difficult to advance to have a deeper work. Being blended is not a matter of giving people doctrines. If the brothers can only present doctrines when they meet in a locality, they will only promote doctrines. Rather than presenting doctrines, we should have fellowship and contact with others in spirit, supplying life to them in the spirit so that they may see something.</p>
<p>We must first be blended with one another in spirit. Then we should have much fellowship to bring everyone into the spirit for a deeper seeing. The brothers and sisters will slowly see the same vision and enter into the feeling of the Body. If we only talk about new methods or new doctrines, we will incite opinions, which some will approve of and others will oppose. We must avoid causing this problem. The brothers should not go to various localities to promote doctrines but to look to the Lord to supply the saints with life and to help them see what the Lord wants today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING FACTIOUS OR INSISTENT</h2>
<p>Moreover, we should never boast in anything. Even if we truly see something and are blended in one spirit, we should not form a faction, saying, &ldquo;We are those who have seen something.&rdquo; Instead of doing this, we should have fellowship in one spirit with the brothers and sisters. We should not promote new doctrines but help people to be supplied in life and to know the Lord&rsquo;s way. We can have fellowship in the prayer meetings or the bread-breaking meetings, sharing little by little, wholly according to life, which will not be a movement but a mutual flow of life.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s work and in leading the church, anyone who insists on an opinion is not in the spirit. Even if a person has a right opinion, he is not in the spirit if he insists upon it. In the work and in leading the church, there can only be the fellowship of the Body, not the insistence on personal opinions. I fully believe that even the apostle Paul was not insistent on his opinions. I hope that we will all pay attention to this matter and be in the fellowship rather than being insistent.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING SEPARATE LANGUAGE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Some have asked if the church in a certain locality should separate into Mandarin-speaking and Taiwanese-speaking meetings. All the serving ones in that locality must seek the feeling of the Body in a spirit of fellowship. Any insistence is wrong. Those who are serving together must seek the feeling of the Body, the feeling in spirit.</p>
<p>Given that human societies have different languages, we need to try our best to thoroughly understand different languages in order to remove the language barrier. Concerning separating meetings into Taiwanese-speaking and Mandarin-speaking, we have had problems before and have learned some lessons. Over twenty years ago in Taipei, the majority of the people were Taiwanese, and many did not understand Mandarin. So we established a Taiwanese-speaking meeting. At the same time we were trying our best to help localities buy land for the construction of meeting halls. We bought a piece of land in Taipei and built a meeting hall for Taiwanese-speaking meetings. I truly regretted doing that then, because it was wholly according to man&rsquo;s weakness. As a result, it did not bring in any blessing; instead, it became a source of corruption and death.</p>
<p>After we established a meeting hall for Taiwanese-speaking meetings, two brothers were tempted by the devil and greatly contended with each other to be first. They even came to me to accuse each other on separate occasions. Thus, the meeting hall for Taiwanese-speaking meetings soon came to an end. It has been nearly three decades since we came to Taiwan. Today everyone who is thirty years old has an education based on the Mandarin language, and almost everyone who is forty understands Mandarin. With the exception of very rural areas, the number of people in their forties or fifties who do not understand Mandarin is very small. Hence, there is no need to establish a Taiwanese-speaking meeting hall. Having separate meeting halls according to geographic areas is according to the truth, but establishing separate meeting halls according to language is unfitting.</p>
<p>I have spoken to the Chinese brothers and sisters in America very seriously, saying, &ldquo;If you have never learned English and do not understand English, then it is understandable for you to speak Chinese. However, if you have graduated from college and even received a doctorate degree in America, you should speak English. Furthermore, if you want to invite people to eat in Chinatown, you should not just invite Chinese brothers and sisters but all the brothers and sisters in the church. Although it is not easy, you should speak English and blend with the English-speaking saints, because you have come to live in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most important matter among us is oneness. When I started working in the United States, my work was not with the Chinese. However, because some brothers and sisters did not understand English, the church in Los Angeles provided radios and earphones for the saints to listen to translation in the meetings. I cannot forget the lessons that we learned in Taipei twenty years ago; establishing a meeting place for another language opens a back door for Satan.</p>
<p>If no one understands Mandarin and all the saints speak Taiwanese, then meetings in Taiwanese are perfectly justified. When we preach the gospel in the mountainous areas, we should certainly speak the languages of the indigenous peoples, especially if no one understands Mandarin. But in the big cities, everyone has a Mandarin education; consequently, there is no need to establish a Taiwanese-speaking meeting. After the church was formed on the day of Pentecost, the first contention occurred between the Hellenists and the Hebrews (Acts 6:1). Language problems can cause trouble, so we must be careful. The important thing is to maintain the oneness of the church and to cautiously guard against any Satan-initiated contentions related to language. We are one in Christ today. All the brothers should turn to the spirit and have fellowship and prayer together to be led together for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in the church.</p></body></html>
