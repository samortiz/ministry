   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE THE INIQUITY OF THE SANCTUARY Date: October 20, 1936, morning</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Kulangsu</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Num 18:1-32 THE INIQUITY OF THE SANCTUARY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's Word shows us that some sins are committed before man, while others are committed before God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some sins are committed against ordinary laws, while others are iniquities committed against the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In short, there are sins committed in our daily life and sins committed in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The book of Numbers shows us that the sins of the priests were iniquities committed against the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Using today's terminology, they are sins committed in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most people only commit sins in their daily life, but a worker of the Lord can commit an additional kind of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Most sins are common sins, but a worker of the Lord can commit some special sins sins in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to pay special attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A sin pertaining to the work may not necessarily involve such things as pride or jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the flesh is manifested, when the self-will is exposed, and when one speaks rashly or makes suggestions rashly, one often commits the special sin that pertains to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who do not engage themselves in God's work will not commit the iniquity of the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But those who work for the Lord are liable of committing the iniquity of the sanctuary in addition to all the other common sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sinning in the work means offending God in His holiness, glory, and sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In God's work, everything that is incompatible with God's will is a sin and is an iniquity of the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have often said to others as well as to myself that there are three very important considerations in God's work which we should never forget.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, the initiation of God's work must be according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Second, the advance of God's work must be according to His power, not our own power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Third, the result of God's work must be for His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we fail in any of these three points, we have committed an iniquity against the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No work can be initiated by ourselves, no work can be carried out by our own strength, and no work should result in our own glory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE INITIATION OF THE WORK BEING OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>AND NOT OF US</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the meetings the sisters have their heads covered with respect to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This signifies that everyone is covered before Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is the Lord, and only He is the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only He is worthy to be the Lord of all, and only He is worthy to initiate any work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In God's work, no decision should be made through the discussion of two or three brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The result and worth of a work, whether or not it is spiritual and pleasing to God, depend not on the amount of work that has been done, but on how much of the work is initiated by ourselves and how much is initiated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The less we initiate, the more spiritual, worthwhile, and acceptable it is to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I thank God that I do not have to initiate anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He arranges everything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I do not have to be responsible for coming up with anything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We often think that we should do this or that, but God has His own agenda.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not have to be His counselor.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We only need to do His will and find out if something is according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not have to worry about the result.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The initiation of God's work must be His will and His will alone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have no right to initiate anything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's will must be the unique beginning of all His works.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I would like to ask the local responsible brothers a question: In your locality, do you embark on a work just because this is what many people want or because it is a logical thing that produces good results?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Or do you do it because you know that it is God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brothers, to initiate anything rashly is to commit an iniquity against the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In spiritual things there is no ground for your own proposals or directions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God does not need you to be His head.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the book of Job God said to Job, "Who is this who darkens counsel/By words without knowledge?.../I will ask of you, and you shall inform Me" 38:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every time I read this, I laugh within myself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Man likes to be God's counselor.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But God does not hire any counselors.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul said, "Who has become His counselor?"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rom 11:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I am afraid the co-workers have not been as serious about the work in the sanctuary as they should have been.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Perhaps you were quite careful at the beginning, but today you have become quite careless and loose.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Those who have a little more authority speak more and dominate more.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Those who have just entered the Lord's work may be more careful than those who have been working for eight or ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The book of Numbers shows us the distinction between holy things and common things.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not fall into unholiness through touching something in a common way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many things are holy and not common.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Have you ever baptized someone?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The first time you baptized someone, you were probably quite serious.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But after five or ten times, it becomes common to you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is nothing new in the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The priests changed the showbread, dressed the lamp, and burned the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They did the same things day after day and year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But if they were just a little bit careless, they would have committed the iniquity of the sanctuary and died.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, no priest could consider his work a common thing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The first time a worker has to give a message, he is very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But after he speaks a few more times, it becomes a common thing to him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many have said to me, "You seem to be prepared all the time."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But I can testify that every time I read the New Testament, I feel as if I have never read it before, and every time I speak, I feel as if it is the first time I have ever spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Brothers, we cannot consider any of God's work as a common thing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whether or not we are fresh to others depends on whether spiritual things are fresh to us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Take the example of the breaking of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The first time we have to bless the bread we are solemnly aware of its significance.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We are very careful before the Lord, and we are truly like the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Subconsciously, God's power and His Spirit come upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But gradually, we become more relaxed.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Our spiritual feeling is not as strong as before, and we have little spirit for prayer and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>A person may realize that God has not given him the power and the anointing at a particular time; however, he may think that since he has done it before, he can do the same thing today.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In this way he loses his spiritual freshness and the power of life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There are three results or punishments for the iniquity of the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>First, there is a loss of the power of life; a man becomes stale.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Second, there is the experience of spiritual death; there may even be sicknesses or physical death.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God does not allow those who sin this way to continue.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Third, there will be the judgment at the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I have the deep sense that at the judgment seat no sin will be greater than the iniquity of the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Brothers, we have to take this matter seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We cannot initiate the work.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>A man can only be satisfied when his desires are met.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In the same way, God can only be satisfied when His will is fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We have no other choice than to do God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We cannot replace God's will with anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>All the sacrifices in the world cannot replace God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Men may think that their work is better than God's will and that His will may be wrong, but please remember that God does not need any counselors.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He only wants us to do His will.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We may have done a lot of things for God, but no matter how much we have done, the only thing that counts is God's will.</S>
