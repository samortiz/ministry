 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE TRADITIONAL WAY<br />
TO MEET AND TO SERVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Kings 17:8 (NASB)</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to see the traditional way to meet and to serve. Although the fellowship in this chapter is concerning a negative and degraded situation, it is very necessary. Especially to us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, it is extremely crucial. The Scripture reading for this chapter is only the first half of 2 Kings 17:8 according to the New American Standard Bible, which tells us that the children of Israel sinned against the Lord by walking &ldquo;in the customs of the nations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been among us for sixty-five years since 1922, but today some part of the traditional way to meet and to serve still remains among us. This traditional way remains in our cells and in our blood because it has been existing on this earth for over nineteen centuries. In chapter two we saw that we needed to meet according to the way ordained by the apostle in 1 Corinthians 14:26. Whenever we come together each one has something&mdash;either a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. We have studied church history and the practices of the denominations, but we could not find anyone who entered into the full reality and experience of 1 Corinthians 14:26. In the nineteenth century the Brethren were raised up by the Lord in England to recover many of the truths in the Bible. They were famous for knowing the Bible and for practicing according to the Bible, yet even they did not recover the full practice of 1 Corinthians 14:26 or Hebrews 10:25.</p>
<p>The biblical way to meet and to serve, the way ordained by God and declared by the Apostle Paul, is difficult to practice because it is against our natural man. According to this way, whenever we Christians come together, we must come with something. Everyone should have something of the Lord or for the Lord to minister, to present, to the meeting for the mutual enjoyment of the attendants. I minister something for your enjoyment, and you offer something for my enjoyment. We all minister something for each other to enjoy with God. This is like the feast of tabernacles in ancient times, to which each of the Israelites brought something. They were commanded not to come to the feast empty-handed (Deut. 16:16). Everyone was required to have something, so they brought all the surplus of the rich produce of the good land to the feast, and there they enjoyed these riches with each other. At the same time their mutual enjoyment was also with God, and their enjoyment with God and before God was the real worship.</p>
<p>In chapter one we illustrated that the Christian meeting is like the birthday of a great father with hundreds of descendants. Suppose that on his birthday all of his children would kneel down before him for twenty minutes. Surely that would shock him. He might say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to see you kneeling down like this. I like to see you all enjoying my provision.&rdquo; To enjoy this great father&rsquo;s provision is the real &ldquo;worship&rdquo; to him. In John 4, the Samaritan woman brought up the subject of worship, and the Lord told her that the proper worship is the exercise of our spirit to contact God the Spirit (v. 24). To contact God the Spirit with our spirit is to drink of the living water (vv. 10, 14), and to drink of the living water is the proper and real worship of God.</p>
<p>I was born into organized Christianity, and from my youth I attended the Sunday morning services and other weekday meetings. The ones who attended those meetings were so silent. According to their feeling, those silent services were the best worship that Christians could render to God. If we look at these kinds of meetings in the Lord&rsquo;s light, we have to believe that God is not happy with them. In one of these meetings, the Lord might say, &ldquo;Is your silence a worship to Me? I don&rsquo;t like this. I like everybody speaking something about Me, about My Being, and about My doings. I would even like to hear you making a joyful noise in talking about this. You don&rsquo;t need to speak in order. All that matters is that everybody speaks.&rdquo; If all of us would speak forth the riches of the processed Triune God in our meetings, God would be happy, and that would be the best worship we could render to our Father.</p>
