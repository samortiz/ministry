<h2 class="head2">The Reason Christ Stopped Peter</h2><p>Peter's speaking was interrupted the second time by Christ in a house in Capernaum. Peter seemed to be the spokesman of the twelve disciples, and some came to ask, "Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?" Peter should have asked Christ first. But he did not do this. Instead, when he was asked, Peter mindlessly answered, "Yes." Then he went in to check with the Lord. He had made a decision already; He was only informing the Lord after the fact. On the Mount of Transfiguration, the Father interrupted Peter after he had spoken a few sentences. But Christ did not wait for Peter to speak at all. He anticipated him, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?" Christ stopped Peter because He wanted Peter to know that no one had authority over Him.</p><p>The kings and leaders of the world only collect taxes from outsiders. They do not collect tax from their own sons. The temple tax was for the temple, not for Caesar. In name the temple tax was for God. In reality it was appropriated to the priests. In Matthew 16 and 17 Christ was manifested specifically as the Son of God. The incident with the temple tax occurred immediately after Caesarea Philippi, where the Lord asked the disciples, "Who do you say that I am?" and Peter said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." In chapter seventeen, on the Mount of Transfiguration, the Father said, "This is My Son, the Beloved." Both of these two chapters speak of Christ as the Son of God. In chapter sixteen the recognition was from men. In chapter seventeen the recognition was from God the Father. In chapters sixteen and seventeen, both men and the Father acknowledged Christ as the Son of God. But what about those other than the disciples? Did they acknowledge Christ as the Son of God? At the end of chapter seventeen those who collected the temple tax came to collect tax. If Christ was just another Jew, no one would have bothered to ask about tax. But Christ was different; His words and actions were very particular. He performed miracles, healed the sick, caused the lame to walk, raised the dead, and even proclaimed that He is the Son of God.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the Jews saw all of these things. Yet inwardly they doubted whether He was really the Son of God. Peter's answer eliminated the question from their minds because he placed Christ on the same level as all the other Jews. Peter treated Jesus the Nazarene as an ordinary person. He forgot that the Lord was the Son of God. The entire salvation of Christ stands upon the foundation that Jesus the Nazarene is the Son of God. If Jesus the Nazarene is not the Son of God, there is no salvation of Christ. If there is no salvation, there is no church. The church proclaims that Jesus the Nazarene is the Son of God. If we do not know that Jesus the Nazarene is the Son of God, nothing will avail. Therefore, after Peter proclaimed that Christ was the Son of the living God in Matthew 16, Christ said to him, "Upon this rock I will build My church." The Son of the living God is the rock. The church is built upon this rock, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. Therefore, if Jesus the Nazarene were just an ordinary person, it would have been impossible for the church to be built up, because there would have been no foundation.</p><p>Friends, what is the salvation of Christ? The salvation of Christ is a faith that believes in Christ being the Son of God. Our faith is not the cross, resurrection, ascension, etc. These are only the works of Christ. The Bible does not ask us to believe in His works. It only asks us to believe that He is the Son of God. This means that we are to believe in His person. If we believe in His person, we will spontaneously believe in His works. The Bible says that everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God (1 John 5:1). Everything hinges on believing in Him as the Son of God. Do you believe in the Son of God? If you read the book of Romans, the Gospel of Luke, or the Epistle of First John, you will find that everything hinges on whether or not Christ is the Son of God. Perhaps you do not consider this question to be that important. But God considers this question to be very important. When a person believes that Christ is the Son of God, he receives salvation and eternal life. "He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life" (v. 12).</p><p>Jesus the Nazarene is a man. He is also the Son of God. The Son of God is the very Jesus the Nazarene. This means that the Son of God became a man. If Christ had not put on human form and instead had the sun on His head, a face like lightning, and a voice like thunder, everyone would have naturally believed that He was the Son of God. But the Lord Jesus was not like this. When He came to this earth, He came to Bethlehem and was born as a human being, just like you and me. Then He grew up gradually. Without revelation, men cannot recognize Him as the Son of God.</p><p>What is the Christian faith? The Christian faith tells us that throughout history there is one person who stands out uniquely among all men. This person is the Son of God, the God of heaven; that is, He is God Himself. This is the One whom we believe in. The Christian faith is altogether a matter of Jesus being the Son of God. This matter is so important because if Jesus the Nazarene were not the Son of God, it would be impossible for men to contact God, even if we knew that God exists in heaven. Even with such a God, He would not be a revealed God. Men would only know that there is a God in heaven but would not know anything about Him. They would be like the Greeks, who addressed the God in heaven as the "unknown God" (Acts 17:23), that is, a God whom no one knows. Jesus the Nazarene is the God in heaven, the God whom no one could know. Today He has come and put on a human body so that man can now touch Him and know Him.</p><p>Paul told us that the Athenians worshipped an unknown God. They thought that the God in heaven was like the lightning in the sky. We can say that Jesus the Nazarene is like the electricity in electrical wire. The electricity in electrical wire makes electricity real and approachable to us; electricity thus becomes something that can be touched, felt, seen, and known. Christianity does not worship a mysterious God. Christianity is about a God who has come to earth; it is about a God who has come among mankind so that man can know and realize Him. God has already come among mankind&mdash;this is the Christian faith. If Jesus the Nazarene were not a man, it would be impossible for men to know God. The God in heaven is a God that man cannot see, but Jesus the Nazarene is the revealed God. Jesus the Nazarene is God being seen, heard, and touched by us.</p><p>This is why Christ would not let Peter go when he told the ones who took up the temple tax that Christ would pay the tax. Perhaps Peter was ready to pay the tax, and if Christ would not pay it, he would persuade Him to pay. Peter was so sure that Christ would pay the tax. His words to the tax collectors seemed to be a guarantee that Christ would pay. Peter never imagined that Christ would stop him. Although Christ did not do much, His answer was a proclamation that He is the Son of God. O friends, do you know who Jesus is? Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He is the God in heaven who has come to earth to be a man. In the end Christ did pay the tax, but not because He was not the Son of God. In His status as the Son of God, He did not have to pay. But He paid the tax because He did not want to offend others. This is a practical lesson for us. It is often not a matter of whether or not we should pay tax. There is also the matter of not stumbling others. Christ would not leave any excuse for others to accuse Him of anything; He did not want to stir up anything. As far as His status was concerned, He had the right to ignore and forget about the tax. He had the absolute sovereign right to do this. But He paid the tax because He would not offend others.</p><p>Here lies a principle: We can exempt ourselves from many obligations if we insist on our rights and status. But to avoid offending and stumbling others, we should take care of the obligations anyway. This is the practical cross. It is always precious to exercise a care for others and their interests. A humble Christian is a loving Christian. In asking whether or not something should be done, we often find that the real issue behind the matter is not whether or not something is a sin, but whether or not we are willing to suffer loss. As far as our qualifications, our life in God, and our status as God's sons are concerned, we may not need to pay any tax. But for the sake of bearing the cross, we should do it. Here we see the preciousness of Christ's meekness. Man could not demand one shekel from Him, yet He was unwilling to hurt anyone's feelings. He paid because He did not want to stumble anyone. Christianity is not just concerned with righteousness. It is true that there is righteousness in Christianity, but it is also full of grace. The salvation of Christ enables us to suffer loss, to bear the cross, to not vindicate ourselves, to be defamed, and to please others.</p><p>The last verse of Matthew 17 is marvelous. Christ even paid the tax for Peter. The only One who was exempt from paying the tax was Christ. But if Christ did not pay, others would be offended, and it would involve more than just Christ. It would involve Peter and Christ. Therefore, not only was Christ involved in this matter, the Christian (Peter) was also involved. The Lord asked Peter to take the tax money to give to them for "Me and you." We should not cause others to stumble. We do many things that we do not have to do. We are willing to bear the cross so that others will not suffer because we are Christians. Rather, we ourselves would suffer the pain. The Lord seemed to be saying, "From now on every Christian has to work together with Me (`Me and you') to keep others from being unhappy."</p>
