<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE FIRSTFRUITS, THE HARVEST,<br>AND THE GATHERING OF THE GRAPES<br>(Revelation 14:1-20)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE FIRSTFRUITS<br>(REVELATION 14:1-5)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 14:1</H2><P>"And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads."</P><P>Is Mount Zion here the heavenly one or the earthly one? It is not the earthly one for the following reasons:</P><P>(1) By then, the earthly Zion will still be in the hands of the Gentiles (11:2).</P><P>(2) Revelation 14:3 clearly says that these ones have been purchased from the earth. By this we can realize that they are not standing on the earthly Mount Zion.</P><P>(3) We know from the last two sentences of 14:4 and from Exodus 23:19 that the firstfruits are not left in the field. As soon as they ripen, they are put into God's house. (Exodus 34:26 says the same thing.) Since the hundred and forty-four thousand are the firstfruits, they should not be left in the field, which signifies the world (Matt. 13:38), but should be put on the heavenly Mount Zion, which is the New Jerusalem.</P><P>(4) Revelation 14:3 says that they stand "before the throne and before the four living creatures and the [twenty-four] elders." We know that the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders are all in heaven.</P><P>(5) The ones described in 14:1-5 are the firstfruits. This is in accord with the matter of the harvest in verses 14-16. If the reaping of the harvest takes place in heaven, even more should not the firstfruits be in heaven?</P><P>(6) It is unreasonable to assume that this occurs on the earth at that time, because the Lord Jesus does not come to the earth until chapter nineteen.</P><P>Who are these hundred and forty-four thousand? Are they the same group of people as the hundred and forty-four thousand in 7:4? The hundred and forty-four thousand in 7:4 and the hundred and forty-four thousand mentioned here are two different groups of people, for:</P><P>(1) The group mentioned in 7:4 are selected from the Israelites; the group in 14:1 are purchased from the earth (v. 3) and purchased from among men (v. 4).</P><P>(2) The seal which the group in 7:4 receives is different from the seal which this group receives. In the former case, it is "the seal of the living God" (7:2). This is a term used in the Old Testament. In this case, the seal is the name of the Lamb and the name of the Father. This name has to do with the church; hence, this group of people must be related to the church.</P><P>(3) The ones in 7:4 are "the slaves of our God" (v. 3), while the ones in 14:1 are the children of God (from the word "Father" in the last part of verse 1).</P><P>(4) In Revelation, every time that the Lord calls God the Father, it is in relation to the church (1:6; 2:27; 3:5, 21), never to the Israelites.</P><P>(5) The ones in 14:1 are related to the Lamb. (They stand with the Lamb, have the Lamb's name, and belong to the Lamb.) But in chapter seven, the Lord is only an angel, returning to the position of a messenger in the Old Testament.</P><P>(6) The song sung by the ones in 14:1 is "a new song" (v. 3), while the ones in 7:4 can sing only the old song.</P><P>(7) The ones in 14:1 are virgins (v. 4), but to be such among the Israelites was a matter of curse. (Exodus 23:26; Deuteronomy 7:14; 1 Samuel 2:5; and Psalm 113:9 all show that childbearing is a blessing and that not to bear children is a curse. Judges 11:38-39 shows that to be a virgin is a thing to be mourned.)</P><P>(8) The articles used for the hundred and forty-four thousand in Revelation 7:4 and the hundred and forty-four thousand in 14:1 are indefinite articles. This shows that these two groups of a hundred and forty-four thousand are different people.</P><P>The hundred and forty-four thousand in 14:1 are a special group of people in the church; they are not the whole church.</P><P>(1) Since the number one hundred and forty-four thousand in 7:4 should be interpreted literally, the number in 14:1 should also be interpreted literally.</P><P>(2) If the number one hundred and forty-four thousand in 14:1 were not to be interpreted literally, there would be no way in which to interpret all the other numbers in this book.</P><P>(3) The hundred and forty-four thousand are the firstfruits (v. 4). One cannot say that the whole church is the firstfruits.</P><P>(4) There is not the fact of the whole church being virgins.</P><P>(5) These are raptured to Mount Zion before the great tribulation (before the speaking of the three angels in verses 6-11).</P><P>(6) Revelation 14:5 points out that they are different in their nature. It is a fact that not every regenerated Christian has this nature. These are the overcomers, the called-out ones, in the church of God. (Both John and Peter are included in this group.) From 14:1 we see that this group of people is related to the Lamb.</P>
