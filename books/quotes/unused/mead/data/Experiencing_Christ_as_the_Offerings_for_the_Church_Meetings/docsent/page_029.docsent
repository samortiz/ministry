   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT HOW TO ENJOY CHRIST AS OUR SIN OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND TRESPASS OFFERING 2 Scripture Reading: Lev 5:11-13; 6:30; 7:1-7 FINE FLOUR OFFERED AS A SIN OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to a big, big problem that seems to be against the scriptural principle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hebrews 9:22 says that without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But according to Leviticus 5:11-13 the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour, which, of course, has no blood, could be offered for a sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How could any blood be shed from the grains of wheat, especially out of flour made from wheat?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is impossible!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Blood has to come out of an animal, not out of any vegetable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In poetry people sometimes like to say that a grapevine sheds its blood to produce wine for us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But still that is wine, not blood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Blood cannot come out of a vegetable.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How then could the fine flour of wheat be used as a trespass offering and even for a sin offering?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some teachers have said that Leviticus 5:1-13 is still on the sin offering as a continuation of chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But nearly all the leading versions of the Bible translate the Hebrew word in 5:6 into trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Leviticus 5:7 should also read the same, but the King James Version did not render it so accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The best translation of Leviticus 5:7 reads: And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring his trespass offering for that wherein he hath sinned; two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the Lord, one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Other teachers have said that the Hebrew word for trespass or trespass offering is a derivation from the Hebrew word that means be guilty.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may translate this Hebrew word into guilt, and you may translate the same Hebrew word into guilt offering, which means the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Most translators translate this word for trespass offering into one of three words: trespass offering, transgression offering, or guilt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In chapters four and five of Leviticus the verb form, be guilty, is used many times 4:13, 22, 27; 5:2, 4, 5, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The noun form of guilty can be translated into a guilt offering, meaning a trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But in verse 6, to translate the word into guilt is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To say he shall bring his guilt unto the Lord for his sin is not meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>So according to the context of the verse you have to translate it into a kind of offering, whether you call it a trespass offering, a transgression offering, or a guilt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is a kind of offering, not just a kind of guilt, or a kind of trespass, or a kind of transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sentence governs the meaning of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The same word in any language may be used differently according to the context of the sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must make a decision based upon the context.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one can explain away the trespass offering in 5:6.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a strong proof that 5:1-13 is not a continuation of the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is a new section, a section on the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A REFLECTION OF OUR EXPERIENCES</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All these points indicate that there are many complications related to these chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only in the writing of the Bible are there complications, but also even in our experiences we have many complications.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why are there complications in the writing of the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is because the writing of the Bible is a kind of reflection of our experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, a certain machine is made in a particular way, so it has a book of particular instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you only look at the instructions apart from the machine, you may think that the writer was not so clear and that his instruction has a lot of complications.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But it is because the machine itself was made with so many complications.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How could the instructions have no complications?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the instructions had no complications, that would not match the machine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The instructions are written according to the make-up of the machine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You have to realize that Leviticus 4, 5, and 6 were written according to your make-up and your experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this chapter there is also a bigger and even more basic complication, that is, the word guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many times the word guilt is used instead of sin and instead of transgression or trespass.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Two kinds of offerings are mentioned and yet both are dealing with the matter of guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Of course, sin is a guilt and transgressions are also guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We illustrated previously using a peach tree and peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Both are peach.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You cannot say that the peaches are peach but that the tree is not peach.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Apparently this is a complication.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Actually it is not a complication.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is a distinct writing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The tree is the tree, and the peaches are the peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although all are peach, still there is a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In like manner sin is a guilt, and all the trespasses are guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Both are guilt, yet there is a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sin as a guilt is something in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Trespasses or transgressions are guilt, yet they are not in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They are in our conduct and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Yet they all come out of the very sin that is in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The many guilts come out of that one guilt which is in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In our daily character and daily behavior there are a lot of guilts.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All these guilts have come out of that unique guilt which is in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Adam committed sin, and now we have committed sin.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What is the difference?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The difference is this: with Adam the committing of sin was unique, but with us the committing of sin is not unique.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Adam s committing of sin was a father to produce so many other committings of sin in us.</S>
