   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DISPENSATIONAL MOVES IN CHURCH HISTORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In church history the first special move was the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God used Luther in this dispensational move.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Brethren were also used.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Darby, Groves, and Grant were His instruments.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After the Welsh revival, a new move of God began.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both Evan Roberts and Mrs. Penn-Lewis knew about spiritual warfare; they knew how to deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The truth of the kingdom began to be known in 1924.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Evan Roberts was seen after an absence of ten years, he said, "I have been praying kingdom prayers."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every time God wants to make a dispensational move, He must obtain His instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Are we at the end of the age?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are, the kingdom will soon begin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a dispensational move is near, then God needs an instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>General work is no longer adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The children of God lack a vision; they do not see the seriousness and intensity of the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now is a matter of dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just being a good servant of the Lord is no longer good enough; this is not of great use to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Please note that we are not saying that it is of no use.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What are we doing to close this dispensation?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What are we doing to bring in the next age?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a special time, so there is the need of special Christians to do a special work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today God is waiting for the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only the rapture can precipitate the events in Revelation 12:10.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God has an order, and He works according to that order.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His eyes have left the church; they are now on the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>An overcomer works according to the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The principle of the Body annuls sectarianism and individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After the rapture the woman will be persecuted three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many other of her children will go through the tribulation, but God will keep them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Being an overcomer is not primarily for escaping the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to see of what value the rapture is to the Lord, not to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of all the dispensational moves, the man-child is the greatest because it removes man's power and the devil's power, and it brings in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We live in the most privileged time; we can do the most for God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Light will show us the way, but strength and power will enable us to walk the road.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A great price must be paid in order to be used now.</S>
