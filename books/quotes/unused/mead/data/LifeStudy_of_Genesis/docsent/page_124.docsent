   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 Creeping on the Belly</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Limited to Moving on the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was certainly a curse for the serpent to creep on his belly and to eat dust all the days of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this curse pronounced upon the serpent something is hidden and implied.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As God judged the serpent, He limited Satan's activity and move to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A bird is free and can soar in the air whenever it wishes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The serpent, on the contrary, has no such freedom, but is restricted to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As long as we are above the earth, the serpent, the Devil, Satan, cannot touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we are transcendent, we are over him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, if we also creep on the earth, we will be where he is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We will become his companion and creep together with him and all the other creeping things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But we are not creeping on this earth we are transcendent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2 Eating the Dust Limited to Eating</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>the Earthy Things</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A second aspect of the curse pronounced upon the serpent was that the serpent was limited to eating only dust.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Dust is the serpent's food.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We were made from dust.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are earthy, living in an earthy manner, we become the serpent's food and he will devour us 1 Pet 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you are an earthy person, dealing with your wife or living with your husband in an earthy way, you will immediately become food for the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many families are completely swallowed up by the Devil because they are so earthy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why does it seem that your marriage life is being devoured by the Devil?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because your marriage life is earthy and full of dust.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In God's condemnation upon the serpent He gave Satan a limitation: the serpent cannot move above the earth and he cannot eat anything except dust.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God created man with a spirit, a soul, and a body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although the body and the soul are earthy, the spirit is not.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since our spirit is not earthy, it is not supposed to be Satan's food.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The serpent is only allowed to eat the dust.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our fallen body and soul are the food of Satan, but our spirit is different.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The human spirit is not earthy; so it should not be Satan's food.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever we walk in our flesh we become a delectable dish for Satan, and whenever we are soulish we become a meal for the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, whenever we turn to the spirit, forgetting the body and the soul, Satan has nothing to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we turn to the spirit, Satan is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Praise the Lord for the limitation that God in His judgment has pronounced over the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We do not need to creep on the earth and we do not have to be earthy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sisters, when your husband or children give you a difficult time, you do not need to remain on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You can exercise your spirit and immediately soar to the heavens, and the Devil will be unable to touch you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The "serpent" is limited to the earth and is only permitted to eat the earthy things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you soar to the third heavens you will say, "Satan, what are you doing there?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You are just playing with my husband and with my naughty children.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Satan, I am here in the third heaven, and you cannot touch me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You cannot devour me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I can crush you under my feet."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"Now the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet" Rom 16:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to crush Satan we must be above him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are under him, how can God crush him under our feet?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since "the serpent" has been limited to this earth, it is so easy for us to tread upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Praise the Lord that in judging "the serpent" God preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God has limited Satan's move and diet.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After pronouncing this judgment on the serpent, God proclaimed the glad tidings found in Genesis 3:15.</S>
