   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HAVE YOU REKINDLED YOUR NEW MAN?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We believers have been regenerated and made by God to be a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have a new man in our being which needs to be rekindled.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But most of the time we put this new man aside.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may come to the meetings, and yet leave our new man at home.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Doctrinally speaking, this can never happen, but practically speaking, it can.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why we have to always rekindle our new man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is no need for us to rekindle our old man because this ugly thing is everlasting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The old man will be with us until it is thrown into the lake of fire to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I was young, people would ask me why God would burn sinners in the lake of fire for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to see that the old man came out of the evil Satan who is everlasting, so he needs a kind of everlasting fire.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no need for us to rekindle our old man because the evil one is always rekindling it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But we do need to rekindle our new man, and the only way to do this is by constant and continuous prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is why the Bible tells us to pray unceasingly 1 Thes 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once we cease our prayer, right away our new man needs rekindling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To have our new man rekindled is not a common thing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Very few Christians know how to rekindle their new man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>HAVE YOU REFILLED YOUR LAMP?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Have you refilled your lamp?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This question is based upon Matthew 25.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The five wise virgins had oil in their vessels and in their lamps v. 4 . But the problem with the foolish virgins was that they neglected the refilling of the oil in their lamps v. 3 . We can refill our lamps by spending time with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is not just by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, we have to pray that our new man will be rekindled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we have to stay with the Lord to have the refilling of the oil in our lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we go for an entire day without praying, we feel that there is no burning within us and no light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is no rekindling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if we pray, after five minutes we realize that something has been rekindled within us, and that is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A few minutes of prayer may rekindle our new man, but that cannot refill our lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To refill our lamp we have to stay with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to my experience, we need at least half an hour for this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One hour is the proper time to be with the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not just to pray, but to be with the Lord; not just to read the Bible, but to be with the Lord; not just to meditate, to muse on some golden verses, but to be with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be with the Lord is even better than musing on some golden verses.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is better than meditating on some portion of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be with the Lord is better than studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is even better than praying.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without reading, without praying, and without meditating, you can enjoy the Lord's presence by being with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then you get the refilling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Put this into your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To rekindle your new man is by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To refill your lamp is by spending time with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>HAVE YOU FANNED YOUR FLAME?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 2 Timothy 1:6 Paul told Timothy to fan into flame the gift of God which was in him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may have a flame, but the flame is dying.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to fan the flame within us into a fire until we become burning.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today there is just a little flame within us, so we can sleep well.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But when the flame becomes a fire in the house, we cannot sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We will be burning in spirit for the Lord's interests.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>V. HAVE YOU STARTED TO HAVE THE INTIMATE AND THOROUGH FELLOWSHIP WITH YOUR COMPANION? HOW MANY TIMES?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The real intimate and thorough fellowship with your companion is something particular.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The fellowship you had in the past probably was not that intimate or that thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You have to open up yourself to your companion.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Prayer is the way to rekindle your new man; spending time with the Lord is the way to refill your lamp; now you have to open yourself up to your companion.</S>
