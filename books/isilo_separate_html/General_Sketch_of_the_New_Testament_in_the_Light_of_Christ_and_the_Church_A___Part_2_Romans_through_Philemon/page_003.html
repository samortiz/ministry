These three matters are the basic points of this section. How can we know that we are sinful? It is by the knowledge of God, by our conscience, and by the law of God. If there were no God in this universe, no knowledge of God, no conscience in human beings, and no law given to us by God, there would be no knowledge of sin. However, because there is a God in this universe, the knowledge of God, a conscience within us, and the law of God outside of us, we cannot escape God&#8217;s condemnation. Outside of man in the universe there is a just and righteous God, and within man He made a conscience to reflect what He is. Then, at a certain time God gave the law, the commandments, to regulate us. By these regulations we know whether we are wrong or right.<p>In the first section of Romans there are three parts. Verse 18 of chapter one to the end of the chapter deals with the knowledge of God. By the knowledge of God we are condemned as sinful. The second part is the first half of chapter two, which deals with the conscience. This part deals particularly with the Gentiles because the Gentiles do not have the law of God, but within them they have their conscience (2:14-16). Because of their conscience, the Gentiles cannot say that they are not sinful. Therefore, due to their conscience, which represents God and reflects what He is, they are condemned before God. The third part of the first section of Romans deals with the law of God (2:17-3:8). Strictly speaking, this part deals with the Jews because they are under the law of God. According to the law of God, the Jews also are sinful and condemned.<h2 class=head2>God&#8217;s Standard Being God Himself</h2><p>Concerning whether we are right or wrong, whether we are righteous or sinful, the standard is God Himself. The knowledge of God comes from God Himself, and this knowledge to some extent has been installed into us through our conscience. Human nature has the function of the conscience. The function of the conscience, which is within us, is related to the knowledge of God. Regardless of whether we are a Jew or a Gentile, we all have the function of the conscience within us, reflecting the knowledge of God to some extent, though not in a full way. Then, in order to establish the knowledge of God and make it more definite, God at a certain time gave man the law, which is a better reflection of the knowledge of God.<p>Therefore, when the apostle Paul was inspired to deal with the sinful human race, the standard he uplifted was God Himself with the knowledge of God, the conscience, and the law. Paul compared all of man&#8217;s deeds with God Himself, with the knowledge of God, with the conscience, and with the law of God. Therefore, his conclusion to the first main section of Romans is that all humans are shut up by the law; there is no excuse and no escape (3:9-20). Every human being is shut up by the law and is under the condemnation of God.<p>Keeping the above items and important words clearly in mind, we should again read 1:18-3:20. These items and terms are the open windows, the light, by which we can see clearly. In order to preach the gospel to tell people that they are sinful, we must find the best way to convince and convict them. In principle, we cannot convince people effectively unless we present to them either God Himself with the knowledge of God or the conscience. Many times we must touch the conscience of people in order to convince them that they are sinful. Many prevailing evangelists have preached a great deal about the law of God. They defined the law of God to people for the purpose of convincing them of their sinfulness. If we want to convince unbelievers that they are sinners, we must make God and the knowledge of God very clear to them. We must also learn how to strike their conscience and use the law of God to expose them. Then they will be enlightened and convicted that they are sinners.<p>We as members of the wonderful universal man were originally sinful persons. In light of the knowledge of God, our human conscience, and the divine law, we were sinful and under God&#8217;s condemnation. There was absolutely no escape and no possibility for us to do anything that could be justified by God. We must bow ourselves to God and to God&#8217;s divine law, being convinced by our conscience that we are sinners who need God&#8217;s redemption. This is the conclusion and the basic point of the first section of Romans. If we receive this word and keep it in mind, we can be crystal clear when we read this portion.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
