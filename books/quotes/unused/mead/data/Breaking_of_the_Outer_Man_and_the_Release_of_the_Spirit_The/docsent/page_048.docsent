   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Therefore, everyone who is subdued, either by revelation or by discipline, shows one characteristic pliableness.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Pliableness is a mark of a broken man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those who are broken by God are pliable before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our outward shell is hard and closed because there are many things which prop up these hard things in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are like a house that is supported by many pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These pillars keep the house from collapsing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When God removes the pillars one by one, the house collapses.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once the outward supporting structure is dismantled, the inward self collapses.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not think that those who speak softly are free from any stubbornness in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not think that those who are subdued in their voice are pliable in their will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many soft-spoken ones are very hard within.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hardness has to do with our nature, not with our voice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many people seem to be outwardly milder than others; they appear to be not as quick and loud.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But before God they are just as stubborn, hard, selfish, and self-confident.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The supporting elements which prop up our inner structure may be different, but the inner structure is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The self, the will, is just as strong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord has to remove these supporting elements one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He has to break them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the reason He deals with us once, twice, and repeatedly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By the grace of God, something will be knocked off of us through these repeated dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such a severe chastisement will produce a fear in us when we try to do the same thing again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We will know that if we do the same thing again, the Lord will smite us again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we say the same thing again, the Lord will chastise us again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We no longer will be so free to act.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It seems as if God has only touched something outward.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But actually, our very being has become softened; we no longer can stand in the area in which we are touched.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At least in that particular area we will not dare to disobey the Lord or insist on our ideas anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Out of fear of the Lord's chastisement, we no longer dare to move.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We fear God, and we become mellowed in that particular area.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more we experience God's dealing, the more pliable we will become.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more God carries out the breaking work in us and the wider the scope of this breaking becomes, the quicker we will be mellowed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Pliableness is a result of breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we contact certain brothers, we can say that they are gifted, but we have the feeling that they are not yet broken.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the condition of many people: They are gifted, but they are not broken.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Others can sense this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As soon as they touch these ones, they can sense the hardness in them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once they are broken, they become soft.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a man is never broken, he will surely remain hard.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In whatever area a man experiences God's chastisement, he will be purged from boasting, pride, carelessness, and lawlessness in that same area.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He will fear God with respect to that area, and he will become pliable in that area.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Bible uses many symbols for the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Spirit is symbolized by fire as well as by water.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Fire speaks of the power of the Spirit, whereas water speaks of His purity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In symbolizing the Spirit's nature, the dove is used.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Spirit's nature is a dove's nature pliable, peaceful, and meek.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not hard.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As the Spirit of God works His nature into us step by step, we acquire a dove's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The pliableness that comes as a result of a godly fear is a mark of the Spirit's breaking work.</S>
