<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE AND THE SPIRIT BEING INSEPARABLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Words of the Bible Entering into Our Spirit<br />
and Becoming the Spirit</h2>
<p>In leading the young people, we must clearly show them the difference between the Bible, which is outside of us, and the Spirit, who indwells us. Although the Bible is outside of us and the Spirit indwells us, the two in reality are one and should not be separated in our concept. The Spirit is the Spirit of the Bible, and the Bible contains the words of the Spirit. The Bible is the utterance of the Spirit so that our mind can understand. When the words of the Bible open our mind, they pass through our mind and enter into our spirit; thus, the words of the Bible become the Spirit. Whenever we understand the words of the Bible with our mind and receive them with our spirit, we sense that the Spirit, not merely the words of the Bible, has entered into our spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit outside of us is the reality of the Bible, and when the words of the Bible enter into us, we realize them as the Spirit. The entire Bible, but especially the Gospel of John, shows us that the Lord is the Word and the Spirit (1:1; 4:24; 6:63). The Lord must be the Word so that we can understand and comprehend Him in our mind, and the Lord must be the Spirit so that He can enter into our spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s words can open our thoughts and mind, and when we understand His words, our spirit can receive His words, which then become the Spirit. The Bible is the forerunner and guide for the Holy Spirit to open our mind. The reality of the Spirit outside of us is the Bible, and the realization of the words of the Bible inside of us is the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Letter Killing but the Spirit Giving Life</h2>
<p>We should never read the Bible without receiving the Spirit. If we merely read the Bible and do not receive the Spirit, the Bible will be of no benefit to us as dead letter and dead doctrines. Without receiving the Spirit, our reading will be similar to that of the Pharisees, who cared only for the black and white letters contained in the Old Testament and not for life in the Scriptures. As a result, the Pharisees fell into the dead letter and were condemned by the Scriptures instead of being saved by them. This is because the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life (2 Cor. 3:6). If the Bible is merely the letter outside of us, it will bring us into death. However, when the words of the Bible become the Spirit in our spirit, we receive life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">Christ Making His Home in Our Heart<br />
through the Revelation of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Based on John 16:15, we must present to the young people the truth that all that the Father has is in the Son and all that the Son has is received by the Spirit. Thus, when the Spirit comes, He reveals all that He received of the Son to us. The Spirit&rsquo;s revelation is through the words in the Bible, which enable us to understand and comprehend in our mind. However, we should not be limited to just understanding with our mind, we must receive the words with our spirit. All that we understand and comprehend in our mind should be turned into prayer in our spirit. The more we pray with our spirit, the more we will receive in our spirit, and what we receive in our spirit will be the rich Spirit, not the black and white letter in the Bible. When we contact and receive this rich Spirit and fellowship with Him, He will gradually reveal all that is of Christ. Thus, we will enjoy all the riches of God in Christ. This is related to Ephesians 3:17 and 19, which speak of Christ making His home in our hearts through faith so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God.</p>
<p>When Christ makes His home in our hearts, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God, because the Spirit in our spirit, through the words in the Bible, will reveal Christ in us. Christ can make His home in us only through the revelation of the Spirit, and the result of Christ&rsquo;s making His home in us is that all the riches of God in Christ will fill our inner being so that we become the fullness of God, God&rsquo;s expression. Becoming the fullness of God is the result of the Spirit&rsquo;s declaring and revealing all that the Son has from the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Speaking everything in this chapter to the young people all at once may be too challenging. It is important, however, that they have a change in their concept. They must understand the Lord&rsquo;s words and receive them with their spirit. We should help them to realize that God and Christ come to them through words that can be understood, comprehended, and then received in their spirit as the Spirit.</p>
<p>Now we understand the reason that the Lord is both the Word and the Spirit, and we also understand that God has given us His Son so that we may obtain God and enjoy Him through His Son. In His Son and through His Spirit, God gives Himself to us for our enjoyment. When His Spirit operates in us, He operates through the words in the Bible. Hence, the words in the Bible serve as a guide for the Spirit to open our mind. When our mind is open and when we receive these words into us with our spirit, the Spirit enters into us. When the Spirit enters into us, God and Christ enter into us, because all that is of God is in Christ, and all the riches of Christ are received and declared by the Spirit. Therefore, through the Bible the Spirit reveals all the riches of Christ in us. Through this receiving with our spirit, the words of the Bible are no longer doctrines to us but the reality of the Spirit, the flowing of the Spirit, the passing through of the Spirit, the operation of the Spirit, and the anointing of the Spirit, which is also the supply of the Spirit. When we lead the young people, we must stress this point. Even if we have to repeat it, we should do so, because this point does not exist in man&rsquo;s natural concept and thoughts. If necessary, we should speak it again and again so that as they pursue the Lord in their youth, they will understand the importance of the Spirit.</p>
<p>In the past we did not touch the matter of the Spirit in a deep way in our leading of the young people; we also did not explain clearly the key to walking according to the Spirit or following the Spirit. If the Lord is willing, we will speak in detail concerning these things, and I believe that it will render a big help to the brothers and sisters. In this way they will be able to touch the experience of the Spirit step by step and understand what it means to know God in Christ as our life. First Corinthians 6:17 and John 16:15 are two great verses in the Bible. Our speaking cannot exhaust the spiritual matters in these two verses. I hope that all the serving ones will pay attention to the Spirit in their leading. However, we do not have to be anxious or quick. Neither is it necessary for the churches and the young people&rsquo;s meetings to progress uniformly and in the same way. The need of the serving ones to touch the Spirit is more important than speed.</p>
