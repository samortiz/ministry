<P>In the previous messages, we have seen the definition of the Spirit. In order to help us see the truth concerning the Spirit in a full way, I would encourage us to read and even to study a small booklet we have published entitled The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus. This booklet is a reprint of chapter five of Andrew Murray's book The Spirit of Christ. Andrew Murray points out that today's Spirit has not only the divine element but also the human element. This is an extraordinary revelation. In the Spirit there are also the elements of Christ's death and resurrection.</P><P>Today the Spirit is not only the Spirit of divinity but also the Spirit of Christ's humanity. In 1971 we gave a number of messages on the significance of the meal offering in the book of Leviticus. In those messages we stressed that the meal offering refers to Christ's humanity (see the book entitled Christ as the Reality). In those messages we coined a new term by saying that we should be "Jesusly human."</P><P>In resurrection Christ, who was the only begotten Son of God in His divinity, was born of God in His humanity to be the firstborn Son of God (Acts 13:33; Rom. 8:29; 1:4). His humanity was "sonized," made divine. This "sonizing" in resurrection sanctified, uplifted, and transformed Christ's humanity which He put on in incarnation. Today such an uplifted humanity is in the Spirit and can be our enjoyment in the Spirit.</P><P>I hope that we could spend some time to study the previous messages we have released concerning the Spirit. If our understanding and apprehension of the Spirit are limited, we will not enjoy the Spirit as much as we should. Our learning and our study of the divine revelation will help us to participate in, to enjoy, the all-inclusive compounded Spirit, in whom we have Christ's divinity, Christ's humanity, Christ's death, and Christ's resurrection. Andrew Murray said that the humanity of Jesus has been interwoven into His divinity. He used the word interwoven, as in a textile. We use the word mingled, as in the mingling of the fine flour with oil in the meal offering (Lev. 2:4).</P><P>Our study of the Spirit of God in the previous outlines and messages was simple, but I believe it was all-inclusive. Those outlines and messages are the produce, the abstract, and the crystallization of the proper understanding of the Spirit of God according to the holy Word. Without such a Spirit, the humanity of Christ uplifted through resurrection could not be ours. Today the Spirit is the instrument which conveys all the elements of Christ's person and Christ's work into our being. Christ's divinity, His humanity, His death with its effectiveness, and His resurrection with its power remain in us. But due to our lack of the proper understanding, we do not know how to enjoy them. This is like having groceries without knowing how to cook them so that we can eat them. We need to see that today all the elements of Christ's person and work can be our enjoyment in the Spirit.</P><P>Now that we have seen the definition of the Spirit, we want to see the definition of our human spirit. This definition is very simple, but we should not minimize it. It is very simple yet very vital and crucial in the divine and spiritual realm. God is a Spirit. This is strongly and emphatically taught by the Bible. The Bible also strongly stresses and teaches us concerning the human spirit. This is a big "missing" in today's Christianity. They miss the human spirit even more than they miss the proper understanding of the Spirit of God.</P>
