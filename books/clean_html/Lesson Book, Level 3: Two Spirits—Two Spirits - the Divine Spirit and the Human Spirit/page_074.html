<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. MINISTERING CHRIST IN THE PRACTICAL SERVICE</H2><P>[The purpose of all we do in the church service is to minister Christ to others. Everything we do should minister life to others.</P><P>Suppose you come to the meeting hall to take care of some practical matters, to arrange the chairs, to do some cleaning work, or to take care of the kitchen. Whatever you are doing, you should take that as an opportunity to minister Christ to others. If you are cleaning, your cleaning should minister life to others. You need to minister Christ by cleaning. If you are teaching, your teaching should minister life to others. Merely to minister some knowledge to others is not enough. You need to minister Christ by teaching. It is the same with cooking. Even by cooking you should minister Christ.]</P><P>[There are many lessons to learn in ministering Christ to others by cleaning, by cooking, and by doing many different practical things. It seems that we are so spiritual, so Christ-like, when we come together for a meeting, but when we are in the kitchen it seems that we are anything but Christ-like. We need to learn the lesson to serve others and to serve God by ministering Christ to others no matter what we are doing. If you are in the spirit when you are playing the piano, by playing the piano you will minister Christ to others. As the church we are here to do nothing else but minister Christ to others. To cook a good meal for the saints, to prepare a good place for meeting, to play the piano in a skillful way&#151;none of these things are meaningful unless they minister Christ to others. Whatever we do in the service of the Lord should minister Christ to others. We have much to learn in this matter.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUMMARY</H2><P>There are two aspects of being a Christian: one is of life and the other is of service. We need to have a proper spiritual service as well as the growth in life. The real service is to minister Christ in whatever we do, whether it is gospel preaching or cleaning the meeting hall. Our serving should be by the growth in life, in the Body, and in our regenerated spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Explain how the parables of the virgins and the talents in Matthew 25 show the aspects of life and service.</li><li>What is the real church service?</li><li>Since the real service is the ministering of Christ, can you see why our serving is based firstly on the growth in life?</li><li>Why is serving a matter of the Body?</li><li>What has happened to our once dead spirit that makes it possible for us to serve in newness of spirit?</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>To Serve in the Human Spirit, pp. 78-79, 99-100, 80-81, 90-91, 97-99.</li></ol>
