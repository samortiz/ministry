<h2 class="head1">II. THE LITTLE HORN IN DANIEL 8</h2><p>Now we come to chapter eight of Daniel, where we see the little horn (vv. 8-12, 21-25). Antichrist will be the fourth beast in Daniel chapter seven and also the little horn revealed in Daniel chapter eight. The revelation in Daniel chapter eight is mainly of two things&mdash;the ram signifying Persia and the goat signifying Greece. In his book on the great prophecies, G. H. Pember says that throughout ancient Persia, especially in the capital, the symbol of a ram was found. Furthermore, in ancient Greece there were many symbols of goats. The Bible uses a ram to signify Persia and a goat to signify Greece. The goat in this chapter refers to Alexander the Great. Alexander was in power for approximately twelve years and died quite suddenly in his thirties. His strength was not like that of a ram, but like that of a goat. History tells us that when Alexander the Great came to Macedonia, he put on a crown of goat horns.</p><p>Daniel 8:8 says, &ldquo;Therefore the he goat waxed very great, and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.&rdquo; Alexander the Great had four generals. After Alexander&rsquo;s death, these generals occupied certain territories and out of them made kingdoms for themselves. Thus, after the death of Alexander, the ancient kingdom of Macedonia was divided into four kingdoms. As we read this prophecy, written long before Alexander&rsquo;s time, we cannot help but believe that the Bible was inspired by God. When I was reading and studying these matters fifty years ago, I was fully convinced that the Bible is inspired by God. No human mind could ever have given us such a brief yet inclusive revelation.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Out of One of the Four Horns of the Goat</h2><p>The little horn in Daniel 8 comes out of one of the four horns of the goat, that is, out of one of the four kingdoms of ancient Macedonia and Greece (vv. 8-9, 21-23).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Growing Exceedingly Great<br />toward the South, toward the East,<br />and toward the Beautiful Land</h2><p>Daniel 8:9 says, &ldquo;And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beautiful land&rdquo; (Heb.). &ldquo;South&rdquo; refers to Egypt, &ldquo;east&rdquo; refers to Asia Minor, and &ldquo;the beautiful land&rdquo; refers to the Holy Land. Knowing this will enable us to determine the region out of which the little horn will arise. He will come either from Greece or Macedonia, probably from Greece. This is the reason that he will be intellectually brilliant, for, since ancient times, the Greeks have been noted for their intellectual achievements.</p><p>However, the prophecies in the Bible are sometimes rather &ldquo;sneaky.&rdquo; For example, Micah 5:2 prophesied that Christ would be born in Bethlehem. Although this prophecy was fulfilled, it was difficult for anyone to trace Christ&rsquo;s origin to Bethlehem. His mother Mary was impregnated in Nazareth, not in Bethlehem. Near the time of her delivery, she journeyed to Bethlehem and stayed there just long enough for the Lord Jesus to be born. Soon after His birth, Jesus was taken by His parents to Egypt and later to Nazareth, where He was raised (Matt. 2:19-23). Consequently, everyone knew Him as Jesus of Nazareth. Hardly anyone knew that, in a &ldquo;sneaky&rdquo; way, He had actually been born in Bethlehem.</p><p>Mr. Pember says that Napoleon was a descendant of the Greeks. Although it is difficult to be certain, I feel strongly that Antichrist will also be a Greek descendant. However, it is difficult to determine exactly where he will spring up. Nevertheless, he will undoubtedly be closely related to Greece in some way. This is not my guess or even my interpretation; this is the clear implication in Daniel 8:9. Antichrist will certainly come from one of the four kingdoms in the territory of the ancient empire of Macedonia and Greece under Alexander the Great.</p><p>At this point let us consider, as a parenthesis, the historical fulfillment of Daniel 2:31-33, 38-45, and 7:3-7. The head of the great image, the first beast, was the empire of Babylon (605 B.C. to 539 B.C.). The breast and the arms of the great image, the second beast, represent the empire of Medo-Persia (549 B.C. to 330 B.C.). Media and Persia were like two arms, but they were one empire. The belly and thighs of the great image, the third beast, signify the empire of Macedonia and Greece (336 B.C. to 323 B.C.). As we have seen, after the death of Alexander the Great, the empire of Macedonia and Greece was divided into four parts: the kingdom of Ptolemy in Egypt, Cyrene, Coelo-Syria, and parts of Asia Minor; the kingdom of Cassander in Macedonia and Greece; the kingdom of Lysimachus in Thrace, western Bithynia, Lesser Phrygia, Mysia, and Lydia; and the kingdom of Seleucus in the remainder of Asia Minor and in Syria (323 B.C. to 31 B.C.). Therefore, that the little horn will grow great toward the south, the east, and the beautiful land is a proof that Antichrist will arise from the source of Greece and Macedonia. The legs of the great image, the fourth beast, are the Roman Empire (30 B.C. to A.D. 476). The territories of the western Roman Empire included Gaul, Spain, Britain, Italy, and the western half of North Africa. The territories of the eastern Roman Empire included Macedonia, Greece, Thrace, Asia Minor, Syria, Judea, Egypt, and the eastern part of North Africa. After A.D. 476 the Roman Empire was suspended. During the time of this suspension, that is, during the interval after the two legs and before the ten toes, the Roman Empire has been replaced by the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
