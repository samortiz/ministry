   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church being the pillar and base of the truth 3:15.</S>

   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word of the truth being the gospel of our salvation Eph 1:13.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Knowing the truth that sets us free John 8:32.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Being fully equipped with the Scripture 2 Tim 3:16-17.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Cutting straight the word of the truth 2:15.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word of God growing Acts 6:7; 12:24.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I began speaking for the Lord in 1927 when I was invited to speak to denominations and other Christian gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, that was not regular.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was not until a church was raised up in my hometown of Chefoo in 1932 that I began to speak on a regular basis for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I spoke at least three to five times every week.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That was over fifty-two years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During these fifty-two years I have listened to many pastors and preachers and paid attention to the content of their messages.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For over half a century, while I labored, I also observed how others labored.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In addition, I was born into Christianity; on my mother s side I am a fourth-generation Christian, and I studied in Christian schools from elementary school through junior college.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It can therefore be said that I have a considerable amount of knowledge concerning today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>AN UNPRECEDENTED DESIRE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>FOR THE GOSPEL AND THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BEING IN MAN S HEART</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to my observation, there is an unprecedented openness toward the Lord in the heart of people today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is seen in their desire to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have been laboring in America for over twenty-two years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During this time we have not seen such openness to the Lord in the heart of men, nor have we seen such a desire for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Chinese migrants are the source of this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I received the burden to go to America twenty-three years ago, I was clear that I was taking the Lord s recovery to the English-speaking world; I was not going there to do a work among the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, I spent my time and energy on the American people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For nearly twenty years I did not stress the work among the Chinese in America, because I knew that if many Chinese were saved, it would be difficult to bring in the Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord confirmed the way we took, by bringing thousands of American brothers and sisters into the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, two years ago there was a change in the American immigration law, which increased the quota for Chinese immigrants from twenty thousand to forty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This enabled many Chinese to move to the United States, and many of our brothers and sisters also went.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then I had the feeling that if we do not care for the Chinese brothers and sisters, we would lose them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, we began the work among the Chinese, and we found out that the Chinese students throughout the various campuses in the United States were open to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We had a welcoming meeting at the University of Southern California the day before school started.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the largest private university in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Over fifty Chinese freshmen came to that gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We also have Chinese-speaking meetings at the University of California in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This fall when school started, there were over fifty students at our welcoming meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some may think that fifty students is not a large number, but the American saints were amazed that so many Chinese students responded to the gospel at a college campus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The brothers who care for the students on the various campuses have found out that no matter where they go, people s hearts are open.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The American students have also changed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The 1960s was the age of the hippies, but we are now in 1984, and there are no more hippies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The American trends come fast and go fast.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The college students today are industrious and aggressive, and they are open to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, we discovered that Christians today like to read the Bible, and they want to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They may read books, periodicals, and pamphlets related to the Bible, but they pay great attention to expositions of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Their desire to understand the Bible is unprecedented.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have labored for the Lord for over thirty years in China and over twenty years in the United States, but I have never seen such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is an unprecedented need for the gospel, for Bible interpretation, and for the truth, because people everywhere have an open heart.</S>
