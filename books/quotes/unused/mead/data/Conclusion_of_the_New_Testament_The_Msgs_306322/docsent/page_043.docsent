   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Meekness to Give In to Others and</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Gentleness to Bear Others</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 2 Corinthians 10:1 Paul says that he entreats the Corinthian believers through the meekness and gentleness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because Paul lived Christ, the virtues of Christ became his.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The phrase through the meekness and gentleness of Christ indicates that Paul was one with Christ and that he took Christ as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, he entreated the believers not by himself but through the virtues of Christ, particularly through Christ s meekness and forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul entreated others by Christ, in Christ, and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the virtues of Christ were becoming Paul s virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Meekness is a virtue in the humanity of Christ by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ s meekness is not a simple matter, because it is in His humanity and by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When He was on the earth, He lived a human life by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through this mingling of divinity and humanity the virtue of meekness was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The principle is the same with Christ s virtue of gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Gentleness is another virtue of Christ lived in His humanity by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To be meek is to give in to others, and to be gentle is to bear others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To have the virtue of meekness is not to invade others or fight with them; instead, it is to be willing to give in to others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be meek is to be mild toward men, without resisting or disputing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Gentleness denotes humility, yieldingness, and approachableness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To have gentleness means to be willing to allow others to invade us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that to have gentleness is to be willing to suffer affliction and injury.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To have meekness is not to invade others but to give in to them; to have gentleness is to be willing to be invaded by others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These are two of the virtues Christ lived in His humanity by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because Paul lived by Christ, whatever Christ was became his virtue in his behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Moreover, we may be meek and gentle, but we need to consider whether or not our meekness and gentleness are something of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all agree that we must reject or repudiate the character that is not meek and gentle, but we need to realize that we must reject our natural meekness and our natural gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some believers may be proud of their meekness and gentleness, but the apostle Paul said that he entreated the Corinthians not in his own meekness or gentleness but in the meekness and gentleness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This shows that Paul was a person living in the spirit, always taking Christ as his everything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was a person living by Christ and experiencing Christ as his meekness and gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, Paul did not say that he imitated the meekness and gentleness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To imitate Christ is one thing, but to live in His meekness and gentleness is another.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to live in His meekness and gentleness, we need Christ to be wrought into us so that His meekness and gentleness can be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul enjoyed these aspects of Christ s unsearchable riches, and they also should be our enjoyment today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we contact others, we should not try to imitate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, we should contact them in the meekness and gentleness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to enjoy the meekness and gentleness of Christ, we need to be in the Spirit, because all the riches of Christ are in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we turn to our spirit, contact Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit, and take Him as our person, His meekness and gentleness become our food, nourishment, strength, and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no need for us to desperately attempt to restrain ourselves or to manufacture meekness or gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The meekness and gentleness of Christ are simply our spontaneous enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can actually feed on these aspects of Christ s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we take Him as our person, we spontaneously enjoy His meekness and gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of self-effort, we simply enjoy whatever Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was the living of the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Truthfulness to Be Honest with Others</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 2 Corinthians 11:10 Paul says, The truthfulness of Christ is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is in Christ as truthfulness as honesty, faithfulness, and trustworthiness was also in the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since Paul lived by Christ, whatever Christ is became his virtue in his behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because the truthfulness of Christ was in him, Paul could be honest with others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ s truthfulness is His genuineness, sincerity, honesty, and trustworthiness as a divine attribute Rom 3:7; 15:8 and as a human virtue Mark 12:14 , an issue of the divine reality John 4:23-24; 2 John 1; 3 John 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such a divine attribute and human virtue should be our experience and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The truthfulness of Christ was in Paul because Christ Himself was wrought into him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ is truthfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a further proof that Paul lived by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Otherwise, he could not have had the truthfulness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here truthfulness denotes faithfulness, trustworthiness, and honesty.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Specifically, truthfulness indicates the faithfulness, the honesty, of the Lord Jesus in His human living.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This virtue was also manifest in the living of the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because Paul realized that he was one with Christ, he also realized that he had the virtues of Christ s human life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Paul not only enjoyed Christ s divinity in great things; he also enjoyed His humanity in the detailed items of His human virtues based upon the divine attributes.</S>
