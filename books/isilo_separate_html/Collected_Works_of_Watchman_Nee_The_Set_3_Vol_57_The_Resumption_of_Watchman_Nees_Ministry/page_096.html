Neither is there such a thing as a group of brothers and sisters serving while another group of brothers and sisters is being served. What we see in the Bible is the whole Body being a priesthood. The church is comprised of priests. God's intention was for the Israelites to be a kingdom of priests. But in actuality, not everyone was a priest. The situation among the local churches today is a little bit better. The brothers and sisters have the liberty to pray, to sing, to preach, and to take up responsibilities. But we have to realize that this is still not the church. The church is built upon the universal priesthood of the whole Body. The church is not built upon a few brothers and sisters. If the priesthood is not universal, we have Roman Catholicism. If the priesthood is universal, we have the church. We have to see that service to God is not a matter of three or five people serving, or thirty or fifty people serving. Our service to God today must be entirely different. In order to serve God today, everyone has to rise up to do the work.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT THE SERVICE OF THE MINISTERS,<br />BUT THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>When we were in Foochow, we noted the fact that in the past century, God raised up many spiritual giants, and that all of them were outstanding people. From 1820 until now, many spiritual giants have been raised up. Yet strangely, among us today we see very few spiritual giants. It seems as if the spiritual giants are all gone. Today we do not see the work of gospel preaching being done through the so-called great evangelists, men like Charles Finney and Stanley. It is not easy to find giants like these anymore. It seems as if God is taking a different way today. Today is the day of the service of the church, not the service of the ministers. It is no longer a matter of individuals preaching the gospel, but a matter of the church preaching the gospel. Previously, we had to invite famous and eloquent speakers to come to preach the gospel, and we had to use much propaganda. But today the church is coordinating together to preach the gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT INDIVIDUALS PREACHING THE GOSPEL,<br />BUT THE CHURCH PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2><p>Take the case of Foochow. Recently, when the brothers were preaching the gospel, we had some brothers giving messages on the platform, but there were no advertisements and no famous speakers. One brother who had been saved for only two or three years was doing the preaching, and all the other brothers and sisters went out to invite friends. Twenty to fifty brothers and sisters could bring in four or five hundred people, and four or five hundred people could bring in a few thousand. Before the speaker stood up, two or three hundred people were saved already. Those brothers and sisters who brought their friends along with them knew if the friends sitting next to them were saved or not. The speaker on the platform could be deceived, but the brothers and sisters were clear about the condition of their friends. They could say that this one who stood up was genuine, and that one who stood up was not genuine. After the meeting they helped their gospel friends become clearer concerning the gospel. They helped them write down their names, showed them the direction to the meeting halls, and visited those who expressed their willingness to believe in the Lord.</p><p>Within one month in Foochow, almost a thousand people were saved. Today some people are still opposing, and this is why our work is still not that strong. If there is no frustration, I believe that all of Foochow can be taken over by us. Today the church is not a few special brothers rising up to preach the gospel; it is the whole church rising up to preach the gospel.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_095.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_097.html">Next</a> </body></html>
