   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEATH, RESURRECTION, MULTIPLICATION, AND GLORIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In previous messages we pointed out that the Lord's death was for His multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To Him, death was not a termination; it was a multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that for the Lord death was not an ending; rather, it was a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Apart from death, how could He have entered into resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First there is death and then resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 12:24 the Lord indicated that He as a grain of wheat would fall into the ground and die and then grow up to produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Praise the Lord that after passing through the process of death described in chapters eighteen and nineteen, the Lord grew up in resurrection with His multiplication!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord's multiplication consists of His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was the reason the Lord told Mary Magdalene to go to His brothers 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that through the Lord's death and resurrection, the Lord's timid disciples became His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We know that Peter took the lead to be timid.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Peter denied that he was one of the Lord's disciples: "Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They said then to him, Are you not also one of his disciples?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He denied and said, I am not" 18:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Peter certainly was timid.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It seems that neither he nor the other disciples were worthy to be disciples, much less brothers of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, on the day of Christ's resurrection, timid Simon Peter became a brother of the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was the resurrected Christ who told Mary to go to His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord's brothers are His multiplication, the result of His wonderful death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord died as a grain of wheat, and in resurrection the result was that many grains were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Praise the Lord that all His disciples became His brothers in resurrection!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the multiplication of the crucified Jesus and the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This multiplication is the glorification concerning which the Lord Jesus prayed in John 17.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before He died, the Lord prayed that the Father would glorify the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then in a short period of time, perhaps less than forty hours, this prayer was answered when in resurrection the Lord was multiplied and glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let us now go on to consider the signs in chapter twenty of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first of the signs in John 20 is that of the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 1 says, "Now on the first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene came early to the tomb while it was yet dark, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is significant that the Lord was resurrected not on the last day of the week, but on the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This day denotes a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Bible the first day of the week is also called the eighth day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After a week of seven days, we have the eighth day, which is the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord died during one week, and He was resurrected at the start of another week.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, the first day of the week is a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>John 20 speaks of both the first day of the week and the eighth day v. 26 . We have seen that the first day is also called the eighth day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first mention of the eighth day in the Scriptures is related to the circumcision of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God commanded them to be circumcised on the eighth day Gen 17:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to John 20, the second Lord's Day after His resurrection was the eighth day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The sign of the first day of the week indicates that the entire universe has a new beginning in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His resurrection ushered in a new period, a new age.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the sight of God, the entire old creation was crucified with Christ and buried with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then on the first day of the week there was a new beginning with Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whereas the Lord's death was a termination of the old creation, His resurrection was the germination of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this reason, instead of keeping the Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, we meet on the Lord's Day, which is the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that in resurrection we are in the eighth day, or the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Elsewhere, the New Testament calls the first day of the week the Lord's day Rev 1:10 , for it was on this day that the Lord Jesus was resurrected to become the living Lord and to usher in a new beginning in resurrection.</S>
