   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY MESSAGE NINE DEALING WITH THE SAINTS OF DIFFERENT AGES Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 5:1-16 THE DIVINE STANDARD AND THE HUMAN LEVEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the end of chapter three Paul comes to the high point of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 3:15 and 16 we see the divine standard.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But in 5:1-16 Paul comes down to the human level.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, in the church life we must have the divine standard; on the other hand, we must care for matters on the human level.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 5:8, for example, Paul speaks of providing for our own relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the instructions in this chapter are very human, normal, and ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nothing is special, miraculous, or supernatural.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The whole book is written in the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is necessary for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The principle of presenting both the divine standard and the human level is found not only in 1 Timothy, but also in the Epistles of Ephesians and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Ephesians Paul first writes concerning the church according to the divine standard.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Afterward, on the human level, he writes about husbands, wives, parents, children, slaves, and masters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In like manner, in Colossians Paul first writes about Christ according to the divine standard.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then he speaks on a human level about family matters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1 Timothy Paul does not come to the human level directly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, he comes to this level by giving instructions to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 5:1-16 Paul tells Timothy how to deal with the saints of different ages.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My burden in this message is to cover four points from 5:1-16.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>LIVING A NORMAL HUMAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First, all the instructions given here are presented in a very human way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should never think that if we reach God's standard, we no longer need to be human.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some believers have been influenced by the false teaching that Christians should be like angels, that it is no longer necessary for them to lead a normal human life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many monks and priests in Catholicism have a living that is abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, the requirement that priests and nuns not be married not only is contrary to humanity, but has its source in demons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to Paul's word in 4:1-3, forbidding others to marry is a demonic teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all need to learn to be human.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In fact, the more spiritual we are, the more human we shall be.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we would live Christ, we must learn to be human in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was very human.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To damage humanity is to ruin both the means and the channel created by God for His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The reason demons and fallen angels forbid marriage and command people to abstain from foods is that their intention is to destroy mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, we in the church must be human and follow the standards of normal human living.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some have falsely accused us of not being human.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We utterly repudiate these allegations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the church life we definitely emphasize the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I can testify that I myself live in a normal human way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you examine my living, you will find me to be very human.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am not a "saint" or an angel; I am simply a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, I encourage all the elders to be human.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The elders should not help the saints in their locality to be like angels.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We appreciate the angels, but we do not want to imitate them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead, we prefer to be human.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should be human Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the one hand, we have the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 ; on the other hand, we are normal human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The fact that we have the divine nature with the divine life does not mean that we shall ever be deified.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, we are to live a genuinely human life by the divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way we shall be able to live the highest human life, a life like that of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When He was on earth, He lived a human life by means of the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord's human living was by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our human living should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, we all must learn to be human.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In 5:1-16 we see that Paul instructed his young co-worker Timothy to contact the saints in a human way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 1 says, "Do not upbraid an elderly man, but entreat him as a father."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To entreat an elderly man as a father is surely to behave in a very human manner.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In relation to brothers who are a generation older than they, the younger brothers should deal with them as fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul also tells Timothy to entreat "younger men as brothers; elderly women as mothers; younger women as sisters."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Timothy was not to assume an elevated position as a bishop, regarding himself as superior to others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the contrary, he was to behave as a brother to younger brothers and sisters, as a son to a father, and as a son to a mother.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the church life there are many fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To deal with the saints as such is to behave humanly.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our contact with the saints must be in a proper atmosphere and with the right attitude and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The atmosphere, attitude, and spirit in our contact with others mean a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If a young brother assumes some kind of elevated position in relation to an elderly man, the relationship between them will be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But if he would contact him as a son speaking to a father, their fellowship will be intimate, loving, touching, and even inspiring.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Suppose that in my relationship with the saints I conduct myself as a teacher and treat the saints as my pupils.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If this is my attitude, my contact with the saints will be quite poor.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But if I am very human in my relationships with the saints and regard myself as a brother among brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, the contact will be loving and intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What a difference it makes when we are truly human in our relationships to one another!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I repeat, in the church life we all must be human.</S>
