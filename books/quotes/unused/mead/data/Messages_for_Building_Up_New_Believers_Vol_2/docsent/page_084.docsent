   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO HUSBAND AND WIFE Scripture Reading: Col 3:18-19; 1 Pet 3:1-7; Eph 5:22-23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have already covered the subject of choosing a mate.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That word was for the young brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, not everyone among us is young.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the future some new believers among us will be married ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible has clear teachings for those who are married.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some portions of the Word contain teachings for husbands, and some portions contain teachings for wives.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before a person is married, he should do his best to choose someone with the fewest number of weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, after a person is married, he or she has to learn to behave in a way that avoids causing problems to the family or the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I. SPENDING TIME TO LEARN TO BE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A HUSBAND OR A WIFE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first thing a married person must realize is that it is a serious matter to be a husband or a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Everyone needs a certain amount of preparation before taking a job.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, a doctor needs five, six, or seven years of training before he can practice medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A teacher has to spend a few years in a teaching college before starting to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>An engineer also needs to spend four years in the university before launching his career.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even a nurse needs to study for three years in preparation for her career.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the interesting thing is that no one spends a day learning how to be a husband or a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is no wonder that there are so many bad husbands and wives.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They have never sat down to consider how to be a proper husband or a proper wife.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would be very hesitant and uneasy about asking someone to treat my illness if he had never studied medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Likewise, I would be very hesitant and uneasy about using a nurse who had never studied nursing before.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I would be fearful and uneasy about hiring a teacher who had never been trained.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If I wanted to build a house, I would only want to hire a civil engineer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I would worry and be afraid if he were not a trained civil engineer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Similarly, I have doubts about those who have become husbands or wives without ever being trained.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our parents never taught us to be husbands or wives.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we grow up, we find a job.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we have the ability to support a family, we find a partner and get married.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Please remember that many difficulties arise between the husband and the wife because neither has undergone any preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When two persons are drawn into a marriage unprepared and suddenly find themselves husband and wife, how can they expect anything but problems for the family?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everything we do with our life requires training; we dare not jump into anything rashly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We prepare for our work and try to learn something about it before we plunge into it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must see that no job is more difficult than the job of being a husband or a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All jobs have fixed working hours.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the only job that takes up all twenty-four hours of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every job has a retirement age except this one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a very serious vocation and a very important one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For now we will put the past behind us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even though you were not prepared when you became a husband or a wife, you have nevertheless become one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You are already married and have reached this point in your life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Perhaps your looseness in the past has ruined your family.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today you have to see that the family is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You have to go back and learn your lessons all over again.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The husbands need to go back to learn how to be husbands, and the wives need to go back to learn how to be wives.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It may not work for a person to try to apply the same earnestness he adopts in his job to his family.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The truth, however, is that many people are far more careless toward their family than they are toward their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This invites inevitable failure into their family.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to pour all of our energy into building our family.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to be more conscientious with it than with our jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we behave carelessly and do not consider being a husband or a wife a serious occupation, our family will end up with nothing but failure.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we want our family to be a successful family, we have to cherish it as a job and spend time with it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to try our best to make it work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is serious business, and we have to make it work at all costs.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those who are careless about their marriage and have no intention of making it a success will never have a successful marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All married brothers and sisters must learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must spend time before the Lord to deal with this matter in a responsible way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a more difficult job than any other job.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to spend time before the Lord to learn our lesson well.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I hope that we will start learning it today.</S>
