<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST IN PHILIPPIANS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Phil. 1:19-21; 2:5-8, 15, 17; 3:7-11, 14; 4:12-13</h1><p>The subject of the book of Philippians is the experience of Christ in every kind of circumstance. No other book deals as specifically with the experience of Christ as this one, telling us that Christ must be our experience regardless of our circumstances and difficulties.<p>Students of the Scriptures may ask why the book of Philippians is inserted between the two sister books of Ephesians and Colossians. I believe that there is a sovereign meaning to this; I wholly believe in the sovereign arrangement of these books in the New Testament. The book of Ephesians is concerning the church, and the church is a matter of a life in Christ. If we intend to have the church life, we need the experience of Christ. We can never separate the church life from the experience of Christ as life. We can never realize the church in a living way if we do not experience Christ in our daily walk. We have to experience Christ in all our circumstances; only then can we realize the church life.<p>The church is not a matter of mere doctrine. We cannot realize the church merely by teaching or by studying. Rather, it requires the real experience of the life of Christ. The more we experience Christ’s life, the more we will sense the need for the church. When we live by ourselves apart from Christ, we do not sense the need for the church. But when we come to Christ and begin to experience Him, right away we sense the need for the church life. Thus, the experience of Christ as life is basic to the realization of the church life. Because of this, Philippians, the book on the experience of Christ, immediately follows Ephesians, the book on the church. This is the meaning of the sovereign order of these books. The more we love Christ and live in Him, by Him, and with Him, and the more we experience Him, the more we sense our deep need for the church.<h2 class=head1>LIVING CHRIST TO MAGNIFY HIM</h2><p>Philippians has four chapters, and each chapter is a section. Chapter one shows us that Christ is our life and expression. In other words, this chapter tells us how we live Christ to magnify Him, that is, to express Him.<h2 class=head2>Living by Christ as Our Life and for Christ as Our Purpose</h2><p>Verse 21 of chapter one says, “For to me, to live is Christ.” This has the meaning both of living by Christ as our life and of living for Christ as our purpose. While we are on this earth, we live not by ourselves but by Christ as our life, and we live not for ourselves but for Christ as our purpose. If we live for ourselves, we cannot say that for us to live is Christ; we would have to say that for us to live is we ourselves. If it is true that for us to live is Christ, this means that we are living by Christ and for Christ. Christ is our life and Christ is our purpose.<p>Verse 20 says, “According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.” To say that Christ is magnified in us is abstract, but to say that Christ is magnified in our body is more concrete. Whether through life or through death, Christ will be magnified in us bodily. Magnified means expressed, exalted, and honored. Christ is expressed, exalted, and honored in us bodily. This means that we are living here to express Christ, exalt Christ, and honor Christ, and our life, living, and being are to follow Christ as our purpose. The purpose of our living, of our family, of our job, and of everything in our life is Christ Himself. Our purpose is to magnify Christ, express Christ, glorify Christ, exalt Christ, and honor Christ.<p>Although it is an easy thing to quote this verse, do we really live for Christ? Is everything of ours on the altar for Christ? We should remember who it is that wrote this word. The apostle Paul put everything on the altar, and he left nothing for himself. Everything of his was an offering, either put on the altar or poured out at the base of the altar. While he was in prison, everything had been taken away for Christ; all that was left to him was his breath. Such a person was qualified to say, “For to me, to live is Christ.” We may not be qualified to say this, because we may not be one hundred percent for Christ. We must be wholly for Christ. While we do business, our business is for Christ. Our job, our studying, our teaching, and everything in our life is for Christ. Whatever happens to us, whatever we have, and whatever we do must all be for Christ. Then we will be in a position to say that for us, to live is Christ. We should check ourselves in this light. Verses 20 and 21 are the key verses in the first section of this book, showing how the apostle Paul took Christ as his life and as his expression.
