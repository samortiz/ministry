<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. ISSUING IN ISRAEL'S TURN TO JEHOVAH</H2><P>In 30:15 and 31:6 and 7 we have a word concerning Jehovah's dealing with Israel's reliance on Egypt and His dealing with the nations issuing in Israel's turn to Jehovah. As we have seen, in 30:15 Jehovah says, "In returning and rest you will be saved;/In quietness and in trust will be your strength." In 31:6 and 7 Isaiah says, "Return to Him from whom men have deeply revolted, O children of Israel. For in that day each man will cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which your hands have made for you as a sin."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. ISSUING IN JEHOVAH'S RETURN TO ISRAEL</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah Waiting to Be Gracious to Israel</H2><P>Jehovah waits to be gracious to Israel. Therefore, He remains on high to have compassion on them; for He is a God of justice. Blessed are those who wait for Him (30:18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jehovah Descending to Wage War on Mount Zion</H2><P>As the lion or the lion cub roars over its prey and because of it a crowd of shepherds is called out, but it is not frightened by their voice, nor overcome by their noise, so Jehovah will descend to wage war on Mount Zion and on its hill. Like flying birds so will Jehovah of hosts protect Jerusalem. He will protect and deliver it; He will pass over and rescue it (31:4-5). Just as there was a time when Jehovah gave up Israel, so there will be a time when He, like birds overshadowing their young, will return to Israel and protect her.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jehovah's Fire Being in Zion<br>and His Furnace Being in Jerusalem</H2><P>Jehovah's fire is in Zion and His furnace is in Jerusalem for the protection of Israel (v. 9b).</P>
