   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>e The Produce Ishmael by the Effort of the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>with the Law</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without exception, every Christian is like Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After we were saved, we came to realize that God wants us to live a Christ-like life, a heavenly life, a victorious life, a life that constantly pleases God and glorifies Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yes, God does want us to live such a life, but He will work Christ into us to live for us a heavenly life to please Him and glorify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, all of us focus on the intention and neglect the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The intention is that we live a heavenly life for the glory of God, and the grace is that God will work Christ into us for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>So firstly we rely upon our Lot, that which we brought with us from our natural background, trying to use him to fulfill God's purpose in living a heavenly life for the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When God does not allow us to rely upon Lot, then we turn to Eliezer, expecting that he will enable us to live a heavenly life for God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually God tells us, "I don't want that.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I don't want anything objective but something subjective from within your own being."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once we realize that God wants this, then we begin to exercise our own energy, our natural strength, to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all have a Hagar, a maid who is always willing to cooperate with us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may not have the law given by Moses, but we do have many self-made laws.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all are lawgivers and make laws for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us consider some examples of these self-made laws.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps you say that never again will you lose your temper with your husband or have a negative attitude towards him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is your first commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The second commandment is that, as a Christian lady and a Christian wife, you need to be nice, sweet, and humble.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Your third commandment is never to criticize others, and the fourth is to always love people and never to hate them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These self-made laws are our Hagars.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whether we succeed or not in keeping our laws makes no difference in the eyes of God because in His eyes even our successes do not count.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the past years some sisters nearly succeeded in fulfilling their self-made laws.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They had a strong character, a strong will, and a strong intention, and all day long they tried their best to control their temper and to be nice, sweet, and humble.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although such sisters might have been successful at this, what they produced was just an Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These sisters were happy with their Ishmael and, in a sense, they were proud of him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The principle is exactly the same with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although we may gain an Ishmael who is good in our eyes, we have the deep sensation that we are missing something.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have lost God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moreover, this Ishmael will always mock the spiritual things 21:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, we do not like this mocking element, but, on the other hand, we still feel that since Ishmael was produced by us, he is not that bad.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But, having lost God's presence, we find ourselves in trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Just as the descendants of Ishmael are a problem to Israel today, so the Ishmael that we have produced remains a problem to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once we are clear about this, we would pray, "Lord, keep me in Your grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Keep me in the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whether Your promise will be fulfilled today or many years from now does not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I only want to care for Your promise."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although it is easy to say this, it is not easy to live it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What is true in our Christian life is also true in our Christian work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The New Testament tells us that after we are saved we need to preach the gospel and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But how much natural effort and strength are exercised in the matter of so-called soul winning!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many kinds of Hagars, all of whom were acquired in Egypt, are used to win souls.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every worldly means of soul-winning is a Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yes, you may use Hagar to win souls, but what kind of souls will you win?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They will not be Isaac but Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the New Testament, the proper fruit-bearing and gospel preaching are by the overflow of the inner life, by God working Christ into, through, and out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that the proper gospel preaching is by Christ as grace to us.</S>
