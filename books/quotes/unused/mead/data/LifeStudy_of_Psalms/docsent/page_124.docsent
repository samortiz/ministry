   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN PRAISING AND GIVING THANKS TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 33 is the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in praising and giving thanks to God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. Encouraging the Righteous to Praise God</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>and Give Thanks to God</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The psalmist encouraged the righteous to praise God and give thanks to God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. Praising God in His Restoring</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>of the Heavens and the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verses 6-9 the psalmist praised God in His restoring of the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 9 says, "For He spoke, and it was;/He commanded, and it stood."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When God said, "Let there be light," there was light Gen 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When God commanded, something came out and stood.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is good, but we need to see that Paul's teaching is not concerning the restoration of the chaotic universe, but of the resurrection of Christ from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We were once dead, but one day the Lord made us alive and raised us from the dead Eph 2:1, 5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today we are living in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are not restored people but resurrected people!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may be impressed with God's restoring of the heavens and of the earth, but the New Testament is concerning the new creation in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul's prayer in Ephesians 1 refers to the resurrection v. 20 . Regardless of how much restoration the heavens and the earth undergo, they are still the old creation, but we are the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are not merely restored; we are resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is nothing in the New Testament which asks us to praise God for the restoration of the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, Paul spoke of his desire to know Christ and the power of His resurrection Phil 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I want to point out again that the Psalms show us the inferiority of the law and the superiority of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is good to praise God for His restoration of the heavens and the earth, but this is not as high as praising Him for the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In His resurrection, Christ raised us from the dead Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is much higher than the restoration of the heavens and the earth.</S>
