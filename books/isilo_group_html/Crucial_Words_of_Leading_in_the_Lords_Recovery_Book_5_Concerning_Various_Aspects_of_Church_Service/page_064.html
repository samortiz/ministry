<p>We must be very careful when we touch the matter of ministering the Lord&rsquo;s word. It is not an easy task to touch the Lord&rsquo;s holy Word, so we must see the importance of this matter. My advice to you is to spend time studying the Bible and the Life-studies. If we are willing to mine the riches in them, many problems will be solved. This can be compared to playing the piano; much time and continued practice are required for a person to be qualified to perform in a concert. This fellowship is not to trouble you, nor is it to discourage you from ministering the word. I believe that many of us are gifts raised up by God. However, I am concerned that we esteem the Lord&rsquo;s word too lightly; we have not given serious regard to the matter of speaking for the Lord.</p>
<p>Only God can create something out of nothing; we cannot. We are human beings, and therefore we need to learn continually. We all need to receive the Lord&rsquo;s grace and the Lord&rsquo;s gift. Paul says, &ldquo;Fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you&rdquo; (2 Tim. 1:6). First and 2 Corinthians, Hebrews, and Ephesians reveal that the gift in us requires nurturing and development. Sooner or later we have to take this way; otherwise, we will never be an outlet for the rich word. At best we will be able to borrow a few main points from others and use them to speak. If we desire to be an outlet for the rich word, we must be saturated with the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>The Lord has granted us His grace. Everything depends on how we cooperate with Him. I once observed some students in a seminary collecting material for fifty-two sermons. This was to meet the need of being a pastor. After staying in a place for one year, they would move on to another place because they had exhausted their sermons. If they do not move to another place after exhausting their sermons, they would begin to speak on unrelated matters. It is better not to speak than to fall into a similar situation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPLYING THE WORD TO BUILD UP<br />
THE SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>We are using the same material for morning watch and for the small groups. This is not a conflict; instead, it is a strengthening and an application. It is the responsibility of every member in a small group to apply what he learns from morning watch. The elders in each meeting hall must also bear this responsibility. They cannot rely on the co-workers to promote this. All the elders in each meeting hall should regularly visit different small groups. If they notice that a particular group is falling behind, they should be willing to meet with the group for a while and help lead them to advance. This is what the elders should do until all the small groups are built up.</p>
<p>This practice will help the saints to exercise their organic function. If we depend solely on the big meetings, no matter how much we endeavor, we will not bring the saints into a situation where everyone exercises his organic function. However, if each of us can take what we read in the morning and apply it in the small group meeting, the result will be impressive. The elders must build up the small groups. The co-workers should also devote themselves to working on the small groups. We must get through. If we can spend two years to devote ourselves to the small groups and lay a foundation, we will reap a great harvest. This is not like holding a revival meeting and inviting a spiritual giant to speak a few messages. The effect of such a meeting is seen for one week, but it does not last. Building up the small groups requires real labor.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DILIGENTLY PROMOTING THE SMALL GROUPS<br />
AND LEADING THE SAINTS INTO THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD</h2>
<p>If the Lord allows it, I would like to consecrate three months to helping you build up the small groups. Much is involved in the small groups. In order to build up the local churches, especially in large localities, we must build up the small groups. We have no excuses. We must build up the small groups. When the small group meetings are strong, the table meeting will be rich, the prayer meeting will be strengthened, and the gospel preaching will be effective. The small groups are the foundation of the church. If the foundation is solid, we can accomplish much more with half the effort.</p>
<p>Some people have been in Christianity for years but know very little. However, if they were to attend fifty-two small group meetings in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, they would change. Their knowledge of the truth and their utterance would indicate that they are from an educated family. We all can make this our goal. If we do not devote time to this now, we will still have to do it in another ten years. However, if we diligently build up the small groups, within half a year all the saints will be getting into God&rsquo;s word. We should labor in one accord toward this goal by diligently facilitating the small groups. Then the saints will be brought into the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 5: Concerning Various Aspects of Church Service &nbsp; pg 64</div><br></body></html>
