<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>O. Deputy Authority<br>versus the Direct Headship of Christ</H2><P>The opposing ones have also rejected the truth concerning deputy authority, claiming that they are under the direct headship of Christ. This is nonsense. All of the people ruling in the government are deputy authorities under God (Rom. 13:1-7). If a country existed in which the people said that they did not want to have any man ruling over them, but that they just wanted God to be their Ruler, that country would be full of chaos and anarchy. There must be a government with the rule of law through the police and the courts. Deputy authority is not versus God's headship.</P><P>In our physical body, there is order. The arm can be considered as a deputy authority to the hand and fingers. The arms are not versus the head. On the earth among human beings, deputy authority is everywhere. In the family there are parents. Even between the parents, there is the father and the mother. These two are not equal. Even among the brothers and sisters in a family, there is an order. Something in our nature tells us that there is such an order. A principal is the head of a school, the teachers are under the principal, and the students are under the teachers. The good students stay in their position, keeping the proper deputy authority.</P><P>Throughout society there is deputy authority. To talk about getting rid of deputy authority is nonsense. The police who regulate traffic on the roads are an example of deputy authority. Because of policemen, the traffic is controlled and kept in a good order, thereby reducing traffic accidents and deaths.</P><P>According to the divine revelation in the holy Word, there is also deputy authority in God's economy, both in the Old Testament, such as with Moses and the priests who taught the people the divine oracle, and in the New Testament, such as with the elders, who take care of the church (1 Tim. 3:5; 5:17; Heb. 13:17), and the apostles, who establish the churches and teach the saints (2 Cor. 10:8; 13:10; 1 Cor. 4:21). In Hebrews 13:17 Paul said, "Obey the ones leading you and submit to them."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>P. Federation of Churches</H2><P>The opposing ones have taught the autonomy of the local churches and have accused us of trying to federate the churches. We need to see that the church is not an organization but an organism. In an organism, you cannot have autonomy or federation. The members of our physical body are organically united as one; they are not federated into one.</P><P>To say that all the local churches are separate in administration, in a certain sense, is right, but this is only one side. The church has its local aspect, but it also has its universal aspect, the aspect of the universal Body. Both are needed. I need the universal Body, and I also need the local church. When I stressed that all the churches should be the same and that they should be one, the dissenting ones said that such oneness meant federation.</P><P>The Brethren had a dispute concerning this. G. H. Lang taught the autonomy of a local church and condemned J. N. Darby for teaching federation. The local churches, however, should not be independently autonomous because they are all the unique, one organism of the processed and dispensing Triune God. If the church in Anaheim declared that it was a local church, standing independent from and not caring for the other churches, the church in Anaheim would immediately become a local sect. A local church must be one with all the other churches in the Body.</P>
