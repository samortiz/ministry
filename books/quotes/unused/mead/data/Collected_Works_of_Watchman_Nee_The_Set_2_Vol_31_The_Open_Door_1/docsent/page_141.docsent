   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Villages in Tai-Shun, Chekiang Province</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The entire county of Tai-Shun has about two hundred villages.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is divided into four regions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The whole area is remote and mountainous.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Transportation is very inconvenient.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The work is very difficult, so only a little more than forty localities have established churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the past few years no one has been raised up to preach the gospel; therefore, no new local churches have been established.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the ninth day of the Chinese New Year, there was a meeting in Hsia-Dong-Si to discuss the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some brothers were raised up to accompany Brother Lee Shu-ren of Ping-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They left from Shi-Si on January 30 and preached the gospel in Region Three for more than twenty days.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They preached in twelve villages.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During the day they preached the gospel door to door and passed out tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the evening they borrowed a house, gathered an audience, and announced the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many received the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every evening they spoke to audiences of one, two, and even three hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They were very orderly and serious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some brothers have decided to go to the area around San-Men-Yang in Region Four to begin preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We look to the Lord for His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please pray for us much.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Your little, weak brother,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Wang You-gao</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Twenty-second day of the third month</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Tzi-Liu-Jing, Szechuan Province</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There will be a few days of gospel meetings in the auditorium of the Ren-Ji Hospital starting May 19.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There may be a few days of Bible study meetings afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We work in the schools and in the homes during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the future we will preach the gospel to the miners and in the markets.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The door for the work is open wide.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We deeply believe that God wants to work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Chang Yu-zhi</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>May 18</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Shi-Ping, Yunnan Province</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To the brothers and sisters in the Lord who are co-workers:</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We would like to tell the brothers and sisters all that God has done through us according to the pattern of the apostles Acts 14:27; 21:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We would also like to tell how God opened the door of the gospel for us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, we give all the glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second, we hope the brothers and sisters would know how to pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Third, we want to let the brothers and sisters who are concerned about the work in the remote areas know where we have been and the condition of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We left Ku-Jiu on the eighteenth of last month and were led by the Lord to arrive safely in Shi-Ping.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We had an edification conference for the brothers and sisters from the evening of the twentieth to the evening of the twenty-seventh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The attendants in the meetings were mainly sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is because there are only four or five brothers here, with many times that number of sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Most of the people in the meeting cannot read, except for the students.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was slightly difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, the Lord brought us through.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It seemed that most of the audience received the word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May God do a deeper work within them that they may gain the life of Christ more richly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We went to the streets beside all the city gates every afternoon from the twenty-first to the twenty-fourth to preach the gospel outdoors.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The atmosphere was not very open.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They have never welcomed Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It was God's grace that we could openly bring the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We borrowed the meeting hall for three gospel meetings on the afternoons of the twenty-fifth to the twenty-seventh.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The brothers and sisters brought their friends and relatives to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We also saw God working.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some declared their faith in the Lord during the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May the Lord gain them that they may not just be saved but may pay the price to walk in the way of victory to glorify the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The director of a certain newspaper was touched by the gospel he heard on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He made a special trip to visit us, and we had a long conversation with him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We also gave him some books on salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He later expressed that he had completely received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He is now reading the Bible and is coming to hear the messages.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the morning of the twenty-ninth, Brother K. H. Weigh and Brother Lin Kuang-tsao went to Lin-An and preached the gospel outdoors at the city gates and at every busy place in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some people received the gospel on the spot.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Some people were coming to the city from the countryside and had an excellent opportunity to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>During the last gospel gathering, the Lord made a marvelous arrangement, and we met a brother in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When he saw us, he was happy to invite us into his home to stay there temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Because the next day was the Lord's Day and we had a burden to hurry back to Shi-Ping, we did not accept his invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord has begun a work in Lin-An.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If He allows, Brother Lin will soon go there to continue preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brother Weigh and Brother Chen Hsi-wen will leave tomorrow and go first to Mong-Tze and then to Kai-Yuan.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Finally, they will go into K'un-ming.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Brother Lin Kuang-tsao will continue to work in this region.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He feels that the harvest is great and the workers few.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He is often conscious of his inability and loneliness.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>May the Lord send one from among the co-workers with a burden for the gospel to the remote regions who will come to Shi-Ping and work with Brother Lin Kuang-tsao in all the localities in southern Yunnan.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Brother Kuang-tsao feels that there is a desperate cry from this region and hopes that all the brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the church in Shi-Ping the majority of the brothers and sisters know that they must learn to follow the Lord and not look to man.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The work that we have just finished needs your prayer as a follow-up.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>May the Lord's rich grace and great love be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Your brothers,</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>K. H. Weigh, Lin Kuang-tsao, Chen Hsi-wen</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>May 1, in Shi-Ping</S>
