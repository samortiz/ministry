<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of eleven messages given in Chinese by Brother Witness Lee in April and July 1962. Chapters 1 through 6 were given in Berkeley, Palo Alto, and San Francisco on April 14 through 16, and chapters 7 through 11 were given in San Francisco on July 7 and 8.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING<br />
THE CENTRAL PURPOSE OF GOD</h1>
<p>Colossians reveals the all-inclusive and unlimited Christ. Speaking of Christ as the Beloved, 1:15 says, &ldquo;Who is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation.&rdquo; Verses 17 through 19 say, &ldquo;He is before all things, and all things cohere in Him; and He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things; for in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell.&rdquo; We need to pay attention to a few things in these verses. First, Christ is the image of the invisible God. Without Christ, people cannot see God. Second, Christ is before all things. Third, Christ is the Firstborn of all creation. Fourth, He is the Head of the Body, the church. Fifth, He is the Firstborn from the dead. Verses 15 and 18 speak of two aspects of Christ&rsquo;s being the Firstborn. He is the Firstborn of all creation and the Firstborn from the dead. Sixth, because Christ is the Firstborn both in creation and from the dead, He has the first place in all things, in everything. Seventh, all the fullness is pleased to dwell in Him.</p>
<p>I hope that we can remember these seven points. Christ is the image of God; Christ is before all things; Christ is the Firstborn of all creation; Christ is the Head of the Body&mdash;the church; Christ is the Firstborn from the dead; Christ has the first place in all things; and all the fullness is pleased to dwell in Christ. Most Christians pay attention to verse 14, which says, &ldquo;In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.&rdquo; Every believer is deeply impressed with the redemption that Christ accomplished for the forgiveness of sins. As a result, when we consider the Lord, we thank and praise Him mainly for redemption. However, we must remember that in addition to redemption Colossians speaks of at least seven more points concerning Christ. It is regrettable that we often neglect these seven points.</p>
<p>Colossians 2:2-3 says, &ldquo;Unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ, in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.&rdquo; Verse 9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; These verses reveal that Christ is the mystery of God. In other words, Christ is the explanation of God, because all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:11 says, &ldquo;Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; The word <em>all</em> here refers to all the members who compose the new man. In the new man Christ is all and in all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL PURPOSE OF GOD IN THE UNIVERSE</h2>
<p>The vision concerning Christ is a great matter in the Bible and a tremendous matter in the universe. It is not an exaggeration to say that Christ is the meaning of the universe. Human beings invented religion, but religion is unable to understand the central meaning of the universe. God created man with a spirit so that man would have the desire to worship God; however, man does not know the meaning of the universe, because man lacks revelation from God. It is easy for man to realize that there is a God in the universe, but it is not so easy for man to see the central purpose of God in the universe. It is easy to lead people to believe that there is a sovereign God in the universe, because this does not require much revelation or vision. Romans 1:20 says, &ldquo;The invisible things of Him, both His eternal power and divine characteristics, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, being perceived by the things made, so that they would be without excuse.&rdquo; Hence, people are able to perceive from the various things in nature that there is a God in the universe. But if they want to know the central purpose of God in the universe, they must receive revelation from God. I hope that we will see the central purpose of God in the universe and the meaning of the universe.</p>
<p>Discussions concerning worshipping or serving God usually involve concepts related to philosophy, morality, religion, and spiritual gifts. A person who neither desires nor worships God will not consider these things. However, the day that this person desires to worship or serve God, his concept will fall into one of these four areas. He may have a philosophical concept, or he may have a moral concept of doing good. He may have a religious concept of revering and fearing God and of trying to please God, or he may have a more advanced concept of wanting to be spiritual or gifted. As soon as a person considers God or wants to serve Him, he cannot avoid these concepts. These concepts are good, but they are natural and are not based on revelation from God. Many believers, who have a heart to serve God, have still not been delivered from these concepts. The Bible reveals that these concepts are not the central purpose of God in the universe. God does not want people to be foolish or immoral, to not fear Him, or to be without spiritual gifts, nor does God want people to focus on philosophy, morality, religion, or spiritual gifts. Christ is the central purpose of God and the ultimate meaning of the universe. Christ is God&rsquo;s desire, and Christ is also the central meaning of the universe. God&rsquo;s purpose for man and the meaning of the universe are nothing other than Christ.</p>
<p>There are four books in the Bible that deal specifically with the four problems of philosophy, morality, religion, and spiritual gifts. Colossians deals with philosophy, Galatians deals with morality and keeping the law, Hebrews deals with religion, and 1 Corinthians deals with spiritual gifts. If we see light in the Word of God, we will realize that philosophy, morality, religion, and spiritual gifts are versus Christ. Philosophy is versus Christ, morality is versus Christ, religion is versus Christ, and spiritual gifts are versus Christ. Most believers know that the flesh, the world, sin, and the self are versus Christ. However, we must see that not only these negative things are versus Christ; even the positive things in human society and culture&mdash;philosophy, morality, religion, and spiritual gifts&mdash;are versus Christ. Just as the negative things are versus Christ, so also the positive things are versus Christ. Satan&rsquo;s stratagem is to prevent people from paying attention to Christ. Regardless of whether something is positive or negative, as long as we focus on it instead of Christ, Satan has attained his goal.</p>
<p>Concerning society, it is commonly believed that people in the East are different from people in the West. People believe that the Japanese are different from the Germans and that the British, the Americans, and the French are different from one another. However, if we travel, we will discover that no matter where people are from, all persons bear the same likeness, the likeness of Adam. All people have the same ancestor&mdash;Adam; they are descendants of Adam. We can say that we all have the same last name, Adam, because we are all out of Adam. People in the United States often like to say which country their ancestors came from; however, all of our ancestors came out of Adam.</p>
<p>People from different places in the world may act differently&mdash;the Chinese eat with chopsticks, and the Westerners eat with knives and forks&mdash;but all people have the same lust. Many different things happen in society in the East and in the West, but these things are all according to the same principle of Satan using many things to replace Christ. On the negative side, some people like to sin and to love the world, and others indulge themselves and live in the flesh. On the positive side, some people endeavor to do good and are zealous concerning religion, and others pursue spirituality and seek gifts. If we would carefully consider these matters, we will realize that the evildoers do not give ground to Christ, and those who promote philosophy, morality, religion, and spiritual gifts also do not give ground to Christ.</p>
<p>When I was in New York, I visited an elderly American woman who said that she was a Christian and who had also grown up in a Christian family. While discussing spiritual matters with her, I gradually realized that she had not believed in the Lord. She had many religious regulations but very little knowledge of Christ. Later, she told me that a certain chapel served as the center for the social life of the local residents. People in that area went to the Sunday service every week because it was the best social activity. The pastor exhorted them to be good people and to be kind to their neighbors. It is sad to see people keeping religion but not giving Christ any ground in their being. Some people in society commit crimes, and others follow religion, but Satan is doing the same thing with both types of people: he is preventing them from giving Christ the ground in them. Philosophy, morality, religion, and spiritual gifts are not the central purpose of God. As those who pursue the Lord, we must ask Him to visit us and show us a vision so that we may see that Christ is God&rsquo;s central purpose and the central meaning of the universe. God wants Christ to be the center of all things and to have the first place in all things.</p>
<p>Even today the universe is still a mystery to mankind. Why does the universe exist? Nearly no one can answer this question. The Bible, however, reveals that Christ is the only answer to the existence of the universe and of mankind. God wants Christ to be expressed. Therefore, Christ has entered into a group of created people to be expressed through them. This is the mystery of mysteries. Colossians reveals that Christ is the meaning of the entire universe. God created the universe and mankind for Christ, and God is gaining the saints and the church for Christ. If it were not for the revelation in the Bible concerning Christ as the centrality of God, the human mind would have no way to comprehend this matter. Hence, we need to be delivered from our natural concepts and receive the revelation in the Bible in order to know Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE MYSTERY OF GOD</h2>
<p>Many people admit that there is a God in the universe. But a person who is not in Christ cannot touch God. A person who is not in Christ can neither understand, know, comprehend, nor experience God. The reality of God is in Christ. We can say that Christ is God, but Christ involves more. Christ is the definition, the reality, and the mystery of God. It is hard to convey this matter adequately with human language. Everything concerning God is in Christ. God is manifested in Christ. Therefore, when Christ was on the earth among men, He was the expression of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE CENTRAL MEANING OF MAN</h2>
<p>Christ is the mystery of God and also the meaning of man. There are billions of people on the earth, but the meaning of human existence is Christ. Christ is the only genuine man. Therefore, a person who does not have Christ cannot fulfill the meaning of his existence. Many people are mentioned in the sixty-six books of the Bible, many people are recorded in human history, and many people live on the earth, but which of these people is a genuine man? Without a doubt, Jesus Christ is the only genuine, perfect, and meaningful man. Apart from Christ, we cannot see God, nor can we see a genuine, proper man. Christ is God, and Christ is also a man. This One is the Christ of God. Therefore, God is working so that such a Christ can enter into us. When Christ enters into us, God enters into us. When Christ enters into us and lives in us, we know the meaning of our human life.</p>
<p>Many people do not have a proper humanity, because they are short of Christ. The more Christ a person has, the more proper his humanity will be. The more of the element of Christ a person has, the more genuine his humanity will be. We should consider how proper our humanity was before we received Christ. We had the appearance of a man, but we did not express a proper humanity, because we were short of Christ. After our salvation we allowed the Lord to gain ground in our being; hence, the element of Christ increased within us, and our humanity became more proper. Were our young people proper before they were saved and allowed the Lord to gain ground in them? If we would tell the truth, we would say no. Their humanity was not proper. However, this is not because they were short of morality, knowledge, or religion but because they were short of Christ. Only when Christ enters into our being can we have the reality of God, receive the element of Christ&rsquo;s proper humanity, and become a genuine man. This is what God desires to do in us. God desires Christ to be our life so that Christ may be expressed through us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONSECRATION BEING TO ALLOW CHRIST<br />
TO GAIN GROUND IN US</h2>
<p>The Bible is centered on Christ. A person who has Christ will certainly be moral and God-fearing, and he will possess spiritual gifts. However, Christ is absolutely different from philosophy, morality, religion, and spiritual gifts. God wants Christ to be our life, and He wants Christ to have the full ground in our being. In order for Christ to gain ground within us, we need to consecrate ourselves to Christ. We do not consecrate ourselves to do something for Christ but to allow Christ to gain ground in us. Because Christ wants to be our life, we should hand ourselves over to Him so that He can live in us. This is the true meaning of consecration. As believers, we should not ask Christ to help us live; rather, we should hand ourselves over to Him so that He may live in us. It is one thing for us to live and expect help from Christ, but it is another thing to hand ourselves over to Christ and allow Him to live in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ACCEPTING THE CROSS<br />
BEING TO ALLOW CHRIST TO LIVE IN US</h2>
<p>The true meaning of the cross is to put ourselves into the death of Christ. When we accept the cross, we acknowledge that we have already died so that Christ may live in us. To fellowship with the Lord or to draw near to the Lord is to allow the Lord to live in us. Being a Christian is a matter of being able to say, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). This is marvelous. God created us, but He does not want us to live by our self. He wants Christ to live in us. Worldly people and sinners do not allow Christ to live in them, and most Christians and religionists also do not allow Christ to live in them. Hence, we are not talking about being a Christian but of allowing Christ to live in us. A Christian should be a person who allows Christ to live in him. God wants us to stop our living and to allow Christ to live in us. God does not want us to replace Christ with anything. He only wants us to take Christ as our goal.</p>
<p>May God open our eyes to see that the universe and mankind are for Christ and to see that Christ wants to be our life, to live in us, and to live out from us. For this reason, we need to consecrate ourselves, read the Bible, pray, fellowship with the Lord, accept the cross, and allow Christ to live in us. Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s desire. He must have the first place in the universe and also the first place in our being. He is all and in all. In Him all the fullness of the Godhead dwells, and when He lives in us and out from us, God is expressed. This is the Christ revealed in Colossians.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING ALL IN THE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>In the universe there is the first creation, the old creation, and there is the second creation, the new creation (6:15). The first creation does not have Christ, but the second creation, the new creation, has Christ. In fact, the new creation is Christ. The new creation is the new man, which is the church. Colossians 3:10-11 says that in the new man there cannot be Greek or Jew but only Christ. Therefore, Christ is all and in all in the church, the new man. In order for Christ to be all and in all when we gather together as the church, we must experience being crucified with Christ so that it would no longer be we who live but Christ who lives in us. In our daily life we need to fellowship with the Lord, read the Bible, pray, accept the cross by the Spirit, consecrate ourselves to the Lord, and allow Him to gain ground in our being and live in us. We should not try to please or glorify the Lord by our own strength. We only need to allow Him to gain ground in our being and live in us. We do not want to initiate anything. If we would live Christ in such a way, allowing Him to gain ground in our being, when we gather together, we will be able to say that we are not expressing our preferences or intentions. Instead, we only have Christ. In our meetings there will not be sin or the world, but Christ will be all and in all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEASURING BY CHRIST</h2>
<p>Being a Christian is not a matter of being spiritual but of Christ having ground in our being. True spiritual weight cannot be measured by anything other than Christ. The ground that Christ has in our being determines how much weight His element has in our living and walk. It is not a matter of doing things correctly or of appearing to be spiritual or gifted but of how much ground Christ has in our being, that is, how much of the element of Christ is in our being. Hence, we need a strong consecration. If we see that Christ is the centrality of God and the meaning of God, we would consecrate ourselves fully to Him. If we see that God wants Christ to be our life, we would be willing to stop living by our life and would allow the Lord to live in us. We would love to read the Bible, to pray, and to fellowship with the Lord. If we would thus allow the Lord to gain more ground in our being, we would spontaneously become persons to whom to live is Christ and in whom Christ is magnified.</p>
<p>The Lord desires to gain a group of people on the earth as His witnesses (Acts 1:8). A witness testifies the Lord by living Him out. May the Lord have mercy on us and show us this vision. Then we would say, &ldquo;Lord, I consecrate myself to You, and I allow You to gain all the ground in my being. You are my life, and You are living in me. I no longer desire to be the one living; I want You to live in me. I desire that You would become all in all with me and in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prayer: Lord, may we see a vision in these days. Visit each brother and sister personally so that we would meet You in a definite way. Appear to us in the meetings and in our personal time, just as You appeared to Paul on the road to Damascus. On that day he fell down because he saw Your light and came to know You. In these days may we be those who meet You and see the vision of Christ. We want to know that Christ is the mystery of God, that He wants to have the first place and to be everything in us, and that He wants to be our life and to live out of us. Lord, may we fall down and place ourselves on the altar so that You may gain the ground in our being and be our all. May the words <em>it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me</em> no longer be merely a sentence or doctrine but a spiritual reality. May the Spirit work in us until we can say, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me as my everything.&rdquo; Lord, fulfill this prayer. We believe that Your word will not return to You vainly. Stretch forth Your arm to work alongside Your word. Anoint Your word to shine in us and to enlighten us. Amen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH BEING THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
AND THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h1>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal plan is to obtain a Body as a vessel for Christ. Most people do not have the concept that the Body of Christ is His vessel. In Ephesians 1:23 Paul says that the church is &ldquo;His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; This verse indicates that the church is the Body of Christ and also His fullness. Our natural concept is that the church is simply the church. We lack the deep understanding that the church is the Body of Christ. <em>The Body</em> is a particular expression. If Paul had not received the revelation that the church is the Body of Christ, I doubt that anyone would have had such an understanding. It is easy for us to understand the church as an assembly, a group of people gathering together. However, we cannot imagine that the church is a Body. Even though we have read in the Bible that the church is the Body of Christ, and we often talk about the church being the Body of Christ, we still do not have much feeling concerning the Body of Christ. What is the church? The most important answer to this question is given to us in the Bible by Paul: &ldquo;the church, which is His Body&rdquo; (vv. 22-23).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH HAVING THE LIFE OF CHRIST<br />
AND BEING A PART OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>As soon as we speak of the human body, two matters immediately come to mind. First, a person&rsquo;s body has life. A chair or a desk has nothing to do with life. When we speak of a person&rsquo;s body, we know that it has life. Brother So-and-so&rsquo;s body has his life; we can even say that this brother is in his body. Second, a person&rsquo;s body is his main part. A person&rsquo;s body not only has life but is also his main part. Moreover, a person cannot be separated from his body. Likewise, the church being the Body of Christ means that the church has the life of Christ and is a part of Christ. Hence, the church cannot be separated from Christ. We must see that the church is a part of Christ. The church is not formed by gathering natural people together; it is formed by those who are full of Christ. The church is the aggregate of those who allow Christ to fully occupy them.</p>
<p>Apparently, Brother A and Sister B are in the church. However, strictly speaking, there are no such persons in the church. We can say this because anyone who comes into the church must not only die but also be buried. According to the Bible, the primary meaning of baptism is burial, that is, termination on the cross. The first thing that happens to a person who believes in the Lord is that he dies and is buried. Any saved person who is part of the church has been put into water and buried. No natural person can enter into the church, because every natural person is buried in the water before coming into the church. &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). I have already died and been buried, and now it is Christ who lives in me. In the church as the new man, there cannot be Jew or Greek (Col. 3:10-11). It is disastrous to bring our natural man into the church. In the church as the new man, there are neither Americans nor Chinese; there is only Christ. If there were Jews, Greeks, Americans, or Chinese, it would be a social group, not the church. In the church there is only Christ, because the church is a part of Christ. Moreover, only Christ is all and in all in the new man. The church is the Body of Christ, and every part of the church is Christ. This is the same as saying that every member of my body is part of me. A false tooth may look exactly like a real tooth, but it is not part of a person&rsquo;s body. We must see that the church is Christ Himself; as such, the church does not have room for the natural man, which is outside of Christ. Just as dentures are not a part of a person&rsquo;s body, any natural element cannot become a part of the church.</p>
<p>Christians lack the reality of the church because there is too much of the human element and too little of Christ&rsquo;s element. A Western missionary once asked me, &ldquo;Why are you so old-fashioned, following the ancient Chinese way of having men sit on one side of a room and women on the other side?&rdquo; He said that we should copy the Western way of letting the men and the women sit together. I replied that we do not have an Eastern concept or a Western concept; it is acceptable among us for men and women to sit together or for them to sit on separate sides of the room. If we have seen that everything natural has been thoroughly terminated, we would not have feelings concerning such matters. Furthermore, we would not insist on any practice, because to insist is to give the human element a place in the church.</p>
<p>A brother from the West once said to me that our meetings are good in every respect except that often everyone prays at the same time. He considered this to be the way Chinese people study in school and, hence, a Chinese custom. He also said that people in the West pray one at a time and, hence, not many people pray. I told him that we cannot require the church to follow either the East or the West, because in the prayer of the church there is neither East nor West; there is only Christ and the Spirit. We all are the one Body of Christ. We must rid ourselves of our natural concepts and natural feelings.</p>
<p>A newly baptized brother who was quite knowledgeable once said to me that it is not proper for everyone to say Amen when a person prays, because such noisy worship forces God to leave our meetings. On another occasion a brother was critical and asked why Christians have so many different postures when they pray; some sway and others shake. I said that our personal opinion, insight, or feeling is not the criterion in the church. We must remember that we have been buried. Hence, we should never rashly criticize the actions of any brother or sister in their service to the Lord. We should never think that the church should follow our considerations in its practice. The church is neither you nor I, and it is neither the East nor the West. Hence, the church does not follow our feelings or our views. The church is the Body of Christ, and Christ wants to fill everyone who belongs to Him in the church. In matters related to our service and in other things as well, we must not forget that we have already been buried and that Christ is everything in the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH AS THE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST<br />
MANIFESTING ONLY CHRIST</h2>
<p>A person&rsquo;s body cannot convey the thoughts and ideas of another person. A person&rsquo;s body is his manifestation; that is, a person is expressed through his body. A person is manifested not only through his face; he is manifested through every move of his body. Hence, it is often possible to recognize someone by the way he walks or even when we can see only his back. Similarly, the church is the Body of Christ, the expression of Christ; hence, the church can manifest only Christ. Christ lives in the church and is expressed through the church. Man cannot find God apart from Christ, nor can man find Christ apart from the church. In the universe there is a God, and this God is in Christ; in the universe there is Christ, and this Christ is in the church. When the God of the heavens came to be among men, He was in Christ, but today when Christ appears to the world, He is in the church. The church is the Body of Christ, and Christ lives in the church. Wherever the church is, there should be the expression of Christ.</p>
<p>A few years ago I was in London, and a friend took me to see the Queen&rsquo;s vine, which grows in a huge glass house. He told me that the Queen&rsquo;s vine is the largest vine in the world. The Queen&rsquo;s vine, however, is not the largest vine in the world. There is a vine on the earth that is much larger than the Queen&rsquo;s vine. The Queen&rsquo;s vine can be contained in a huge glass house, but the globe is not large enough for the vine that is revealed in the Bible. This great vine is Christ and the church. The Lord is the vine, and the believers are the branches (John 15:5). The church is Christ&rsquo;s vine, and the branches of this vine are spreading throughout the earth. Wherever there is a proper church, there is the manifestation of Christ. May we all see this vision: the church is not a social group; the church is the Body of Christ, the church is filled with Christ, and the church is the embodiment of Christ. The church is filled with the element of Christ and expresses Christ.</p>
<p>When we were saved and entered into the church, we were buried. The church did not bury us after we had been saved for a long period of time. Rather, we were buried the very moment that we entered into the church. Hence, the church does not express something of our self; the church expresses only Christ. The church does not allow the self to occupy any place. The church lets Christ have the first place in all things. In the church there is no room for human opinions, views, propositions, or actions. This is the only way that the church can be full of the divine life. To be full of the divine life is to be full of Christ. The church is the expression of Christ, the Body of Christ, and the fullness of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The church being the Body of Christ is not easy to understand, and the church being the fullness of Christ is even more difficult to understand. When I was young, I failed to understand how the church could be the fullness of Christ, the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:23). One day I asked an experienced brother why the church is the fullness of Christ. This brother used the Lord&rsquo;s Word to show me that God created Adam and then took a rib from Adam&rsquo;s side and built it into Eve (Gen. 2:21-22). A part of Adam became Eve. Eve was a part of Adam, so Eve was Adam&rsquo;s fullness. Adam needed Eve as his fullness. Adam was not full without Eve, just as a man without a wife does not have a fullness. Hence, the church being the fullness of Christ means that without the church Christ does not have a fullness.</p>
<p>In the Epistle to the Ephesians Paul says that the church is the Body of Christ and that the church is the fullness of Christ (1:23). A man with a big head but a small body does not have a fullness. A person&rsquo;s fullness depends on whether he has a proper body. The church should be the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ, but during the past two thousand years the church has lost its proper expression. For example, it is not easy to see a proper church in Japan, and it is also not easy to find proper churches in the so-called Christian countries, such as the United States and Great Britain. The church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ.</p>
<p>The expression of Christ that we see in the Gospels becomes fuller in the book of Acts. The church at the time of Pentecost, at the time of the apostles, was truly the expression of Christ. When the church was spreading to many localities, Christ was spreading, because the expression of Christ was appearing in many localities. The church is not a social organization, nor is it a group of people who are pursuing individual spirituality. Rather, the church is composed of saved persons who are full of Christ and who have become the mysterious Body of Christ as the fullness of Christ. The individual Christ in the Gospels is the corporate Christ in Acts. The Head lives and is expressed through the Body. The Head and the Body share the same life and the same element. If we would read Acts from the viewpoint of the fullness of Christ, we will see what the true condition of the church should be.</p>
<p>Acts does not merely show us how the believers preached the gospel and received the Holy Spirit. Acts shows us the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ. After His resurrection and ascension, Christ came as life to those who belonged to Him. These ones, who belonged to Christ, had died through the cross and had been buried. When they came together in the Spirit, they were the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ. They had God&rsquo;s presence, authority, power, and blessing. Hence, it was easy for them to lead people to be saved. Moreover, it was easy for the early believers to be spiritual and to meet God, because they were full of Christ, and they let Christ gain ground in them. God desires to have such a church, a church that is the embodiment of Christ and the fullness of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME<br />
AND THE CHURCH BEING FILLED</h1>
<p>We have seen that the church is the Body of Christ and the fullness of Christ. In Ephesians 3 the apostle Paul prayed for the believers to experience the reality of the church. Verses 16 through 19 say, &ldquo;That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; Here Paul speaks of a few important matters. First, Paul speaks of Christ making His home in the believers&rsquo; hearts; second, of apprehending with all the saints the breadth, length, height, and depth; third, of knowing the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ; and fourth, of being filled unto all the fullness of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING<br />
WHERE CHRIST MAKES HIS HOME</h2>
<p>The phrase <em>that Christ may make His home in your hearts</em> shows that Christ is making His home in the hearts of many people. The church is the Body of Christ and also Christ&rsquo;s home. The church is Christ&rsquo;s making home in our hearts. In the original language the phrase <em>make...home</em> is the verb form of the noun <em>home.</em> For Christ to make His home in our hearts is for Him to make us His home, His house. We are Christ&rsquo;s Body, His fullness, and we are also His home. The church is where Christ makes His home, where He is making His believers His home, and where He dwells restfully. When a person makes his home, he can put everything he owns in his home as it pleases him. When Christ makes His home in our hearts, He puts everything that He possesses in our hearts. As a result, He can control our entire being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN ALL THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>In a sense, Christ is making His home in individual saints, but strictly speaking, He is making His home in all the saints. An individual is not sufficient to be Christ&rsquo;s home. Christ&rsquo;s home is not an individual believer but the saints, the Body of Christ. Sometimes a believer says, &ldquo;Christ dwells in me.&rdquo; We must see that this &ldquo;me&rdquo; is not an independent &ldquo;me&rdquo;; it is not an individual &ldquo;me.&rdquo; This &ldquo;me&rdquo; is joined to all the believers. It is difficult for a person who has not had sufficient dealings with the brothers and sisters and has not attended many meetings to experience Christ dwelling in him.</p>
<p>Experientially, a believer who does not attend meetings and who cuts off fellowship with other believers might feel that Christ has left him. For example, a brother who is unhappy with the situation of the meetings may decide to read the Bible and pray by himself at home since he does not get any help in the meetings. The first day that he stays at home, he devotes considerable time to read the Bible and pray. On the second day he reads and prays less. This pattern will continue until after a week he gives up reading the Bible and praying, because he does not sense the dearness or nearness of the Lord. To stay away from other believers is almost the same as staying away from Christ. Hence, when we stay away from other believers, it is not easy for us to sense Christ making His home in our hearts. We should consider how much grace we have received from the Lord in our personal seeking and how much we have received through the brothers and sisters. The Lord&rsquo;s presence, His making home, is in all the saints. We should never say, &ldquo;The Lord is omnipresent, so we do not need to be in the meetings. We can shut our door and pray at home, according to the teaching of the Bible, because the Lord will be with us.&rdquo; If we stay at home instead of going to the meetings, after half a year we will have no way to pray and will probably end up loving the world. To leave the saints is to leave the fellowship of the Body of Christ. This is nearly the same as leaving Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPREHENDING THE BREADTH, LENGTH,<br />
HEIGHT, AND DEPTH WITH ALL THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>We must come together because our hearts are the corporate dwelling place of Christ. The word <em>hearts</em> in verse 17 is clear and definite; it is not an empty word. Hence, Paul is not speaking in a general way concerning Christ dwelling in us. Paul is clear and definite concerning Christ making home in our hearts. Christ making His home in our hearts is dear and affectionate, because we sense His presence in our hearts. Therefore, Paul also speaks of our being rooted and grounded in love. Every time we meet together, we sense that the Lord is making His home in us, that the Lord is loveable, and that our union with the saints is sweet. Thus, when we let the Lord make home in our hearts, we are joined with all the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s love and are able to apprehend the breadth, length, height, and depth. The breadth, length, height, and depth are descriptions of the Lord&rsquo;s immeasurable dimensions. No one can say how wide is Christ&rsquo;s width, how long is His length, how high is His height, or how deep is His depth. Only God in Christ is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth. He is as immeasurable as the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE KNOWLEDGE-SURPASSING<br />
LOVE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>We can experience the immeasurable and boundless Christ when we come together with all the saints. Individually, our experience of Christ is limited, but when we experience Christ with all the saints, we sense His vastness. We also realize that He is as immeasurable as the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe. We do not know how vast Christ is. He is so vast that He needs a corporate body to contain Him. The more the saints are together, the more the immeasurable Christ is manifested. We can apprehend with all the saints the breadth, length, height, and depth, and we can know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ. To know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ is to realize that His love is beyond what we can fathom. His love is all-surpassing. There is not a problem that He does not bear, nor is there a suffering that He does not feel. When we see that the Lord is able to take care of each and every problem, we will know that His love is beyond our human apprehension. However, we must remember that only when we are joined together with all the saints can we know Christ&rsquo;s breadth, length, height, and depth and also know His knowledge-surpassing love.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED UNTO ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD</h2>
<p>One person cannot fully experience Christ&rsquo;s immeasurableness, nor can one person fully know Christ&rsquo;s knowledge-surpassing love. But when believers come together, people will see and experience the immeasurable Christ and His unfathomable love. Hence, Paul says, &ldquo;That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; If we are joined together and let Christ fill us, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God. The riches of God must be expressed through the church. Hence, the church must be full of Christ. When the church is full of Christ, full of God, people will touch Christ and God. This is the church, the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ. This is where Christ can make His home and be expressed.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that the church is the fullness of Christ. In this chapter we will consider the riches of Christ. Ephesians 3:8 says, &ldquo;To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.&rdquo; This verse speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ. Ephesians 1:23 says that the church, &ldquo;His Body,&rdquo; is the fullness of the One who fills all in all. This verse speaks of the fullness of Christ. These two verses contain two very significant terms: the <em>riches</em> of Christ and the <em>fullness</em> of Christ. These two terms refer to two different things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE RICHES OF CHRIST<br />
TO BECOME THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>There is a difference between the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ. The riches of Christ are the gospel that the apostle preached (3:8). The apostle Paul received grace to preach the gospel. The gospel that he preached was just the riches of Christ. When we received the gospel, we received the riches of Christ. By enjoying the riches of Christ, we become the fullness of Christ. Many people mistakenly understand <em>riches</em> and <em>fullness</em> to mean the same thing. However, these are two different Greek words: <em>riches</em> is <em>ploutos,</em> denoting &ldquo;wealth,&rdquo; and <em>fullness</em> is <em>pleroma,</em> denoting &ldquo;completeness.&rdquo; Thus, <em>riches</em> and <em>fullness</em> refer to two different things.</p>
<p>Christ is rich; He is the unsearchable riches. The apostle preached these unsearchable riches as the gospel. When a person receives the gospel, he gains, enjoys, and experiences these riches. Those who gain and enjoy the riches of Christ become the fullness of Christ. Hence, if we enjoy the riches of Christ, we will become the fullness of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RICHES OF CHRIST BEING UNSEARCHABLE</h2>
<p>Ephesians uses the general term <em>riches of Christ</em> but does not define what the riches of Christ are. The entire Bible is needed to define the riches of Christ. For example, in the Epistles of Paul we are told that Christ is wisdom to us as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1 Cor. 1:30). Wisdom as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption refers to different items of the riches of Christ. Christ as wisdom to us from God has at least three functions. First, Christ is the righteousness of God. By Christ as our righteousness we were justified, accepted by God, and saved (Rom. 5:18). Second, after we are saved, Christ is our sanctification so that we can live a sanctified life (6:19, 22). Third, when we meet the Lord in the future, Christ will redeem our body; He is redemption to us for the transfiguration and glorification of our body (8:23; Phil. 3:21). Christ justified and saved us in the past, He is sanctifying our whole being in the present, and He will redeem our body in the future. These different items of the riches of Christ are God making Christ wisdom to us.</p>
<p>Wisdom is displayed in the way that we solve problems. A wise person has the best way to solve a problem. Hence, God has the best way to solve problems. As sinners, we did not have righteousness, but God gave Christ to us as righteousness. We cannot sanctify ourselves, but God gives Christ to sanctify us gradually. We cannot redeem our body, but God has given us Christ to transfigure and redeem our body by His resurrection power. Therefore, Christ is our God-given way. Christ is wisdom to us from God as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. These are a few items of the unsearchable riches of Christ.</p>
<p>The New Testament is full of the items of the riches of Christ. First Corinthians 1:30 gives three items of the unsearchable riches of Christ, but these three items involve many details. For example, sanctification involves our living, conduct, thoughts, emotions, and intents. For this reason, Paul says that we can have the mind of Christ (2:16), that we should let the mind that was in Christ Jesus also be in us (Phil. 2:5), that we can enjoy the love of Christ (Rom. 8:35-39), and that we can experience the power of Christ (Phil. 3:10). These items are included in Christ being our sanctification.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE &ldquo;I AM&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John speaks of the Lord Jesus as the way, the reality, and the life (14:6), the true vine (15:1, 5), the good Shepherd (10:11, 14), the door (v. 7), and the resurrection life (11:25). How rich Christ is! Hence, the Gospel of John says that the Lord&rsquo;s name is &ldquo;I Am&rdquo; (8:58). The name I Am means that Christ is whatever we need. If we need life, Christ is life. If we need comfort, Christ is comfort. If we have no way to resolve a problem, Christ is our solution. If we do not have a way through, Christ is our door. If we have no joy, Christ is joy. If we are dying, Christ is life, and if we are dead, Christ is resurrection. Christ is everything. These are the riches of Christ. Whatever He is, is ours. He is like a blank check given to us so that we can write in what we need. The riches of Christ are unsearchable.</p>
<p>In 1933 I was in Shanghai. While I was there, I often fellowshipped with a brother who had much experience in the Lord. One afternoon he asked me, &ldquo;Brother, what is patience?&rdquo; I thought that this was a very basic question. Who does not know the meaning of patience? However, I felt that his question could not be that simple. Therefore, instead of answering him quickly, I thought for a long time. He asked me a second time, &ldquo;What is patience?&rdquo; Although I was not sure how to answer his question, I knew that I had to answer. So I said to him, &ldquo;Patience is trying one&rsquo;s best to endure the mistreatment of others.&rdquo; He said that my answer was not correct, so I asked him, &ldquo;What is patience?&rdquo; He continued rocking in his chair and asking, &ldquo;What is patience?&rdquo; without telling me the answer.</p>
<p>I was unable to answer such a basic question. Eventually, he said, &ldquo;Patience is Christ.&rdquo; As I walked home, I asked myself, &ldquo;What does it mean to say that patience is Christ?&rdquo; Because I did not understand and was troubled, I prayed and asked the Lord how patience could be Christ. One morning I received light while I was praying, and I began to offer praises. I understood that patience is Christ, and Christ is patience. Christ is my life, and He is living in me. When He is lived out from me, He is patience for me to handle any situation. Likewise, Christ is love. When I am in a situation that needs love, and Christ is lived out from me, He becomes my love. From that day onward, I began to see that patience is not gritting one&rsquo;s teeth while enduring beatings or ill speaking. Patience is Christ lived out from me. Patience is not my enduring; it is Christ living out from me. Love is not my love; love is Christ living out from me. These are the riches of Christ, and these riches are unsearchable. Christ is whatever we need.</p>
<p>We have no need other than Christ. If the elders want to know how to be good elders, they need Christ. Christ is the way to be an elder. If the elders will allow Christ to gain ground in their being, they will be very good elders. What should the young co-workers who minister do when they cannot find a topic? Christ is their topic. Christ is their speaking. If they will allow Christ to gain ground in them and to pass through their being, they will experience Christ as their inexhaustible topic. A wife with a difficult husband should allow Christ to gain ground in her being and to be lived out from her. Then she will have a way with her husband, because Christ is her way and her solution.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR NEEDS ENABLING US<br />
TO EXPERIENCE THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Christ is rich, His riches are unsearchable, and He is everything to us. If we need Him, we will draw out His riches. A person who does not realize his need for Christ will not be able to enjoy the riches of Christ. When there is a sense of need, the riches of Christ will be drawn out. Careless, lazy, and indifferent Christians are not able to enjoy the riches of Christ. Christians who are serious with the Lord and who desire to overcome, to be holy, and to be acceptable to God are not loose. Such Christians know that they have no way and no power and, hence, develop a sense of their need for Christ. It is difficult for Christians to experience Christ as their victory, holiness, and way if they do not pursue victory or holiness and do not serve. Some Christians regard the meeting hall as a place for them to be entertained. They want others to sing to them, to preach to them, and to serve them. Such Christians want only to watch and listen. They do not sense their need for Christ; hence, they do not experience the riches of Christ.</p>
<p>A Christian who receives burdens realizes how much he needs Christ. If none of the believers in a local church rise up to minister or to lead, some should be concerned about this situation and receive a burden from God. These ones are not proud, nor do they want to be leaders. Rather, they know that the church cannot go on without the grace of the Lord. A brother who receives such a burden might initially feel that he does not know how to speak or what to say. However, the burden within him will force him to go before the Lord to experience and enjoy the riches of Christ. If he continues in this way, he will not merely give messages, but he will minister the Christ whom he has experienced. His experiences will enable him to speak, because his words are Christ.</p>
<p>In the same principle, a brother may see that the church needs some to rise up to bear the responsibility and pay the price to administrate matters related to the children of God. This brother might not know how to serve, but the burden within forces him to experience and enjoy Christ until Christ becomes his administration and service. We must remember that the church is not a society that needs natural capabilities and talents. The church needs only Christ. The messages that the church needs are Christ, the administration that the church needs is Christ, and the service that the church needs is also Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR SERVICE NEEDING TO MINISTER<br />
THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>There are two kinds of service that have two different results. One kind of service is natural, and the other kind of service is of life. A capable person tends to do things by his natural ability. Such a person usually does things well, but it is easy for him to be proud. Because he serves by his natural ability, he cannot tolerate criticism; he reacts when others touch a lack in his service. This kind of service does not lead others to touch life.</p>
<p>The second kind of service is of life. A brother may not have a natural talent, but he loves the Lord. When this brother sees that no one in the church is serving, he prays and is willing to receive the burden to serve. This can be compared to the case in Matthew 14 of the Lord feeding the five thousand with five loaves and two fish. The disciples told the Lord to send the crowds away into the villages to buy food for themselves, but the Lord told the disciples to give the crowds something to eat (vv. 15-16). A brother who does not have natural eloquence or ability may receive the burden to pray, &ldquo;Lord, the church needs people to serve. Raise up such ones.&rdquo; Then the Lord might tell him to rise up and receive the burden to serve. The brother might say, &ldquo;I do not know how to serve,&rdquo; and the Lord might answer, &ldquo;I am your way.&rdquo; This need of the church forces the brother to go before the Lord, to enjoy His riches, and to serve by the Lord&rsquo;s grace. Initially, this brother may be confused in his service, but he should humble himself before the Lord and continue enjoying the riches of Christ. As a result, when his service is criticized, he will ask the Lord and the saints for forgiveness and will continue endeavoring to minister life. Eventually, even if his messages seem awkward and he is inexperienced in managing matters, his service will always lead others to touch the Lord&rsquo;s life. This is the way that the church should take today.</p>
<p>The church needs people who can minister life more than just manage things. Human society looks for people to manage things in a clever and effective way, as if they were running a business. But this is not the need in the church. The church should minister the riches of Christ. We need to see that there is only Christ in the church. The service needed in the church is to enjoy and minister the riches of Christ. Then the church can become the fullness of Christ.</p>
<p>A brother and I have been together for nearly twenty years. When he was appointed as an elder, he was not good at giving messages or administrating, but he could minister Christ to people. Because he enjoyed and experienced the riches of Christ, the saints always sensed that the presence of Christ was with him. Furthermore, because he loved the Lord and the church and was willing to receive the burden of administrating, he prayed for many matters in the church and often fellowshipped with the Lord. As a result, he experienced the Lord in administrating the church. His messages were not impressive or powerful, but they were filled with Christ, and those who listened to him were supplied. Hence, our needs compel us to experience and enjoy the riches of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR ENVIRONMENT AND SUFFERINGS<br />
ENABLING US TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST</h2>
<p>The environment that God arranges for us and the sufferings that He measures out to us also enable us to experience and enjoy the riches of Christ. Our environment and sufferings help us to experience more of Christ. It is not easy for a person who is always prosperous to experience Christ. There is a difference between the riches of Christ that we experience in sickness and the riches that we experience in health. There is a difference between the riches of Christ that we experience in poverty and the riches that we experience in wealth. There is a difference between the riches of Christ that we experience in failures, oppositions, and attacks and the riches that we experience with success and popularity. God often raises up different environments and allows us to experience suffering so that we would experience Christ. Therefore, it is unlikely for a genuine seeker of the Lord to always live a life of ease. However, we should not fear the circumstances that the Lord arranges, because He will also look after us and guide us. He arranges our environment to meet our specific need so that we would experience Christ.</p>
<p>We must learn to worship the Lord, for His deeds are wonderful and perfect. The Lord arranges a precious wife for a brother and a precious husband for a sister, and His arrangement is never wrong. A brother needs the dealings that come from his wife, and a sister needs the dealings that come from her husband. A good brother may love the Lord but have a strong natural disposition that cannot be touched or changed by anyone. Therefore, the Lord arranges for his wife to deal with him. After a few years of married life this brother becomes pliable, open to suggestions, and no longer insists on his own opinions, because the Lord measured to him a precious wife. The Lord also arranges the children for parents and parents for the children, and His arrangement is never wrong. All parents experience both sweetness and bitterness in raising their children. Parents always feel helpless with regard to their children and feel that others&rsquo; children are better behaved and more obedient than their own. The same applies to children. Children always feel that other parents are more loving than their own parents. We need to believe that what the Lord measures to us is never wrong. Our spouse was chosen by God before the foundation of the world. Our parents and children were also prepared by God. Even the brothers and sisters who coordinate and serve with us in the church were arranged by the Lord before the foundation of the world. There are often conflicts among the brothers and sisters who are placed together to serve and coordinate. Such conflicts force them to experience and enjoy the riches of Christ. Our environment and sufferings are arranged by the Lord for us to experience Christ so that we may minister life to people.</p>
<p>Ephesians shows that the riches of Christ are unsearchable. We need the entire Bible to explain these riches, and we need our whole life to experience them. May the Lord burden us and may He enable us to sense our need so that we may experience His riches in our environment and sufferings. Only by enjoying the riches of Christ can we become the fullness of Christ, which is the Body of Christ. This is the church that He is after.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PURPOSE OF GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION</h1>
<p>A major problem among Christians is that we believe God&rsquo;s salvation is for us, for individuals; we cannot imagine that God&rsquo;s salvation is for the church. We consider receiving salvation and obtaining grace and blessings for ourselves, but we do not think of letting God have His church. Without vision and revelation from God, we would never think of the church, because the natural man has absolutely no concept of the church.</p>
<p>At best, Christians have a desire for their personal salvation, blessing, growth, and spirituality, and they meet together merely for mutual help. Therefore, the concept and purpose of being a Christian is limited to one&rsquo;s personal salvation; it is not related to the church. However, God&rsquo;s concept and purpose are wholly focused on the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EDIFICATION VERSUS BUILDING</h2>
<p>Of course, God&rsquo;s salvation saves individuals, edifies individuals, and leads individual believers to grow spiritually. However, the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation is not with individuals but with the church. The Chinese Union Version and some English translations of the Bible often render the Greek word for <em>building</em> as &ldquo;edifying.&rdquo; This indicates how much Christians regard God&rsquo;s salvation as being a matter of personal edification. There is a difference between edification and building. Suppose we have some lumber and bricks. A carpenter would need to plane the lumber until the boards are leveled and smooth, and a mason would need to square the bricks. This is an example of edification. However, the carpenter and mason do a work of edification on the lumber and bricks with the ultimate purpose of building. To make the lumber look nice for display is edifying, not building. The work of edification and messages on edification are common and popular in Christianity, but almost no one is doing the work of building up the church. Most preaching is done with the intention of edifying the believers. Christians believe that they need to be edified because they are not spiritual enough or because they have problems. Most Christians do not have the concept of building the church.</p>
<p>In relation to the church, the New Testament uses the word <em>build</em> (Matt. 16:18; 1 Cor. 14:4; Eph. 4:12, 16). This word refers to the building of a house. The Greek word for <em>build, oikodomeo,</em> is a verb related to the noun <em>oikos,</em> which is translated &ldquo;house.&rdquo; However, many English and Chinese translations often render this word as &ldquo;edify&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;build.&rdquo; Strictly speaking, the apostles did not use the word <em>building</em> in relation to edifying individual believers but in relation to building up the church&mdash;building the saints into a spiritual temple (2:21-22). This can be compared to building a house. The craftsmen labor to smooth the lumber and square the bricks for the purpose of building the house. When the house is built, we no longer see scattered materials; instead, we see a finished house that is built with various materials. No matter how valuable or beautiful a piece of wood may be, if it is lying on the floor, it is out of place, useless, and even an obstacle. Hence, all the material that the craftsmen &ldquo;edify&rdquo; must be built together into the house. Any material that is not built into the house is useless.</p>
<p>We have been believers for many years and have received much edification. However, we must ask whether we have been built up as the Body of Christ or whether we are only good for display. There are many attractive and expensive items in an antique shop. These items may be fine antiques made by skillful craftsmen. God has no desire to gain &ldquo;antiques&rdquo;; He has a desire to gain a building. Many experienced and spiritual Christians can be compared to fine antiques. These Christians have been edified and dealt with, just like stones whose rough edges have been cut and polished until they are smooth and pleasant to the eye. Such stones are precious. However, from the point of view of building, no matter how much a craftsman works on a stone, it does not fulfill the purpose of building the house if it is not built into the house.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING A CHRISTIAN WHO CAN BE<br />
BUILT UP WITH OTHERS</h2>
<p>Some Christians have not been edified. Other Christians have been edified, but they cannot be built up with others. Because God wants to gain a builded church, He needs a third kind of Christian. God needs Christians who have been edified and are willing to present themselves to the Body (Rom. 12:1). God needs Christians who are willing to present their bodies for the church life. What kind of Christians will we be? God needs not only spiritual, fine, and precious Christians; He needs Christians who can be built up with others.</p>
<p>We must see that God desires to gain a building. When a believer is willing to present himself, the church lays hands on him as an acceptance of his consecration. Such a laying on of hands emphasizes identification and blessing. Laying on of hands is also the church asking the Lord to give a member his gift, that is, to manifest this member&rsquo;s function for the building. Furthermore, through the laying on of hands every member, whether or not he is precious, spiritual, or honorable, is built into one Body. First Corinthians 12:23 and 24 say, &ldquo;Those members of the body which we consider to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor; and our uncomely members come to have more abundant comeliness, but our comely members have no need. But God has blended the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked.&rdquo; Because God has special care for the less honorable members, He places and joins the honorable members with the less honorable so that more abundant honor may be given to the members that lack. God does not allow isolated honor; rather, He gives more abundant honor to the member that lacks and builds the honorable members together with the less honorable members.</p>
<p>We should ask ourselves, &ldquo;With whom am I built up?&rdquo; We may not be able to answer this question, because our natural life loves to preserve itself whole, to be isolated, and to not be built up with others. We cannot be &ldquo;moving stones&rdquo; in the church, who come and go as we please. A stone that is built into a house is steadfast. It is in the house when it is pleased, and it is still in the house when it is not pleased. It is in the house when strong winds blow, and it is in the house when there is heavy rain. Once a person is built up, he no longer has the freedom to come and go as he pleases. We are living stones for God&rsquo;s building (1 Pet. 2:5); we are not unbuildable, moving stones. To be built together is to grow together. The laying of hands by the church on a person who presents himself is a declaration of the church that an individual stone is being put into the building. When a person asks the church to lay hands on him, he is saying that he is willing to accept the building of the church and that he agrees to be built up together with other saints into the church as a house. From the day that a believer consecrates himself for the building, he should be prepared to lose his personal freedom, to no longer be individual or closed, and to be completely open to the Body and its members.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION BEING FOR BUILDING HIS CHURCH</h2>
<p>God does not want to gain fine antiques. He wants to gain a building as His dwelling place, and this building is the church in each locality. The testimony of the church does not come from scattered, spiritual men, as we may imagine. God does not need an individual, scattered testimony. He needs a group of people built together as His dwelling place in spirit to be His corporate testimony. For this reason, we must have a definite ground, and we must not carelessly establish meetings according to our will. We acknowledge that there is only one local church in any place. Whether a church is spiritual, childish, or experienced, the believers must be built into it and not have their own choice. To establish another meeting according to our own choice or preference is to damage the Body of Christ and destroy God&rsquo;s building. We must never allow such a thing to happen. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy may we see that God&rsquo;s salvation is not for individuals but for building His church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>

<p>In the previous chapters we saw that God&rsquo;s eternal intention and His eternal plan are centered on Christ. God wants Christ to be our everything, to be our life and our life supply. We also saw that the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation is to build the church. The church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ, and the issue of our enjoyment of the riches of Christ. If we are to enjoy the riches of Christ in order to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose, we need the following five practices.</p>
<p>First, we need to practice living a life of faith. Second, we need to read the Lord&rsquo;s Word and apply the word of life to feed our spirit. Third, we need to have an absolute and thorough consecration and to learn to have continual fellowship with the Lord in spirit and to abide in the Lord. Fourth, we need to experience death and resurrection. In other words, we need to experience our co-crucifixion on the cross, which has terminated our soul-life, and we need to know resurrection life and enjoy the riches of Christ in resurrection. Fifth, we need to practice being built together with the saints in our locality to practically live the church life. We must bring these matters to the Lord in prayer both privately and corporately, and we also need to practice these matters by the Lord&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING A LIFE OF FAITH</h2>
<p>We need to practice living a life of faith. We must understand the doctrine of living by faith and also commit ourselves with our needs, problems, and situations into the Lord&rsquo;s hand, looking to Him in faith. When the Lord tries us, we can prove Him. Many problems come to us because the Lord wants to bring us to our end so that we would learn the lesson of faith. Our end is God&rsquo;s beginning, and our dead end is God&rsquo;s way out. If we do not learn to trust in the Lord, we may be loose and careless. When we learn to trust in the Lord, He will demand certain things of us and correct us. Then He will have a way to flow out of us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">READING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD</h2>
<p>We need to read the Lord&rsquo;s Word. We must not only understand the Word with our mind but also feed our spirit with the Word. It is not necessary to read a large portion each time, but we should read a few verses every day. This is like eating a meal. We should not eat too much lest we get an upset stomach, but we should always eat a few meals a day to stay healthy. A person who is fed is healthy, safe, and happy. It is good to ask one another whether we have read the Bible or spent time with the Lord. We must eat spiritual food through the Lord&rsquo;s Word daily. We should not talk about the building up of the church on a spiritually empty stomach. Instead, we should eat, drink, and enjoy the Lord through reading His Word. Some may feel that it is barbaric to speak of eating the Lord, but the Lord Himself said, &ldquo;As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (John 6:57). The thought of eating the Lord is in the Bible. We can eat the Lord because He is our food. We eat Him by reading the Bible. We do not read the Word to accumulate spiritual knowledge but to obtain spiritual food with our spirit.</p>
<p>When saints ask me why they are weak, I ask them how many days they have been without a meal. This question is not concerning physical food but concerning reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word daily to be fed by the Lord. Most of these saints confess that they do not read the Lord&rsquo;s Word daily. If we do not eat every day, it is impossible for us to be strong. A person who does not eat physical food is unlikely to survive after forty days. This should be a warning to us.</p>
<p>Christians are weak because they neither read the Bible nor fellowship with the Lord. A person who does not eat or drink will not have much strength the following day and is more likely to get sick. We have spiritual problems because we lack spiritual vitamins. In order for us to be strong and free from various spiritual ailments, we must read the Bible and draw near to the Lord daily. Reading the Bible daily to enjoy the Lord not only solves our spiritual problems but also strengthens our spirit. I hope that the saints will not neglect this matter.</p>
<p>Some Christians excuse themselves, saying that they are too busy to read the Lord&rsquo;s Word. We do not need to spend much time to read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, but it is important that we take a little time to feed on the Word daily. About thirty years ago I read a tract that said Christians should spend ten minutes to speak, four times a day. The first ten minutes are for speaking to the Lord, that is, for prayer. The second ten minutes are for listening to the Lord speak, that is, for reading the Word. The third ten minutes are for speaking with other believers, that is, for fellowship. The fourth ten minutes are for speaking to the Gentiles, that is, for preaching the gospel. We should practice these four ten minutes daily. We should at least practice the first two ten minutes; we should spend ten minutes to speak to the Lord and ten minutes to listen to the Lord speak. We should not wait until night to speak to the Lord or to listen to Him speak; rather, we should spend ten minutes in the morning to speak to the Lord and ten minutes to listen to the Lord speak.</p>
<p>Someone once asked George M&#252;ller why believers should read the Bible and pray in the morning. He replied that in the Old Testament people offered up the precious fat of the sacrifice, not the dung of the sacrifice (Exo. 29:13-14; Lev. 4:8-12). The morning can be likened to fat, but night can be likened to dung. Therefore, reading the Bible and praying to draw near to the Lord in the morning can be likened to offering up the fat of the sacrifice. We should not wait to use whatever time is left over at night for drawing near to the Lord. No matter what day it is, we should always spend ten minutes for prayer and ten minutes for Bible reading in the morning. Ten minutes is not a long time; hence, this can easily be done. Such time is very precious. May we respond to the Lord and give Him our most precious and best twenty minutes in the morning by praying and reading the Bible to draw near to Him.</p>
<p>We should force ourselves to practice this; otherwise, we will not be strong. Listening to messages will not make us strong. I hope that we would sign a spiritual agreement with the Lord to practice reading His Word and praying. Children must learn to eat so that they can grow up to be strong. Therefore, we must practice reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word every day. We should calm our inner being to read every morning. We do not need to read for too long. We need only ten minutes, and then we should turn what we have read into prayer. This is the way to feed our spirit daily.</p><h2 class="head1">HAVING AN ABSOLUTE AND THOROUGH CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>We need to have an absolute and thorough consecration. In the Old Testament the children of Israel daily offered up burnt offerings in the morning and in the evening, and particular offerings were offered every Sabbath, at the beginning of every month, and for every feast (Num. 28&mdash;29). The children of Israel also had to offer up burnt offerings on major events (Lev. 8:18, 28; 1 Kings 3:4, 15; 8:62-64). Offering the burnt offering typifies our need to consecrate ourselves on every occasion, for everything, at all times, and in every place. Young people who are taking college entrance exams and young adults who will be getting married and starting a family must both have proper consecrations. We should also consecrate ourselves for spiritual activities, such as preaching the gospel or visiting the saints. Renewing our consecration daily is an important and great lesson. Practices such as learning to abide in the Lord and having His presence through consecration were recovered by Mrs. Hannah Whitall Smith. We should not do anything that will cause us to leave the Lord&rsquo;s presence. If saying something will take us out of the Lord, we should not say it. We must learn to pay attention to the inner sense and practice abiding in the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>We need to experience death and resurrection in everything. We must experience the cross in all things. Even our love for the brothers needs to go through the cross. Our inclinations and desires must go through the cross. We must also learn to experience resurrection. Resurrection is the next step of the cross. Thirty years ago a brother told me that a stone buried in the earth would yield nothing, but a seed buried in the earth would bring forth fruit. This is resurrection. As Christians, we have Christ in us. If we would accept the cross, stop ourselves, and let ourselves die, the resurrection life of Christ within us will be lived out. Therefore, we must experience death and also resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BUILT TOGETHER WITH OTHERS</h2>
<p>We must ask ourselves whether we are individualistic or are joined to others and being built up together with others. As Christians, we must be on the proper ground, and we must practice being built up with others as the church in our locality. This is God&rsquo;s eternal intention and the goal of His eternal salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: What does it mean to experience death by accepting the cross?</em></p>
<p>Answer: A dead person has no feelings; he cannot even feel death. If we can feel death, we are not yet dead. If we still have feelings, we are not yet dead. In Foochow there was a married woman who had such a disagreeable contention with her husband&rsquo;s family that she threatened to drown herself in the sea. She ran to the sea, and her family followed, but when she reached the sea, she held on to her skirt so that it would not get wet. When the family saw this, they knew that she would not drown herself, because she was unwilling to let her skirt get wet. Many Christians say that they accept the cross, but they have too many feelings. They are like the woman who held on to her skirt. A person with so many feelings is not dead. When we truly experience death, we do not feel anything.</p>
<p><em>Question: How can we always renew our consecration?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We should consecrate ourselves in great matters and in small matters. For example, a sister who wants to visit a friend should consecrate herself before leaving her home. She may say, &ldquo;Lord, I belong to You; I am not my own. I am going to visit a friend, so I hand myself over to You so that You can make every decision.&rdquo; Once she consecrates herself, she may sense that the Lord does not want her to go. The Lord may ask whether this visit is according to her will or according to His will. Then the sister should ask the Lord to forgive her because the visit was according to her will. She may also say that she no longer intends to go. If the Lord then leads her to go, she should be exercised not to say anything presumptuously. She should follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading in whatever she says and does. We need such an absolute consecration in what we say and do.</p>
<p>The younger saints sometimes ask me whether they may still watch movies now that they are Christians. I do not debate with them, nor do I say anything related to going or not going. Instead, I advise them to consecrate themselves whenever they want to watch a movie. They can say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I belong to You; I am not my own. I am now going to watch a movie, so I consecrate myself fully to You.&rdquo; Then they will know whether they should watch the movie. They often say that after such a consecration, they are not able to watch a movie. Whether or not they watch movies should not be the result of human exhortation but of their consecration. Our consecration can make things clear for us. When we place ourselves on the altar, our eyes will be opened, and there will be no more reasoning. This is my experience; many things become clear to me when I pray and consecrate myself.</p>
<p><em>Question: How do we know whether something is of the Lord or is acceptable to Him?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We should never analyze spiritual matters with our mind. I still do not know whether my right foot or my left foot is the first to move when I walk. If I always paid attention to whether I use my left foot first or my right foot first, I still would not know how to walk. Instead of analyzing, we should just walk. We need to believe that the Lord accepts our consecration, regardless of who is consecrating himself or of what is being consecrated. Even if a brother would feign a consecration, the Lord never pretends; He will make a feigned consecration real. In the Old Testament no one could take an offering back once it was on the altar (Lev. 27:9-10). After something has been placed on the altar, it cannot be taken back. This proves that the Lord remembers our consecration forever and that no one can annul his consecration.</p>
<p><em>Question: How can I know whether I have growth in life?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We need to have faith regarding matters of life. Matters of life have their law. Once I planted a seed but did not see anything grow after two days. I was so worried there might be a problem with the seed that I dug up the soil to see whether the seed was still there. There was no problem with the seed, yet nothing grew after several more days. Later, an experienced person told me to leave the seed alone, because it has its law of life and will grow when it is time. Likewise, it is sufficient to love the Lord, draw near to Him in prayer daily, consecrate ourselves, wait on the Lord and abide in Him, and give heed to the sense of peace within. We do not need to analyze our situation or worry. We should be at peace and let the law of life take care of the matters of life. The life seed will grow, and we will be strong. There is no need to check whether we have grown. When we analyze, we interfere with the law of life.</p>
<p>Being a Christian is very difficult and also very easy. My youngest daughter is often concerned about how many centimeters she has grown. She should not worry, even though she seems to be the same height every day. The Lord said, &ldquo;A man cast seed on the earth, and sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and lengthens&mdash;how, he does not know. The earth bears fruit by itself&rdquo; (Mark 4:26-28). Hence, we do not need to be anxious concerning whether we are growing. We simply need to eat and sleep properly, and life will grow.</p>
<p><em>Question: What should we do when we do not want to eat, drink, or enjoy the Lord?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There are two solutions. First, we should force ourselves to eat and drink the Lord. We must eat and drink the Lord even when we do not want to. If we would force ourselves to eat and drink the Lord, after a while our negative feelings will disappear. Second, if we are unable to eat and drink the Lord for a long period of time, we need to see a spiritual physician. The Lord is our spiritual Physician, and the church is also. When we come to the church, the Lord will speak to us through the saints concerning our sickness. By praying for us, the saints &ldquo;prescribe medication&rdquo; and also strengthen and supply us. Therefore, there is no reason for a Christian to be weak for a long period of time. He must always eat and drink the Lord normally.</p>
<p><em>Question: What should we do if we do not understand our environment?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Christians encounter two kinds of environments. The first kind of environment is an obstacle raised up by Satan when we obey and carry out God&rsquo;s commandment. We must overcome such environments by faith, but we must not use our flesh to deal with Satan. The second kind of environment is a trial from God. We should not expect to overcome the environment that God gives us but should rather accept the environment and learn the lesson in that environment. Because it is difficult for believers to discern whether an environment is an attack from Satan or a trial permitted by God, we need to pray more and also pray together with our fellow members. We may ask the Lord to resolve the environment if it is an attack from Satan and to strengthen us if the environment is a trial from the Lord. The lesson that the Lord wants us to learn is different in each environment. If through prayer we are certain that an environment is of Satan, we should pray until the environment is resolved.</p>
<p><em>Question: How do we discern what is of God and what is an obstacle from Satan?</em></p>
<p>Answer: When we encounter a situation that we do not understand, we should first wait and not do anything. We should never have an attitude of resignation, of accepting everything. We should do our best to avoid problems. We should avoid what is avoidable and commit the unavoidable into the Lord&rsquo;s hand. For example, if a brother sees that a car is about to hit him, he should not stand still and say, &ldquo;I do not know whether this is an attack from Satan or a trial from the Lord.&rdquo; Of course, he should try to avoid being hit by the car. Some things, however, are unavoidable, no matter how much we try to avoid them. In such situations we should willingly submit and accept them. It is wrong to willingly accept avoidable problems, but we should accept with thanksgiving and learn lessons from things that are from the Lord.</p>
<p><em>Question: Does the Lord reveal His will to us in one instant, or do we wait for Him to gradually reveal it to us?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is not easy to be clear concerning the Lord&rsquo;s will, because there are many intricacies that are involved. In principle, the Lord does not let us know everything about a matter; He often reveals things to us bit by bit. In this way, we will always look to the Lord, draw near to Him, and depend on Him. When God called Abraham, He said, &ldquo;Go...to the land that I will show you&rdquo; (Gen. 12:1). However, Abraham did not know where he was to go. God did not tell Abraham the destination. If God had told Abraham, he would not have needed to depend on Jehovah God. Abraham needed to follow God step by step; he took one step one day and another step the next day. Abraham could not afford to lose God, because God was his Guide. God did not give Abraham a map, so Abraham could not forsake God.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Lord wants us to understand His will, but we are distracted by the mixture within us. Miss M. E. Barber knew the Lord. She said, &ldquo;If you have not forsaken yourself completely, you are only ten percent into your hundred-mile journey of pursuing to know the Lord, but if you have forsaken yourself, you have already finished ninety-nine miles.&rdquo; This means that the greatest problem in knowing the Lord&rsquo;s will is the self.</p>
<p>There is a story of a captain who steered his ship toward the foot of a mountain, even though he navigated with a map and compass. He could not explain why the ship was steered to the foot of the mountain. Some experts later discovered that the mountain was so rich in magnetite that it affected the compass. This is a very good illustration. The self is so rich in &ldquo;magnetite&rdquo; that it can influence a Christian to read the Bible according to his concept and to deliberate concerning God&rsquo;s will according to his own thoughts. Such Christians are like a ship with a failed compass. If we want to know God&rsquo;s will, we should be pure, trust in the Lord, and follow Him closely step by step; we must not expect to know His will in one instant.</p>
<p>On our journey of following the Lord we must forsake our self when we sense that it is entangled in a certain matter. However, we should not overanalyze. If we fellowship with the Lord and accept the cross, we do not need to analyze.</p>
<p><em>Question: I still have a strong feeling concerning my consecration to the Lord, but I lack a clear calling from the Lord. Should I still drop everything and hand everything over for His use?</em></p>
<p>Answer: To consecrate oneself to the Lord for His use does not mean that one must drop everything and become a preacher. We consecrate ourselves to let the Lord live in us and pass through us. Such a consecration requires that we hand ourselves over fully. Consecration depends on us, but what we do after our consecration does not depend on us. The problem of many believers is that either they do not consecrate themselves, or they consecrate themselves and then instruct the Lord concerning how to use them. The Lord wants us to consecrate ourselves, but He does not want us to direct Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS<br />
BOTH GOD AND MAN<br />
FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</h1>
<p>Matthew 22:34-46 says, &ldquo;The Pharisees, when they heard that He had muzzled the Sadducees, gathered themselves together. And one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him, Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law? And He said to him, &lsquo;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.&rsquo; This is the great and first commandment. And the second is like it: &lsquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&rsquo; On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets. Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus questioned them, saying, What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is He? They said to Him, David&rsquo;s. He said to them, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, &lsquo;The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet&rsquo;? If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son? And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone from that day dare to question Him anymore.&rdquo; We will pay special attention to the question in verse 42, &ldquo;What do you think concerning the Christ?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE QUESTION OF QUESTIONS</h2>
<p>Before the Lord Jesus was crucified, He was tested and examined for four days in Jerusalem by people of high social status. These people included the Pharisees, patriotic Jews who were zealous for morality and ethics; the Sadducees, modernist Jews who advocated reform; and the Herodians, Jews who supported the Roman Empire. In addition to these three groups there were the priests who served God, the elders who were the rulers, and the scribes who understood the Scriptures. Before the Lord&rsquo;s death the Pharisees, Herodians, Sadducees, priests, elders, and scribes attacked Him with their questions so that they might find reason to accuse Him (21:23-27; 22:15-40). Their questions were of four categories: politics (vv. 15-22), religion (21:23-27), belief (22:23-33), and interpretation of the law (vv. 34-40). These four categories represent all the questions of the Jewish society at the time of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Our Lord is infinitely wise. No question could muzzle Him. The Lord&rsquo;s replies to the four major questions demonstrate His extraordinary wisdom. The people who wanted to ensnare Him could find no loophole as a reason to accuse or condemn Him. The Lord&rsquo;s replies rendered them speechless; they were defeated and brought down by the Lord Jesus. After the Lord Jesus answered their questions, these people of high standing were muzzled and had no more questions.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, however, asked them a question. This question was related to Christ and can be considered the question of questions. The Lord Jesus asked, &ldquo;What do you think concerning the Christ?&rdquo; The Lord was truly wise. Man cared for politics, religion, belief, and the interpretation of the law instead of Christ. This is still the case with the people in the world today. Experts of every field, including politics, religion, science, sociology, economics, and history, study many issues, but they neglect the question concerning Christ. The Lord Jesus asked the Jews, &ldquo;What do you think concerning the Christ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unbelievers are not the only ones who neglect the Lord Jesus; it is easy for Christians to neglect Him. Every believer has many unresolved questions. These questions concern parents, children, spouses, education, work, and daily necessities. There may be many questions, but the true question is &ldquo;What do you think concerning the Christ?&rdquo; What do you know concerning Him? What is your relationship with Him? Does He have any ground in you? If we have Christ as our answer, all our questions will be solved. We must bear in mind that the question of questions is: &ldquo;What do you think concerning the Christ?&rdquo; This is the central question of human life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE CENTER OF HUMAN LIFE</h2>
<p>Human life is like a ship at sea. At the center of every ship is a tall mast. The mast is not only for hanging sails; it is the stabilizing center of the ship. A ship without a mast will rock violently when hit by winds and waves. But a ship with a tall mast is more stable. Human life is like a ship drifting at sea without a stabilizing center. All men, regardless of their nationality, religion, wealth, social status, or education, are drifting about aimlessly. Some people think that education will give them a goal in life. However, I have met excellent scholars who were still depressed after gaining education. Other people think that fortune will give them security in life, but wealthy people are still empty and depressed and are also anxious concerning their wealth. Still others think that politics will gain them respect. But even if they were to become president, it would be for only a few years, during which they would be troubled daily by national affairs. Human life without a mast is a matter of drifting. Christ is the mast of human life. The question of questions that the Lord Jesus asked means that people who have Christ have a stabilizing center in their human life. This also applies to us Christians. Christ, and nothing else, is our base, support, and comfort. Even if we have studied and understand every issue, we are adrift if we do not know the Lord sufficiently. Only the Lord is the center of our life.</p>
<p>The words that the Lord Jesus spoke in the Gospels are simple, but they are wise, rich, and deep. For example, He said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst&rdquo; (John 6:35). These words are simple, but this is a tremendous statement. A small man by the name of Jesus Christ can cause people all over the world and throughout the ages to hunger no more and to thirst no more. This word is too great and too high. Who could utter such a word? Could Socrates, Confucius, or any sage say this? The Lord&rsquo;s words are simple yet deep, high, and profound in significance. How can He be our bread of life? How can we drink of Him? This is truly a mystery.</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life&rdquo; (8:12). His words are not abstract, confusing, or incomprehensible, like those of philosophers. The words of the Lord Jesus are simple and easy to understand; even children can understand His words. Yet His words are high, mysterious, rich, deep, and have a profound significance. He is the bread of life. He is the water of life. He is the light of life. These are tremendous statements. Who besides Christ could utter such words?</p>
<p>The Pharisees, Sadducees, and Herodians were wise in their own eyes and wanted to confuse the Lord Jesus, but their questions were insignificant to Him. Instead, in Matthew 22:42 He used simple words to ask them questions concerning the mystery of the universe: &ldquo;What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is He?&rdquo; The Pharisees thought they knew the Scriptures and answered, &ldquo;David&rsquo;s,&rdquo; so the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;How then does David in spirit call Him Lord?&rdquo; (vv. 42-43). How can a father call his son Lord? How could David call his descendant Lord? The Lord&rsquo;s question baffled the Pharisees. As a result, &ldquo;no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone from that day dare to question Him anymore&rdquo; (v. 46). No one dared to question the Lord Jesus, because those who do not know Christ do not understand human life. Anyone who does not know Christ does not know the heavens, the earth, or human life. Even a renowned scholar who does not know Christ is unclear concerning human life.</p>
<p>About thirty years ago a sister brought me to see the mayor of Tientsin, whose wife and two children met with us. He was a very established and powerful political figure, but he was seriously ill and bedridden. According to my sense within, I said to him, &ldquo;If a person does not know the Lord, if he does not know Christ, he is most pitiful. The Lord Jesus is the light of the world; he who follows Him shall by no means walk in darkness. He who does not have the Lord Jesus has no light, and he who has no light is in darkness.&rdquo; This man said humbly, &ldquo;Indeed, it is as if I am lost in life, and I do not know what course to take. It is as if I have gone astray, and I do not know where I am going.&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;You have fame, status, wealth, and a good family. Yet you are still missing the center of your life, which is Christ. Once you have Christ, everything will be clear and bright to you. Once you know Christ, you will know the meaning of the universe and where you are going.&rdquo; This is true not only for unbelievers but even for Christians. A person can be a Christian, but if he does not love the Lord or give the Lord ground in him, he is living foolishly.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING AND EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS GOD</h2>
<p>There is a God in this universe, and this God is Christ. Christ is the true God who created the universe and all things. There is a genuine and proper man in this universe, and this man is Christ. No one is as genuine or proper as the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the true God and a real man. He has the divine life and nature, and He also has the human life and nature. As the son of David, Jesus Christ is man, and as the Lord of David, He is God. We must know that our Lord is both God and man. He has the divine nature and the human nature. We are saved, but who is Christ to us? What ground does He have in our hearts, and what effect does He have in our lives? May we see that Christ is the mystery of the universe; He is the mingling of God and man. Before Christ was born, God was in the heavens, and man was on the earth; God and man were not mingled together. Now there is One who was tested and who was found in fashion as a man but who was God. This wonderful One is the mingling of God and man. He is the manifestation and expression of God. Through His humanity God is manifested in man and expressed through man. This is the Christian faith.</p>
<p>The Christian faith has everything to do with God and man. The characteristic of Christians is that they have God within them. Genuine Christians are filled with God. Those who do not have God within them are false Christians; they are not orthodox Christians. A person may know Christ doctrinally but not experientially; he does not have a revelation concerning Christ, nor has he gained Christ. A person who sees that the Christ who indwells him is the great and unlimited God will be enlarged. Those who have the revelation of Christ are broad. Young believers may be lively and exuberant, but they need to express the greatness of Christ. This greatness is God. A young brother may be unassuming, but the great God dwells in him. If this brother knows that the Christ who dwells in him is the God of the universe, he will not put on a long face when things do not go his way or when he is offended. Instead, he would be willing to forgive, forget, and forbear offenses, and he would not be discouraged by problems. If we truly know that Christ is God and that He dwells in us, we will not focus on offenses. Those who can forgive, forbear, and cover others are broad, but those who hold grudges and are easily offended are narrow because they do not know the indwelling Christ.</p>
<p>Some saints consider their houses or their wealth to be as dear as their life. This indicates that they do not know Christ adequately. If a brother knows that Christ is God living in him, an expensive house would not mean anything to him nor would gold. A broad person has Christ. The apostle Paul counted the knowledge of Christ Jesus as excellent; hence, he was broad, and nothing earthly could touch him. Paul said that he suffered the loss of all things and counted them as refuse that he might gain Christ (Phil. 3:8). The narrower a person is, the more he cares about how he is treated and about his possessions. An excellent house would not have touched the apostle Paul&rsquo;s heart. Do we live like those who have Christ dwelling in them? When we are full of the element of Christ, we will be broad and weighty. If we lack the element of Christ, we will be narrow and lightweight.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING AND EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS MAN</h2>
<p>Christ is not only God; He is also man. No one is as great or as lowly as Christ. If we are short of Christ, we will be neither broad nor lowly. Suppose four brothers serve together. Who would take the lead to be humble? I am afraid that no one would want to be the first to humble himself. However, the Lord Jesus is the great God, yet He humbled Himself and became a man (2:6-7). He could lay aside His outer garments, gird Himself with a towel, wash the disciples&rsquo; feet, and wipe them with the towel with which He was girded (John 13:4-5). When the disciples argued with one another concerning who was greater, the Lord said, &ldquo;If anyone wants to be first, he shall be the last of all and the servant of all&rdquo; (Mark 9:35). When James and John asked the Lord to grant them to sit one on His right and one on His left in His glory, the Lord said, &ldquo;You know that those who are esteemed as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. But it is not so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be the slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many&rdquo; (10:42-45). The principle in the Bible is that the one being served is small, but the one serving is great. The Christ within us is both God and man so that we can be normal human beings who express God. If we know the Christ who is in us, we will be broad and humble. We can be as low as dust and not be concerned with how we are treated. We will be humble, lowly, and willing to serve others, because the lowly Christ is in us.</p>
<p>The Christian life should express Christ. We can be as broad as the great God and as humble and low as a proper man. If we have been graced by the Lord, nothing on earth will affect us. It will not matter whether we receive a part of the family inheritance, because the Christ within us is great and transcendent. We can also humble ourselves to serve in a lowly way, because we have Christ within us. Such is the living of ones who experience the deep work of the cross. They are touched by Christ, not by any problem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST BRINGING IN<br />
THE ONE ACCORD AND PRODUCING<br />
THE REALITY OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Christ is God; therefore, people should see the greatness of God in us. Christ is also man; therefore, people should also see the lowliness of man in us. This is to live Christ out. Such a living brings in the one accord and produces the reality of the church.</p>
<p>Before the Lord Jesus died, the disciples argued concerning who was greatest (Luke 22:24). They did not have the one accord, nor did they have the reality of the church. It was not until Christ entered into them that they began to know Christ. At Pentecost Peter was filled with God and spoke the word of God with boldness (Acts 2:14-40). Peter was great, fearing no one and nothing. However, he was also so small and lowly that he could coordinate with the brothers. Thus, the disciples had the one accord and the reality of the church.</p>
<p>Because Christ is in us, we should be so broad that we have nothing to argue about and have no need to argue. We should also be so small that there is nothing we cannot accommodate and no one with whom we cannot coordinate. People in the world contend in order to be great, and no one is willing to be small or lowly. Instead, their living shows that they are quite narrow. As those who have Christ, we should not be such. We should be broad and lowly. If we have unresolved problems, we need to know Christ more. &ldquo;What do you think concerning the Christ?&rdquo; He is God, the Lord of David, and He is also a man, the son of David. If we know and experience Him, we will be both broad and lowly. No one among us would assume to be greater than others; rather, we would be full of grace and express the great, extraordinary, and transcendent God in all things. We would also be small, humble, accommodating, and able to serve one another. This is the living of Christians who express God, and this is the practical church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THREE IMPORTANT PRACTICES<br />
IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider three important practices in our Christian life&mdash;pursuing to know the Lord, fellowshipping with the Lord, and preaching the gospel. Every believer should make a resolution before the Lord to practice these three matters. Such resolutions are a great help.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING A RESOLUTION BEING TO RESPOND<br />
TO THE LORD&rsquo;S GRACE</h2>
<p>Every great matter in the Christian life requires a resolution. We cannot say that Christians should leave everything to the Lord&rsquo;s grace, that resolutions are regulations, or that we should not make resolutions. The Bible says, &ldquo;Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you&rdquo; (James 4:8). The condition for the Lord&rsquo;s drawing near to us is our drawing near to Him. In addition, the Lord said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you&rdquo; (John 15:4). The Lord wants to draw near to us and abide in us, but there is a condition: we first need to draw near to Him and abide in Him. This does not mean that our human effort is effective but that the Lord has graced us and is waiting for us to take the initiative to respond to Him.</p>
<p>For example, suppose a brother comes to a love feast. Unless he uses his hands, the food cannot enter into his mouth. No matter how rich the food may be, he must respond by picking up the food, opening his mouth, and putting the food in his mouth. If he does not use his hands or open his mouth, no one can help him. Hence, we will be fed if we receive, but we will be hungry if we do not receive, because receiving love and grace is our response. Suppose there are forty guests at the love feast, but only thirty-eight respond. Those who respond will be happy and satisfied, but those who do not respond will be hungry. The host cannot be held responsible for the guests who are hungry, because he has given them food and drink. The problem is not a lack of love from the host but a lack of response from the guests.</p>
<p>The same applies to the Lord&rsquo;s grace. He has done everything and has given us everything. He died on the cross for us, accomplished the work of redemption for us, and dealt with the problems of sin and the enemy for us. He resurrected from the dead, satisfied God&rsquo;s requirements, became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), and has given Himself to us in this Spirit. He is now waiting for us to respond to Him. If we would draw near to Him&mdash;respond to what He has done and given to us&mdash;He will draw near to us. An open vessel can be filled. If our being is open, we will be filled. If the opening of a vessel is turned downward, it cannot be filled with rain even in a downpour. If we do not receive grace, we should not say that God&rsquo;s grace is not sufficient or that God is a respecter of persons and gives grace to others but not to us. Rather, we should question whether we have responded to Him. The Lord has done everything for us and has given us everything. He requires us only to respond to Him.</p>
<p>The Bible can say that the Lord will draw near to us if we draw near to Him, because He is waiting for us to draw near to Him and to receive Him. The Bible can say that the Lord will abide in us if we abide in Him, because the Lord is already abiding in us. However, we will not sense His abiding in us unless we abide in Him. A person who does not read the Bible or pray in order to draw near to the Lord can be moved by the Lord occasionally but will not always sense that the Lord abides in him. But a person who prays, reads the Bible, and fellowships with the Lord will always sense that the Lord abides in him. According to our experience, it is possible to sense that we are filled with the Lord when we pray and fellowship with Him. This is to experience His abiding by our abiding in Him and fellowshipping with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PURSUING TO KNOW THE LORD</h2>
<p>There are a few great matters that require resolutions. These matters are: pursuing to know the Lord, fellowshipping with the Lord, and preaching the gospel. We should consider the pursuit of the knowledge of Christ to be excellent. In the preceding chapter we saw that Christ is both God and man and that He is in us. He is God; man calls Him the great God. He is man; He appeared on the earth as a small and lowly man. Because He is God in us, we are so enlarged that we can forbear and accept anything. Because He is a man in us, we are so low that we can accommodate and endure anything. His life is both great and small, because He is both God and man. This is truly wonderful. There is no end to pursuing the Lord or to knowing Him. Therefore, we must make a resolution to know Him. We should not resign our knowing Him to fate, nor should we live on the spirituality of others.</p><h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIPPING WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>Next, we must fellowship with the Lord by drawing near to Him every morning and by reading the Bible and praying daily. As Christians, we must absorb the Lord through reading the Bible, praying, drawing near to Him, and enjoying Him. This is not a matter of doctrine but a matter of practice. Some believers have been saved for many years, but they still do not know how to fellowship with the Lord, nor do they know the key to fellowshipping with the Lord. They are thus unable to touch the Lord or enjoy Him. Such Christians are not normal Christians. Persons who do not eat or drink cannot be healthy, and those who are malnourished are susceptible to all kinds of sicknesses. Christians can also be sick if they are spiritually malnourished.</p>
<p>In order to fellowship with the Lord, we must know that He is omnipresent. The Bible says that &ldquo;the Lord is the Spirit&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:17). He is the Spirit indwelling our spirit; therefore, we can fellowship with Him at any time. The Lord is also the Word. In the Gospel of John the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (6:63), and in Romans Paul says, &ldquo;The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart&rdquo; (10:8). If we contact the Lord&rsquo;s word by reading the Bible, we will be able to contact the Lord. However, we must take heed to read the Bible not only with our eyes or our mind but to contact the words of the Bible with our spirit. This is the way to receive the Lord as our supply from His Word.</p>
<p>We must also pray after reading the Bible. When we pray according to our spirit, we will be able to contact the Lord in our spirit. If we will spend ten to thirty minutes reading the Bible and praying every morning, we will be supplied inwardly by the Lord. In our fellowship with the Lord, He may shine in us, rebuke us, comfort us, or encourage us. No matter what we experience, we gain the Lord. To gain the Lord is to be fed within. It is best to do this not only in the morning but also to find quiet time to fellowship with the Lord in the afternoon and in the evening before going to bed. The Lord is our true food, true drink, true sunlight, and true air. If we eat Him, drink Him, breathe Him, and accept His shining, our spirit will be strong.</p>
<p>Regrettably, some Christians do not know how to have genuine contact with the Lord. Hence, they have a nominal Christian life and are merely religious. They know only doctrines; they do not know how to use their spirit, nor do they know about using their spirit. As a result, they are often deflated spiritually. Because they do not fellowship with the Lord, they are also indifferent to their mistakes and their coldness. If we are genuinely saved, we must learn the way to fellowship with the Lord, to contact Him, to read His Word, to pray to Him often in spirit, and to be supplied by Him. Then we will accept the Lord&rsquo;s dealings and experience His demands, restrictions, limitations, and breaking. The more we have such experiences, the better.</p>
<p>We should bring what we sense to the Lord in prayer. As soon as we have a sense, we should pray. To pray much is to let the divine air flow more through us, to penetrate us further, and to flow deeper within us. Such prayer can be compared to deep breathing and will refresh us and make our spirit healthy and strong. Sometimes we may further experience being led in prayer, and we may also experience the infilling of the Spirit and the outpouring of the Spirit. We will also have a burden for the gospel and the spirit of the gospel when our spirit is open. When we are enlivened within, we will be living and full of the Spirit, instead of being deflated while preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>I hope that all the saints will make a resolution to pursue knowing the Lord and to fellowship with Him. Fellowshipping with the Lord includes many things, such as drawing near to Him, reading the Bible, and praying in the morning. How can the Lord bless us if we do not read the Bible, pray, or rise up early to draw near to Him? If some do not have the time in the morning, they can be flexible and use other times. However, the morning is the most suitable time. The saints in Los Angeles are an example. Both the younger and the older saints do their best to come together for morning revival at six o&rsquo;clock. Some wake up before five o&rsquo;clock and drive an hour to join the morning revival. It is good for individuals to rise up early and draw near to the Lord, and it is more helpful for several to draw near to the Lord together. We all need to pay some price. We will lose the blessing when we are at ease. It is important for us to pay the price of rising up early by sacrificing some sleep so that we may enjoy the Lord in morning revival. In our morning revival we should read the Bible and pray, but we should not read for too long. The important thing is to absorb the Lord, pray much, and fellowship with one another.</p>
<p>The saints who live close to one another should daily practice to rise early in order to read the Bible, to pray, and to enjoy the Lord together. It is not easy to open up to others, because of our human nature. Our natural life is closed and wants to do everything on its own. We should have personal prayer, but there are many things in which we cannot get through with personal prayers. These things require that we pray with the brothers and sisters in order to get through. Hence, we must learn to be open persons, to open to the brothers and sisters, and to read the Bible, pray, and pursue the Lord together with others. Those who keep themselves closed cannot fellowship with the saints, and as a result, it is not easy for them to receive grace and grow. If we are open for fellowship with others, they will remember our problems in prayer.</p>
<p>The prayer of two or three gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name has the most authority. The Lord said, &ldquo;Truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens. For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst&rdquo; (Matt. 18:19-20). The Lord also said &ldquo;Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven&rdquo; (v. 18). Personal prayer does not have such authority. In any matter the strength of an individual is much smaller than the strength of many. This also applies to prayer; the prayer of several people together is very effectual. If we can practice this, it will afford much growth to the church.</p><h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>We must also make a resolution to preach the gospel. Christians must preach the gospel. A Christian who has never brought anyone to salvation has a spiritual problem. The fruit-bearing branches of a tree are an example. The branches that do not bear fruit are sick. Another example is that of people getting married and having children; when life grows to a certain point, it will produce offspring. This is normal. Because we are saved, we are branches of the Lord, the vine. Therefore, we must grow in life so that we can bear fruit. Every child of God should bring forth spiritual children. The apostle Paul did not have children in the flesh, but he had spiritual children, such as Timothy and Titus, whom he brought forth, raised, and taught in the Lord (1 Tim. 1:1-2; 2 Tim. 1:1-2; Titus 1:4). After a person is saved, he should not wait three to five years before bringing someone to the Lord. A believer who does this has a spiritual problem. Therefore, we must make a resolution to preach the gospel and bring at least one person to the Lord each year.</p>
<p>However, we should not be hasty. After we have the desire to preach the gospel, we should first pray to consecrate ourselves to the Lord. Second, we should make a list of our relatives and friends and pray for the ones who are not saved. If a relative or friend is not in our locality, we may write him a gospel letter and ask the saints in that locality to visit him and give him gospel tracts, books, or the Bible. This would help our relative or friend to be brought into that local church. If a relative or friend lives close to us, we should seek the Lord concerning how to visit him or to invite him for a meal. Our contact for the gospel should be in coordination with the saints. We should not be hasty, nor should we expect everyone to get saved immediately upon hearing the gospel. We just need to receive a burden from the Lord and then spend a year bringing one person to the Lord. If we are burdened to preach the gospel to a relative or friend whom we have not been in touch with, we must first build a little friendship with him. Do not rush into preaching the gospel. We should first establish a friendship and then slowly bring up the gospel or give him a few books. After a few months we can invite him for a meal and also invite two saints to speak with him. We should move slowly and wait until he has a taste for the Lord before inviting him to hear the gospel. Haste makes waste, and rushing may slow things down. As long as we can maintain our burden for him, pray for him, and work on him, he will get saved. If the saints are willing to do this, we will be able to bring the Chinese as well as the Americans to the Lord. If we will spend the time, our relatives and friends will be baptized.</p>
<p>People say that it is difficult to preach the gospel in America but easy in China, but this is not the case. A tree can grow and bear sweet fruit. However, a dead tree is not completely useless; as long as we work on it, we can make a good vessel or a tool out of it. I believe that it is not difficult to preach the gospel in America, but this depends on whether we are willing to make an effort. For thirty years when I went to the countryside in China, people would say that it was easier to preach the gospel in the city, but when I went to the city, people would say that it was easier to preach the gospel in the countryside. The Christians in both the countryside and the city had many excuses for not preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>In April 1942 I was in Tsingtao. When the brothers there heard that Chefoo was blessed, they said that Tsingtao was a dead city and could not be enlivened and that in the northern cities of Tientsin and Tsingtao everything but religion prospers; hence, they said it was difficult to preach the gospel. I knew this was an excuse to avoid preaching the gospel. There were around a hundred and thirty saints in Tsingtao. I gathered the saints and led them first to meet for several days and then to preach the gospel. As a result, from April to June we had six or seven baptismal meetings and baptized about two hundred. That year the number of people meeting in Tsingtao doubled. The gospel was later interrupted by the Second Sino-Japanese War, but after the victory was won, Tsingtao had a revival in 1948 and 1949, and more than seven hundred were baptized in one meeting. This shows that it is not difficult to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>The same happened in Shanghai. In 1942 the church in Shanghai had an internal problem, and at the same time the Japanese were forcing the church to join their false Christian organization. Because the church in Shanghai refused to join, it had to close down for more than three years. The breaking of bread did not resume until 1945, and there were only a little over a hundred people. After the victory of the Second Sino-Japanese War was won in 1946, the brothers wanted me to go to Shanghai. By the time I arrived in Shanghai, the saints in Shanghai had heard that the churches in the north had been blessed. However, when I mentioned preaching the gospel, they said that the northerners were simple and leisurely, and hence it was easier to preach the gospel to them, but the Shanghainese were sophisticated and busy, and hence it would not be easy for them to believe the gospel. Instead of arguing with them, I said, &ldquo;Let us try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We started meeting at the end of 1946 and had a gospel meeting at the beginning of the following year. I can testify that it was easy to preach the gospel. A multitude of people came to the first gospel meeting, and one to two hundred people were baptized. This happened more than once. By the summer of 1947, less than a year after we began preaching the gospel, the church in Shanghai had seventeen districts and over a thousand people. Therefore, we should never believe that it is difficult to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>The same thing happened in Hong Kong. I visited Hong Kong in 1948, and the church met upstairs in a small, quiet, and desolate building. In 1950 the church in Hong Kong still met upstairs in the same small, quiet, and desolate building. Brother Watchman Nee cabled me in Taiwan and asked me to go to Hong Kong. One evening I told the serving brothers that Hong Kong is a modern city, but our meeting place was in a small building with narrow stairs, and it was even difficult to find the doorbell. The meeting place had an old organ that had been donated to the church by a missionary before he went back to his country. The brothers said that they did not know Cantonese and that the Cantonese people were not open to those from their province. However, I said that we must preach the gospel to bring people in. When we did, the church in Hong Kong grew so large that it had to build a large meeting hall in order to accommodate everyone. The number of people kept increasing, and eventually even the new meeting hall was too small.</p>
<p>Everyone thinks that it is easy to preach the gospel in Taiwan. When we first arrived in Taiwan, people said it would not be easy to preach the gospel. They had all kinds of excuses, such as, the Taiwanese were not open to outsiders, and the mainlanders were not open because they had not yet settled down. These were words of cold water. Now, however, everyone says that it is easy to preach the gospel in Taiwan. These examples prove that it is easy to preach the gospel; it depends on whether we are willing. It is not difficult to preach the gospel in America either. The day will come when we will prove that it is easy to preach the gospel in America. Whether or not it is easy to preach the gospel, we must always receive the burden and make an effort. If we would receive the burden, look to the Lord, and make a resolution to bring one person to the Lord in a year, we will succeed. If a locality has fifty saints, it will have a hundred saints the following year, two hundred the year after, and four hundred the year after that. Such an increase would be marvelous. May we all respond to the Lord and make a resolution to bring people to salvation.</p>
<p>In regard to preaching the gospel, no one can boast of seniority; we must remind and incite one another. The church does not have a regulation of preaching the gospel, but we must care for one another and bring people into the church. If we are faithful, our number will double in one year. We should not think that it is too difficult; difficulty comes from Satan, the devil. Nothing is too hard for God (Jer. 32:17, ASV; Luke 1:37). As long as we are willing to make an effort, someone will be saved. We should preach the gospel to the Americans and bring them to salvation and into the church life. We should not work only on the Chinese in America. We are all sojourners in America; therefore, we should bring grace to the locals, and let them continue the work with us.</p>
<p>The results depend on whether we can carry out the gospel faithfully. May we make a resolution to practice these three important matters. Without such a resolution, we will merely be meeting year after year without pursuing the Lord, without growing in our knowledge of the Lord, without having more fellowship with the Lord, and without preaching the gospel. Eventually, our labor will not have much fruit. We cannot leave things to fate; we must rise up and do our best. Our effort determines how much God will bless us, and our response determines how much grace we will experience. The Lord has already given us grace; therefore, instead of making more excuses, we should receive the Lord&rsquo;s grace and eat joyously and be satisfied. These are not matters of doctrine but of practice. Hence, we must make a resolution. Our resolution is our response to the Lord&rsquo;s grace. If we make a resolution and practice these matters, we will be blessed.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">PREACHING THE GOSPEL IN ONE ACCORD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE RECEIVING THE BURDEN<br />
TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>As Christians, we must preach the gospel. Every Christian has to preach the gospel. The primary reason for there being only a few saints in a local church is nearly always the neglect of preaching the gospel. If very few new believers are brought in after a period of time, it must be because the saints have neglected to preach the gospel. We should pray that the Lord would give us the burden to preach the gospel. Preaching the gospel does not depend on a method; it is a matter of burden. Preaching the gospel involves passing out tracts and contacting people. Even if people do not like the fact that we preach the gospel and do not receive us, we still need to find ways to continue preaching the gospel by passing out tracts and contacting people. As long as we preach the gospel steadfastly, people will eventually get saved.</p>
<p>Few people will get saved if we rely on monthly gospel meetings but do not preach the gospel in our daily life. Hence, we should preach the gospel and contact people in our daily life. There is a brother who had a strong burden for his supervisor, who was an unbeliever and also opposed the Lord. Nevertheless, the first thing this brother did every day at work was to put a gospel tract on his supervisor&rsquo;s desk. When the supervisor saw the gospel tract, he threw it away. But this brother continued to put a gospel tract on his supervisor&rsquo;s desk daily until his supervisor was eventually saved. When we preach the gospel, we need to speak and persistently bother people. Someone may oppose the gospel for many years but eventually be touched and saved.</p>
<p>Everyone, including the younger and the older saints, should receive the burden to preach the gospel. Whenever there is an opportunity, on any day of the week, we should preach the gospel to a few people. As long as the gospel is preached, people will be saved. Therefore, we must preach the gospel even if we do not have a burden. Having a formal monthly gospel meeting is better than doing nothing, but it is also possible to contact people street by street. When we start a new street, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, this land is dry. We commit this land to you. Pour down rain on this land today.&rdquo; By preaching the gospel, we water the land. If we preach the gospel again on the following day, we water the land some more. If we would only be concerned about regularly watering the land, there will certainly be some fruit in the end. In particular, the young brothers and sisters should receive this burden. Whether or not the church has a gospel meeting, they should always bring their classmates and friends to salvation. This is altogether a matter of burden.</p>
<p>For example, the saints in the church in Los Angeles are very burdened to speak about the ground of the church. They do not care whether people agree; the saints only care to speak to people and help them accept the ground of the church. Their speaking has produced a favorable result. We should not expect to do a great or quick work, nor should we expect to gain a large number of people. Instead, we should do a slow work. Our job is to preach the gospel, and people will be saved. Furthermore, if we have the burden to preach the gospel, the people we bring to salvation will likewise have the burden to preach the gospel, because everything brings forth fruit according to its kind.</p>
<p>We need to have a burden to bring our relatives and friends to salvation by any means. After they are saved, we should help them to have the same burden to contact people. If we would gain a few who would also contact their relatives and friends, the gospel will spread. After one year the number gained will grow from two to twenty. In another year the number will grow to forty. If these forty people have the burden for the gospel, the gospel will be prevalent in that locality. This is altogether a matter of the burden. Apparently, it is not easy to preach the gospel, but actually, it is not hard. The more we think that it is hard to preach the gospel, the harder it becomes. Eventually, no one will be willing to receive a burden when the responsible brothers decide to have a gospel meeting. As a result, the speaker will be unable to give a clear message, and few will hear the gospel. Eventually, the saints will be cold toward the gospel. This is a disservice to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT FEARING DIFFICULTIES<br />
WHEN PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Whether in Tsingtao, Shanghai, or Hong Kong, the saints in those places initially said that it was not easy to preach the gospel. However, when the church in Tsingtao rose up to preach the gospel, more than seven hundred people were baptized. Likewise, the church in Shanghai grew in number, and the number of district meetings increased. The church in Hong Kong had to purchase a piece of land and built a large meeting hall in order to accommodate the increase. Our problems related to the gospel originate from a lack of burden. It is impossible for people not to get saved if we would preach the gospel. We must receive the burden to preach until people believe in Jesus.</p>
<p>It is much easier for us to preach the gospel today than it was for the missionaries who went to China at the end of the Ching Dynasty. It was difficult for the missionaries to go to China to preach the gospel. At that time China was a closed culture. People in the countryside who saw missionaries entering a village would shout that the foreign devils had come. All the doors would be closed, and no one in the entire village would be seen on the street. It was useless for the missionaries to knock on the doors, because no one was willing to open the door. Hunter Corbett was a missionary sent from the United States by the Presbyterian Church. He was a learned and spiritual man who labored in the northeast part of Shangtung province for fifty-five years until he died at the age of eighty-five. He often traveled on a big horse and was able to preach the gospel in the native tongue of the local people. In those days one hundred Chinese coins strung together were called a diao. Mr. Corbett carried many diaos with him. The adults were embarrassed to ask for money, but the children had no problem begging. Mr. Corbett would distribute the coins as if he was bestowing grace. As long as people asked, he would give until the money he had run out. The children received him as their god of wealth, but the adults did not like him. They threw stones and dirt at him. Mr. Corbett, however, did not fear, nor did he shun them. He continued walking slowly. Over time the adults were touched because he never hit back. Gradually, the gospel spread. Missionary Corbett preached the gospel during the Boxer Rebellion. However, because he had a loving heart and showed great kindness toward the people, giving everything he had to them, even the Boxers said, &ldquo;Kill all the foreign devils, except for Missionary Corbett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Mr. Corbett and his co-workers first went to the countryside in Shantung province, as soon as they entered a village, all the doors would close. Eventually, Mr. Corbett and his co-workers learned to hide next to a door. When the people inside a house opened the door, Mr. Corbett and his co-workers would stick their staff into the doorway so that the door could not be closed. If the people cursed them, they would smile. If the people hit them, they would not hit back. Eventually, this softened people&rsquo;s hearts. The missionaries knew that the people in northern China ground their wheat; nearly every house had a mill room. It was a tiring task to grind at the mill. Therefore, when the missionaries entered into a house, they would run straight to the mill before they could be kicked out. Initially, the people let the missionaries grind. As their hearts softened, the people would bring water for the missionaries. This was an opportunity for the missionaries to speak. Eventually, the people were opened. Although it was difficult, the missionaries continued to preach in such a way, and eventually the gospel spread.</p>
<p>When the number of believers increased, the missionaries built schools and did not charge tuition. The missionaries even took care of the students&rsquo; food, lodging, and clothing, and gave them allowances to take home. Because the students were taught the words in the Bible, local preachers were raised up. After a little more than ten years, the first group of local evangelists were produced in China. This is how the door of the gospel was opened in China. It was not easy. Today we should have the same burden and spirit.</p>
<p>Hence, we need to pray for the saints so that they would continue steadfastly in the burden for the gospel and would not fear difficulties. The church in Los Angeles had the burden to preach the ground of the church, which is actually harder than preaching the gospel, among the Chinese Christians and also among the American Christians. Eventually, the people knew that there was a group of Christians from China speaking about the ground of the church. In the same principle, if we have a burden for the gospel, we would each bring one person to salvation every year. The most effective way for the students to preach the gospel to their classmates and to gain them is to befriend them. Do not develop friendships blindly; rather, make friends for the gospel. Young students are pure, but when they are in middle school, they are exposed to all kinds of secular ideologies. Our pure gospel is superior to any secular ideology. If we can make friends with our classmates and preach the gospel to them, it will be easy for them to receive the gospel.</p>
<p>This is how the brothers and sisters in the medical school of Cheeloo University in Jinan preached the gospel. The brothers and sisters loved the Lord in a pure way. However, the environment did not allow them to meet, so they held the table meeting at a graveyard. For the table meeting they put the bread and the cup on a stone table, and fifty or sixty of them sat on the ground. These saints gained more than one hundred medical students by preaching to their classmates. Later, in Beijing Union Medical College Hospital, the largest hospital in Beijing, the gospel was spread through some sisters who were nurses in the hospital. Many doctors were brought to salvation through these nurses. Preaching the gospel requires skill, but first of all we need to receive a burden and to pray. Then we need to ask the Lord to give us a way to contact people. If we would pray and then go out to preach the gospel, the Lord will do something, and people will believe.</p><h2 class="head1">ENDEAVORING TO GAIN NEW ONES</h2>
<p>Concerning our focus and the direction that we should take in the future, I have a heavy feeling within that we should not spend too much time and energy on the saints in the denominations. Rather, we should spend our time and energy on the Gentiles, that is, the unbelievers and those who are not clear about salvation. There are three benefits to doing so: First, if we bring one person to salvation, there will be one more citizen in the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom. This is an increase in His kingdom and the propagation of the work of His salvation. Second, it is easier to bring an unbeliever to salvation than it is to change a Christian. Third, our purpose in coming to the United States is to maintain the Lord&rsquo;s testimony by standing on the proper ground. If we want believers to deny the ground on which they meet, we might come into conflict with other groups.</p>
<p>It is not easy to change a Christian. This can be compared to remodeling a house instead of rebuilding it. This was our experience when we began the work in Taiwan. Because of the change in the political situation in China, many Christians went to Taiwan. These Christians had no choice but to come to our meetings, because they could not find their former denominations. On the one hand, they appreciated the spiritual help that we rendered, but on the other hand, they could not change their old practices. Every day we prayed for these Christians, hoping that they would change, but they did not change. They usually argued when we spoke with them. The new ones whom we gained, however, made much progress in one year. To lead Christians yields little result with twice the effort, but to lead new believers yields much result with half the effort. Therefore, it is more prudent for us to spend our time gaining new ones.</p>
<p>The Lord called us to come to the United States for the testimony of the ground. When a Christian comes in and sees that we have no other grounds, there might be conflict. There is always this danger when we bring someone in. If his eyes are not opened, he will argue with us about the work because he has different views, and such debates do not have clear conclusions. Our desire to lead him onward will be to no avail, and our effort will be of no effect. Instead, we should focus on preaching the gospel. Of course, we will not reject the Christians who come to us. Fishing involves taking the hook. We have the testimony of the church, so whoever wants to come may come. In relation to the unbelievers, we cannot hope that those who want to come will come; rather, we need to spend time to gain and lead new ones. The more new ones we save, the stronger our testimony will be. This constant addition of new ones will prove to the Christians that our practice of the ground is right. Eventually, the Christians will have a good impression of the ground of the church. Facts speak louder than words. By such a practice, we will double the result with half the effort. Therefore, we should focus our energy on actively gaining new believers, especially the local people.</p>
<p>The United States needs the gospel. If we cannot each bring one person to salvation every year, then we at least need to bring one person to salvation every three to four years. It is not acceptable for us not to bring someone to salvation in three to four years. Our neighbors, relatives, and friends are before our eyes; they are schools of fish. The students can make friends with their classmates and invite them to listen to the gospel. Some of us have been living in the United States for many years, but we have not brought anyone to salvation. There must be something wrong. If we would bring one person to salvation every four years, we could double our number every four years. The number of saints in the United States has increased over the past few years, but this increase has been primarily among Asians instead of among the local people.</p>
<p>If we do not preach the gospel, no one will be saved. If we do not increase, within a decade there will only be old people in the church. If no children are born in a family, that family has no hope, because it is without a next generation. Furthermore, if the members in a family are all fifty or sixty years old, everyone will be grumpy and peculiar. The atmosphere will be lifeless, and there will be no appetite or interest in anything. Our salvation is to receive the Lord&rsquo;s burden to preach the gospel and save souls. When we strive together with one mind to preach the gospel and save people, praying for people and taking care of new ones, those who did not have this mind will be of one mind, and those who were dead will be living. When we spend our time and energy to preach the gospel, the church will be of one mind.</p>
<p>This is Paul&rsquo;s word in Philippians regarding the blessed situation that the church should have in the furtherance of the gospel. Paul says, &ldquo;I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you, always in my every petition on behalf of you all, making my petition with joy, for your fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun in you a good work will complete it until the day of Christ Jesus&rdquo; (1:3-6). And in verse 27 Paul says, &ldquo;Only, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether coming and seeing you or being absent, I may hear of the things concerning you, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together along with the faith of the gospel.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE OF THE BRANCHES OF THE VINE<br />
BEARING FRUIT</h2>
<p>We are the branches, and the Lord is the vine; hence, we should bear fruit (John 15:5). A branch that does not bear fruit should be cut off. Verse 2 says, &ldquo;Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit.&rdquo; The phrase <em>takes it away</em> does not refer to perishing in the lake of fire but to losing one&rsquo;s fellowship with the Lord and with the saints. If the branches of the vine remain on the vine, the sap of the vine will flow into the branches, and the branches will have fellowship with the vine and with the other branches. However, once a branch is cut off, the fellowship is interrupted. If we do not preach the gospel properly and do not bring anyone to salvation in eight or ten years, we are like a branch that does not bear fruit, and we will lose our fellowship with the Lord. On the contrary, if we preach the gospel zealously and bring people to salvation every year, we will spontaneously have much fellowship with the Lord and with the saints.</p>
<p>There are a few things we must practice in order to preach the gospel and bear fruit. First, we need to pray, confessing our sins and asking the Lord to forgive our barrenness. Second, we need to make a list of our relatives, classmates, colleagues, neighbors, and acquaintances, and we should fellowship with the saints for the Lord&rsquo;s leading to either visit the ones on our list, write to them, or invite them for a meal so that they can hear the testimonies of the saints. If we would do this, our number would double quickly. The success of a task depends on how much effort we put into it. If there is no effort, there will be no results. If we do not preach the gospel, God will have no way to do anything. If we preach the gospel, He will work. Third, we need to consecrate ourselves to the Lord again for this matter. After we make a list of names, we will have the burden to contact the ones on our list. If we cannot contact them every day, we can at least contact them once a month. This is the most effective way to preach the gospel. Then it will be easy to invite our relatives and friends to come to a gospel meeting of the church. Fourth, we need to rely on the church. Without the church, we cannot preach the gospel. Therefore, we must have the church life; we must love one another and coordinate in service with the saints. This is our testimony.</p>
<p>Acts 2:44-47 says, &ldquo;All those who believed were together and had all things common; and they sold their properties and possessions and divided them to all, as anyone had need. And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart, praising God and having grace with all the people. And the Lord added together day by day those who were being saved.&rdquo; This indicates that in the early church life the saints lived and coordinated together and loved one another. This is the genuine ground of oneness that allowed the Lord to add new believers. The church life is not attending Sunday service and listening to a message every week and then living a separate life at home. Our church life should be the same as the situation in Acts. Although we cannot repeat what happened in Acts, we should love one another and coordinate with one another. You care for me, and I care for you. You support me, and I support you. The gospel that is most worthy of being spread in today&rsquo;s society is to care for one another and love one another in the Lord. When our relatives and friends see how we care for the saints and how the saints care for us, their hearts will be easily touched.</p>
<p>John 15:12 says, &ldquo;This is My commandment, that you love one another even as I have loved you&rdquo;; 13:35 says, &ldquo;By this shall all men know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another&rdquo;; and 17:21 and 23 say, &ldquo;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me...That they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me.&rdquo; In the genuine church life the saints bear one another&rsquo;s burdens, help with one another&rsquo;s problems, and consider one another, thus manifesting a certain kind of testimony. This is a very moving gospel. Our preaching of the gospel is not merely to give a message and then ask people to become members. No, we have the word of the gospel, and we also have a living that testifies to the ground of oneness. If we lack such a church life, it will be hard for our preaching of the gospel to be effective.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL BY THE CHURCH<br />
BEGINNING WITH THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>In order to preach the gospel, the church must have the one accord and strive together with one mind. The one accord and the striving together with one mind are our church life. I believe that if we can each live the church life, the gospel will spread very quickly. We must continue to preach the gospel. There should not be only old faces in the church; there must be new faces added all the time. We are fishers of men (Matt. 4:19; Mark 1:17), so we need to go fishing. We are also laboring farmers (2 Tim. 2:6), so we need to till the land, sow seeds, and gather the produce. The church will be poor if we do not go fishing or labor on the land. In order for the church to be rich in saints, spiritual gifts, and even material riches, we must preach the gospel. The church will be rich if we bring all kinds of people to salvation by preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>There must be children in a household. Without children, without offspring, a household is doomed no matter how rich or poor it may be. A person with many children may be poor now, but if one child later becomes successful, the household will flourish. Our children are our future and our hope. The more children there are, the more hope there is. If we have only the current brothers and sisters without new ones, we will eventually be like a lonely old man. In order to grow, new ones must be brought in. A growing society must have new blood. A society has no future if there are only old people. Likewise, we must preach the gospel and bring new ones into the church life. As long as new ones are coming in, the church will not become old. If we have both new ones and old ones, the church will be prosperous and full of hope.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">LOVING THE LORD TO RECEIVE REVELATION<br />
AND TAKE ACTION</h1>
<p>John 20:1-18 is concerning the Lord&rsquo;s appearing to Mary the Magdalene after His resurrection. &ldquo;Now on the first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene came early to the tomb while it was yet dark and saw the stone taken away from the tomb. She ran therefore and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him. Peter therefore went forth, as well as the other disciple, and came to the tomb. And the two ran together, yet the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter and came first to the tomb. And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there; however, he did not enter. Then Simon Peter also came, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he beheld the linen cloths lying there and the handkerchief which had been over His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in one place apart. At that time therefore the other disciple also, who came first to the tomb, entered, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that He had to rise from the dead. The disciples therefore went away again to their own home. But Mary stood outside at the tomb weeping. Then as she wept, she stooped to look into the tomb and beheld two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. And they said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him. When she said these things, she turned backward and beheld Jesus standing there, yet she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking? She, supposing that He was the gardener, said to Him, Sir, if You have carried Him away, tell me where You have laid Him, and I will take Him away. Jesus said to her, Mary! She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, Rabboni! (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God. Mary the Magdalene came, announcing to the disciples, I have seen the Lord, and that He had said these things to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This portion reveals a person who loved the Lord and sought Him. There are three key points in this portion. First, this person was attracted by the Lord to love Him. Second, the issue of loving the Lord was a new discovery, a new revelation, concerning the Lord. Third, this lover of the Lord took action based on the new revelation that she received from loving the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ATTRACTED BY THE LORD TO LOVE HIM</h2>
<p>The four Gospels show that not many people appreciated or loved the Lord Jesus when He began His ministry. People were touched by His words and revered Him because of His miracles, but not many people had a loving response to the Lord. In other words, not many people were attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love when He began His ministry. At the end of the Gospels, however, there were a few people who had been attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love and had an inner response to His love. The Lord&rsquo;s love was a like strong magnet that drew people to Him. In the Lord&rsquo;s last journey on earth He went to Jerusalem. For three and a half years the Lord&rsquo;s work had been contrary to the Jewish tradition; hence, the atmosphere in Jerusalem was against Him. What the Lord did on the earth was also incompatible with earthly politics. Eventually, the Jewish rulers, the Herodians, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the rulers of the Roman government all joined forces to oppose the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was a lowly carpenter from Galilee, but His words and deeds in the three and a half years of His ministry caused an intense reaction in the land of Judea. We may say that He upset the whole Jewish society. Many people were moved by Him, many were helped by Him, and many feared Him. The rulers of the Jewish society were very jealous and opposed Him because He had an indescribable attracting power. When we read the four Gospels, we can sense that the atmosphere in Jerusalem was against the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus died on the cross during the Jewish Passover. According to the custom of the Jews, every male was required to go to Jerusalem to keep the feast. Because the Jewish rulers had conspired to kill Jesus while He was in Jerusalem to keep the feast, this talk spread through the Jewish society before the Lord Jesus arrived in Jerusalem (John 11:55-57). Being a man of God, the Lord Jesus was neither dismayed nor intimidated; rather, He obeyed God&rsquo;s will and went up to Jerusalem. The disciples sensed the atmosphere and knew that it was dangerous to go up to Jerusalem (Mark 10:32). The disciples would not have dared to follow the Lord into Jerusalem had they not been attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love. This shows that the disciples were attracted by the Lord.</p>
<p>For three and a half years the Lord Jesus&rsquo; deeds attracted a few people, including some women, to love Him (15:40-41). According to Jewish custom, only the males had to go up to Jerusalem three times a year to keep the major feasts&mdash;the Feast of the Passover, the Feast of Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles. The women did not have to go up to Jerusalem. Hence, it sufficed for Peter, James, and John to go up to Jerusalem with the Lord Jesus. The women did not have to go; it might seem superfluous for the women to go up to Jerusalem. But these women were attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Some of these women were probably clearer than Peter, James, and John that the Lord would be arrested and put to death. The women understood that it was their last opportunity to contact the Lord and were reluctant to leave Him; thus, they accompanied the Lord to Jerusalem together with the disciples. The atmosphere in Jerusalem was antagonistic toward the Lord Jesus, but these women did not fear the threatening situation; instead, they followed the Lord Jesus because they were attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Six days before the Passover, the Lord Jesus went to Bethany. As He reclined at table, Mary came with an alabaster flask of costly pure nard, broke it, and poured the ointment over Him (Matt. 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8). Mary poured out her love on the Lord Jesus because she was attracted by His love.</p>
<p>Even though the atmosphere was against the Lord Jesus when He was on the cross, one of His disciples, Joseph from Arimathea, dared to ask Pilate for His body. Furthermore, Nicodemus, who had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes. Joseph from Arimathea and Nicodemus took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, according to the burying custom of the Jews (19:38-40). They did this because they were attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Even after the Lord Jesus was buried, Mary the Magdalene was so attracted by His love that she had to go to His tomb. Everyone else went home, but she went to the tomb to find the Lord. On the first day of the week, the third day after the Lord Jesus had been buried, Mary the Magdalene went to the tomb early, while it was yet dark (20:1). She did not go there to work; she went because she was attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love. She loved and missed the Lord so much that she could not help but go to His tomb. Mary&rsquo;s going early, while it was yet dark, shows that she loved the Lord and missed Him so much that she did not wait until daylight. She eagerly went to the Lord&rsquo;s tomb early in the morning with the hope of finding her Lord.</p>
<p>May we all see this picture. People followed the Lord Jesus to an antagonistic place, poured precious ointment upon Him before His death, followed Him all the way to the cross, requested the Lord&rsquo;s body, and anointed and buried it in the midst of a frightful atmosphere, because they were attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love. It was because of this love that a sister went while it was still dark to find her Lord in the tomb.</p><h2 class="head1">LOVING THE LORD TO RECEIVE REVELATION<br />
CONCERNING HIM</h2>
<p>There is an issue to having a loving heart and a loving response to the Lord. Something happens to those who love the Lord. Every lover of the Lord gains new knowledge, a new revelation. The disciples knew that the Lord had died and was buried, but they did not understand that He would rise from the dead. Their knowledge of the Lord included His death and burial. Peter and John knew the Lord only in His death and burial. Therefore, they could speak about the Lord being born in a manger, preaching, performing miracles, teaching crowds, manifesting His love, and being crucified and buried in a tomb.</p>
<p>Mary the Magdalene was a sister who loved the Lord, and the Lord gave her a discovery because she loved Him. Mary saw that the stone was taken away from the tomb (v. 1) and thought that someone had taken the Lord out of the tomb. Hence, she ran to tell Peter and John (v. 2). Because she had a new discovery, new knowledge, she had a new truth to proclaim and a new revelation to convey to others. Others had old truth concerning the Lord Jesus, but only Mary received new revelation. This new revelation came from her love for the Lord. A person who loves the Lord will receive new knowledge concerning the Lord. If we love the Lord more than others, we will surely know Him more than others. There were many disciples, but no one saw the Lord&rsquo;s empty tomb before Mary the Magdalene did, because she loved the Lord very much. She must have felt perplexed when she saw the empty tomb and asked why He was gone. As soon as she made this new discovery, she went to tell Peter and John.</p>
<p>After hearing Mary&rsquo;s story, the two brothers realized that this was something new and immediately ran to see (v. 3). Their love for the Lord was not as burning as Mary&rsquo;s love for the Lord, but they still loved the Lord; they were not indifferent. The two disciples ran, but one was faster and the other was slower. John, who arrived first at the tomb, did not go in but waited for Peter, who arrived second, to enter the tomb (vv. 4-6). These two disciples were pursuing the Lord together, but one was ahead and the other was behind. John was ahead but was satisfied to reach the mark. Peter was behind but continued to move forward. Thus, the first became the last, and the last became the first. These details portray our own pursuit of the Lord.</p>
<p>Mary and the two disciples pursued the Lord. Mary was ahead but was afraid of entering into the tomb. She needed the help of Peter and John. They were bolder and entered directly into the tomb to investigate. However, they were clear as soon as they stepped into the tomb. They saw the linen cloths lying there and the handkerchief, which had been over His head, folded apart from the linen cloths (vv. 6-7), and they immediately knew that the Lord had resurrected. It was very clear. The disciples saw and believed (v. 8). But because they did not yet understand the Scripture, that the Lord had to rise from the dead, they went away again to their own home (vv. 9-10). These two disciples had a clear mind, but their love was not hot; therefore, they were satisfied with seeing the empty tomb. Mary, however, loved the Lord so much that she was not satisfied with seeing the empty tomb. She still wanted to find her Lord.</p>
<p>Loving the Lord is a strength of the sisters. Mary loved the Lord, saw the empty tomb, but was not satisfied. She wanted to see the Lord. The tomb was empty, and it was obvious that the Lord had resurrected. The disciples should have celebrated and rejoiced. But Mary loved the Lord so much that it was painful for her to not be able to find the Lord. It was as if she would rather have seen the Lord&rsquo;s dead body than know that He had resurrected. Because she yearned to see the Lord, she stood outside at the tomb and wept (v. 11). Her action seems to be very foolish, but it indicates that she was truly attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Mary, a foolish lover of the Lord, not only found the empty tomb but also gained the fresh appearing of the Lord Jesus after resurrection. After rising from the dead, the Lord appeared to Mary first, even before He ascended into the presence of the Father (vv. 14, 17). Mary was the first person in the universe to taste the freshness of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. The Lord appeared to her because she loved Him desperately; the Lord had no choice but to appear to her. The Lord was supposed to ascend to God immediately after His resurrection, but because of Mary&rsquo;s desperate love for Him, He had no choice but to appear to her. Hence, our love for the Lord results in our receiving new revelations and making new discoveries concerning the Lord. By loving the Lord, we can gain His fresh appearing. Those who are clear-minded do not have this kind of experience.</p>
<p>I have met some intelligent, highly educated, and knowledgeable scientists and philosophers. They can converse freely on any subject matter, but they are confounded when it comes to the things of the Lord Jesus. I have also met successful businessmen who are knowledgeable and full of insight in matters related to running a business. They are genuine believers in the Lord, but they are confounded when it comes to the things of the Lord Jesus. There are also some older sisters in the church who are illiterate and uneducated, but they love the Lord very much. They do not understand philosophy or science, nor do they know how to run a business, but they genuinely understand the things of the Lord Jesus and spiritual principles. They are completely different from the brothers. These sisters have spiritual understanding. They may not read the Bible, but what they say about the verses that they know is full of light and life. The Lord is very intimate with them. Their spiritual understanding is the result of their pure love for the Lord.</p>
<p>When a person loves the Lord, his spiritual understanding is opened. Hence, those who love the Lord receive new revelations and make new discoveries of the Lord. No one thought to look for the Lord Jesus after His resurrection, but Mary was the first person to see Him. When Mary met the Lord, she did not know that it was the Lord. The person she was looking for stood in front of her and said, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?&rdquo; (v. 15). She heard the Lord&rsquo;s voice but did not recognize Him. She was blinded by love. Supposing that the person speaking with her was a gardener, she said, &ldquo;Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away&rdquo; (v. 15). Mary was speaking with the resurrected Lord, but she did not seem to know Him. A genuine seeker of the Lord will see light and receive revelation, but he may not think that he sees light or that he has received revelation. This is a genuine experience of seeing light and receiving revelation. Some people proclaim loudly that they have seen great light, when in fact they have not seen anything. If we see something but doubt what we have seen, we may have received light and revelation.</p>
<p>Mary was blinded until Jesus said, &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; Then she turned and said to Him in Hebrew, &ldquo;Rabboni!&rdquo; (v. 16). Mary must have recognized the Lord&rsquo;s voice when He called her name. She had heard Him call her name for the past three years. Hence, she knew that it was the Lord and wanted to touch Him. However, the Lord said to her, &ldquo;Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God&rdquo; (v. 17). After His resurrection and before ascending to the Father and presenting the freshness of His resurrection to the Father, the Lord Jesus appeared first to Mary, who loved Him. Then the Lord charged Mary to go to the brothers and tell them what He had said to her.</p><h2 class="head1">RECEIVING REVELATION TO TAKE ACTION</h2>
<p>There are three key points in the account of Mary seeing the Lord Jesus. First, Mary the Magdalene was attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love. Second, because Mary loved the Lord, she gained a new discovery, new knowledge, and new revelation concerning the Lord, and she also experienced the Lord&rsquo;s new appearing. Third, Mary, a lover of the Lord, took action based on the revelation that she had received. Mary&rsquo;s action was based on her discovery and revelation. Mary was the first one to discover the empty tomb. After she made this discovery, she took action by running to tell the brothers (v. 2). She was also the first one to see the resurrected Lord. After seeing the resurrected Lord, she went to tell the brothers what the Lord had said to her, according to His charge (vv. 17-18). Mary&rsquo;s action was based on her knowledge of the Lord and was according to the revelation she had received from the Lord.</p>
<p>When we speak of preaching the gospel or of living the church life, we are not promoting outward practices, because outward practices do not yield much success and are not of much value. Our actions must be because the Lord has attracted us again with His love and because we are willing to respond yet again to the Lord in love. When we respond to the Lord in love, we will gain new knowledge and make new discoveries concerning the Lord, and we will receive a burden and a commission from the Lord. We will know what the Lord desires to do and what He wants us to do. Therefore, we must spend time with the Lord every day. To rise up early and draw near to the Lord is not a regulation; rather, we love to rise up early to seek the Lord and come forward into His presence because we are attracted by His love. This is our response to His love. Even if we would make a resolution to be revived every morning, we should rise up with the feeling and sentiment of loving the Lord, just as Mary did. Mary&rsquo;s going to the Lord&rsquo;s tomb early in the morning was the best morning revival. This is a pattern for all the saints to follow in their morning revival.</p>
<p>Keeping morning revival should not be turned into a regulation. No one should be forced to keep it, nor should anyone feel obligated to keep it because everyone else is keeping it. The practice of morning revival is before the Lord. We love the Lord, and our goal is to approach Him, just as Mary went to find the Lord early in the morning. Our time for morning revival is for us to rise up early and appear before the Lord with the desire to see Him face to face. If we will rise up early to meet the Lord in the morning, we will receive fresh revelation concerning the Lord and receive a new mission and a new commission. We will be revolutionized within. There is something wrong with our morning revival if there is no change in our living after two months of reading the Bible and praying during our morning revival. It is impossible for a person to have no change in his living after keeping a time for morning revival for two months. A person must change when he meets the Lord, because the Lord will work in his being and teach him many lessons. When a person draws near to the Lord and sees the Lord, he will definitely be revolutionized. Such a person will mourn, grieve, repent, confess his sins, and feel convicted regarding his past. His temper and disposition will be dealt with, and he will experience a new revival. Then the Lord will give him a new burden and fresh feelings, enabling him to care about the affairs of the saints and of the church. This is the result of rising up early to draw near to the Lord.</p>
<p>When we rise up early to draw near to the Lord, we need to allow Him to touch us, our habits, and our preferences. When we draw near to Him, He will touch our love and our heart. He wants us to love what He loves and to hate what He hates. If we love something that He does not love, He will contend with us so that we have no peace, because He is a jealous God. If we would have such fellowship with the Lord, we will experience His work and receive the dealings from Him. If we do not practice morning revival or if we do it casually, the Lord will not be able to touch us. Then even if we do not commit gross sins, we will often be negligent of our minor mistakes. The meetings will become a pastime in which we watch others sing and pray, and we will listen to messages as if we were watching a show. The Lord will not have any effect in us, and we will be of no use in His hand.</p>
<p>If we keep a time for morning revival with a heart that genuinely loves the Lord, many things will follow. If we draw near to the Lord every morning, He will not let us go. He will not allow us to be an inappropriate or improper Christian. The Lord will thoroughly inquire about everything in our being; He will not cease until we are fully subdued. If we genuinely practice morning revival, we will have new knowledge, new discoveries, new visions, and new revelations concerning the Lord; we will also receive new dealings from the Lord. This is the meaning of meeting the Lord and touching Him. After He deals with us, He will give us a commission and a burden, and this burden will become our mission. A burden is a heavy weight within that presses us down and does not let us go so that we have no peace until we carry out God&rsquo;s charge. Those who meet the Lord receive burdens.</p>
<p>Pursuing to know the Lord, fellowshipping with Him, and preaching the gospel must not become regulations to keep. Please do not consider this fellowship as a doctrine. Rather, we should respond in love to the Lord because we have been attracted by His love. May we all have the prayer of <em>Hymns,</em> #368: &ldquo;More love to Thee, O Lord, / More love to Thee! / Hear Thou the prayer I make / On bended knee; / This is my earnest plea: / More love, O Lord, to Thee, / More love to Thee, / More love to Thee!&rdquo; May the Lord grant such hunger and desperation to motivate us to draw near to Him. If we do not draw near to Him, we will be hungry and thirsty within, and we will not be able to go on or be satisfied. If we rise up early to draw near to the Lord daily, the Lord will meet us. We will have new discoveries of the Lord and receive many dealings in His hand. If we pass through these dealings in His presence, we will receive a burden for His work. Then others will not need to beg us to preach the gospel, because we will be burdened for the gospel and also compelled to preach the gospel.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">DEALING WITH THE NATURAL CONSTITUTION<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP</h1>
<p>The purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation is to build up the church as the Body of Christ. Hence, we must have the concept that we need to be built up. In terms of calling, we need to grow unto maturity. In terms of building, we need to be built up into the dwelling place of God. Growing unto maturity is related to life. Birds can fly because they have a flying life. It is possible and easy to fly with the bird life, but it is extremely difficult to fly without the bird life. The growing processes spoken of in the Bible, such as sanctification and renewing, are a matter of life; they are part of the process of growth in life. It is possible to grow with the life of God, but it is not possible to grow without the life of God. After we receive the life of God, we need to grow in this life unto maturity. We also need to be built up in this life into the dwelling place of God in order to accomplish the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE MIXTURE OF<br />
THE NATURAL CONSTITUTION</h2>
<p>For building we need to allow the Lord to touch our natural constitution. Some Christians do not love the Lord and are not zealous, but some love the Lord zealously. Among the Christians who love the Lord zealously, some love the Lord and seek Him in a pure way. Mary the Magdalene was such a person. She truly loved the Lord, and her love was not mixed with the natural or selfish element. She had a pure desire to find the Lord. Therefore, people regarded her as foolish. There are also Christians who love the Lord zealously according to their natural taste and preference. Such people love the Lord, but their love is mixed with a natural element; it is not pure. As a result, their love for the Lord is void of revelation and cannot build up the church; rather, it can create problems.</p>
<p>Some people are constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love and respond zealously with the desire to serve the Lord and labor for Him. However, because their heart is not pure, they want to be at the top and love to be a leader. This is the mixture of their naturalness. The service of the church is a test to the purity of our love for the Lord. Some people are naturally independent. They can love the Lord individually but cannot love the Lord together with others. Some people naturally like to take the lead. Such ones love the Lord zealously when they take the lead, but they stop loving the Lord and lose their zeal when they come into the church and are not given the opportunity to take the lead. If the church does not give them the position of a leader, they will cause trouble in the church. This is very serious.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROBLEMS CAUSED BY OUR NATURAL TASTE</h2>
<p>It may be harder for those who love the Lord with their naturalness to see light and receive revelation than for those who do not love the Lord. This is seen in the examples of Paul and Martha. Before his salvation Paul did not love the Lord; he even opposed and attacked the Lord Jesus. However, God had mercy on him. While he was on his way to Damascus, he saw light and received revelation (Acts 9:1-6). Martha loved the Lord and diligently labored and served Him. She was unable to receive the Lord&rsquo;s revelation, not because she was too busy but because she held on to her own opinions and taste. She was strong in her naturalness. She rebuked the Lord for not understanding that she was toiling in service (Luke 10:40), and she complained that the Lord did not come on time to heal her brother Lazarus (John 11:21). Martha loved the Lord according to her natural taste, and she wanted the Lord to do things according to her will. As a result, she was unable to hear the Lord&rsquo;s words or receive His revelation when He said that He is the resurrection and the life and that Lazarus would rise again (vv. 23-27).</p>
<p>We should not think that those who are quiet are Marys but that those who are busy running around are Marthas. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things&rdquo; (Luke 10:41). Martha&rsquo;s problem, however, was not that she was busy but that she was busy according to her natural taste. When some people do not love the Lord, they leave everyone else alone, but when they love the Lord, the whole church has to follow their taste and be subject to their control. They will complain if the church is not under their control. This was Martha&rsquo;s problem. It is not wrong to be busy, nor is it right to be quiet. We need to ask whether our being quiet or being busy is according to our natural taste or according to the Lord&rsquo;s command. If the Lord commands us to be busy, it is right to be busy. If the Lord commands us to be quiet, it is right to be quiet. Whether we are busy or quiet, we will cause trouble in the church if we love the Lord with our naturalness. This is the most common problem among Christians today.</p>
<p>When some Christians are zealous, a new sect is formed. For example, a brother who has a natural taste for foot-washing may demand that others practice foot-washing according to his taste. This brother may love the Lord zealously and sacrifice his time, spend his energy, and offer material riches to the church but insist on foot-washing and ask the elders to lead the whole congregation to wash each other&rsquo;s feet. If the elders cannot agree to his demand, he may form a sect that practices foot-washing. Never think that we do not have such a natural preference. Every person has his own taste. We are willing to love the Lord, but we often require the saints to do things according to our will and to serve according to our taste. Some people boldly say that they will accomplish great things if they become elders in the church. This is an expression of their natural taste. If such persons become elders, they will not serve according to the Lord&rsquo;s will but according to their own taste. As a result, they will create problems in the church.</p>
<p>When someone loves the Lord zealously according to his own taste, it is hard for him to see light and to receive revelation. Such a person holds on to his own taste and condemns others. There was a brother from Shanhsi who loved the Lord zealously, but his taste was to preach the gospel. No matter what the occasion was, he would speak about preaching the gospel. At the table meeting he did not care whether the saints were remembering the Lord or worshipping the Father; he would give a long prayer and preach the gospel in his prayer. Later the saints became frustrated, and a few elders fellowshipped with him to focus on remembering the Lord at the table meeting and to pray according to the atmosphere in the meeting. This brother refused to receive the fellowship and continued to preach the gospel in the table meeting. Eventually, the elders had no choice but to say, &ldquo;Even if you feel that you are justified, we would still like to ask you to not pray in such a way in the next table meeting.&rdquo; But at the next table meeting he prayed, &ldquo;Lord, the responsible brothers do not want me to pray, but no one else will pray, so I have no choice but to pray. You died for sinners. You visit men. You love sinners.&rdquo; Later, this brother left the church and started broadcasting the gospel on a radio station. Even though this was not very effective, his zeal was satisfied. This is what it means to love the Lord according to one&rsquo;s natural taste, caring only for the self and no one else. Such zealous love for the Lord is unlikely to last long, but if it is long lasting, it will cause other problems or bring trouble to the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BREAKING OF THE NATURAL CONSTITUTION<br />
BY THE CROSS<br />
FOR THE GENUINE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>For us to be built up together in the church, we must have a pure love for the Lord and accept the purging of the cross so that the Lord can deal with our natural taste. Mary did not know much, but her love for the Lord was pure, without the mixture of her personal taste. The more a person loves the Lord and fellowships with Him, the more the Lord will appear to him and deal with him. This is the experience portrayed in Song of Songs. In chapter 1 the seeker is likened to a mare among Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariots (v. 9). This indicates that her natural strength is very strong. Hence, she needs to be stripped and dealt with by the Lord in order to be delivered from her own taste.</p>
<p>In chapter 2 she continues to seek and love the Lord, and she gains satisfaction and a degree of rest from His presence (v. 3). However, she begins to love the strong feeling of His presence. Hence, she is tried and dealt with by losing the sensation of the Lord&rsquo;s presence. The seeker is in the house, but the Lord is outside leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills (v. 8). The seeker cannot stay within her house if she wants to respond to the Lord. The Lord wants us to come out of our own condition. This is a kind of spiritual stripping and dealing.</p>
<p>In chapter 3 the Lord requires His seeker to be delivered from the self and from focusing on the feeling of His presence. Therefore, He turns away from the seeker, and she seeks Him whom her soul loves but finds Him not (v. 1). This trial forces her to rise up and seek the Lord everywhere (v. 2). Often those who love the Lord have their own spiritual taste, but the Lord requires them to be delivered from their self and their natural constitution when He appears to them. If we remain in our self, we will face problems on the path of loving and pursuing the Lord. We cannot love the Lord according to our own taste.</p>
<p>When the Lord first came out to minister, no one loved Him. Then the disciples developed a loving response to Him. They were lovers of the Lord. However, they needed to be stripped and dealt with because they each had their own taste and element. Peter loved the Lord, but when he heard that the Lord would be killed and would be raised on the third day, he immediately rebuked the Lord, saying, &ldquo;God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!&rdquo; (Matt. 16:22). This was Peter&rsquo;s naturalness. Hence, the Lord dealt with Peter in a strong way, saying, &ldquo;Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men...If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me&rdquo; (vv. 23-24). Peter had his own taste, and James, John, Martha, and Mary also had their own tastes. Our love for the Lord must be dealt with by the Lord; otherwise, we will not be freed from our strong, natural taste at the end of our journey of following the Lord, even though we have paid the price and spent our energy. It is even possible that one day we will lose our love and be unable to go on if we can love the Lord only according to our taste.</p>
<p>In the Gospels every follower of the Lord had a different natural flavor. At the beginning of Acts the one hundred and twenty were willing to pay the price and drop their personal tastes. I do not believe that these one hundred and twenty were the only ones who believed in the Lord at that time. However, these one hundred and twenty had learned the lesson and had been dealt with. Mary the Magdalene, Martha, and Mary the mother of Jesus were among these people who had been led by the Lord, had been dealt with by Him, had learned the lesson, and did not have many opinions. Hence, so many could come together to pray in one accord for ten days (Acts 1:12-15). This was the issue of being stripped of their natural constitution and having their taste dealt with. As a result, Peter was a different person when he stood up to speak, and he expounded the Bible with clarity and understanding. The disciples were like one man; no one voiced his own opinion (vv. 15-26). It was not that Peter became the pope and practiced dictatorship; rather, everyone was freed from their natural tastes because they had learned the lesson, and their natural constitution had been dealt with by the Lord. This experience of the one hundred and twenty was the genuine church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING GENUINE IN OUR MORNING TIME<br />
WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>As those who desire to have a genuine and pure love for the Lord and to be without opinions and natural tastes, we should rise up early, come to the Lord in purity, and spend time with Him. We should meet Him in a genuine way to be touched by Him and to allow Him to work in us. A brother may have consecrated himself in the past and yet feel the need to consecrate himself again while spending time with the Lord in the morning. A sister may be high-minded, but while she is spending time with the Lord in the morning, she may see that she is at fault and is more sinful than others. A brother who serves the Lord zealously may have always followed his own will and never answered the Lord&rsquo;s call. It is not until he is touched by the Lord, who makes some demands of him, that he will understand the Lord&rsquo;s intention and will answer the Lord&rsquo;s call. If we rise up early to touch the Lord and enjoy Him, our spiritual experience will become deeper and more genuine, and the experience of our salvation will be deeper and more solid. We will sense that every consecration is deeper and more genuine. Therefore, our time of meeting with the Lord in the morning is a time for us to be saved again.</p>
<p>Some of the young saints heard the gospel in their childhood because their parents zealously love the Lord. These saints believed in the Lord and began to love Him from their childhood. However, they cannot specify at what point in time they were saved. They believe in the Lord, but they may not have touched the Lord experientially. This may be the case with their experience of believing in the Lord for salvation as well as their experience of consecration. Many saints were led by their parents to consecrate themselves to the Lord while they were still young and were also taught to pray at home. Their parents offered them to the Lord, and they said Amen. They were also taught to consecrate themselves in the children&rsquo;s meetings and were baptized. Then every summer they were helped to consecrate themselves again and again during the young people&rsquo;s edification conferences. These experiences are not wrong, but some of these consecrations were the result of being taught; they might not be the issue of meeting the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must rise up early to seek the Lord and touch Him. When we touch the Lord, the opaque and unclear experiences from our childhood will become transparent and clear. A consecration that formerly was the result of outward teaching will become an inner requirement after we touch the Lord. Only when we contact the Lord and spend time with Him can we have a genuine beginning in our spiritual experiences. The teachings that we received in our childhood were helpful, but genuine experiences can be gained only when we meet the Lord in a personal way.</p>
<p>When a person meets the Lord, he will sense something fresh. When a person meets the Lord, he will sense that his faith was not solid and that his former consecration was not deep enough. He knew that he was a sinner, but when he meets the Lord, he will sense that he is the foremost of sinners. He knew that he should preach the gospel before, but when he meets the Lord, preaching the gospel will become a genuine burden. When the Lord touches our inner being, we receive a burden. Such experiences are gained by meeting the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIPPING WITH THE LORD IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Concerning coming together for morning revival, there are a few things that we need to pay attention to. First, we should not turn morning revival into a teaching or regulation by requiring everyone to attend. Only when we have a heart to seek the Lord can we meet Him in morning revival. Second, we should ask the saints to read the Bible and give them adequate time to pray-read in spirit. We should not repeat doctrine. The elderly saints do not need to show off their seniority by giving a message. This will disrupt the morning revival. Those who speak must have inspiration from the Lord. Third, we should not consider morning revival as a meeting and therefore arrange for people to pray or to speak a message in order to fill up the time. It is better not to fill the time with speaking. If no one speaks, the saints should quietly read the Bible and pray before the Lord. Morning revival is not a Sunday service in which someone must give a message. Rather, morning revival is our looking to the Lord and quietly seeking Him together so that He may speak to us and give us spiritual milk. We must learn to always pray with our spirit. If we receive a word or inspiration from the Lord, we should not be bound but should release it. If there is no word or inspiration, we should not fabricate something in order to fill up the time.</p>
<p>I studied at a Christian school that emphasized religious rituals. Classes started before eight, and the fourth period ended at eleven thirty. There was a period of thirty minutes, from eleven thirty to twelve o&rsquo;clock, for the whole school to attend a short service. The dean or the principal would host the ceremony, and a speaker would be asked to give a sermon. All the students were forced to attend the service. To the students, those thirty minutes felt like years. Every seat had a number so that the teachers could mark who was absent. Neither arriving late nor leaving early was allowed. It was hard to endure those thirty minutes. When the speaker did not stop after thirty minutes, the audience became very impatient. Eventually, the non-Christians and the Christians did not like to attend this service. The Westerners who established the school were very patient and persistent in holding the service daily, but because they did not know the right way, some students refused to believe in the Lord. The Christian school administrators thought that it was beneficial for the students to attend worship service every day but did not foresee that regulations have a negative effects&mdash;the students hated Christianity.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to our coming together to enjoy the Lord in the morning. We should not turn this time into a worship service or regulation. Five brothers should rise up early and come together to meet the Lord, not to suffer. If one of them likes to speak doctrine, the others will have to endure until he finishes. This disrupts the morning revival. Therefore, we should not arrange for someone to speak or to pray in order to fill up the time. Something is wrong if we must fill up the time in our morning revival. We would rather not hold this kind of morning revival. Those who come to the morning revival must have a heart, be willing to seek the Lord, and desire to fellowship with Him in spirit. We do not want doctrine or set prayers. Our only desire is that everyone would touch the Lord, hear Him, and receive inspiration. This is the way for the Lord to deal with our natural constitution so that we may grow unto maturity in life and be built up in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: How can we receive inspiration?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Inspiration comes when the Spirit inspires our human spirit. This depends on the condition of our heart. We will receive inspiration if our heart is strong for the Lord, but we will not receive inspiration if we do not have a heart for Him. In order to receive inspiration we also need to deal with our sins. If we sense that we have spoken too much, are wrong, have failed the Lord, or have offended someone, we should deal with it immediately. If we would deal with our sins in such a way, it will be easy to receive inspiration. Those who do not deal with their sins rarely receive inspiration, nor do they care to receive inspiration. If we do not deal with our sins in a proper way, our speaking and prayer in the meetings will be to fulfill a duty. Others will not have the way to touch the Spirit. If we have a heart for the Lord and are willing to deal with our sins, it will be easy to receive inspiration.</p>
<p><em>Question: How do we deal with sins?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We deal with sins according to our sense. When we sense that something is wrong inwardly, we should deal with it immediately. We should not reason. If we sense that we have offended the Lord but not man, we should deal with the offense before the Lord. If we have offended someone, we should deal with the offense before him. Not many Christians can deal with sins in such a way. Most Christians do not deal with sins thoroughly but would rather reason with the Lord. Dealing with sins involves paying a price. It is the Lord who asks us to deal with sins; hence, we need to pay the price and respond to Him without reasoning. If, instead of reasoning, we would do whatever the Lord says, it will be easy for us to deal with sins. The more we deal with sins in such a way, the keener our inner sense will be.</p></body></html>
