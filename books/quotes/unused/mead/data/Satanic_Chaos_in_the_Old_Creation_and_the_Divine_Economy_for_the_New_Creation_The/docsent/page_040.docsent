   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>of the Degraded Church</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to enjoy Christ as the hidden manna, a special portion of the nourishing supply, to overcome the worldliness of the degraded church with the idolatrous teaching of Balaam and the hierarchical teaching of the Nicolaitans Rev 2:12-17a .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord gave manna to the children of Israel openly.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But a small portion of this manna was preserved in a golden pot within the ark in the tabernacle 16:33; Heb 9:4 .</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such a worldly church has the idolatrous teaching of Balaam and the hierarchical teaching of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today in Christendom these two kinds of teachings are prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Balaam was a Gentile prophet who taught people for wages.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was a prophet for hire, and his teaching enticed God's people into fornication and idolatry Num 25:1-3; 31:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The teaching of Balaam distracts believers from the person of Christ to idolatry and from the enjoyment of Christ to spiritual fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The teaching of the Nicolaitans builds up a hierarchy among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This teaching destroys the function of believers as members of the Body of Christ, thus annulling the Lord's Body as His expression.</S>

   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the religious organization of the Roman Catholic Church there are the bishops, the archbishops, the cardinals, and eventually the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the Protestant denominations there is the system of clergy and laity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The teaching of the Nicolaitans is that only the clergy are qualified and positioned to preach, to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The others are so-called laymen.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the Lord's recovery, we have to overcome the clergy-laity system.</S>

   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All of us can speak for the Lord and teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our speaking for the Lord in the meetings is the annulling of the hierarchy.</S>
