   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAW OF SIN AND OF DEATH Issue No. 20 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:1-4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These four verses can be considered the most important passage in the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A certain believer once said that the whole Bible is like a ring studded with a precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The book of Romans is the precious stone on the ring, and chapter eight is like the light that shines from that stone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This may seem descriptive, but those who have experience will admit that it is true.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although Romans 8 is very clear, it is also very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although it is very easy, at the same time, it is very hard.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 8:1-4 occupies a special place in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are four chapters in Romans which are quite important; they are chapters five through eight.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Chapter five speaks of forgiveness in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Chapter six speaks of union in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Chapter seven speaks of the flesh not being able to keep the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And chapter eight speaks of the fulfillment of the righteousness of God's law in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 8:1-4 embodies the meaning of these four chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 1 speaks of having no condemnation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 2 speaks of union in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 3 speaks of that which the law could not do because it was weak through the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Finally, verse 4 speaks of being able to do in Christ what otherwise could not be done.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, these four verses are the crystalization of the salvation that we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before I speak on verses 1 through 4, I would like you to pay attention to one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What does Romans 7 speak about?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 7 says that "to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not" v. 18 . Brothers and sisters, is this not true? Many times, we make up our mind to do good, but we cannot work out our will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We know to do good, but we cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not want to love the world and we want to serve God, yet we cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Romans 7 can be summarized by one word: "cannot."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Please remember that above every person's head the word "cannot" is written in big letters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you have never tried to do good, you will not realize your inability.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if you seriously try to overcome, you will find that you cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not only are you unable to perform things as profound as serving God, but you cannot even do a small thing such as getting up early in the morning to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You may want to read the Bible uninterruptedly every day of the year, but you cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These may be small things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet many Christians cannot do them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They may be able to do them for a day or two.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At most they can do them for a week, after which they fail again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You may be well aware of a sin, yet you cannot remove the sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, you may have a temper which is very difficult to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There was once a believer with a bad temper who knew that he should not have such a temper.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day, one of the best vases in his house was broken by his servant.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was afraid of losing his temper if he looked at the broken vase, so he went to bed and covered his head with a blanket.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But what is the difference between a temper under the blanket and a temper outside the blanket?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many Christians want to speak truthfully and not exaggerate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet they cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They fall once and they fall twice.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although they do not want to fall again, they find themselves falling still.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They do not want to love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet they cannot avoid it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They want to live fully for God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet they cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although they want to work for God, their hearts are distracted whenever they think of what others have achieved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Numerous experiences have proven to us that we cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Romans 7, Paul told us only one thing: "cannot."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was desperate, and he said, "Wretched man that I am!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Who will deliver me from the body of this death?" v. 24 . Brothers and sisters, how many of you sitting here want to be free from jealousy and pride, and find that you cannot do it? How many of you do not want to love the world and find that you cannot stop loving the world? How many of you have willed to do good and found that you cannot do good? How many of you have failed once, twice, until you have given up trying to overcome? Is this word of mine merely a law which does nothing but serve as a mirror to expose you? No, here is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Romans 8:1 says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"Now" means that yesterday is over and that there is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now in Christ there is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How precious this is!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A scholar in Greek demonstrated that according to reliable manuscripts the word condemnation has two kinds of usages.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The first is in the legal sense, while the other is in the civil sense.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The civil sense is the common usage.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to the civil sense, the word condemnation means "powerless," and "restricted."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Brothers and sisters, from this verse we can find immeasurable comfort!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Indeed, a person who is in Christ is no longer condemned legally, and as far as his flesh is concerned, he is powerless no more.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There are no more restrictions in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What Paul complained he was unable to do can, now be done in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Romans 8:2 says, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Please notice that it speaks of two laws here: the law of the Spirit of life and the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Why does it say "the law of the Spirit of life" in Christ frees us from "the law of sin and of death," rather than "the Spirit of life" frees us from "sin and death"?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What is the difference between "the Spirit of life" and "the law of the Spirit of life"?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What is the difference between "sin and death" and "the law of sin and of death"?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Sin is an inward power.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The law of sin is the habit of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For example, there is the force of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whenever we drop something, it is attracted by the force of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The force of gravity becomes a law because it pulls down everything by habit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If I drop a book here, it will fall to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If I drop the book in another place, it will still fall to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the effect of a law.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If a book falls when it is dropped here, but does not fall when it is dropped elsewhere, then it is not governed by a law.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Anything habitual, anything that produces the same result from the same action is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Sin is one thing, and the law of sin is another.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We sin because within us there is the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is like a book falling to the ground because there is the law of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Brothers and sisters, have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Our sinning is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We do not sin or fall by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>To sin is a habit, and to fall is a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Both sinning and falling have become a law.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>A law is something that will give the same result anywhere and in every way when given the same action.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If our sinning is accidental and not caused by a law of sin, there are still ways to solve it.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>For example, if you sin because your environment is bad or your job is bad, you can change the environment or change jobs, and you will then stop sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But brothers and sisters, this book, the Bible, tells us that we do not sin by accident, but by a law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Suppose you lose your temper easily.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>You would lose your temper easily in Shanghai, and you would lose your temper easily even if you go to Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>You lose your temper easily in your business.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But if you change your job, you will still lose your temper easily.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>No matter when or where, your temper will break out.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Brothers and sisters, the Bible shows us that a law of sin has firmly grasped us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It may be possible to overcome sin, and it may be possible to overcome death, but it is impossible to overcome the law of sin and of death!</S>
