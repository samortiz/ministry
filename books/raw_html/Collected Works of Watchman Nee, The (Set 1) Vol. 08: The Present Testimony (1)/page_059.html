<H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S MASTERPIECE</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(A RECORD OF A LORD'S DAY MEETING)<br>Issue No. 18</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:1-10</H1><P>Before I expound this portion of the Scripture, I would like you to pay attention to Ephesians 1. Chapter one can be separated into two large sections. The first section speaks of what one receives by the riches of God's grace—the apostle told the believers the measure they had received, that God in Christ had blessed them with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies (vv. 1-14). The second section is the apostle Paul's prayer. Though they had obtained, he prayed for them lest they not know what they had obtained. In this way they might come to know the might of His strength that raised the Lord Jesus from the dead (vv. 15-23).</P><P>Chapter two is an explanation of the mighty power of resurrection in the previous chapter. It fully explains the question concerning salvation. Verses 1-10 first speak of our condition before we believed in the Lord. Second, these verses tell what Christ has accomplished; third, they explain how we can obtain what Christ has accomplished; and fourth, they speak of what we should do after we have obtained what Christ has accomplished. We will now look at this portion verse by verse.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR CONDITION BEFORE BELIEVING</H2><P>Verse 1 says, "And you, though dead in your offenses and sins." The last chapter calls to our attention the surpassing greatness of His power and the might of His strength. Chapter two starts off by letting us know what kind of persons we were before we were saved. If we want to see what salvation is, and if we want to grow spiritually, it is most important for every one of us to know what kind of persons we were originally. The Bible not only says that we were sinners who committed sin and did evil; it also says that we were dead! We always think that we are just sinners and that all we need is improvement. However, we do not realize that we are dead persons who cannot be improved.</P><P>What is a dead person lacking? Life. We were dead in our offenses and sins. It was not just that we were so evil, committing sins; we were also short of life. Death includes two things: first, it has no life; and second, it cannot produce life. Thus, because of what we were, we could never be like God. Only with life is there the possibility of growth, power, and organic unity. Because we did not have the life of God, we were dead to the holiness, power, and glory of God; we could not be holy, powerful, and glorious as He is. Only a living one can live; no dead one can live. Originally, we were dead. Unless we received life, it would be impossible for us to have a holy living.</P><P>God said we were dead. Let me ask, is our death like wood or rock? No, dead wood or rock stays the same all the time. The death of our being, however, decays and corrupts. We become more and more rotten. God does not want us to improve, because we are dead. We should not try to improve a corpse. We do not have the strength to do good. We cannot overcome the world. We cannot resist temptations, because we are dead.</P><P>What kind of death is this? This is not physical death; it is not ordinary death. It is a death that dies in offenses and sins. Offense in the original language means a slight overstep. For example, in running a race, alongside the track there are straight lines to set the boundaries. Overstepping these lines a little will constitute a violation of game rules, and one will be disqualified from the race. This slight overstepping is called an offense. Sins are filthy and dirty things. Offenses are not as serious as sins. All through our lives we live between these two—offenses or sins. Not committing sins, not loving the world, and not being moved by temptation were beyond our power to control because we were dead in offenses and sins.</P><P>The Lord Jesus also said that man is dead. "Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life. Truly, truly, I say to you, An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live" (John 5:24-25). The Lord said that when a sinner is saved, not only will he have eternal life and escape condemnation, but he will also pass from death into life. The Lord also told us that a sinner is not merely a sinner; he is a dead person. This is why He said that the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God.</P><P>Because one is dead, he has absolutely no hope for God's holiness, righteousness, power, and glory. There is no possibility for him to attain these things. Since we know that man is dead, the first thing to overcome is death. We are not afraid of sin, but we are afraid of death. Medical doctors all know that there are poisons in many kinds of food. But a man with an active life is not afraid of the poisons. His concern is not how to get rid of the poison, but how to have a strong life that fights off the poison. Sin will not die, but a vigorous life can overcome sin.</P><P>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He never committed a sin. Was it because He had an especially good family? Or was it because He had an especially good environment? Was the society at the time especially good? Or was it because the world did not tempt Him or Satan did not test Him? We know that none of these was the case. It was not because the Lord did not meet any difficulties. Rather, the Lord had the life of God, and sin and evil could not touch Him. This is why we are not afraid of sin but are afraid of death. Sin will not die, but we can overcome it with life.</P><P>Ephesians 2:2 says, "In which you once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit which is now operating in the sons of disobedience." Verse 1 speaks of death, and verse 2 of our walk. Verse 1 speaks of the original condition of man—death,  verse 2 of what is worked out by man.</P><P>In which denotes the offenses and sins in verse 1. Originally, man took offenses and sins as a way to walk. We have to be clear. We were dead in offenses and sins and had no power and life; therefore, we walked in offenses and sins. The world advises us to cultivate and improve ourselves. So we thought that if we prayed more and read the Bible more, we would overcome sin. But because we were dead, we had no way but to walk in offenses and sins.</P><P>The Bible says we have three enemies: (1) the world, (2) Satan, (3) and the flesh. In this verse, two enemies are mentioned—the world and Satan. The next verse mentions the flesh.</P>
