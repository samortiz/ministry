   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-NINE DEALING WITH THE ABUSE OF FREEDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN FOODS AND IN THE BODY 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 6:13-20</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 6:15, 17, and 19 there are three crucial matters: first, that our bodies are members of Christ; second, that we are one spirit with the Lord; and third, that our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the context of dealing with the abuse of freedom in foods and in the body, Paul opens up these matters in a marvelous way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>MEMBERS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 15 says, Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because we are organically united with Christ v. 17 , and because Christ dwells in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 and makes His home in our heart Eph 3:17 , our entire being, including our purified body, becomes a member of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, to practice such membership we need to offer our body to Him Rom 12:1, 4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 17 Paul says, But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word joined in this verse refers to the believers organic union with the Lord through believing into Him John 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This union is illustrated by that of the branches with the vine John 15:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a matter not only of life, but also in life, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such a union with the resurrected Lord can only be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The expression one spirit indicates the mingling of the Lord as the Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our spirit has been regenerated by the Spirit of God John 3:6 , who is now in us 1 Cor 6:19 and is one with our spirit Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the realization of the Lord who became the life-giving Spirit through resurrection 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17 , and who is now with our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This mingled spirit is often referred to in Paul s Epistles, as in Romans 8:4-6.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A TEMPLE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 19 Paul says, Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, Who is in you, Whom you have from God, and you are not your own?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Holy Spirit is in our spirit Rom 8:16 , and our spirit is within our body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, our body becomes a temple, a dwelling place, of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 20 Paul concludes, For you were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The price mentioned here is the precious blood of Christ Acts 20:28; 1 Pet 1:18-19; Rev 5:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To glorify God in our body means to let God who dwells in us 1 John 4:13 occupy and saturate our body and express Himself through our body as His temple, especially in the two matters of eating and marriage, according to the context of this section from 6:13 through 11:1.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this, we need to exercise a severe and strict control over our body, bringing it into subjection 1 Cor 9:27 and presenting it to God as a living sacrifice Rom 12:1 .</S>
