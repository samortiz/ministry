   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We must remember that the first thing the ministry of the word needs is revelation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Yet in order for the human element to be present in God's word and in order for man to be a minister to God, the light of revelation has to pass through man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It has to enter man's spirit and be translated into man's thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If our spirit is not in the right condition, we will not receive any revelation or light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the other hand, if something is wrong with our mind, light will not reach our outward man and cannot be translated into thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After light shines into our spirit, there is still a need for a strong and rich mind to translate this light into understanding and then into words.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are pressed all day long by our own worries over such things as food, clothing, and family, and if our thoughts wallow in these things all the time, our mind does not have the capacity to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A man's mental capacity is like his physical capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a man's arm has a capacity to lift fifty pounds of weight, he can only lift fifty pounds of weight; one more pound will become too heavy for him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our mind has similar limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If our mind is occupied by other things, we cannot use it in the things of God; we will not be able to translate God's light into thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brothers, the sooner we acknowledge our limitations, the more blessing we will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A vain struggle is a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some brothers set their minds on food, clothing, family, and affairs of this world all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How much room is in their minds for God?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Their minds are full of things already; their thoughts are pressed by too many things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Their spirits cannot receive any light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even if their spirits can receive light, the shining will only be a vain exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They will still not be able to serve as an outlet of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When light shines in their spirit, they do not have a stable mind to receive the light.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When light comes, only a free, powerful, and rich mind can retain this light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If our thoughts are revolving around other things, we will be in a maze, and we will not be able to come out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our thoughts will never understand the light.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Light has indeed entered our spirit, but it may stop there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Light must follow a definite pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's word also has its pathway; it has to go through some definite steps before it can be released as the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a man wants to serve others with the word, he has to allow God's word to come out of him step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If something is wrong with his mind, God's word will remain in his spirit as light; he will not be able to translate it into thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The interesting thing is that every time light comes to our spirit, we do not know what it means or what it is saying.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By the time we try to understand it and retain it, it is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our minds and thoughts are not sufficient enough to understand the light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We see something, yet we do not know what we see.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times, light has to come to us two, three, or even more times before we can capture it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If our thoughts are rich enough, we can retain the light more easily.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If our mind is not burdened or occupied by other things and if our thoughts are sufficient and inclusive enough, we easily see what the light is and what it all means.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All experienced ones agree that while our minds try to translate the light, this light seems to run away.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our minds have to be very quick.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The quicker our mind is, the easier it is for us to translate the light.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once our mind misses, the light runs away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If God is merciful to us, the light will come back the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if He does not have mercy on us, it will not come back.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sometimes we feel as if we have lost something; we feel as if something is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that our mind has not been able to function properly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many times we feel that our mind is not quick enough.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many times we see something, and like a rescue team rushing to a burning house, we quickly try to translate the light into thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If our minds are quick enough, we may catch a few things, but the rest is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Light does not wait patiently for us to ponder and understand.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It flies away quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to snatch it quickly before it runs away.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Brothers, once you find that you cannot retain the light, you realize how useless your mind is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Before you try to engage your mind in the pursuit of God's light, you may think that you are a very clever man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may boast that your mind is sharp, but when God's light needs to be translated into intelligible thoughts, you find out how poor your thoughts are.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is like the experience of interpreting for a speaker on the podium: You need to interpret for him, yet you cannot do it because the words do not come to you fast enough.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When you interpret for a human speaker, he is able to wait for you to find the right words.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, light is different; it does not wait for you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you cannot catch up with it, it flies away.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I cannot tell you why this is so, yet it is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You can only retain as much light as your capacity allows; what cannot be retained is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If light comes back a second or third time, you can thank the Lord and capture it again.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if the light does not come back, you suffer a loss, and the church suffers a loss as well.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you lose the light, the church loses the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Who decides who the ministers are?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God decides.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Yet if our thoughts cannot match the light, we miss our opportunity to serve as a minister.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This shows how crucial our thoughts are in relation to the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many people have a foolish idea: They think that a minister of God's word does not need to exercise his mind at all.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>First Corinthians 14 clearly tells us that a minister of the word needs to exercise his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Without exercising his thoughts and mind, he cannot serve properly as a minister of God's word.</S>
