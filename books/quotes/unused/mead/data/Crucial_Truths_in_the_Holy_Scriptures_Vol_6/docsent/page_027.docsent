   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He who deceives the whole inhabited earth ; Deceive the nations Rev 12:9; 20:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first work of the devil in relation to man is to deceive man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His deception extends to the whole inhabited earth and to all the nations on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He uses all kinds of people and things to deceive man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no person, matter, or thing that cannot be used in order to deceive people, and there is no one who cannot be deceived by him.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He deceives all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Has blinded the thoughts 2 Cor 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The devil blinds man s thoughts so that man cannot know God or see the origin, meaning, and purpose of his existence, thus preventing him from receiving the gospel and being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many Ph.D. s and college professors are very bright and thoughtful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But even though they are filled with scientific knowledge and understand many principles, they do not know the reason and purpose of their existence.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What little knowledge of God and of the things related to Him that they have is considered by them to be foolish superstitions with no meaning or value.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This proves that the devil has blinded their thoughts so that they would not have the inward sight to see God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The devil does not want the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ to shine in them to bring them out of darkness into the light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These worldly people are under the devil s blinding covering, and they are living a dull, confused, sightless existence, not knowing either their origin or their destination.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one comes and snatches away Matt 13:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When people hear the word of God, the devil works to snatch it away.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The word of God enlightens the eyes of man s heart and causes him to see spiritual things concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It regenerates his spirit and causes him to obtain the life of God and participate in the spiritual things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Consequently, the devil comes to snatch away the word of God from man s heart in order to keep him in darkness and death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The tares are the sons of the evil one; and the enemy who sowed them is the devil Matt 13:38-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The devil also works to damage the church by mixing false believers, or tares, into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This causes the church to lose her purity outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The whole was leavened Matt 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The devil not only mixes false believers into the church but also mixes heretical teachings as evil leaven into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This causes the church to be corrupted inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>With respect to the faith, he fills the church with heresies that are not according to the truth, and with respect to living, he fills the church with evil things that go against the Lord s righteousness and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking someone to devour 1 Pet 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This devil is like a roaring lion who walks about the whole earth seeking someone to devour, that is, someone who will accept his tempting, misleading, and ensnaring influence.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Satan himself transfigures himself into an angel of light 2 Cor 11:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Although the devil comes to devour people as a roaring lion, he can also transfigure himself into a lovely angel of light in order to deceive people.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even believers who are on guard against him as a roaring lion sometimes receive him as an angel of light.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They escape his terrible devouring but accept his bright deception.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, the devil in his brightness often can do more damage to the saints and the church than he can through his roaring and devouring.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For three centuries the Roman Empire roared like a lion and damaged the church, but that damage was nothing compared to the damage done by the Roman government s acceptance of Christianity as the state religion in the fourth century.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When the church is under the devil s roaring persecution, we do not need to fear too much for the church, but when she receives the devil s welcoming face as an angel of light, we must truly be in fear.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Tempted you 1 Thes 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Since the devil can transform himself into an angel of light, he can tempt people.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>His transformation is for his temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is another aspect of his work.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You are about to suffer Rev 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When the devil is not successful in tempting the saints, he causes them to suffer.</S>

   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>10.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Satan has asked to have you all to sift you as wheat Luke 22:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The devil sifts the believers like people sift wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If a believer does not have strong faith, it is hard to pass through this sifting and remain firm.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Therefore, the Lord constantly prays for us concerning this matter so that we would not lose faith v. 32 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>11.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The stratagems of the devil Eph 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The devil uses stratagems.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He is crafty, and he has many schemes and deceptive works to help him arrive at his evil goal.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>12.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>A messenger of Satan, that he might buffet 2 Cor 12:7 .</S>

   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Satan stood up against Israel and moved David to number Israel 1 Chron 21:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Moving the saints is another aspect of the devil s work.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Whenever the saints are moved, regardless of the reason, the devil is behind their movement.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Sometimes if we would only wait for five minutes, we would escape the devil s attempts to move us.</S>

   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The devil takes advantage of every opportunity to be an adversary to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He points out our mistakes so that we will be embarrassed, and he traps us in difficult situations so that we will be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>16.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The accuser of our brothers Rev 12:10; see also Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Because the devil is the adversary of the saints, he is always accusing us.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>He accuses us before God and in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>He can go before God to accuse us as he accused Job, and he can accuse and condemn us in our conscience in order to interrupt our fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The Lord s blood is the only thing that enables us to overcome his accusations Rev 12:11 .</S>
