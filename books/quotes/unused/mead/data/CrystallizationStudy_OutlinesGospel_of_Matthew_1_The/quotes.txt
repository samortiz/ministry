[12]  16:18-19; 21:42, 44; 5:14 In order to enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the coming age, we must do the will of our Father in this age Matt 7:21-23; 6:10; 12:50; Rev 4:11; Rom 12:2; Eph 1:5, 9, 11; 5:17; Col 1:9; 4:12: God is a God of purpose, having a will of His own pleasure, and He created all things for His will that He might accomplish and fulfill His purpose Rev 4:11; Eph 3:9-11; Col 1:9: God s will is His heart s desire, His mingling with man, and the fulfillment of His eternal plan Eph 1:5, 9, 11; 5:17.

[15]  Message Eleven Christ versus Religion Scripture Reading: Matt 21:41-46; 16:13-16; 9:14-17; 12:1-14 To have a religion is to worship God, to serve God, and to do certain things to please God, yet without Christ: To be religious means to do something for God without Christ and without the Spirit Matt 9:14-17.
[16]  Christ did not come to establish an earthly religion of rituals and dead religious practices but a heavenly kingdom of life with Himself, the all-inclusive One, as the full enjoyment of His followers that they might become the constituents of His kingdom 21:41-46.
[17]  The Gospel of Matthew reveals that Christ is versus religion and that the things concerning Christ are outside of religion: The birth of Christ, the finding of Christ, the recommending of Christ, and the following of Christ were all outside of religion 1:18-23; 2:1-12; 3:1-12; 4:12-22.
