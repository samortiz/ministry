   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then Jehovah said, "I will make Jerusalem heaps, / A habitation of jackals; / And I will make the cities of Judah / A desolation without inhabitant" v. 11 . This indicates that although Jehovah was punishing Israel, He was still sympathetic toward them.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In these verses the words us and our indicate that Jehovah joined Himself to the suffering people and was one with them in their suffering.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He joined Himself to them and stayed with them.</S>
