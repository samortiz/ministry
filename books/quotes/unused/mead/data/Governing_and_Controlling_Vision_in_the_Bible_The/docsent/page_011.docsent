   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CRYSTALLIZED SIGNIFICANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CONSUMMATION OF GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The accomplishment of the economy of God is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It has been more than four hundred years since Luther s reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Luther saw only the truth concerning justification by faith; he did not have the revelation concerning God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After him, very few Bible expositors could give a clear and definite word concerning the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even Robert Govett, a well-respected Bible expositor who was quite good in the interpretation of prophecies, asserted that the New Jerusalem is a physical city.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Based upon his principle of biblical interpretation, he asserted that Revelation could only be interpreted literally, not spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the last few hundred years, concerning the interpretation of Revelation, there is a school of literal interpretation that considers the seven lampstands as seven lampstands, the city as a city, the doors as doors, and the street as a street.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Regarding this kind of interpretation, my rebuttal is that Revelation opens by saying that Christ showed all the things to His slave John by signs 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, the entire book of Revelation is composed of signs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, Revelation 5:6 says that Christ is the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot interpret this word literally and say that He is a lamb with four legs and a tail.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Also, 1:12 says that the churches are lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Are the churches merely physical lampstands?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, this should not be interpreted literally, but on the other hand, it should be interpreted literally, because the seven lampstands which John saw were actually seven lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a sign, however, seven signifies completion and perfection, and the significance of the lampstands is even richer and more inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Bible expositors throughout the generations were not able to clearly interpret the proper meaning of the New Jerusalem in its different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Among us, from Brother Nee s study of Revelation together with my few decades of study, we now have explained clearly every item of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our publications we have more than thirty messages on the New Jerusalem; I hope that you will all read these messages carefully see God s New Testament Economy, chs.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>26-44; Elders Training Book 2, The Vision of the Lord s Recovery, chs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>5-13; The Conclusion of the New Testament, msgs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>254-264 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Revelation says that the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God 21:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This follows John 1, which says that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us v. 14 ; that tabernacle was God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John refers to the tabernacle in chapter one; then in chapter two he mentions the temple v. 21 . Both the tabernacle and the temple are dwelling places, and the consummation of these dwelling places is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Revelation also says that the New Jerusalem is the bride, the wife, of Christ 21:2, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To those who advocate the literal interpretation of the New Jerusalem, I would ask, Do you really mean to say that the wife of Christ is a physical city?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ephesians tells us that the wife of Christ is the church 5:23-32 and that the church is the dwelling place of God 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the New Jerusalem is the consummation of the church as the wife of Christ and the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the meaning of the New Jerusalem as a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, Revelation 21 says that the light of the city is like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone v. 11 . It also says that the wall of the city is built with jasper v. 18 , having twelve foundations, and that the first foundation is also jasper v. 19 . According to Revelation 4, God is like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance v. 3 . The red color of sardius signifies redemption and indicates that God is the God of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jasper is dark green, signifying life in its richness and indicating that God is the God of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In chapter four, jasper is the appearance of God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In chapter twenty-one the wall of the entire city of New Jerusalem is jasper, and its light is like jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that the New Jerusalem is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the book of Revelation must be interpreted entirely according to letters, does that mean that in chapter four God is simply a jasper stone?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This shows that Revelation cannot be interpreted literally.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In these years the Lord has shown us the crystallized significance of the New Jerusalem: it is a mingling, a constitution, of the Triune God with His chosen and redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Perhaps some will ask where in the Word do we get this kind of interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The answer is that we see in the New Jerusalem the twelve tribes of Israel representing the Old Testament saints Rev 21:12 and the twelve apostles representing the New Testament saints v. 14 . We also see that God is in it, Christ is in it, and the Spirit is in it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although the title Christ is not used in Revelation in referring to the New Jerusalem, when God is mentioned, He is mentioned with the Lamb 22:1, 3; 21:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the Lamb is mentioned, it refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Gospel of John shows us that Christ is the Lamb 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the same principle, although the Spirit is not mentioned in Revelation concerning the New Jerusalem, a river is there 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>John 7 says clearly that out of the innermost being of those who receive the Spirit shall flow rivers of living water v. 38 . Consequently, the Lamb refers to Christ, whereas the river refers to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, we see that the New Jerusalem is constituted with the Triune God and His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, the three kinds of materials gold, pearls, and precious stones which constitute the city of the New Jerusalem Rev 21:19-21 indicate that the New Jerusalem is the Triune God wrought into His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These three kinds of materials are not the gold, silver, and precious stones referred to in 1 Corinthians; rather, they correspond to the gold, bdellium, and precious stones in Genesis 2:11-12.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Revelation and Genesis are two corresponding ends, whereas 1 Corinthians is the course.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Man has the sinful nature due to the fall, and during the course he still has sin, so he needs the silver that signifies redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After the age of redemption passes away, in the new heaven and new earth, there is no longer the problem of sin, and as a result, there is no longer the need for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Creation reverts to the sinless condition in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the New Jerusalem gold signifies the holiness of God the Father, pearls signify the overcoming death and life-dispensing resurrection of God the Son, and precious stones signify the transforming work of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is why we say that the New Jerusalem is the mingling, the constitution, of the redeeming God with His redeemed people.</S>
