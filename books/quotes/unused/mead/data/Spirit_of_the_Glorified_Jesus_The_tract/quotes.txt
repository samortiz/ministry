[1]  The Lord Jesus is a unique, wonderful person, because He is both God and man.
[2]  While the Spirit of God, possessing only the divine nature, has existed eternally, the Spirit, possessing both the divinity and humanity of the Lord Jesus Christ, did not come into being until Jesus had been glorified through His death and resurrection.
[3]  Because the Lord Jesus has become the Spirit, the New Testament variously designates the Spirit as the Spirit of Jesus or the Spirit of Christ or the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
