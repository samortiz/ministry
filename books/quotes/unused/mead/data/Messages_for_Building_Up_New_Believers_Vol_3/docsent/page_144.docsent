   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. In Order to Follow the Lord One Must Sell All</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hence, no one can follow the Lord who will not sell all his possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If one does not sell his all, he cannot follow the Lord; he cannot go on in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must have a deep realization of this serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>C. Keeping One s Possessions</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Meaning Keeping One s Sorrow</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible says that when the young ruler heard the Lord s word, he left in sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A man can be so close to the Lord and so clear about Him and yet still refuse to let go of his possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He can still try to keep his possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But when he keeps his possessions, he also keeps his sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Money pierces a person through with many pains 1 Tim 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A man cannot accumulate riches and joy at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If he accumulates riches, he accumulates headaches for himself as well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If he saves his possessions, he saves sorrow and troubles for himself as well.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here was a man who kept his possessions, but he could no longer follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you want your money, you should not follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you do not follow the Lord, your money can remain intact, and your sorrow will also remain intact.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Money and sorrow always go together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You cannot retain your money without retaining your sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only those who have handed over their all can live a joyous life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who are unwilling to give up their possessions always live a sad life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have noticed this too clearly in many places.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I can predict that the brothers who cling to their money will always abide in sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not a happy thing to cling to material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should tell new believers that if they want joy, they should give up everything to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>D. Salvation, Receiving Eternal Life,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>and Entering God s Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The young ruler would not let go of his possessions, and he left in sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Lord saw this, He remarked, How difficult it will be for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Mark 10:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first point in this story concerns inheriting eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Following this there is the matter of entering the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who heard the Lord s words concerning entering the kingdom asked, Then who can be saved? v. 26 . Here the matters of salvation, receiving eternal life, and entering the kingdom of God are all linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we want to inherit eternal life, we have to part with our possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Otherwise, our possessions will hinder us from inheriting eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we want to enter God s kingdom, we must remember that it is impossible for a rich man to enter in. If we want to be saved, the Lord will save us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yet we must remember that if the Lord does save us, we have to give up our riches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This does not mean that one is saved by giving up his riches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It means that if a man is saved, he will spontaneously give up his riches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is impossible for a camel to go through the eye of a needle.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the same way it is impossible for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yet all the brothers and sisters among us are camels.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who are rich are big camels, and those who are less rich are smaller camels; everyone is a camel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Just as a camel cannot go through the eye of a needle, a rich man cannot enter the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the Lord says that no rich man can enter God s kingdom, it must mean that no rich man can enter it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>E. Selling All to Inherit Eternal Life</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the disciples heard this they were worried.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They asked, Then who can be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They misunderstood the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What did the Lord say to the young man?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the young man asked, What shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? the Lord s answer was to sell all he had and give to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, one must sell all that he has before he can receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A little while later the Lord said that a rich man entering God s kingdom is like a camel going through the eye of a needle.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This means that a rich man cannot enter God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you put the two things together, you can see that a rich man cannot enter God s kingdom, and that one must sell his all before he can inherit eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Peter behaved liked a Bible teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When he heard this, he felt this was a terrible requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He thought, If the inheriting of eternal life is related to one s work, and if one cannot enter God s kingdom if he is rich, but instead must sell his all before going in, this must mean that the entrance no longer depends on faith.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If this is the case, who can be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Who can sell all that he has before inheriting eternal life?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Who can first be poor in order to be saved?</S>
