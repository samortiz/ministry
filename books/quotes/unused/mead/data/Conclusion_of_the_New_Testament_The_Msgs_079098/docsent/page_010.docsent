   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>T. THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ultimately, the Spirit of God is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit is the totality, the aggregate, of all the elements of the titles of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, the Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When all the aspects and elements of the Spirit are put together, we have a totality, an aggregate, known in the New Testament as the Spirit Mark 1:10; Matt 4:1; 12:31; John 3:5, 34; 7:39; Acts 6:3; 8:18; Rom 8:16, 23, 26, 27; Gal 3:2, 14; 5:16-18, 22, 25; 1 Pet 1:2; Rev 2:7; 14:13; 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As Bible is the book, so the Spirit of God today is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit is the all-inclusive, processed, compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This Spirit is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Father, the Spirit of the Lord, the Spirit of the Son of God, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the Lord Spirit, the Spirit of the living God, the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life, the Spirit of grace, the Spirit of reality, the Comforter, the Spirit of power, the Spirit of glory and that of God, the eternal Spirit, and the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 7:39 says, "This He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This verse speaks of the Spirit, telling us that before the Lord Jesus was crucified and resurrected the Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit of God was there from the beginning Gen 1:1-2 , but the Spirit as the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ was "not yet" at the time of John 7:39, because the Lord Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After His resurrection, that is, after He had been glorified, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even though, before Christ's death and resurrection, the Spirit of God was the Spirit of Jehovah and the Holy Spirit, the Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This term the Spirit is often used by Paul in his Epistles and by John in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In speaking of the Spirit John and Paul are referring to the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, eventually and ultimately the Spirit of God is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With regard to the preaching of the gospel beforehand to Abraham, Galatians 3:14 says, "In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God in preaching the gospel to Abraham promised him the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once again in Galatians 3:14 we do not have the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Lord, or the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this verse we have the Spirit because the Spirit was the unique blessing of the New Testament economy promised by God to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have pointed out that in the Bible the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, this is not the Triune God apart from the process through which He has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit is the Triune God after He has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Having passed through this process, the Triune God is now this consummate Spirit as the blessing of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, the Spirit is the blessing of God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the book of Revelation only two titles of the Spirit are used: the seven Spirits and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; and 5:6 we have the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In chapters 2 and 3 the title "the Spirit" is used again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is also found in Revelation 14:13 and, for the last time, in Revelation 22:17.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This verse says, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This reveals that the Spirit as the totality of the processed Triune God has become one with the church, who is now fully matured to be the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the Spirit is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, and the bride is the ultimate expression of the transformed tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By the time of Revelation 22:17, the processed Triune God and the transformed tripartite man will be one and will speak as one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now, at the conclusion of this message, we may give a full definition of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit is the processed, compound, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold intensified, consummated Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God to be the eternal portion of His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified tripartite people as their life, life supply, and everything.</S>
