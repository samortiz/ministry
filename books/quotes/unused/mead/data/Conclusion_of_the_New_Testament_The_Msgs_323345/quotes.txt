[1]  In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in Galatians.
[2]  The subject of Galatians is Christ replacing the law and being versus religion and tradition.
[3]  Although many Christians know that Christ died for our sins to deliver us from God s condemnation and the lake of fire, few realize that Christ gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us from the religious world.
[4]  This is a crucial matter because Christ gave Himself for our sins to rescue us out of the religious world, not according to His choice but according to the will of God.
[5]  It was not because Christ was rejected by the Jews that He hated Judaism and went to the cross in order to rescue His disciples out of Judaism.
[6]  Rather, it was according to God s will, that is, His plan, His economy, that Christ gave Himself for our sins to deliver us out of the Jewish religion.
[7]  In His economy God planned that Christ would rescue His chosen people out of Judaism, the law, traditions, and rituals.
[8]  The book of Ephesians reveals that the will of God is to have the church as a living Body for Christ 1:22-23; 3:10-11 ; it is not to have an organization but an organism.
[9]  In Galatians 1:16 Christ is presented as the One revealed in the apostle.
[10]  When Saul of Tarsus, on his way to Damascus to bind those who call upon the Lord s name, was opposing Christ and persecuting the churches, Christ appeared to him.
[11]  When Christ met him there, he saw Christ, was captured by the appearing of Christ, and became Paul the apostle.
[12]  Christ was resurrected from the dead that He might live in us v. 1; 2:20 . We were baptized into Christ, being identified with Him, and we have put on Christ, clothing ourselves with Him; thus, we are in Christ and have become of Him 3:27-29; 5:24 . Christ has been revealed in us, He is now living in us, and He will be formed in us 1:16; 2:20; 4:19 . To Christ the law has conducted us, and in Christ we are all sons of God 3:24, 26 . In Christ we inherit God s promised blessing and enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit v. 14 . In Christ we all are one v. 28 . We should not be deprived of all profit from Christ and thus be separated, severed, from Him 5:4 . We need Christ to supply us with grace in our spirit that we may live Him 6:18 . God s desire is that His chosen people receive His Son into them; this is the gospel 1:15-16; 2:20; 4:19 .
[13]  1 God s Pleasure to Reveal His Son in Us
[14]  In 1:16 Paul emphasizes the fact that the Son of God was revealed in him.
[15]  This indicates that God s revealing of His Son to us is in us; it is not outward but inward, not by an outward vision but by an inward seeing.
[16]  It is not an objective revelation but a subjective one.
[17]  Moreover, Paul says that it pleased God to reveal His Son in him.
[18]  The focal point of the Bible is not the practices, doctrines, or ordinances.
[19]  Rather, it is the living person of the Son of God who is the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit for us to enjoy Him, partake of His riches, and live Him 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17; Phil 1:19; Gal 6:18 .
[20]  The heart of God is fully occupied with the living person of His Son.
[21]  5 Christ Revealed in Us Being the Center of God s Plan
[22]  God s plan is neither to have a religion nor to have many religious works accomplished.
[23]  God s plan is to reveal Christ into us, to make Christ our life and everything, and to regenerate and transform us to be members of Christ.
[24]  When God the Father reveals His Son in us, He sows Christ into us as the seed of life.
[25]  God made the apostle Paul a minister of Christ by setting him apart, calling him Gal 1:15 , and revealing His Son in him v. 16 . At the time of Paul s conversion, God was pleased to reveal Christ in him.
[26]  Galatians 2:4 reveals that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the sphere of freedom.
[27]  In this verse Paul speaks of the false brothers, brought in secretly, who stole in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into slavery.
[28]  In Galatians 2:16 Christ is revealed as the means of justification: Knowing that a man is not justified out of works of law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we also have believed into Christ Jesus that we might be justified out of faith in Christ and not out of the works of law, because out of the works of law no flesh will be justified.
[29]  Fallen man cannot be justified by works of law.
[30]  In Galatians 2:20 Christ is presented as the One who has given Himself up for the believers and who lives in them.
[31]  It is only when we come to know Christ as the One who lives in us and we live by Him, not by ourselves, that we can enjoy Christ as the One who rescues us out of religion.
[32]  By knowing Christ as the One who lives in us and by living by Christ through our faith in Him, we should experience and enjoy Him as the One who rescues us from religion.
[33]  In Galatians 2:20 Paul declares, I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God.
[34]  The Son of God loved us and purposely gave Himself up for us that He might impart the divine life into us.
[35]  In Galatians 3:1-22 Christ is unveiled as the seed of Abraham.
[36]  as the Blessing of the Gospel Promised to Abraham,
[37]  Christ as the seed of Abraham was crucified and became a curse on our behalf to redeem us out of the curse of the law in order that we might receive the Spirit as the blessing of the gospel promised to Abraham, the promise that all the nations would be blessed in Him.
[38]  Galatians 3:14 says, In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
[39]  Galatians reveals the way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God: by God s revealing of Christ in us 1:16a; Eph 1:17; Gen 13:14-18; Eph 3:8, 19 ; by our receiving of Christ out of the hearing of faith Gal 3:2 ; by being born according to the Spirit and by being given the Spirit of God s Son into our hearts 4:29b, 6 ; by putting on Christ through the baptism that puts us into Christ 3:27 ; by being identified with Him in His death so that it may be no longer we who live but He who lives in us 2:20 ; by living and walking by the Spirit 5:16, 25 ; by having Christ formed in us through travail 4:19 ; by sowing unto the Spirit with the desire and aim of the Spirit in view, to accomplish what the Spirit desires 6:7-8 ; by boasting in the cross of Christ and living a new creation vv.
[40]  Galatians 3:24-29 reveals that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the goal of the law.
[41]  Likewise, the law was used by God as a custodian, a guardian, a child-conductor, to watch over His chosen people before Christ came, and to escort and bring them to Christ when He did come, that they might be justified by faith and participate in the blessing promised and covenanted by God.
[42]  In Galatians 4:4-7 Paul presents Christ as the Son of God.
[43]  2 The Spirit of His Son in Our Hearts,
[44]  In 4:6 Paul says that God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts.
[45]  Actually, the Spirit of God came into our spirit at the time of our regeneration John 3:6; Rom 8:16 .
[46]  Because our spirit is hidden in our heart 1 Pet 3:4 , and because the word here refers to a matter that is related to our feeling and understanding, both of which belong to our heart, Galatians 4:6 says that the Spirit of God s Son was sent into our hearts.
[47]  The parallel verse, Romans 8:15, says that we who have received a spirit of sonship cry in this spirit, Abba, Father! whereas Galatians 4:6 says that the Spirit of God s Son is crying in our hearts, Abba, Father!
[48]  This indicates that our regenerated spirit and the Spirit of God are mingled as one, and that our spirit is in our heart.
[49]  In Galatians 4:19 Christ is presented as the One who is formed in the believers.
[50]  In Galatians 5 Christ is presented as the Emancipator.
[51]  In 5:11 Paul says, If I still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted?
[52]  Then the stumbling block of the cross has been annulled.
[53]  Living a Life of One Who Is of Christ
[54]  In Galatians 5:24 Paul says, They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts.
[55]  Here the expression they who are of Christ Jesus refers to those who have believed into Christ and have been baptized into Him.
[56]  Therefore, they belong to Christ and are of Christ.
[57]  As believers in Christ, we are now of Christ.
[58]  Galatians 6:12-18 reveals that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the Creator of the new creation, which is the ultimate issue of His cross and His grace.
[59]  Through His cross, Christ crucified not only the religious world but also the flesh.
[60]  Through His death on the cross Christ dealt with the flesh.
[61]  In 6:12-13 Paul speaks of the flesh and the cross of Christ: As many as desire to make a good show in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, but only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
[62]  1 Walking by the Rule of Being a New Creation
[63]  The grace of Christ is with the spirit of the believers who walk by the rule of being a new creation.
[64]  In Galatians 6:16 Paul says, As many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.
[65]  The rule Paul mentions in this verse refers to the rule of being a new creation, of living by the Spirit through faith, having the Triune God as our life and living, in contrast to keeping the law by observing ordinances.
[66]  We need to walk by the rule which is the Triune God processed to be our life and living.
[67]  OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY-THREE EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST
[68]  Although the New Testament reveals many aspects of Christ for our experience and enjoyment, the aspects of Christ in Ephesians are much deeper than those in other books of the New Testament.
[69]  This is because the aspects of Christ revealed in Ephesians are for the producing of the church and the building up of the Body of Christ.
[70]  Ephesians 1:3 says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.
[71]  Following God s choosing us to be holy is His predestinating us to be His sons.
[72]  In eternity past, before the foundation of the world, we were predestinated, marked out, by God.
[73]  Ephesians 1:5 says, Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.
[74]  Through Jesus Christ means through the Redeemer who is the Son of God.
[75]  To be made holy to be sanctified by God by His putting Himself into us and then mingling His nature with us is the process, the procedure, whereas to be sons of God is the aim, the goal, and is a matter of our being joined to the Son of God and conformed to a particular form or shape, the very image of the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29; Col 1:15 , that our whole being, including our body Rom 8:23 , may be sonized by God.
[76]  In Ephesians 1:7 Paul goes on to say, In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace.
[77]  As previously mentioned, verse 6 reveals that we have become the object of God s favor, for we have been graced in the Beloved.
[78]  For Him to work out His plan with us, God needed to accomplish redemption in Christ through His blood in order to solve all the problems between us and God.
[79]  After presenting the revelation of the heading up of all things in Christ, Paul speaks of our being made an inheritance in Christ in order that we may inherit God as our inheritance.
[80]  The phrase in whom refers to the heading-up Christ revealed in verse 10, indicating that we have been placed into the heading-up Christ.
[81]  We are not only God s redeemed ones in Christ but also God s precious inheritance produced in Christ as the sphere and with Christ as the element of life.
[82]  If we live in Christ day by day, we will experience and enjoy Christ not only as the sphere in which we enjoy the dispensing of God Himself into us, but also as the divine element, the producing ingredient, with which God will make us His inheritance.
[83]  In Ephesians 1:19-23 we see that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the means of the divine power.
[84]  In chapter 1 verse 22 Paul indicates that after seating Christ at the right hand of God, God as the divine power subjected all things under His feet.
[85]  Christ s being far above all is one thing; His having all things subjected under His feet is another.
[86]  The former is Christ s transcendency; the latter, the subjection of all things to Him.
[87]  In order to experience the subjecting power, we need to pray, Lord, all things have been subjected under Your feet.
[88]  The Body of Christ is not an organization but an organism constituted of all the regenerated believers for the expression and activities of the Head.
[89]  The Body of Christ is the issue of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, who has come into the church.
[90]  By means of the ascended Christ s heavenly transmission, we are made one with Him, and thus His Body is produced.
[91]  On the day of Pentecost all that Christ had passed through, obtained, and attained was transmitted from the third heaven to the church.
[92]  Ephesians 2:5-10 reveals that Christ is the sphere and element of the creation of God s masterpiece, the believers as a corporate entity.
[93]  This portion of the Word reveals that by the dispensing of His life into the believers, God in the Son has enlivened them together with Christ, raised them up together with Christ, and seated them together with Christ in the heavenlies, thereby creating them in Christ as His masterpiece in order that He might display in the ages to come the surpassing riches of His grace of life.
[94]  Christ is the means by which, the sphere in which, and the element with which God has enlivened us, raised us up, and seated us in the heavenlies.
[95]  Without Christ and outside of Christ, God has no way to enliven us, raise us up, and seat us in the heavenlies.
[96]  In Ephesians 2:10 Paul goes on to say, We are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus.
[97]  Here the Greek word for masterpiece is poiema, which means something that has been made, a handiwork, or something that has been written or composed as a poem.
[98]  We, the church, the masterpiece of God s work, are a poem expressing God s infinite wisdom and divine design.
[99]  Ephesians 2:11-22 unveils that Christ is the Creator of the new man.
[100]  Speaking of Christ, Ephesians 2:14 says, He Himself is our peace.
[101]  The word our refers to both Jewish and Gentile believers.
[102]  Ephesians 3:3-11 reveals that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the mystery of the church.
[103]  This mystery is God s economy, which is to dispense Christ, as the embodiment of God, into God s chosen people in order to produce a Body to be the increase of God s embodiment in Christ, that God may have a corporate expression.
[104]  Regarding Christ as the mystery of the church, verse 6 says that in Christ Jesus the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the Body and fellow partakers of the promise through the gospel.
[105]  The expression fellow heirs indicates that in God s New Testament economy the chosen, redeemed, and regenerated Gentiles and the believing Jews are fellow heirs of God, inheriting God.
[106]  Both the blessing of God s household and the blessing of Christ s Body are particular, whereas the blessing of God s promise is general, all-inclusive.
[107]  e. In Order to Make God s Multifarious Wisdom
[108]  Known to the Rulers and Authorities in the Heavenlies through the Church
[109]  Verse 10 continues, In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church.
[110]  When God s chosen people partake of and enjoy the riches of Christ, they are constituted with those riches to be the church, through which God s multifarious wisdom is made known to the angelic rulers and authorities in the heavenlies.
[111]  In Ephesians 3:14-21 Christ is revealed as the Settler in the hearts of the saints.
[112]  In this passage Paul prays that God the Father would strengthen us according to the riches of His glory with power through His Spirit into our inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith, that we may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints the universal dimensions of Christ and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[113]  Following this prayer, Paul praises God: To God be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations forever and ever.
[114]  Ephesians 3:17 indicates that the result of the Father s strengthening us into our inner man is that Christ makes His home in our hearts through faith.
[115]  Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul the mind, the emotion, and the will plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit Heb 4:12; Acts 11:23; John 16:6, 22; Heb 10:22 .
[116]  According to Ephesians 3:18-19, the result of Christ s making His home in our hearts is that we are full of strength to apprehend the dimensions of Christ the breadth, length, height, and depth and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ.
[117]  To apprehend the dimensions of Christ, we need all the saints, not individually but corporately.
[118]  Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace: one Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
[119]  The Father as the source is in Christ the Lord, who is the embodiment of the Father John 10:38; 14:10; 17:21 ; the Lord is the Spirit, who is the reality of the Lord; and the Spirit is in the Body.
[120]  Through faith we believe into the Lord John 3:36 , and through baptism we are baptized into Him Gal 3:27; Rom 6:3 and terminated in Adam v. 4 . Faith is the means for the Body to be joined to Christ as the Head, and baptism is the means for the Body to be separated from Adam, the old head.
[121]  Through faith and baptism we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ, thereby being joined to the Lord 1 Cor 6:17 .
[122]  1 One Body, One Spirit, and One Hope a Keeping the Oneness of the Spirit
[123]  In verse 3 Paul says, Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.
[124]  To keep the oneness of the Spirit is to keep the life-giving Spirit.
[125]  If we act apart from the Spirit, we are divisive and lose the oneness.
[126]  The essence of the Body of Christ, containing the divinity of the Triune God, has the capacity to supply the divine life Phil 1:19 ; the essence of the Body of Christ, containing the excelling humanity of Jesus, has the capacity to supply this excelling humanity Acts 16:7 ; the essence of the Body of Christ, containing the all-inclusive death of Christ, has the capacity to put to death the negative things Rom 8:13 ; and the essence of the Body of Christ, containing the surpassing resurrection of Christ, has the surpassing capacity of resurrection Phil 3:10 .
[127]  In Ephesians 4:4 the one hope of glory Col 1:27 refers to the transfiguration of our body Phil 3:21 and the manifestation of the sons of God Rom 8:19, 23-25 .
[128]  As saved ones, we have the hope that one day the Lord Jesus will come as our hope of glory and that through Him our vile body will be transfigured Phil 3:21 .
[129]  On the one hand, we appreciate our bodies because they are useful and because without them we cannot exist in this world.
[130]  Therefore, we believers in Christ have the hope that one day our troublesome bodies will be metabolically transfigured by Christ to become glorified bodies.
[131]  In Ephesians 4:7-16 Christ is presented to us as the Giver of gifts.
[132]  In particular, through His death Christ conquered God s enemy Satan, destroyed his power of darkness, and captured from Satan s hand God s chosen people, those who had been taken captive by Satan in his kingdom.
[133]  When Christ ascended up on high, to the third heaven, that was not the end of His traveling.
[134]  Therefore, Christ is the One who descends, ascends, travels, and comes to us in gracious visitations.
[135]  Verse 7 tells us that Christ gives grace to each of His members according to the measure of His gift.
[136]  Concerning the Body of Christ, all the basic elements are one, but the gifts the functions are many and varied.
[137]  Verse 12 tells us that the gifted ones were given to the Body for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.
[138]  The many gifted persons in the preceding verse have only one ministry, that is, to minister Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ, the church.
[139]  Ephesians 1:1 4:16 presents profound and mysterious aspects of Christ for our experience and enjoyment, whereas the rest of the Epistle presents practical and fine aspects of Christ for our experience.
[140]  This indicates that when God in Christ was incarnated as a man, He came with grace and reality; that is, when Christ came, grace and reality came with Him.
[141]  2 No Longer Walking in the Vanity of Our Mind
[142]  Paul s exhortation is to no longer walk as the Gentiles... walk in the vanity of their mind Eph 4:17 .
[143]  The Gentiles are the fallen people, who become vain in their reasonings Rom 1:21 .
[144]  They walk without God in the vanity of their mind, being controlled and directed by their vain thoughts.
[145]  Ephesians 4:30 says, Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.
[146]  To be sealed is to be sealed in the Holy Spirit as the element.
[147]  This indicates that God has sealed us with the Holy Spirit as the sealing element.
[148]  From the time that we are saved, the Holy Spirit as the seal in us seals us continually with the element of God that we may be transformed in nature until our body is completely transfigured and redeemed.
[149]  Based upon the Believers Having Put Off the Old Man and Having Put On the New man
[150]  In Ephesians 4:22 Paul says, You put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit.
[151]  In verse 24 Paul goes on to say, Put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.
[152]  It is based upon our having put off the old man and having put on the new man that we can enjoy Christ as the reality and grace for the living of the new man.
[153]  In our experience, we should cooperate with the Triune God to put off the old man, which He terminated on the cross; we should also cooperate with the Triune God to put on the new man, which He created through Christ s death and resurrection.
[154]  In verse 2 Paul issues a commandment: Walk in love.
[155]  As grace and reality truth are the basic elements in 4:17-32, so love 5:2, 25 and light vv.
[156]  8-9, 13 are the basic elements in the apostle s exhortation in 5:1-33.
[157]  In Ephesians 5:22-32 we see that Christ is the Husband of the church.
[158]  It is such a glorious church that Christ will present to Himself at His coming back.
[159]  Hence, to be glorious is to be God s expression.
[160]  Eventually, the church presented to Christ will be a God-expressing one.
[161]  Ephesians 5:29 says, No one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church.
[162]  To nourish is to feed us with the living word of the Lord.
[163]  Just as a mother tenderly embraces her baby to warm him and feed him, Christ cherishes us by warming us and nourishes us by feeding us.
[164]  e. One with the Church as the Great Mystery
[165]  Verses 30 through 32 say, Because we are members of His Body.
[166]  For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.
[167]  This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.
[168]  Ephesians 6:10-20 reveals that Christ is the constituents of God s armor.
[169]  Ephesians 6:15 says, Having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace.
[170]  In the first part of Ephesians 6:17 Paul goes on to say, Receive the helmet of salvation.
[171]  This is for covering our mind against the negative thoughts directed at us by the evil one.
[172]  Such a helmet, such a covering, is God s salvation.
[173]  Ephesians 6:18 says, By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.
[174]  The expression by means of all prayer and petition modifies the word receive in verse 17.
[175]  By prayer we receive both the helmet of salvation and the word of God.
[176]  This indicates that we need to receive the word of God by means of all prayer and petition.
[177]  We should experience Christ as our girdle of truth; we should experience Christ as righteousness that covers our conscience; we should experience Christ as the gospel of peace to strengthen our stand to fight the spiritual warfare; we should experience Christ as the faith to shield our entire being from the attacks of the enemy; we should experience Christ as salvation to cover our mind against the negative thoughts Satan seeks to inject into our mind; and we should experience Christ as the sword of the Spirit to slay the enemy.
[178]  Ephesians 6:23-24 records Paul s blessing: Peace to the brothers and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[179]  Christ is the peace, love with faith, and grace in our experience in order that we may love Him in incorruptibility, that is, in all that the church is.
[180]  For the proper church life we need to love the Lord in incorruptibility, that is, in and according to all the crucial things revealed and taught in the six chapters of this book, such as the church as the Body of Christ, the new man, the economy of God s mystery, the oneness of the Spirit, reality and grace, light and love, and the items of God s armor.
[181]  We should love the Lord according to the Father s choosing and predestinating us unto sonship; we should love the Lord according to the Son s redemption; we should love the Lord according to the sealing and pledging of the Spirit; we should love the Lord according to the hope of God s calling, according to the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and according to the surpassing greatness of His power which made Christ the Head over all things to the church; and we should love the Lord according to Christ s resurrection which made us alive, resurrected us, and seated us in the heavenlies.
