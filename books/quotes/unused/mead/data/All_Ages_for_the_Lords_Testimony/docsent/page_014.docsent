   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO RANK OR SPECIAL CLASS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the church life we need to take care of the little ones, the weaker ones, and the uncomely ones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must not have any rank; the strong ones should not form into a special class of their own.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the elders are always conscious of the fact that they are elders, they should resign.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The elders should regard themselves as little brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the reason we never use the term "elder" as a title or speak of Elder So-and-so.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In like manner, we should not have the concept of so-called leading sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yes, we have leading ones both in reality and in practicality, but we should not have titles or the consciousness of position.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What a shame it is to seek for position or title in the church life out of ambition!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>NO PRIVATE INTIMACY</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At this point I need to say a strong word: never have a private intimacy with anyone in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No matter how spiritual we may be, we are still in the flesh and influenced by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are truly for the Lord's recovery, we must crucify the flesh and never allow it to form a private intimacy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I can testify that I do not have a personal intimacy with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although I share in responsibility with certain brothers, I rarely go to their homes, and they rarely come to mine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead of private friendship or personal intimacy, there should simply be the fact that we are members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>MINISTERING LIFE AND SHEPHERDING</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Genuine spirituality is seen in ministering Christ as life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A proverb says that if we water others, we shall be watered also Prov 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The spirituality in the church life is not a matter of being in a certain select group; it is a matter of ministering life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Again I say that there is a great need for shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not expect that everyone in the church life will be a spiritual giant.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the contrary, the proper church life is a big family that includes grandparents, young ones, weak ones, and even sick ones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When all the saints are cared for, we shall have a beautiful church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Please forget about eldership and leadership and take care of the practical needs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I hope that many will have the heart to care for those who are discouraged and not in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the very least, call them on the telephone and tell them that you miss them and hope to see them soon.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even such shepherding will help to keep them in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we love the church, let us change our concept regarding leadership and take care of the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we all do this, what a glorious church life we shall have!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE FUNCTION OF ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us now consider the function of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Acts 14:23 says that the Apostle Paul and his co-workers appointed elders in every church, and in Acts 20:28 Paul speaks of the elders of the church in Ephesus as overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Greek words for elder and bishop, or overseer, are presbyteros and episkopos respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Titles for two types of denominational organizations Presbyterian and Episcopalian are taken from these Greek words.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to the Bible, the elders and the overseers are the same people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their responsibility is to exercise oversight; it is not to do all the practical things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, an elder should not spend the whole day sweeping the meeting hall parking lot.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, along with possibly doing some cleaning himself, he should exercise the oversight of the cleaning work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Likewise, the elders should oversee the shepherding of the saints to be sure that all are taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the right way for the elders to function as overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The main responsibility of elders, however, is shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 1 Peter 5:1 Peter refers to himself as a co-elder Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>. Peter was an elder in one locality, whereas some of those addressed in his Epistle were elders in other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The term "co-elder" is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It implies that although the elders are in different localities, they should work together with one another as co-elders.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are shepherding one flock, not many flocks, because the Lord Jesus has just one flock.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Part of this flock is in Anaheim, another part is in Los Angeles, and still another part is in San Diego.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The elders in all the churches are the co-elders, and the Lord Jesus is the head Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Shepherding is the main function of the elders.</S>
