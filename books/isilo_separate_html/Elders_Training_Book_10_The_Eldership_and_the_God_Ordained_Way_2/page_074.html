The Lord's Recovery Being<br>Not Only through Life,<br>but Even the More of the Truth</H2><P>At such a time as this, we need to stress not only the matter of life but also the matter of truth (1 Tim. 3:15). We need to stress the truth concerning the Body and concerning the church ground.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Walk in the Light<br>of the Judgment Seat of Christ</H2><P>We need to remember that whatever we do and whatever we say will be judged by the Lord's coming back at His judgment seat (1 Cor. 4:1-5; 2 Cor. 5:10). Paul was strongly criticized. In such a situation he was forced to say that he did not judge himself, nor did he justify himself; rather, he was waiting for the Lord's judgment at His coming back (1 Cor. 4:3-5). We must walk in this kind of light. It is not just a matter of what we are today. Whatever we are today affects what we will be in the future.</P><P>Even the Apostle Paul was greatly criticized; hence, we should not be disappointed if we are criticized, defamed, and slandered. We ourselves must exercise to have a conscience void of offense (Acts 24:16).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_073.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_075.html">Next</a> </body></html>
