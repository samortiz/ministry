<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given in Chinese by Brother Witness Lee from 1985 through 1990 in Taipei, Taiwan and Anaheim, California. The first seven chapters concern the gospel, Christ, and the church. The last two chapters concern the new way to meet and to serve and the functioning of every member. These messages were not reviewed by the speaker.</p>
