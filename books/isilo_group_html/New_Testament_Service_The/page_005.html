<h1 class="title">FOUR MAIN PRINCIPLES<br />
OF NEW TESTAMENT SERVICE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 1:20b, 23; Gal. 1:11-16; Phil. 3:5-8; 2 Cor. 3:5-6, 8</h1>
<p>What we have pointed out in the preceding chapter can be summarized as four main principles of New Testament service. As we mentioned, the first instance in the New Testament is the birth of Jesus Christ, showing us the principles of New Testament service. For our service today we need to learn the principles rather than try to copy the ways recorded there.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ABSOLUTELY OUT OF RELIGION</h2>
<p>The first principle is that the New Testament service is absolutely out of religion with all its traditions. This is a main principle which we should not forget. New Testament service has nothing to do with religion. In the birth of Jesus, nothing is related to religion. The words &ldquo;religion&rdquo; and &ldquo;tradition&rdquo; were used by the Apostle Paul in Galatians (1:13, KJV). He was in the Jewish religion and had all the traditions of his forefathers. When he was met by the Lord, however, he was delivered out of religion and was through with all the traditions.</p>
<p>When Jesus was conceived in Mary&rsquo;s womb, there was not one bit of religion or tradition. His birth was something which was absolutely new and completely different from the religious background. Mary was greatly surprised when the archangel Gabriel came to her. No one would expect such a thing to happen. It was absolutely new&mdash;new to religion, to culture, to nature, and even to the natural law. It was something contrary to the natural law, but revealed by God and conceived of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The New Testament service is different from religion and tradition in every detail. Even the place where Jesus was brought up was not a great religious center like Jerusalem, but a despised region and a little town. No part of the New Testament service was related to the law, the regulations or written code, but this service was absolutely something of the Spirit. Furthermore, it was begun not in a marvelous and great way, but in a small way, without any advertisement. Everything was small, humble, and low. According to appearances, it was not honorable for a virgin to be with child. No one would boast of such a thing, but this is the New Testament way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Recovery of the Church Life</h2>
<p>Today there is much religious service and work carried on in a way that is contrary to the principles of Christ&rsquo;s birth. In the recovery of the church life, however, these principles must be recovered. If we go out to spread the church life in a way that is so marvelous, so noble, a way that causes us to be so boastful, such a way proves that we are wrong and that we are not in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The recovery of the church life in every aspect will be in principle the same as the birth of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>In a sense, whenever we carry on the New Testament service, that is again the birth of Jesus, for the birth of Christ is simply to bring forth Christ to people. If some of us migrate to another city, there should be a birth of Christ. To migrate in order to spread the church life is to bring forth Christ to the people. This can only be carried out in a new way, not in an old way, not in a traditional, religious way with all its advertisement and propaganda. We should go out in a lowly, humble, and small way.</p>
<p>We may say that the New Testament service is something like the situation of a virgin with child. Sometimes we would even feel ashamed to mention it. Of course, in the eyes of God it is glorious, but in a human sense, it is a shame. When others ask what kind of a work we are doing and what church we go to, it may sometimes be difficult to answer. Apparently, it is not so glorious. That is the case of a virgin with child. Sometimes we may want to tell others that the work we are doing is somewhat like a virgin with child, but the child we are going to deliver is Jesus Christ. There is no glory or honor, but the enemy knows that it is a real glory to God. Man does not know, but the Devil knows, and, praise the Lord, we know also! We know what we are doing.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The New Testament Service &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
