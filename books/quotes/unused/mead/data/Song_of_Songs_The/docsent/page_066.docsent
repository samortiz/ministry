   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Solomon will have his share as well.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The one thousand pieces of silver are the account that we have to give to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is different from what is recorded in Luke 19 and Matthew 25.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There we see a difference based on our gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here the one thousand pieces of silver are what each keeper should give to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we stand before the judgment seat, the Lord has a minimum requirement for each one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This requirement is the one thousand pieces of silver here.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 12 says, "My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The maiden now separates herself from the other keepers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She is not an ordinary keeper of the vineyards of Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Solomon gave her a vineyard once; therefore, she has her own vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This vineyard is now "before me," which means that the vineyard is hers Gen 13:9 and that it is under her direction.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to righteousness, the keepers should pay Solomon a thousand pieces of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to love, should she do less than what the law requires?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of course not!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She should give Solomon a thousand pieces of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here we see two kinds of services.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some serve according to the law, whereas others serve according to love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some serve out of fear, where as others serve out of gratitude.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some serve as a duty, whereas others serve as a joy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although she stands on a higher ground, and although she has a love relationship with the Lord and is different from others who serve Him out of a sense of duty, nevertheless, she does not give less than what the Lord's duty requires.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not only does Solomon receive something; those who keep watch over the fruits also receive something.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She renders rightful glory and praise to all those helping her in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She does not take over their rightful portion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>May God's children not usurp the glory of their co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Lord rewards His workers, she will be included among those keeping the fruits; she will receive the two hundred pieces of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to righteousness, she should only receive the fruits and not the silver S.S. 8:11 . However, all those who serve the Lord in love will find that when they do not take the Lord's work as a commercial enterprise, the Lord will not reward them on a commercial basis.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In addition to receiving her fruits, the Lord bestows glory on her.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The judgment seat should be something along the line of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, the emphasis here is not on responsibility but on love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The question of work and reward should not have been brought up.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, the Holy Spirit mentions it from the standpoint of love, not from the standpoint of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is mentioned because it matches the principle of the whole book.</S>
