   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LORD HAVING BORNE ALL OUR SINS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To take care of this matter, we must first realize that the Lord Jesus has borne all our sins on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the sins which we have committed, as well as those we are committing and will commit during our whole life, were borne by the Lord on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, on the day we believed in the Lord, under God's light we only saw the sins that we had committed before we had believed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A man can only be conscious of the sins which God shines His light upon; he cannot feel the sins which he has not yet committed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the actual sins the Lord Jesus bore on the cross are more than the sins that we see.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus bore all of our sins on the cross, but we see only the sins which we have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may have been saved at the age of sixteen, or you may have been saved at the age of thirty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the sins you committed before your salvation are absolutely and totally forgiven by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, at the time of your forgiveness, the number of sins that you were conscious of was actually much less than the actual number of sins which the Lord bore for you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Your experience of the Lord's grace went only so far as your personal experience of your sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the Lord's work on our behalf was based on His knowledge of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must realize that even the sins that we are not conscious of are included in the Lord Jesus' redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Perhaps you were saved at the age of sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose you had committed a thousand sins during the first sixteen years of your life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You might have said at the time you believed in the Lord, "I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My sins have been forgiven because You have taken away all my sins."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In saying that the Lord had taken your sins away, you meant that the Lord had dealt with your one thousand sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What would have happened if you had been saved at the age of thirty-two instead?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Proportionally, you probably would have committed two thousand sins by the age of thirty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You might have said the same thing: "O Lord, You have borne all my sins."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you were saved at sixty-four years of age, you would have said the same thing: "O Lord, You have borne all my sins."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is quite clear then that the Lord has dealt with the sins that were committed during the first sixteen years of your life as well as the sins that were committed from age sixteen to age sixty-four.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord dealt with all of your sins on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The criminal on the cross did not believe in the Lord until just before he died, but the Lord took away all his sins Luke 23:39-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, the Lord took away the sins of our whole life on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although, when we first believed in the Lord, we only felt the forgiveness of our past sins, in actuality, the Lord took away all our sins, even those we commit after we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must understand this fact before we can understand how to recover our fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE TYPE OF THE ASHES OF THE RED HEIFER</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have a picture of the Lord's vicarious death for our sins in the type of the ashes of the red heifer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Numbers 19 is a very special chapter in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A heifer was used, which speaks of something special.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This heifer was used not to meet a need at that moment but to meet a need in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This, too, is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 2 God told Moses and Aaron, "Tell the sons of Israel to bring you a red heifer without blemish, in which there is no defect, and upon which a yoke has never come."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A heifer, not a bull, was offered here.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Bible gender is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Male signifies everything related to the testimony of the truth, while female signifies everything related to the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a principle we should be familiar with in reading our Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Abraham speaks of justification by faith, while Sarah speaks of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Justification by faith is objective; it has to do with truth and testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Obedience is subjective; it has to do with life and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Throughout the Bible the church is symbolized by females, because the church is subjective, being related to the Lord's work in man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A heifer is used here instead of a bull because it represents another aspect of the Lord's work His work toward man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The red heifer signifies a work that is subjective rather than objective.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What happened to the heifer?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was slaughtered, and its blood was taken and sprinkled seven times directly in front of the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In other words, the blood was offered to God because the work of the blood is always for God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The heifer's blood was sprinkled seven times in front of the tent of meeting, signifying that it was for God and for the redemption of sin.</S>
