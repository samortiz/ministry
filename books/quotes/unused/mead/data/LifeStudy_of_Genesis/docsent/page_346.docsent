   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>e With the Calling on the Name of Jehovah,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Eternal Mighty One</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 33, which tells us that Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, also says that he "called there on the name of the Lord, the Eternal God" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here we see another special title of God Jehovah, El Olam.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapter seventeen we saw El-Shaddai, the all-sufficient Mighty One.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here we see El Olam.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Hebrew word olam means eternity or eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the root of this Hebrew word means to conceal, hide, or veil from sight.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Anything which is veiled spontaneously becomes secret.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Abraham eventually experienced God as the Eternal One, as the secret and mysterious One.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot see or touch Him, yet He is so real.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His existence is eternal, for He has neither beginning nor ending.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is the Eternal God Psa 90:2; Isa 40:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here we find another seed which is developed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The God whom Abraham experienced in chapter twenty-one is the same as the One revealed in John 1:1, 4: "In the beginning was the Word..and the Word was God..in Him was life."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This life is the very El Olam.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The mysterious God in eternity is our eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eternal life is a divine Person who is so concealed, veiled, hidden, mysterious, secret, and yet so real, ever-existing, and ever-living, without beginning or ending.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The title El Olam implies eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here God was not revealed to Abraham but was experienced by him as the ever-living, secret, mysterious One who is the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, in Genesis 21 Abraham experienced God as the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By the tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, Abraham could testify to the whole universe that he was experiencing the hidden, ever-living One as his mysterious life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There, at Beer-sheba, he called on the name of Jehovah, El Olam.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In chapter twelve he only called upon the name of Jehovah, not yet experiencing Him as the God who is the mysterious, ever-living One.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But here in chapter twenty-one, after having so much experience, with Isaac at Beer-sheba under the tamarisk tree he experienced the ever-living, mysterious One as his inner life and called, "O Jehovah, El Olam!"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although no one could see this mysterious One, He was real to Abraham in his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The One we have within us today is the very El Olam, the hidden, secret, concealed, mysterious, ever-living One.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may have the same enjoyment Abraham had simply by calling, "O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While Abraham was sojourning in Beer-sheba, he must have done many things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But here the Scripture only tells us of one thing that Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beer-sheba and called on the name of Jehovah, El Olam.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By this brief record we can see two things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One is that the planting of the tamarisk tree must have been very significant; the other is that this planting of the tamarisk tree is connected with calling on the name of Jehovah, El Olam.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we have pointed out, Genesis 1 and 2 are not merely a record of God's creation but a record of life, with the tree of life as its center.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Likewise this section of the Word is not merely a record of Abraham's history; it also is a record of life, showing by what source Abraham was living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He lived by calling on Jehovah, El Olam, by experiencing the eternal, hidden God as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In New Testament terms, he was experiencing the eternal life flowing with all its riches like a tamarisk tree which expresses the riches of the well by which it lives.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the tree of life is the center of the record in chapters one and two, the tamarisk tree is the center of the record here.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may say that the tamarisk tree is the tree of life experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is the expression of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our Christian life and the proper church life are both a tamarisk tree, expressing the tree of life by which we live.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This goes together with the calling on the Lord who is our eternal life, our Jehovah, El Olam.</S>
