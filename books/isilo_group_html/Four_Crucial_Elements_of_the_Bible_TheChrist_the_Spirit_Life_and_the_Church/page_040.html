This is not for doctrine but for our experience. We have at least two hymns on this matter, Hymns, #609 and #501. Hymn #609 not only speaks of our spiritual experience but also has many references to the Bible. Stanza 3 says, &#8220;The Triune God the Spirit is,/And comes as breath and wind to me.&#8221; In John 20:22 the Holy Spirit as breath is of the essential aspect, while in Acts 2:2-4 the Holy Spirit as wind is of the economical aspect. Essentially, the Holy Spirit as breath enters into us as life; economically, the Holy Spirit as a rushing violent wind is poured upon us as power. Therefore, the Holy Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God is as breath and wind.<p>Stanza 4 of Hymns, #609 says, &#8220;All that the Father is and has/In His beloved Son doth rest,/And all the riches of the Son/Are by the Spirit now possessed.&#8221; This is based on John 16:15, which says, &#8220;All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you.&#8221; Verses 13-14 say, &#8220;But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you.&#8221; The &#8220;He&#8221; in verse 15 is clearly the &#8220;Spirit of reality&#8221; in verse 13. The Spirit&#8217;s declaring to the disciples is His glorifying of the Son in verse 14 and His guiding of them into all the reality in verse 13. Therefore, the meaning of verses 13 through 15 is that all that the Father has is the Son&#8217;s, and all that the Son has is received by the Spirit, and after the Spirit receives, He declares everything to the Son&#8217;s disciples. Such a declaring is the glorifying of the Son, and it is the guiding of the disciples into all the reality. This reality is all that the Son has and all that the Father has. Therefore, stanza 3 of Hymns, #501 says, &#8220;All things of the Father are Thine;/All Thou art in Spirit is mine;/The Spirit makes Thee real to me,/That Thou experienced might be.&#8221;<p>Stanzas 8 and 9 of Hymns, #609 say, &#8220;The Father purposed that the Son/Should be the first in everything;/The Son the Father takes as Head;/And over all His headship brings. / The Spirit perfectly desires/That Christ, the Son, be glorified,/And He reveals Him unto me,/That He be fully testified.&#8221; The Father&#8217;s purposing for the Son to be the first in everything is according to Colossians 1:18, which says, &#8220;And He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things.&#8221; The Son&#8217;s taking the Father as Head is based upon what 1 Corinthians 11:3 says, &#8220;But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.&#8221; Therefore, in the Gospel of John, the Son often indicated that He was obedient to the Father. Everything that He did, He did by the Father and not by Himself because He took the Father as His Head (5:19, 30; 4:34; 17:4; 14:10, 24; 7:18). Stanza 9 of Hymns, #609, as quoted above, is derived from John 16:14. Not one item of human idea or concept can be found in this hymn. Rather, it was written altogether according to experience and by putting together different points of the revelation of the Bible.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Four Crucial Elements of the Bible, The-Christ, the Spirit, Life, and the Church &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
