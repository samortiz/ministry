[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: Jer 1:1-3
[2]  In our life-study of the Word, we now come to the book of Jeremiah.
[3]  Although many of us may not be familiar with Jeremiah, I hope that the Lord will stir up our interest in this book and show us its intrinsic purpose.
[4]  The name Jeremiah in Hebrew means "Jehovah exalts."
[5]  The subject of the book of Jeremiah is Christ being made the righteousness of Jehovah to God's elect as their center and circumference in God's dealings with Israel and the nations.
[6]  No matter how stubborn, wicked, and corrupt Israel, God's elect, may be, God will eventually make Christ the righteousness of Jehovah to them.
[7]  The central thought of the book of Jeremiah is that the God of love, in His everlasting love, earnestly yearns that Israel, His beloved yet distracted elect, would turn to Him from the other gods, all of their idols 2:28; 11:13 , that they may gain His incarnated Christ as the righteousness of Jehovah to them as their central being and universal expression.
[8]  Thus, in spite of the fact that His degraded elect, according to their nature by birth, are wicked 12:1; 30:23 , have a heart which is deceitful above all things 17:9 , and cannot possibly be changed in any way, as the Cushite cannot change his skin or the leopard his spots 13:23 , they may be redeemed from their fall by the redemption of Christ and be saved from their sinful nature, not only from their sin and wickedness, by the divine life of Christ with its divine capacity of the inner life, not with the outward law of dead letters, to be renewed as indicated by the new covenant they have received of God that God could be their God and that they could be God's people 31:31-33 to participate in the enjoyment of the riches of the Triune God.
[9]  This participation of theirs in the riches of God will be in the millennium in the coming age of restoration and will ultimately consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.
[10]  Lamentations 3:22-25 says, "It is Jehovah's lovingkindness that we are not consumed, / For His compassions do not fail; / They are new every morning....
[11]  According to Jeremiah 31:33, this divine law is not only put into our spirit but is also written, inscribed, on our hearts.
[12]  This corresponds to the New Testament teaching about the divine life spreading from our spirit into our heart and mind.
[13]  Jeremiah 31:34 tells us that all the house of Israel will know Jehovah, from the little one to the great one among them.
[14]  OF THE DIVINE REVELATION IN JEREMIAH Scripture Reading: John 5:39-40; Jer 23:6; 33:16; 31:33-34
[15]  In John 5:39 and 40 the Lord Jesus said to the Jewish religionists, "You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life." To "search the Scriptures" may be separated from "come to Me." The Jewish religionists searched the Scriptures but were not willing to come to the Lord.
[16]  The book of Jeremiah reveals that Christ is made the righteousness of Jehovah to God's elect 23:6; 33:16 .
[17]  Someone might answer by saying that Christ must be made the righteousness of Jehovah to God's elect people because in themselves they are wicked and corrupt and altogether without righteousness; and unless Christ becomes righteousness to them, God cannot have anything to do with them.
[18]  We have seen that the subject of Jeremiah is God's carrying out of His economy through the chastisement of Israel, His elect, in love, with His tender care, compassion, and sympathy, and His judgment upon the nations in righteousness, to match His love, that Israel may manifest Christ, who is their divine righteousness as their centrality and universality, by their being made a new creation with the inner law of the divine life and the capacity of this life to know God 31:33-34 .
[19]  Concerning this, I would like to ask the following question: In what way does God make Christ everything, the center and the circumference, to the people of Israel?
[20]  Someone might answer this question by saying that the way God does this is for Christ to be incarnated as the Shoot of David, to be crucified, and then to become the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.
[21]  This, however, is the means by which God makes Christ everything to us; it is not the way in which God makes Christ everything to us.
[22]  Eventually, according to the new covenant, Israel will be redeemed, saved, and renewed so that God will be their God and they will be God's people to participate in the enjoyment of the riches of the Triune God.
[23]  LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE THREE THE INTRINSIC CONTENT OF JEREMIAH Scripture Reading: Jer 2:13; Lam 3:22-25; Jer 23:5-6; 31:33-34
[24]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that the entire Bible, including the book of Jeremiah, was written for God's economy.
[25]  My burden in this life-study of Jeremiah is that you would see what the Lord has shown me from the Word concerning God's economy.
[26]  In Jeremiah 2:13 we see not only something positive the fountain of living waters but also something negative the children of Israel's forsaking this fountain to hew out for themselves broken cisterns, which hold no water.
[27]  God was burdened that Israel would drink Him to become His increase as His fullness that they might express Him.
[28]  WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL Putting His Law within Them
[29]  "This is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares Jehovah: I will put My law within them and write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.
[30]  And they will no longer teach, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for all of them will know Me, from the little one among them even to the great one among them, declares Jehovah, for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more."
[31]  In speaking of the new covenant that He would make with His elect, God said that He would put His law within them.
[32]  In the last part of verse 34 God says, "I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more."
[33]  LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE FOUR GOD'S FAITHFULNESS IN FULFILLING HIS ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Jer 2:13; Lam 3:22-25; Jer 23:5-6; 31:33-34
[34]  God needs to be the fountain of living waters to us because He has an economy.
[35]  In order to be God's counterpart, Adam had to drink of God, to receive God into him that he might have the divine life with the divine nature and the divine element in order to be divine to match God.
[36]  God is faithful in leading us into His economy, and His economy is for us to drink Christ, to eat Christ, to enjoy Christ, to absorb Christ, and to assimilate Christ that God may have His increase with us to fulfill His economy.
[37]  THAT GOD HAS A WAY TO CAUSE US TO MATURE
[38]  Whether we seek God diligently or only a little, God has a way to make Christ our righteousness, our redemption, our life, our life law, and our life capacity so that we can be matured.
[39]  LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE FIVE JEREMIAH'S CALL AND COMMISSION Scripture Reading: Jer 1:4-19
[40]  This portion tells us first how Jeremiah was called by God and then how he was commissioned by Him.
[41]  Verse 6 tells us that to God's call Jeremiah responded with excuses.
[42]  According to verses 11 through 16, in his commission Jeremiah was given to see two visions.
[43]  In verses 17 through 19 we see that Jeremiah was charged by Jehovah.
[44]  In 2:13 Jehovah says of His people, "My people have committed two evils: / They have forsaken Me, / The fountain of living waters, / To hew out for themselves cisterns, / Broken cisterns, / Which hold no water."
[45]  "Israel was holiness to Jehovah, / The firstfruits of His increase" v. 3a . The word increase here means produce from the earth.
[46]  God gained some increase from the earth as produce, and Israel was the firstfruits of this produce.
[47]  God treasured Israel as holiness to Him, as the firstfruits of His increase from His field.
[48]  / And those who handle the law did not know Me, / And the shepherds transgressed against Me, / And the prophets prophesied by Baal / And followed after things that did not benefit them" v. 8 . The priests did not know where God was, and those who handled the law did not know God.
[49]  It was an evil and bitter thing that the people of Israel had forsaken Jehovah their God v. 19 . They forsook Him, the fountain of living waters, and went away from Him to idols.
[50]  Israel exchanged the reality of God for the falsehood, the vanity, of idols Jer 2:5 .
[51]  In 2:32 Jehovah says, "Can the virgin forget her ornaments, /Or the bride her attire?/But My people have forgotten Me / For days without number."
[52]  This word concerning ornaments and attire indicates that God is our ornament and attire; that is, God is our beautification.
[53]  Israel's treacherous sister, the southern kingdom of Judah, saw what Israel did and what happened to her.
[54]  In asking Israel to return, Jehovah made promises to her.
[55]  In verse 12 Jehovah promised that He would not drop His countenance on her; for He is merciful and will not preserve, that is not exercise, His anger forever.
[56]  "At that time they will call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah, and all the nations will be gathered to it because the name of Jehovah is at Jerusalem" Jer 3:17a .
[57]  As a woman acts treacherously by departing from her husband, so the house of Israel dealt treacherously with Jehovah v. 20 . Her children wept and supplicated prayed particularly on the bare indicating without any man heights, for they perverted their way and forgot Jehovah their God v. 21 .
[58]  Eventually, her children came to Jehovah, confessing that He, Jehovah, is their God, admitting that their worship on the hills and mountains in a tumult was in vain and that their salvation surely is in Jehovah their God, and feeling shameful for the sins of their fathers and for their sinning against Jehovah their God since the beginning of their relationship with God vv.
[59]  "Go to and fro in the streets of Jerusalem, / And look now and know, / And seek in her open squares / If you can find a man, / If there is anyone who executes justice, / Who seeks faithfulness; / And I will pardon her" Jer 5:1 .
[60]  "For wicked men are found among My people; / They lie in wait like fowlers crouching; / They set a trap, / They catch men" v. 26 . These wicked men set up a "net" to catch their prey.
[61]  "Prepare war against her; / Rise up, and let us go up at noon./...Rise up, and let us go up at night / And destroy her palaces" vv.
[62]  The enemy will thoroughly glean her remnant like a vine; they will pass their hand again over her branches like a grape gatherer v. 9 . The houses of Israel will be turned over to others, fields and wives together, and the Husband will stretch out His hand over her inhabitants v. 12 . God will stretch out His hand to chastise them.
[63]  LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE NINE A WORD CONCERNING ISRAEL'S HISTORY
[64]  In this message I would like to give a word concerning Israel's history and the situation of Israel in what may be called the sunset of the divine revelation.
[65]  Israel, however, did not obey the commandment to utterly destroy the idol worshippers.
[66]  As Jeremiah went forth to fulfill God's commission, he spoke to the king, the princes, the priests, and to the people.
[67]  Jeremiah told the king that he was sinful and that if he did not repent and return to God, he would be taken captive.
[68]  As the hypocritical worshippers of God, Israel actually Judah committed many evils.
[69]  "This is what I commanded them, saying, Hear My voice, and I will be your God, and you will be My people; and walk in all the way which I command you, that it may go well with you" v. 23 . However, Israel did not listen to the voice of Jehovah their God but walked in the counsels and the stubbornness of their evil hearts and went backward and not forward v. 24 .
[70]  They stiffened their neck and did more evil than their fathers v. 26 .
[71]  "The wise men are put to shame; / They are dismayed and are taken; / Behold, they have rejected the word of Jehovah, / And what wisdom do they have?" v. 9 . Having rejected the word of Jehovah, Israel had no wisdom.
[72]  The bones of the kings of Judah, of its princes, of the priests, of the prophets, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will be brought out from their graves and spread out to the sun, to the moon, and to all the host of heaven, which Israel has loved and served and which she has gone after, sought, and worshipped.
[73]  Jehovah will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a habitation of jackals.
[74]  Jehovah is slinging out the inhabitants of Israel and bringing distress on them v. 18 . He is casting them away like stones.
[75]  In 10:19-25 we have a word spoken by the prophet for the people of Israel.
[76]  LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE TWELVE GOD'S ECONOMY WITH HIS DISPENSING
[77]  IN THE BOOK OF JEREMIAH Scripture Reading: Jer 2:13; Lam 3:22-23; Jer 23:5-8; 31:33-34
[78]  After spending more than sixty-six years in studying the Bible, I can testify that the highest peak of the revelation in the Word is the revelation concerning God's economy and God's dispensing to produce the New Jerusalem.
[79]  In this verse God, through the prophet, presents Himself to the children of Israel as a fountain of living waters.
[80]  Instead of giving such a charge to man, God placed him in a garden, in front of two trees the tree of life, which signifies God, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which signifies Satan Gen 2:9 .
[81]  At this juncture I would like to say a word concerning the law of God.
[82]  Originally, God did not intend to give us the law.
[83]  This means that after God presented His purpose to man, man did not accept God and His purpose but instead began to do things according to himself.
[84]  Apparently God had given up Israel and would have nothing more to do with them.
[85]  The picture portrayed by Jeremiah concerning Israel is a picture of us as believers in Christ today.
[86]  Like Israel, we once had a "bridal day" Jer 2:2 , a time when we pledged our love to the Lord and told Him that we loved Him to the uttermost.
[87]  Regarding this covenant, in Jeremiah 11:3 and 4 Jehovah says, "Cursed is the man who does not listen to the words of this covenant, which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Listen to My voice and do the things according to all which I command you; and you will be My people and I will be your God."
[88]  The first five commandments, based on Jehovah God's uniqueness and jealousy, demand man to honor, serve, and love God as the unique and jealous God Exo 20:3-12 .
[89]  Concerning this, Paul says in Galatians 2:16, "Knowing that a man is not justified out of works of law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we also have believed into Christ Jesus that we might be justified out of faith in Christ and not out of the works of law, because out of the works of law no flesh will be justified."
[90]  Through their failure under the test of the law, Israel was to learn that they are unable to keep the law and that they have no righteousness by the law Rom 8:3a; 9:31; 10:3 .
[91]  God asked Jeremiah to tell His people that He would be sending a drought upon them, and in these verses we have Jeremiah's description of the suffering of Israel during this time of drought.
[92]  Send them out of My sight and let them go" v. 1 . God was so disgusted with Israel that He wanted them taken out of His sight.
[93]  If they asked the prophet where they should go, he was to say, "Thus says Jehovah, / He who is for death to death, / And he who is for the sword to the sword, / And he who is for famine to famine, / And he who is for captivity to captivity" v. 2 . Jehovah went on to say that He would visit them with four kinds of punishment: the sword to slay, the dogs to tear, and the birds of heaven and beasts of the earth to devour and destroy v. 3 . Finally, He said that He would make them a horror among all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem v. 4 .
[94]  / In Your longsuffering do not take me away; / Know that for Your sake I bear reproach" v. 15 . By using the word know in his petition, Jeremiah seemed to be reminding God concerning his situation.
[95]  Because of his suffering and disappointment, he said to his mother, "Woe is me."
[96]  It seems that God spoke in one way according to His feeling and that Jeremiah responded in a different way according to his feeling.
[97]  In 16:1-9 we see Jehovah's restrictions to Jeremiah for His further commission.
[98]  For thus says Jehovah concerning the sons and daughters who are born in this place and concerning their mothers who bear them and concerning their fathers who beget them in this land: They will die grievous deaths and will not be mourned nor buried; they will be as dung on the surface of the ground and will be consumed by sword and by famine, and their corpses will become food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth" vv.
[99]  In his praise Jeremiah said, "O Jehovah, my strength and my stronghold, / My refuge in the day of distress; / To You the nations come / From the ends of the earth and say, / Surely our fathers inherited falsehood / And vanity, in which there is no profit.
[100]  In 17:19-27 we have Jehovah's warning concerning the keeping of His Sabbath.
[101]  God told Jeremiah to go and stand in the gates of Jerusalem and tell all the inhabitants of Jerusalem who enter through these gates that they should take heed to their souls and bear no burden on the Sabbath day.
[102]  LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE SEVENTEEN A FULL PICTURE OF GOD'S ECONOMY
[103]  In this message I would like to give a brief word concerning God's economy as it is presented in the book of Jeremiah.
[104]  In this record of Jeremiah's speaking to Jehovah and Jehovah's speaking to Jeremiah, we see some crucial aspects of God's economy.
[105]  In 15:16 Jeremiah says to Jehovah, "Your words were found and I ate them, / And Your word became to me / The joy and rejoicing of my heart, / For I am called by Your name, O Jehovah, God of hosts."
[106]  Jeremiah 18:1-10 reveals Jehovah as the sovereign Potter, the One with the absolute right over His pottery.
[107]  Israel had stumbled in her ways from the ancient paths, walking on bypaths, on a way not cast up v. 15b . The ancient paths were the right paths, which their forefathers had taken.
[108]  In 19:1-13 God showed Jeremiah that Israel was as a potter's earthenware jar which had been spoiled and needed to be broken.
[109]  This prophecy declares that the God of Israel is bringing evil upon Jerusalem and all its cities because they have stiffened their neck so as not to hear His words.
[110]  Also, He said that they would be fruitful and would multiply v. 3 . Concerning this promise of restoration, verses 7 and 8 go on to say, "Therefore behold, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when they will no longer say, As Jehovah lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; but, As Jehovah lives, who brought up and led back the seed of the house of Israel out of the land of the north and out of all the lands where I had driven them, that they might dwell in their own land."
[111]  "In His days Judah will be saved, / And Israel will dwell securely; / And this is His name by which He will be called, / Jehovah our righteousness" Jer 23:6 .
[112]  This verse reveals that the name of this Shoot is called "Jehovah our righteousness," indicating that Christ, as a descendant of David, is not merely a man but is the very Jehovah who created the heavens and the earth, selected Abraham, set up the race of Israel, and was the Lord of David, the One whom he called Lord Matt 22:43 .
[113]  LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE TWENTY AN ADDITIONAL MESSAGE
[114]  To Bring Us into the Kingdom of the Heavens
[115]  Christ, the son of Abraham, brings us the divine blessing for us to inherit God.
[116]  Galatians 3:29 says, "If you are of Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise."
[117]  Because we are one with Christ, we are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise, inheriting God's promised blessing, which is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God to be our portion.
[118]  If we study the history in the Old Testament, we will see that after God made the covenant with Abraham, His people had failure after failure and defeat after defeat.
[119]  The blessing could not come, because the earth was full of rebellion against God.
[120]  Therefore, God came to a man after His heart 1 Sam 13:14 , David, the son of Jesse, and made a covenant with him.
[121]  God must have a kingdom, a realm, a sphere, on earth with His chosen race to exercise His administration under His full, divine authority.
[122]  LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE ISRAEL'S SIN AGAINST JEHOVAH
[123]  JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT UPON ISRAEL 12 JEHOVAH'S CONDEMNATION OF AND PUNISHMENT UPON THE KINGS AND PROPHETS OF JUDAH 2 Scripture Reading: Jer 21 23
[124]  "One basket had very good figs, like first ripe figs" v. 2a . This basket of good figs signifies those Israelites whom the God of Israel had sent from the holy land to the land of the Chaldeans vv.
[125]  "Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Like these good figs, so I will regard those who are exiled of Judah, whom I have sent from this place to the land of the Chaldeans, for good" v. 5 . We might think that Jehovah would have no regard for the exiles; however, here we are told that He would regard them for good.
[126]  Jehovah said that He would make them a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth for evil, to be a reproach, a proverb, a byword, and a curse in all the places where He would drive them v. 9 . Here byword indicates mocking, and proverb signifies a formal expression of derision.
[127]  Jeremiah's genuine prophecy is in verses 12 through 17.
[128]  In verses 16 through 18 Jeremiah prophesied concerning the king who sat on the throne of David and concerning all the people who dwelt in Jerusalem and who did not go into exile.
[129]  Jehovah will multiply Israel, so that they will not be few.
[130]  He will cause them to be honored, so that they will not be small 30:19b .
[131]  "Behold, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by their hand to bring them out from the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although I was their Husband, declares Jehovah" vv.
[132]  From the time we were saved, we have had the desire that God would be our God.
[133]  "They will no longer teach, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for all of them will know Me, from the little one among them even to the great one among them, declares Jehovah" v. 34a . This word indicates that we will know God to such an extent that we will not need anyone to teach us.
[134]  LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX THE INNER LAW
[135]  THE CENTER OF THE NEW COVENANT Scripture Reading: Jer 31:31-34
[136]  In this message I would like to give a brief further word on the new covenant, focusing on the inner law as the center, the centrality, of the new covenant.
[137]  THE FUNCTION OF THE INNER LAW OF LIFE The Divine Capacity
[138]  As we consider the essence of the inner law of life, we see that this law has another aspect, that is, its function.
[139]  Jehovah went on to say that although He had driven Israel in His wrath and in His great indignation, He would gather them out from all the lands where He had driven them and would bring them back to the holy land and make them dwell there in safety v. 37 . Here we see that Jeremiah came to know God's intention and that His intention, revealed in His word to Jeremiah, became His promise to the prophet.
[140]  According to verse 38, Israel would be Jehovah's people, and He would be their God.
[141]  In Jeremiah 32:40-44 Jehovah said that He would make an eternal covenant with them that He will not turn away from them.
[142]  It is by this covenant that God will not turn away from us and will plant us in Christ, our good land, and Christ in all His aspects will be bought by us.
[143]  C. In the Holy Land There Being a Habitation
[144]  Jehovah will establish the good word which He has spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah v. 14 . He will cause to shoot forth a Shoot Christ of righteousness unto David, who will execute justice and righteousness on the earth v. 15 . This word regarding Christ as the Shoot of righteousness unto David is related to the new covenant, the center of which is the inner law of life.
[145]  As no one can break Jehovah's covenant with respect to the day and His covenant with respect to the night, so that day and night will not be at the appointed time, so His covenant with David His servant can never be broken, so that he will not have a son to reign on his throne.
[146]  Chapter thirty-five gives the example of the Rechabites.
[147]  In the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, Jehovah asked Jeremiah to invite the house of the Rechabites to the house of Jehovah to drink wine.
[148]  However, they would not drink it, because their father Jonadab the son of Rechab had commanded them not to drink wine nor to build a house, nor to sow seed, nor to plant a vineyard, but to dwell in tents all their days.
[149]  Therefore, Jehovah, the God of Israel, was bringing on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil which He had spoken against them.
[150]  However, Jeremiah said to the Rechabites, "Because you have listened to the commandment of Jonadab your father and have kept all his commandments and have done according to all that he commanded you; therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Jonadab the son of Rechab will never lack a man to stand before Me forever" vv.
[151]  In the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, in the fast proclaimed before Jehovah, Baruch read the words of Jeremiah in the book in the house of Jehovah to all the people in Jerusalem and to all the people who came from the cities of Judah.
[152]  A leader among them, after hearing the word, went down to the king's house and told the princes there what he had heard in that book.
[153]  Then the princes sent someone to Baruch to ask him to come to them with the scroll in his hand and read it to them.
[154]  In chapter thirty-eight we have a record concerning the second step of Jeremiah's imprisonment.
[155]  The princes heard Jeremiah speaking to all the people that he who remained in the city would die, but he who went out to the Chaldeans would live and that the city would surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon and he would capture it.
[156]  When the princes heard this, they said to the king, "Let this man be put to death, for he is weakening the hands of the men of war who are left in this city and the hands of all the people by speaking such words to them; for this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm" v. 4 . In reply, Zedekiah the king said, "Behold, he is in your hand, for the king can do nothing against you" v. 5 . Then the princes cast Jeremiah with ropes into a pit in the court of the guard, and he sank into the mire.
[157]  He said to Jeremiah, "I am going to ask you something; do not hide anything from me" v. 14 . Jeremiah replied, "If I tell you, indeed will you not put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me" v. 15 . Then Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah secretly, saying that as Jehovah, who had made his soul, lives he would not put him to death or give him into the hand of those who sought his life.
[158]  After Zedekiah made this promise, Jeremiah said to him, "Thus says Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, If you will indeed surrender to the princes of the king of Babylon, you will live, and this city will not be burned with fire, and you and your house will live.
[159]  In 39:11-14 and 40:1 44:30 we have a record of certain things that happened after the fall of Jerusalem.
[160]  In the seventh month Ishmael of the royal family, one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him came to Gedaliah and ate bread together in Mizpah.
[161]  Jeremiah said that he would pray to Jehovah their God according to their words and that whatever Jehovah answered them he would tell them and not withhold anything from them v. 4 . Then they said to Jeremiah, "May Jehovah be a true and faithful witness against us, if we do not do according to every word with which Jehovah your God sends you to us.
[162]  After ten days the word of Jehovah came to them through Jeremiah, saying that if they would still remain in the land, He would build them up and not tear them down, and He would plant them and not pluck them up vv.
[163]  However, if they would not remain in the land and would not listen to the voice of Jehovah their God, but would go to the land of Egypt and dwell there, then the sword would overtake them in Egypt, and the famine would follow hard after them, and they would die there in Egypt vv.
[164]  In this message I would like to give a word on the biblical principle of being one with God as revealed in the book of Jeremiah.
[165]  The book of Jeremiah unveils how God fulfills His economy by dispensing Himself into His chosen people.
[166]  To take, receive, and keep the word of God, we must be absolutely one with God.
[167]  We must trust in Him, rely on Him, and not have any opinion that comes out of ourselves.
[168]  We should simply enjoy what God has done and what He will do for us.
[169]  In the new covenant we are one with God and let Him write Himself into us as our life and as our life law with its capacity for us to function.
[170]  The principle of the Bible, especially of the New Testament, is that God opens Himself to us that we may enter into Him, receive Him, and become one with Him.
[171]  When Jeremiah finished speaking the words of Jehovah, all the people, including Johanan, accused him of lying.
[172]  They said to him, "You are speaking falsehood; Jehovah our God has not sent you to say, You shall not go to Egypt to sojourn there" 43:2 .
[173]  Refusing to listen to the voice of Jeremiah to remain in the land of Judah, Johanan and all the leaders of the forces took the remnant and went to Egypt.
[174]  Because we, like the children of Israel, were not one with God and did not have the heart to do God's will or take His good pleasure, we offended God, transgressed His ordinances, and committed sins against His commandments.
[175]  LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE THE SPIRITUAL SEQUENCE IN THE BIBLE
[176]  AND IN THE BOOK OF JEREMIAH Scripture Reading: Jer 2:13; 17:9; 13:23; 23:5-6; 31:33
[177]  In this message I have the burden to speak a word concerning the spiritual sequence in the Bible and in the book of Jeremiah.
[178]  The content of this new covenant is the Triune God within us to be our life, our life law, our life supply, our life capacity, and our everything that we may be constituted with God in His life and nature and thereby become His increase, His enlargement, to be His fullness for His eternal expression.
[179]  First, this expression is the church; second, it is the kingdom; and eventually, in the new heaven and new earth, it is the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of the new covenant of God to express God in a corporate way to the uttermost for eternity.
[180]  After writing concerning Israel, God's chosen people, Jeremiah wrote another six chapters, chapters forty-six through fifty-one, concerning Jehovah's judgment upon the nations involved with Israel.
[181]  Jehovah delivered the people of Israel out of the Egyptian slavery and tyranny and brought them into the good land Exo 3:7-8 .
[182]  Jehovah, the God of Israel, punished Amon the most honorable god in Egypt , Pharaoh, Egypt, and her gods and kings, even Pharaoh and those who trusted in him, by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the hand of his servants.
[183]  In the time of the judges, Jehovah delivered Israel into the hands of the Philistines forty years Judg.
[184]  LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT
[185]  The Ammonites took the land of Gad and possessed it with their god Malcam Jer 49:1 .
[186]  Even with such a people, God is very concerned for the widows and the orphans and desires that they, and all human beings, trust in Him.
[187]  Jeremiah 50:2 declares that Babylon is captured, that Bel the chief Babylonian idol Isa 46:1 is put to shame, that Merodach a Babylonian idol is shattered, that her images are put to shame, and that her idols are dismayed Jer 51:17-18 .
[188]  In the fourth year of the reign of Zedekiah the king of Judah, when Seraiah, the quartermaster, went to Babylon with Zedekiah, Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that would come on Babylon, all the words that are written concerning Babylon vv.
[189]  LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN BABYLON THE BEGINNING
[190]  AND THE ENDING OF HUMAN GOVERNMENT Scripture Reading: Jer 50 51
[191]  The political aspect of Babylon the Great includes many material things and many things related to the international trade and commerce upon the earth Rev 18:9-19 .
[192]  Since the whole world has become Roman, under the influence of Roman government and Roman religion, it may seem that God has been defeated.
[193]  LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE THIRTY-EIGHT THE SEPARATION OF THE CHURCH,
[194]  The book of Jeremiah also shows us that God's elect, Israel, was very much involved with the nations.
[195]  Babylon was the nation that destroyed the nation of Israel, the people of Israel, the holy temple of God, the holy city of God, and the holy land of God.
[196]  LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE THIRTY-NINE THE FOUNDATION OF THE NEW COVENANT,
[197]  The content of the new covenant is the Triune God, who has been processed and consummated to become everything to God's chosen people.
[198]  Whereas Christ's ministry is a ministry of justification, Moses' ministry was a ministry of condemnation 2 Cor 3:9a .
[199]  In chapter thirty-one Jeremiah laid the foundation of the new covenant, prophesying that God will put His law within us; that He will write His law into our mind that we may know God; that God will be our God and we will be His people; that we will not need anyone to teach us, because we will all have a teaching life within us; and that God will forgive our iniquity and remember our sins no longer.
[200]  If we understand this portion in light of the entire New Testament, we will see that in this new covenant we have the church, the kingdom of God, God's household, the house of God as God's dwelling place in our spirit, the new man, and the Body of Christ as the fullness of the processed and consummated Triune God.
[201]  LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE FORTY THE KERNEL OF THE BOOK OF JEREMIAH Scripture Reading: Jer 2:13; 17:9; 13:23; 23:5-6; 33:16; 31:33
[202]  In this message I would like to give a very brief concluding word to this life-study of Jeremiah.
[203]  To the Samaritan woman who had come to the well to draw water and whom the Lord Jesus had asked to give Him a drink, He said, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water" v. 10 . When she asked Him where He could get this living water, He answered, "Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life" v. 14 . The Lord's word here indicates that whatever we drink becomes one with us.
[204]  Another aspect of the kernel of the book of Jeremiah is the exposure of what we are in our fallen condition.
[205]  Outwardly, we are justified, having Christ as our righteousness, but inwardly we are still empty.
[206]  Therefore, we need Christ to be something else to us.
[207]  This life is a law which works in us to dispense into our being all that God is in His rich being.
[208]  Inwardly, He is the divine life to fill us, to make us one with God, and even to constitute us with God that we may live God.
