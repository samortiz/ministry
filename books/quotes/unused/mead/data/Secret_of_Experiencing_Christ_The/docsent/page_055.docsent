   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD AND THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we take in the Word in a proper way, we have both faith and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In a very real sense, the Word, the Spirit, and faith are one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At least they are of one source, and that source is God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the unique source, God is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"In the beginning was the Word..and the Word was God" John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Have you ever realized that the greatest wonder in the universe is the Word of God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Creation, redemption, regeneration, sanctification, and transformation all take place by the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If God had been silent that is, if there had been no Word there could have been no creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Creation came about through God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When God spoke, all the items of creation came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How marvelous that our God is a speaking God!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This speaking God is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Regarding this, John 1:1 is a strategic verse, for this verse declares that the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we had written the Gospel of John, instead of "In the beginning was the Word," we might have said, "In the beginning was God."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But at the opening of the Gospel of John, John puts the Word before God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some readers may think that John was mistaken in doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Who is the source, God or the Word?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There can be no doubt that God is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why, then, did John put the Word first?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why did John not say, "In the beginning was God, and God was the Word"?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The reason John put the Word first is that nothing comes into existence apart from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was through the Word that all things have come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The entire Gospel of John is built upon the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, the church life is founded on the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we had not heard the preaching of the Word of God, we could not have been saved and regenerated, and we could not have become a part of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Word is the source of re-creation as well as of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE WORD, FAITH, AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the New Testament, whenever we hear the Word, faith is produced within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Faith is a marvelous thing; no one can fully explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I was young, I heard a preacher define faith by saying that faith is like the assurance a member of a political party has that the policy of that party will be a success in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This may be a definition of secular faith or worldly faith, but it has nothing to do with the faith spoken of in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We simply are not able to define adequately what genuine faith is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But by our experience we know that when we come to the Bible in a proper way and repeat a certain verse, we are inspired, and faith is produced within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more we repeat a portion of the Word of God, the more we are inspired.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no true inspiration, however, in repeating the words of Plato, Confucius, or any other philosopher.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible is inspiring because it is the Word of life, the living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is living because it is the expression of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to John 1:1, the Word is God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to John 6:63, the words spoken by the Lord Jesus are spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, the Word is both God and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John 4:24 says, "God is Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible reveals that it is impossible to separate the Word, God, Christ, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Word is God, Christ, and the Spirit.</S>
