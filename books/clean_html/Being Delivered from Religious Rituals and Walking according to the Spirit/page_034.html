<h2 class="head1">THE MEETINGS BEING AN EXHIBITION<br />
OF OUR CHRISTIAN LIVING</h2>
<p>The way we function in the meetings depends on the way we live our life. First Corinthians says that Christ is the portion given to us by God (1:2), and Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God (v. 24), who became righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us (v. 30). He is everything to us. Christ is the First and the Last. He is the first One raised from among the dead, and He is also the last Adam (15:20, 45). He is also the second man (v. 47). After He accomplished redemption, He became the life-giving Spirit so that we may be joined to Him as one spirit (v. 45; 6:17). Now we are learning to live by our mingled spirit. Our living is to experience and enjoy Christ in our spirit. This is to live by our spirit. Our meetings are an exhibition of this living. Christian meetings are the exhibition of our Christian life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEETINGS NEEDING A STRONG SPIRIT<br />
AND HAVING CHRIST AS THE CONTENT</h2>
<p>The meetings are an exhibition of our living when we use a strong spirit to exhibit the Christ we have experienced. Christ is the &ldquo;harvest&rdquo; that we exhibit. Hence, we must pay attention to two important points: our spirit must be strong, and Christ must be our content. We need a released spirit, and we must be filled with the riches of our experience of Christ. This is a basic principle.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 2:1-2 shows how Paul was among the Corinthians: &ldquo;I, when I came to you, brothers, came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the mystery of God. For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s speech and proclamation were &ldquo;not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power&rdquo; (v. 4). He did everything according to the expression and demonstration of the Spirit. His speech was simple, not eloquent, but it expressed the Spirit. His speaking was the expression and demonstration of the Spirit and of power.</p>
<p>When Paul was with the Corinthians, his spirit was strong, but his speech was not eloquent, nor did he express human wisdom. When he opened his mouth, his spirit came forth. He did not express eloquence, literary attainments, or philosophy; rather, he demonstrated his spirit. The content of the demonstration of his spirit was not mathematics, science, or philosophy; it was Christ. Christ was Paul&rsquo;s content. This should be a pattern for our meetings.</p>
<p>When Paul was with the Corinthians, he demonstrated a strong spirit, and Christ was his content. In the same principle, we should have a strong spirit, and Christ must be our content in our meetings. Our spirit must be strong, and it is released through our speaking. The content of our speaking should not be stories about our daily affairs, nor should we relate how gracious God has been to us or how we have received His care. The content of our speaking should be Christ, the mystery of God. We should minister Christ with a strong spirit. This is the meaning of prophesying. Our speaking in the meetings is to exhibit, to display, the Christ we have experienced. In this way we present Him as our offering to God and, at the same time, supply Him as food to others. Furthermore, we also enjoy Him. This is the meaning of prophesying.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING NEEDING A STRONG SPIRIT<br />
AND HAVING CHRIST AS THE CONTENT</h2>
<p>To prophesy is to declare Christ with human words. It is to speak forth Christ as the mystery of God. According to chapter 14, the most important matter in a Christian meeting is to prophesy. Prophesying is the most important element in the Christian meeting. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.&rdquo; Verse 12 says, &ldquo;Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.&rdquo; Prophesying is the gift that builds up the church. Verses 23 through 25 say that if an unbeliever is present in our meetings and we speak in tongues, he will say that we are insane because he cannot understand us, but if an unbeliever is present and we all prophesy, he will be convicted and examined by all. Furthermore, he will worship God and declare that God is among us. Verse 31 says, &ldquo;You can all prophesy one by one.&rdquo; The above verses show that prophesying is the main activity in the Christian meeting.</p>
<p>In order to prophesy, our spirit must be strong, and Christ must be the rich content of our speaking. These two matters&mdash;a strong spirit and Christ as the content&mdash;are the conditions for prophesying. We should prophesy whenever we meet.</p>
