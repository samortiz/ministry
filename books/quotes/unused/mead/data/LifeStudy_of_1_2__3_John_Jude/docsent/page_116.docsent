   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WATER, THE BLOOD, AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 5:6 John goes on to say, This is He who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ; not in the water only, but in the water and in the blood; and the Spirit is He who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He, Jesus Christ, came as the Son of God so that we may be born of God and have the divine life John 10:10; 20:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is in His Son that God gives us eternal life 1 John 5:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jesus, the Man of Nazareth, was testified to be the Son of God by the water He went through in His baptism Matt 3:16-17; John 1:31 , by the blood He shed on the cross John 19:31-35; Matt 27:50-54 , and also by the Spirit He gave not by measure John 1:32-34; 3:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By these three, God has testified that Jesus is His Son given to us 1 John 5:7-10 so that in Him we may receive His eternal life by believing in His name 5:11-13; John 3:16, 36; 20:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The water of baptism terminates people of the old creation by burying them; the blood shed on the cross redeems those whom God has chosen from among the old creation; and the Spirit, who is the truth, the reality in life Rom 8:2 , germinates those whom God has redeemed out of the old creation by regenerating them with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus they are born of God and become His children John 3:5, 15; 1:12-13 to live a life that practices the truth 1 John 1:6 , the will of God 2:17 , the righteousness of God 2:29 , and the love of God 3:10-11 for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 5:6 John says that the Spirit testifies because the Spirit is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Spirit, who is the truth, the reality John 14:16-17; 15:26 , testifies that Jesus is the Son of God, in whom is the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By thus testifying, He imparts the Son of God into us to be our life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 6 truth denotes the reality of all that Christ is as the Son of God John 16:12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verses 7 and 8 say, Because there are three who testify, the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are for the one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For the one also means unto the one, that is, unto the one thing, the one point or purpose in their testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First John 5:6-8 says that God testified that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God testified this in three steps: by water, by the blood, and by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The water refers to the baptism of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the record of the four Gospels, immediately after the Lord came up from the water, the heavens were opened and a voice declared that He is God s beloved Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That was God s testimony that Jesus Christ is His Son, the testimony by water, by baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Three and a half years later, the Lord Jesus died on the cross, shedding His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Someone standing near the cross testified, after the Lord died, that He was God s Son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That was the testimony of God by blood concerning Jesus Christ being the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Following this, we have the testimony of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we read 5:6 carefully, we shall see that the Lord Jesus came through water and through blood, but we are not told that He came through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then in verses 7 and 8 we are told clearly that there are three who testify, and that these three are the Spirit, the water, and the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ came through the water, through the blood, and as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Of course, He did not come as the water or as the blood, but eventually, in resurrection, He came as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, according to verse 6, Christ came in the water and in the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But this verse does not say that He came in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Concerning the Spirit, this verse has the thought of being, for we are told, The Spirit is He who testifies.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we need to see clearly that Christ came through the water, through the blood, and as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The phrase through water and blood refers to the baptism at the beginning of His ministry and to crucifixion at the end of His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After this, in resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit, and thus He came as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Son of God came through water and through blood, that is, through His baptism and through His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may also say that He came in the water and in the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then He came not through the Spirit nor in the Spirit, but as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The water of baptism terminates the old creation, and the blood shed on the cross redeems whatever God has chosen of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the Spirit comes to germinate what God has chosen and redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, here we have termination, redemption, and germination.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the old creation, we have been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But as God s chosen ones we were first redeemed and then germinated to be the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This new creation is a composition of God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By these three steps of termination, redemption, and germination, Jesus Christ has not only been testified as the Son of God, but has also entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Through the water of His baptism, through the blood of His cross, and as the Spirit, Christ has been testified as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By these three steps He has also come into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that by termination, redemption, and germination, Christ is now within us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hallelujah, we are a terminated, redeemed, and germinated people!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are no longer the old creation; we are the new creation with the new birth and a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because we are the children of God, we have the life ability to overcome the world and all negative things.</S>
