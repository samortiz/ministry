<h2 class="head2">The Intrinsic Factor of Such Blowing Teachings</h2>
<p>With the winds of teaching there is talk about the Bible and about spiritual things, but what is the intrinsic factor of such teaching? In 1933 a brother among us received a note from Brother Watchman Nee that said, &ldquo;Do the right thing in the right way with the right spirit.&rdquo; This word became a wonderful saying to me. I need to remember all the time to do the right thing in the right way with the right spirit. The things that are being done today related to these winds of teaching are not the right thing, they are not done in the right way, and they are not done in the right spirit. What is being done is wrong, the way is wrong, and the spirit in which it is done is even more wrong. What is being spoken in the winds of teaching are either entire lies or half-truths, which are also lies. Half-truths and innuendos are more evil than a straight lie. The intrinsic factor of such blowing teachings is the sleight of men&mdash; man&rsquo;s subtle ways of cheating. The sleight of men is the craftiness of men with a view to a system of error&mdash;man&rsquo;s plotted deception to induce people into the satanic system of error (Eph. 4:14). The system of error is of the enemy, Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PURPOSE OF THE WINDS OF TEACHING</h2>
<p>Now we need to go on to see the purpose of the winds of teaching. The purpose of the winds of teaching is the evil purpose of the enemy Satan, which is versus the eternal economy of God. Their purpose is to overthrow the faith of some believers. Some of the saints&rsquo; faith has been overthrown by the winds of teaching. They may not oppose the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, but they have lost their faith in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. They are neutral. They do not come to the meetings regularly, and they are not so concerned about the Lord&rsquo;s interest as they once were. They have been spoiled.</p>
<p>The purpose of the winds of teaching is to devastate the church life (Acts 8:3). This is what Saul of Tarsus did before he became Paul the apostle. Also, the purpose of the winds of teaching is to frustrate the building up of the organic Body of Christ, to tear down the building up of the organic Body of Christ, and to divide the members of the organic Body of Christ&mdash;causing endless divisions (sects) in hatred and jealousy, instead of keeping the unique oneness of the Body of Christ in love and kindness (1 Cor. 1:10-11). According to our past history, the instigators of any storm in the recovery all became very divisive. They even divide among themselves. Their division is endless. There is no love or kindness with them. What they do is full of hatred and jealousy.</p>
<p>Now we have seen the purpose of the winds of teaching and their intrinsic factor, which is the sleight of men in craftiness with a view to bring people, to usher people, into a satanic system of error. Those who get brought into Satan&rsquo;s system of error are finished with the building up of the Body of Christ in the central lane of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>I am so thankful to the Lord that the majority of the saints in the churches have the proper discernment. They will not be shaken, tossed about, or carried away. Thank the Lord that we are still here in the advance of His recovery today!</p>
