<p>A young person who is without opinions and prejudices can be used by God. According to the record of the creation of man at the beginning of Genesis, God created man for three functions. First, man was created in God&rsquo;s image in order to express God (1:26). God desires to be expressed through man. If we want to express God, we need to let go of our opinions because the most frustrating thing to God is our opinions. Our opinions are a great hindrance to the expression of God. When we hold on to our opinions, we become old, and God cannot use us. As a consequence, we lose God.</p>
<p>If we want to be blessed, we must drop our opinions. We have to let go of our prejudices, put away our biases, empty ourselves from within, and say to the Lord, &ldquo;I do not know anything, and I have nothing. I do not want anything. I want to be an empty vessel for Your use.&rdquo; We must have thorough prayer, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I want to be a young person, not an old person. Empty me. Empty not only the sins and the world but also my opinions, prejudices, biases, and assertions. I want to be an empty vessel to be filled with You and to express You according to Your image.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Second, man was created to exercise dominion for God (v. 26). God created man in His image and gave him the authority to exercise dominion for Him. When we have God&rsquo;s image, we have God&rsquo;s dominion. God uses man not only for His expression but also to exercise His dominion. Today we need to overcome our circumstances, we need to overcome all the persons, things, and affairs that bother us, and we need to overcome the attacks of Satan. We do not need to strive in ourselves, because striving is vain. We need to be young and to let God occupy us and fill us. When God fills us, Satan will spontaneously be under our feet. When we have God&rsquo;s image, we have God&rsquo;s dominion. When we are full of God, we are full of God&rsquo;s authority. When we have God&rsquo;s authority, the authority of darkness is under our feet, and all our circumstances are under our feet. When our inner being is occupied by God, we bear God&rsquo;s image and exercise God&rsquo;s dominion to deal with His enemy.</p>
<p>Third, man was created to contain God&rsquo;s life. In order to express God and deal with Satan, we must receive God&rsquo;s life. When we empty ourselves, God will fill us with His life. After God created man with His image and gave him dominion, God put man in front of the tree of life so that he would partake of the tree of life (2:8-9), that is, so that man would take God in as life. God&rsquo;s life is in man so that man can express God&rsquo;s image and exercise God&rsquo;s dominion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD CREATING MAN WITH A SPIRIT TO RECEIVE HIM</h2>
<p>In order for man to fulfill this threefold function, God created man in a particular way: He created man with a spirit. Man&rsquo;s outer shell was made from the dust of the ground (v. 7). This fact is fully proven by science, which shows that the composition of the human body is the same as dust or clay from the ground. In clay there are salt, sulfur, calcium, iron, copper, and other elements. In the composition of the human body, these elements also are present. However, our body is only an outer shell. Within us there is a spirit, which was formed when God breathed the breath of life into man (v. 7). Every man has a spirit within him (Prov. 20:27; Job 32:8).</p>
<p>God created man with a spirit because He is Spirit (John 4:24), and His purpose is that man would receive Him as Spirit in man&rsquo;s spirit. Consider the matter of air. If our body did not have a breathing organ, we would not be able to receive air into us. Thankfully, our body has a breathing organ to breathe in air. Similarly, we have an organ that is able to receive God who is Spirit. This organ is our human spirit. Our spirit is a God-receiving organ.</p>
<p>We can also consider a camera. Once a camera shutter opens, the film within the camera receives light from the outside, and this light imparts the scenery onto the exposed film. Second Corinthians 4:6 says, &ldquo;The God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts.&rdquo; Man has a spirit, and our spirit is like the film in the camera. Whenever we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; we &ldquo;take a picture.&rdquo; This is very practical. Animals do not have a spirit. No matter how much a puppy barks or how much a cow moos, they are not taking any &ldquo;pictures.&rdquo; Even though the chirping of a bird is quite pleasant to the ear, there is no receiving that results from its chirping. However, when we call on the name of the Lord, our inner being is &ldquo;exposed,&rdquo; because we receive the Lord by calling on His name.</p>
<p>Through our study of the Bible and our experiences over the past several decades, we have discovered that the spirit within man is like photographic film that can receive the Lord as the Spirit. Hence, we need to open our being continually. We need to say, &ldquo;O Lord, Amen. O Lord, Hallelujah! O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&rdquo; This is the way for us to receive the Lord.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
