   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR CHRIST IS THE "I AM" Scripture Reading: Exo 3:13-14a; John 8:28a</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From eternity to eternity, our God is God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is not limited by time and space, because He is from eternity to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, we want to see how God is not limited by time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The psalmist once prayed to God, "Teach us to number our days,/That we may gain a heart of wisdom" Psa 90:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If men are wise, they should know how to number their days.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But what about God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is no way to count God's days because He is God from the ages to the ages; He is God from eternity to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second Peter 3:8 tells us "that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years like one day."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Man can never have this view.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we treat an hour as a week, or a week as an hour, we will throw many things into disorder.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As men we cannot live without dealing with time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But God sees one day as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day; He is not limited by time, and He is not bound by time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is God; therefore, He transcends time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>GOD IS THE "I AM"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we want to learn to go on and to know God, we need to realize that God has one characteristic: He is beyond time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot measure God by time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All of God's works are beyond the limitation of time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we want to contact God, to gain some spiritual experience, or to receive some spiritual help, we have to learn to get away from the concept of time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whoever wants to pursue God and know God must not be bound by the concept of time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to see another very special matter: God is the present God, the God of today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, there is no concept of time in God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not to say that God does not have time, but God does not have the concept of time, and God is not bound by time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Human beings divide time into periods.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To us, one period of time belongs to the past, another period of time belongs to the future, while we call a third period of time the present time, or today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever we think of time, we always think of the past, the present, and the future.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everyone thinks in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, in our communication with God, there is only one time period the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God does not have the past.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In God all the past is the present.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God does not have the future either.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In God all the future is the present.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are not saying that God does not have time, but time as we think of it does not exist in God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our time is the past, the present, and the future, but God's time is eternally present; it is continuously, eternally present.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In God, neither the past nor the future exist.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Bible, God has the name Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jehovah means that God is the self-existing and eternal God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is the One who now IS and who forever IS.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Revelation 1:4 God is called "Him who is and who was and who is coming."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From man's view, He is the One who was, who is, and who is to come; there is a distinction of the past, the present, and the future.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever the Bible mentions God's past, present, and future, it is with man's realization in view.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But as far as God's name is concerned, He is the eternal One.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no concept of time in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If there is, it is always the present, and this present is forever unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For instance, a father's birth is always earlier than that of his son.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This fact is true not only today, but forever.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God is the God who now is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is forever the God who now is.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is an assured fact.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God Himself is unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What we think of as the past and the future does not apply to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God is forever the God who is.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The only tense God has is the present tense.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Exodus 3, God told Moses His name the self-existing and ever-existing One, which, according to the original text, can be translated as "I AM THAT I AM."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The time of the "I AM" is present.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God said to Moses, "I AM THAT I AM," which meant "I am the One who now is."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As far as God Himself is concerned, He is the God who now is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hebrews 11:6 says, "But without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to Him, for he who comes forward to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To please God we must believe.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But what must we believe?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must believe that "He is."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"I AM" is what He calls Himself, while "He is" is what others call Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not believe in God as the God of the future, because for God there is no future; nor should we believe in God as the God of the past, because for God there is no past.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This teaching may bewilder even the most intelligent persons.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>From man's point of view, we always think that something belongs to the past, something belongs to the future, and something belongs to the present.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We always divide time into the past, the present, and the future.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But with God, there is neither a past nor a future.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Why then does God's Word mention the past and the future?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It mentions them because for human beings, there is always a need to reference things to the past or the future; otherwise, our mind could not comprehend or understand what is being discussed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To say that God is the God who now is does not refer to the "now" in time as we know it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Rather, it refers to the fact that God is the One who forever is in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In God there is no past, present, or future.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God is the God who now is.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In John 8:28, the Lord Jesus said to the Jews, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The meaning of the "I am" in this verse is the same as the meaning of "I AM" in Exodus 3.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He was not saying, "I was" or "I will be," but "I AM," that is, "I AM NOW."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This means that He is God; He is a God who now is.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Jews countered the Lord and said, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>57-58 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When the Jews heard this, they took up stones to cast at Him, because the "I am" that the Lord spoke of here is the same as the "I am" in verse 28.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Jews knew this "I am."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>So they took up stones to cast at Him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Furthermore, when Judas led others to arrest Jesus and the Lord said, "I am," they drew back and fell to the ground John 18:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Lord is the "I am."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Once this God appears, no one can stand before Him; everyone has to fall to the ground.</S>
