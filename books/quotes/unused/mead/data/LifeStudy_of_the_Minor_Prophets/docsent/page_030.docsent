   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Devastate the Land of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The nation mentioned in Joel 1:6a came to devastate the land of Jehovah, devouring and breaking the people into pieces and making the land a desolation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>6b-7a; 2:3; Dan 7:7; Isa 10:3; Jer 25:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because of this desolation, there were no food to feed the people and no wine to cheer the people Joel 1:5, 7, 10-12, 16a, 17 , no meal offering and no drink offering for the priests to offer to God in His temple vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>9, 13, 16b , and no pasture for the beasts, herds of cattle, and herds of sheep vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From Nebuchadnezzar,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>the First King of the Babylonian Empire,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>to the Last Caesar of the Roman Empire</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The empires that have devastated the land of Jehovah include the empires from Nebuchadnezzar, the first king of the Babylonian Empire, through the Medo-Persian Empire and the Macedonian and Grecian Empire, to the last Caesar Antichrist of the Roman Empire Dan 7:2-8; 8:3-14; 11:2-45; Rev 13:1-18; 17:11-14; 19:19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Babylon actually began with Babel, which was founded by Nimrod Gen 10:8-10 , the first type of Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible likens these four empires to locusts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A plague of locusts is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In just one day an entire harvest can be consumed; nothing can stop the devouring locusts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The armies of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome were like locusts coming to devastate Israel totally, devouring their people, land, fields, produce, food, and drink and cutting off their offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Apparently, these four empires are human like the great human image representing the totality of human government.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, in the sight of God they are beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Babylon is the lion; Medo-Persia is the bear; Greece is the leopard; and Rome, being the totality of the first three, is the most wild and devastating beast of all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ultimately, these four empires are four horns used by Satan to devastate God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The prophecies concerning this are now history.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Daniel 7:12 says, As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but an extension of life was given to them for a season and a time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that as each empire was defeated, although its dominion was taken away, its culture was adopted by each succeeding empire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus each empire continued to live.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The culture of Babylon was adopted by Medo-Persia; the culture of Medo-Persia was adopted by Greece; and the culture of Greece was adopted by Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From this we see that the Roman Empire inherited the cultures of the three foregoing empires.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The dominion of the Roman Empire is over, but its life, its culture, continues.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In a sense, we all are Roman citizens, for we are under the influence of the spirit of the Roman Empire, especially in the matters of politics and law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today the world s culture is Roman, yet, being an accumulated culture, it contains the cultures of the Babylonians, Persians, and Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible covers four things: God s chastisement on His elect people, God s punishment of the nations, the manifestation of Christ, and the restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These four matters are covered in Joel, a short book of three chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First, God sent the locusts to devastate Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was His chastisement for Israel s great evils.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Second, this book reveals that God will punish and judge the Gentile nations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Third, Joel speaks concerning the outpouring of the processed, consummated, compound Spirit, the Spirit of God compounded with Christ s humanity, Christ s death and its effectiveness, and Christ s resurrection with its power.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the Holy Spirit who was poured out on the day of Pentecost, and this Spirit is the consummated Christ for the manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This manifestation began with the incarnation of Christ and has been confirmed and strengthened by the outpouring of the Spirit because, through that outpouring, the individual Christ became the corporate Christ, initiating the church life and the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church is the great mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh 1 Tim 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, we are the manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now we are awaiting the fourth matter revealed in the book of Joel the glorious day of restoration, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the revelation of the Bible, and this is the history of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The four empires signified by the locusts are very worldly, but they are used by God s Craftsman Christ Dan 2:34-35 as His instrument to chastise Israel and punish the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way God is accomplishing whatever is needed for Christ to be manifested in full, that the entire universe may be fully restored.</S>
