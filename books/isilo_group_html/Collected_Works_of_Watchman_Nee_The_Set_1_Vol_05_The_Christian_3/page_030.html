Watchfulness is the most tiring and burdensome thing. To be watchful means that one has to preserve himself from sleep. Man's heart is prone to weariness and is most unwilling to be on the alert for the things happening in the world. Unless we are drawing near to Christ, and unless we feel His searching and supervising, it is difficult for us to be watchful. Even in our works, we need to be watchful. If we draw near to Christ, we will have a clear view concerning everything. However, a tendency toward generality will rob us of this view. If we consider our trials in the presence of Christ, we will see that the way of deliverance is very easy, but many times when we are in the midst of the trials, we lose this view. In trying circumstances, it is very easy for us to lose the clear view before Christ on account of sorrow and weariness. Our eyes must be single to do the will of God. The more humble we are, the simpler we will become. If we are simple enough, God will guide us through His Spirit and His word. The wise ones cannot know God through searching and studying, yet a babe can receive the wisdom of God by faith. We must be watchful and must remain in God's light so that we know where we stand. Foolishness is not God's will. It is neither God's pleasure to work in a dream. Every time we put our foot forward to take a step, we have to know if the One sitting in heaven approves of it or not.</P><P>"If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you." If believers are not watchful, their end will indeed be solemn! "I will come as a thief." This is the way the Lord deals with the world. To the world, "like a thief in the night, so the day of the Lord comes" (1 Thes. 5:2). But to the believers, the Lord's word was "you, brothers, are not in darkness that the day should overtake you like a thief" (v. 4).</P><P>If believers are not watchful, they will be treated like the worldly people! Positionally speaking, they are God's children, but in conduct, they are like those in the world. For this reason, they will be treated the same way as those in the world are treated when Christ comes back. Their works are not completed before God because none of them matches the grace God has bestowed. What God is saying here is that if one does not walk according to what the Lord has given him, and if he is not watchful but slumbers like the world does, he will suffer what the world will suffer. Have these ones not followed the ways of the world already? They must now be careful, lest they suffer the punishment that the world will suffer. If one enjoys the pleasure of the world, he should suffer the judgment of the world.</P><P>The Holy Spirit gives a comparison between the true believers and the worldly people in 1 Thessalonians 5. He is comparing the prepared believers with the unprepared ones. The Lord tells us how a saved believer, like the believers in Sardis, if unwatchful, will suffer loss. The unwatchful Christian will suffer what the world suffers. The Lord did not rebuke them as He rebuked Jezebel. But since they are not much different spiritually than those in the world, except for the fact that they are saved, they will suffer the judgment reserved for the world. This has nothing to do with the matter of salvation. It has to do with being delivered from the great coming world tribulation (Rev. 3:10).</P><P>What a solemn matter this is! Many believers around us today have been saved, but positionally speaking, they have joined themselves to organizations that put the Lord to shame. In works, they have forgotten what they have received and heard. In life, they sleep like the worldly people do! Now we are constantly in touch with this kind of people. When we consider the judgment in the house of God in the future, do not our hearts tremble? The day is coming fast, but we do not know how fast it will be. We cannot find anything else more solemn than this in the Bible-saved believers will suffer the same treatment as those in the world.</P><P>"I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you." The word "come" here is a special word. This word means that the Lord has come; He has stopped His action, because He has arrived at the destination. This means that the Lord has already come and is already in the air. His move has come to a stop there. Those who are watchful and prepared have already been raptured, but those believers who are spiritually like the ones in Sardis will not know of such a "coming" of the Lord. They will not know when the Lord will come. They may know about it later after some saints are raptured. According to the original language, there should be the word "have" before the word "come." The Lord's coming and His receiving of the watchful believers is a thing that will be known to the unprepared believers only when the event has already come to pass. The Lord has come already, yet they have missed it.</P><P>We have said that these believers in Sardis are saved ones. We must constantly be reminded of this fact because it shows us that it is possible for saved believers to be left on the earth. The Bible never mentions "the rapture of the church." A wrong kind of expression will result in a wrong kind of teaching. The Bible never tells us that every saved sinner, irrespective of his degree in life, will be raptured at the same time. According to 2 Corinthians 5:10, every believer will be raptured, irrespective of his spiritual condition. However, the Bible never tells us that their rapture will happen at the same time. On the contrary, the Bible shows us that there is at least more than one rapture. In the book of Revelation alone, the matter of rapture is mentioned seven times.</P><P>Rapture is typified by the gathering of the wheat into the barn. Before the wheat is gathered into the heavenly barn, there is the unique requirement of maturity. Because there are differences in the timing of maturity, there is the distinction between the firstfruit, the harvest, and the gleanings (Lev. 23). Of course, the unwatchful and unprepared believers cannot be harvested while they are still green. The degree of maturity determines the timing of their harvest. That wheat is left in the field longer does not mean that it is unwilling to become mature. It only means that it has to wait to become mature. Every believer will be raptured, but it will not happen at the same time.</P><P>In the prophecy the Lord gave at the Mount of Olives, He warned the believers, "If the householder had known in which watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into" (Matt. 24:43). The Lord compared Himself to a thief and the believers to a householder. What He meant is that the householder should be watchful so that a thief cannot break into his house and steal his goods undetected. The believers must be watchful in the same way if they do not want to miss the Lord Jesus' coming, in which the watchful saints in the church will be raptured undetected. As a thief comes undetected by the householder, in the same way, the Lord will come undetected by the Christians. This kind of teaching shows the Christians that they should not be content just because they consider themselves Christians and have already received eternal life. Instead, they should be watchful and prepared so that they can be raptured. The condition for being raptured is not merely to be a Christian. The condition for being raptured is to be a watchful Christian. The basis of one's rapture is not his life but his living.</P><P>If believers miss the Lord's coming, they will be left on earth to go through the great tribulation. The great tribulation was originally prepared for the world (Rev. 3:10), but if a believer lives like those in the world, he will suffer like those in the world. This is the same as with hell, which is prepared for the devil, but which a sinner who follows the devil will suffer as the devil suffers (Matt. 25:41). These believers will learn obedience through suffering. In the end, the Lord will also come to take them. This is the teaching that is most urgently needed today. Many Christians are already clear about the proof of salvation, but they think that to receive eternal life is the final thing that a person needs to do. They fail to realize that salvation is only the first step in the way of life! They think that while the world will be suffering the tribulation on earth, they will be raptured to the heavens which they have not loved very much anyway! How can this be possible? A spirit of ascension foretells a body of ascension. If the believers' heart and spirit are not in heaven, even if they are raptured, they will not enjoy the preciousness and joy of the rapture.</P><P>Now let us consider the difference between the saints and the world concerning the Lord's coming. The day that will come upon the world will be "the day of the Lord." That is another name for the great tribulation. What will come upon the believers will be the coming of the Lord. At the time God pays vengeance on the sinners remaining on earth, "the day of the Lord" will be a "sudden destruction" upon them, "and they shall by no means escape" (1 Thes. 5:2-3). But the hope of the believers is for the Savior to appear before "the day of the Lord." This "day" is recorded after the end of chapter six of this book (Rev. 6:17; 16:14). The hope of the believers is the coming of the Lord (2 Thes. 2:1) and not the day of the Lord (v. 2). However, if they are not watchful, they will lose the joy of the coming of the Lord and will suffer the tribulations of the day of the Lord.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 05: The Christian (3) &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
