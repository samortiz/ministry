   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 44:"For this reason you also be ready, because at an hour when you do not expect it, the Son of Man is coming."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some people, such as Scofield, consider this to be the Lord's addressing the Jews as the Son of Man, with no reference to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, the Son of Man is also the name of the Lord in the kingdom, and it is also used in His addressing Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Stephen was a person in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He too saw the Lord as the Son of Man Acts 7:56 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Hebrews 2:6 the "son of man" refers to the Lord receiving glory in the kingdom see also Heb 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to John 5:27-29 the Son of Man has authority to judge in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Matthew 19:28 the Son of Man is in the kingdom; in Matthew 25:31 the Son of Man comes in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Matthew 13:41 and 16:27-28 also refer to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John 6:53-54, the Son of Man is related to the resurrection in the last day, which also refers to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 12:23 is also a matter of receiving the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the Son of Man is a name used by the Lord in the kingdom; He is the King in His qualification as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 45:"Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the proper time?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 45 begins another parable, concerning two kinds of slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord said that there are two kinds of stewards, but actually, there is only one person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This person can be a good steward or a bad steward.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verses 45-47:"Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the proper time?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Blessed is that slave whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Truly I say to you that he will set him over all his possessions."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This speaks of being a good slave.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This section can be divided into four small sections: 1 the household, 2 the Lord's commission, 3 the Lord's requirement, and 4 the Lord's reward.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>1 The household here is different from the house of the householder in the previous parable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The former is individual and belongs to the man himself; the latter is corporate and belongs to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This corresponds with Hebrews 3:6 and Mark 13:34.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This household includes all the believers 1 Tim 3:15 ; hence, it refers to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2 The Lord's commission. a To be set over a household implies authority. b To give food at the proper time implies ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, such a one ministers before God; on the other hand, he ministers before man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not be misled to think that this signifies one slave ruling over the whole household; if we are, there will be ground for a pope, as in Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nor does it signify a pastor ruling over a parish, because he has "fellow slaves" in verse 49, and fellow slaves are those who serve together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord simply used one slave as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The work is to rule or to manage.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every slave in the house of God has a portion of the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every slave who has been bought by the blood of the Lord has authority to rule, to serve, to minister, and to give food at the proper time so that the whole household has food to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some say that today's church should have its attention turned to the outside and should preach the gospel in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, to preach the gospel is still a thing within, because this is for the perfecting of the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To preach the gospel is to produce material for the church; therefore, to save sinners is the procedure, not the end. To perfect to give food at the proper time is the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>So let us do our best to serve our Father by giving food at the proper time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"To give them food at the proper time" is to minister, that is, to serve people with the things of God and the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is to take Christ's ministering to serve people; this is to be a minister.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, this section is spoken to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To give food is to preach, but preaching is not necessarily to give food, because in giving food, one must be able to nourish people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The preaching which can lead others to repent, to know their sins, to be saved, to follow God's will, to believe, and to obey is the real giving of food.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let us find those brothers who need help and, according to their need and level, give them food.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But always remember: do not take the attitude of Hezekiah or the attitude of being "holier than thou"; otherwise, they would rather starve to death than eat.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>3 The Lord has two requirements: to be faithful and to be prudent i.e., wise .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Faithfulness is toward the Lord, and wisdom is toward the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But we are always the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are too faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We scold others and think that this is being faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the same time we are too unwise, that is, too loving in heart to speak a true word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Toward God we are too unfaithful; we are not absolutely obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At the same time, we are too wise, excusing and comforting the self with all kinds of reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Toward man we need to be faithful also; wisdom alone will make one too political.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If one is only faithful, he can easily become faithful foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must be faithful and must also be wise.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Faithfulness means not to discount.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We accept however much the Lord says.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It also means not to consider one's own gain or loss, and not to become unfaithful through considering one's gain or loss.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, those who want to be faithful must bear the cross and exercise self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They must deny cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Cleverness is from man's natural being, whereas wisdom is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today many of those who are the most faithful are the most foolish, the most rude, the most inconsiderate, and the most independent.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is why we must have wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Much of God's work is spoiled and destroyed by those who are faithful but not wise.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, it is better to have faithfulness without wisdom than to have wisdom without faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today there are too many who have wisdom but are not faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They have enlarged the narrow gate.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This kind of person is not worthy to be God's steward.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>4 The reward being set to rule over all His possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>"So doing" in verse 46 means to carry out faithfully what the Lord commanded.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we carry out such a command with wisdom, we are blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>"Blessed" refers to the reward in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"He will set him over all his possessions."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The way in which men are busy today is not like the way in which one will be busy in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the kingdom many things require one's ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The busy activities today are merely a test to see if one can endure being busy.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you can serve the brothers today, you will be able to serve in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Today God assigns you a few things; in that day the Lord will assign you to rule over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>One who is lazy will never have the opportunity to rule.</S>
