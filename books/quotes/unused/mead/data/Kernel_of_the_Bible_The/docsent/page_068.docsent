   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FILLED WITH GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 21:11 also says that New Jerusalem has the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Both inside and outside, New Jerusalem is filled with glory.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Glory is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Glory is the manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When God is manifested, that is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because God is fully manifested in this city, it has the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, in New Jerusalem we have regeneration, a holy walk, transformation, building, the appearance of God, and the full manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All these aspects of New Jerusalem should be in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the church we should have the pearl gates of regeneration, the holy walk on the golden street, transformation, building, the appearance of God, and the manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In New Jerusalem we have the number twelve Rev 21:12, 14, 16, 21; 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Twelve here is composed of three times four.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We know this by the fact that there are three gates on each of the four sides of the city Rev 21:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The number three signifies the Triune God, and the number four signifies the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, the number twelve, composed of three times four, signifies the mingling of the Triune God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The entire New Jerusalem is a mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This tells us that the church is a matter of the mingling of the Triune God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the foregoing messages we have pointed out that the church is the constitution of Christ into human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that the church is the mingling of the Triune God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the church life today we are being mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What a picture we have in Revelation 21 and 22 of the mingling of God with man!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This picture is better than thousands of words.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE REIGN OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But there is still more to be seen of New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this city there is the reign, the kingship, of God Rev 22:1, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In New Jerusalem all the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and built-up ones, those who bear the appearance of God with the glory of God, will reign as kings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This characteristic must also be found in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are a proper church, we shall reign.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A number of times we have told the Lord that we do not agree with certain events taking place in the political sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In our prayers we said, Lord, we don t agree with this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By praying in such a way, we reign over the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church in Stuttgart must reign, telling the Lord about those things that the church does not agree with.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE NATIONS WALKING IN THE LIGHT OF THE CITY</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Revelation 21:24 we are told that the nations will walk by the light of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In eternity, all the unsaved yet restored nations will walk in the light of New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the church today is strong and shining, the heathen will also walk under our light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is the consummation of the kernel of the Bible, Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In all these messages, we have seen the kernel of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although we may not know all the small streets, lanes, and alleys, we do know this main street.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After reading these messages, we cannot say that we do not know this main street.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, we must shout, Hallelujah, I know the main street!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I don t know so many details, but I do know the kernel of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I know the highway from the church to New Jerusalem!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are walking, even driving, on this highway today.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In all these messages we have seen this highway from Genesis through the tabernacle, the temple, the rebuilt temple, the church, and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the kernel of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now we are in the church life, walking the church way toward New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here we have the Triune God, the redeeming and life-dispensing God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Here we have life, light, regeneration, the holy walk, transformation, building, the appearance of God, the manifestation of God, and the divine reign.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is no wonder that the heathen are walking in the light of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the church life today and the New Jerusalem in eternity.</S>
