   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Building of God s Eternal Habitation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In our reading of the book of Acts we may still be under the influence of traditional theology.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Due to this influence, we may realize only that the name of Jesus is for salvation, that there is no other name given for us to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may not go on to consider the significance of the stone and the builders.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In particular, we may not ask what these builders were building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What were they building?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some may think that they were building Judaism, that is, building a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, it is not God s intention to build up Judaism or any kind of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Jewish leaders, the builders, did not know God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Likewise, many believers today do not know what God s economy is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have put out hundreds of Life-study Messages, and in these messages we have covered many things concerning God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have pointed out that God s economy is to build up His habitation in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Heaven is not God s permanent habitation; rather, heaven is God s temporary residence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible reveals clearly that God is not satisfied to stay forever in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Mingling of God with Man</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible reveals to us that God has an economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s economy is a plan, an arrangement, an administration, to accomplish something.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What God intends to accomplish in His economy is to build up His eternal habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is God s eternal habitation?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s eternal habitation is the blending of Himself with man, the mingling of God with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Neither heaven nor earth is God s habitation for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nothing other than the mingling of God with man is qualified to be God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although we see little concerning this in the Old Testament, it is revealed in full in the New Testament, in particular, in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John 1:14 says, The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This word refers to the incarnation: the Word, which is God John 1:1 , became flesh and tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word tabernacled in this verse is rich in its significance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It signifies that the incarnated One is the very mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This mingling is God s tabernacle, where God can dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, in this tabernacle God s chosen people can serve God and stay with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, in John 1:14 we see the mingling of God with man in the incarnation to become God s tabernacle, His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus says, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here we see that the Son and the Father will come to the one who loves the Lord Jesus and make an abode with that one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then in John 15:4 the Lord goes on to say, Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here the Lord indicates that He may become our abode, our abiding place, and that we need to be His abode.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord seems to be saying, Abide in Me so that I may abide in you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Be My abode so that I may be your abode.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we have the mingling of God and man for a mutual dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Have you ever heard anything concerning this?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is not such a concept in traditional theological teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A Building in Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In John 2:19 the Lord Jesus says, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to John 2:21, He spoke of the temple of His body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here the Lord seems to be saying, You Jewish leaders should be builders.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, eventually you will destroy this temple.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But I will build it up in three days.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In resurrection I shall build up what you have destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This building in resurrection includes not only Jesus Christ Himself, but also all those who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Ultimately, He and all the believers will be built together into the habitation of God, which in the New Testament is called the house of God, the church 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now we can see that God s economy is to build an eternal habitation for Himself and for His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This habitation is actually the mingling of God with His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A Mutual Dwelling Place</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The thought of having God as our habitation can be found in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, Deuteronomy 33:27 says, The eternal God is thy dwelling-place ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Psalm 90:1 Moses says, Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In these verses we see clearly that God is our habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, in the Old Testament we cannot see a verse telling us that we, God s chosen people, are His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But the New Testament reveals clearly that there is a universal building, and this building is the mutual building of God and His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Actually, this habitation is God as our dwelling place and we as God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This wonderful dwelling place is God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God intended to use Moses, the kings, the prophets, and all the Jewish leaders to build this habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, the builders in Acts 4:11 should refer to the builders of God s universal habitation.</S>
