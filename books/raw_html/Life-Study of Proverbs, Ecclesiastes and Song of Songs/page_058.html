<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Lover's Pursuing</H2>

<P>In verse 4a we have a word concerning the lover's pursuing: "Draw me; we will run after you." In her pursuit of Christ, she asks Him to draw her that she and her companions may run after Him. Everyone who is drawn by Christ will have companions in following Him. Since I was drawn by the Lord, many have followed the Lord with me. Consider the situation with Peter when he, a fisherman, was called by the Lord (Matt. 4:18-20). One day Christ the Beloved came, and Peter was charmed by Him and he left the nets and followed Him. Many followed Christ as Peter's companions. When we are drawn to follow Christ, we become a factor in others' following of Him.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. FELLOWSHIPPING WITH CHRIST<br>
RESULTING IN ENTERING INTO THE CHURCH LIFE</H2>

<P>In Song of Songs 1:4b-8 we see that fellowshipping with Christ results in entering into the church life. The church life is indicated by another figure&#151;the flock (vv. 7-8), which signifies the church as a collection of many believers.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Beloved Bringing Her into Her Spirit<br>
as the Holiest of All for Fellowship</H2>

<P>The Beloved brings her into her spirit as the Holiest of all (His chambers) for fellowship. The word spirit is not used here, but it is signified by the word chambers in verse 4. Our spirit as Christ's dwelling place (2 Tim. 4:22) becomes His Holy of Holies (Heb. 10:19) for fellowship.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. She and Her Companions Extolling<br>
His Love with Joy and Rejoicing</H2>

<P>In fellowship with Christ, the lover and her companions extol His love with joy and rejoicing, for rightly do they love Him (v. 4b).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Seeing Her Self That She Is Sinful<br>
in Adam but Justified in Christ</H2>

<P>She sees her self that she is sinful in Adam, but she is justified in Christ (vv. 5-6a). Her being sinful in Adam is signified by her being black like the tents of Kedar. Her being justified in Christ is signified by her being lovely like the curtains of Solomon. The tents are under the sunshine, but the curtains are within the inner chamber.</P>
