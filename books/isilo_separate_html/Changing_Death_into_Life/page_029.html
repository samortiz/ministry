TO QUENCH PEOPLE&rsquo;S THIRST</h2>
<p>Many people know that they are thirsty, but they will not come to the Lord Jesus. They still want to find ways and things in the world to quench their thirst. Everyone who has such a hope will eventually be utterly disappointed because nothing in the world is able to quench the thirst within man. Instead of quenching man&rsquo;s thirst, the things in the world increase man&rsquo;s thirst. The pleasure and enjoyment of the world can only create thirst in man. The more wealth and enjoyment someone has, the more he wants. The more beautiful and fashionable someone is, the more he wants. A person who has never watched a movie may not have a longing to watch a movie, but if he watches a movie, it will increase his thirst to watch more. If he did not watch a movie last Saturday, he may not want to watch one on the coming Saturday, but if he watched a movie last Saturday, he will be very hungry and thirsty to watch a movie on the coming Saturday. The more he watches, the more he wants to watch, and the more he wants to watch, the more he will watch. No matter how much he watches, however, the thirst within him will not be quenched; it will only increase.</p>
<p>This is the case with watching movies, and it also applies to other things. The more someone gambles, the more he wants to gamble. The more someone dances, the more he wants to dance. The more someone smokes, the more he wants to smoke. The more someone drinks, the more he wants to drink. This is the case not only with sinful and addictive things but also with normal things in human life. Someone with a position wants a higher position. Someone with a business wants a bigger business. Someone with money wants more money. Everything in this world strengthens man&rsquo;s need and deepens his thirst. As a result, man is all the more dissatisfied. Nothing is able to quench man&rsquo;s thirst. The experiences of human life are sufficient to prove this point.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IF ANYONE THIRSTS,<br />
LET HIM COME TO CHRIST AND DRINK</h2>
<p>Because people are thirsty and unable to quench their thirst, the Lord Jesus stood and cried out, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me...out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&rdquo; (vv. 37-38). The Lord Jesus cried out on the last day of the feast because He wanted people to know their real need. He wanted them to know that they were thirsty and that He has living water to quench their thirst. The joy of the feast was unable to stop or quench their thirst. Only His living water that flows eternally is able to quench man&rsquo;s thirst forever.</p>
<p>There is a historical background to what the Lord Jesus said. The Jews who heard this word knew their history. When their forefathers were thirsty in the wilderness, God performed a miracle. He split the rock, and living water flowed out to quench their thirst. God performed this miracle to solve the problem of their thirst. However, the split rock typifies Christ, whose body would be split on the cross so that living water would flow out to quench the thirst in the spirit of man.</p>
<p>After the Jews entered into Canaan, they held the Feast of Tabernacles each year to remind them that their forefathers lived in tents in the wilderness. Hence, the Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Your forefathers wandered in the wilderness, and they drank water that flowed out from the rock. Today you are wandering in the wilderness of this world, but one day you will realize that there is no water, because your joy will come to an end. Then you will feel the thirst of human life, just as you are thirsty on the last day of this feast. If you feel thirsty, come to Me and drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus cried out that day to the Jews, and He is still crying out today. You have sensed the thirst of the human life, so you should come to Him. He is the Savior of life who is able to quench your thirst. His body was broken on the cross, just as the rock was split in the wilderness, and the living water flowed out from Him. After He died on the cross, He rose from the dead and was glorified. Then the Spirit of life descended, and the living water flowed out. If anyone receives the Lord Jesus, the living water will become rivers flowing forth. These rivers will quench his thirst so that he lives a watered and full human life. These rivers will also overflow from within him to reach others and quench their thirst. This is the real need of thirsty humanity. This is the salvation that the thirsty need.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE STEPS TO QUENCH MAN&rsquo;S THIRST</h2>
<p>How can man receive such a salvation? How can man receive the Lord Jesus as the living water to quench his thirst? The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me...out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&rdquo; (vv. 37-38). According to the Lord Jesus&rsquo; word, man must take three steps in order to receive the living water that quenches his thirst.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
