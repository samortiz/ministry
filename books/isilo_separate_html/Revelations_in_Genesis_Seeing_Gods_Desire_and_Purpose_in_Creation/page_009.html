<h1 class="title">THE PURPOSE OF GOD&rsquo;S RESTORATION<br />
OF CREATION</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw the reason, the basis, the means, the process, and the focus of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation. Now we will consider the purpose of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation. This is a great point. If we read the first two chapters of Genesis and pay attention only to what God created each day, we are merely on the surface. We must see the intrinsic spiritual significance of creation and identify God&rsquo;s desire and purpose in creating the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN BEING<br />
THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE</h2>
<p>What was God&rsquo;s intention and purpose in creating the heavens, the earth, and all things? In addressing this question we should consider the creation of man on the sixth day. Genesis 1:26 says, &ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.&rdquo; This shows that the most important thing in God&rsquo;s creation of man is that God created man in His image and according to His likeness. If we are enlightened by the Holy Spirit, it is not difficult to see God&rsquo;s desire and purpose in creating all things. God wanted to gain a group of people with His image and likeness, that is, a group of people who are exactly the same as He is.</p>
<p>The account of God&rsquo;s creation contains a clear picture: God created the heavens and the earth and all things in them, and He created man with His image and likeness according to Himself. This picture reveals that man is the center of all things in the universe because only man has the image and likeness of God. Of all the things created in the universe, man is the highest and most central creature. The record of creation reveals that God&rsquo;s first and foremost desire and purpose in creation are to gain a group of people who are like Him, possessing His image to express Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE IN CREATING MAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Expressing God</h2>
<p>Why does God have a desire that man would be exactly the same as He is? The Bible reveals that God longs to gain a group of people who are exactly the same as He is in order to express Him and to declare Him so that His glory may be fully manifested. It pleases God to gain such a group of people as His image in the universe so that through them all things may see Him and know Him (Gen. 1:26; Rom. 8:29-30).</p>
<p>Many prominent public figures hang portraits of themselves in many places. These portraits are their expression. Although these public figures may not often be seen in person, they are expressed among people through their portraits. When people see their portraits, they are able to know these figures.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a friend in the United States whom we have never seen in person and who wants to visit us. If he wants us to know what he looks like before he arrives, he can take a picture of himself and send it to us. We can know him through his picture because he is exactly the same as the image in the picture.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Made in the Image of God</h2>
<p>Man bears the image of God; he is a picture of God. God intended to come into the midst of all things, but before He came, He took a &ldquo;picture&rdquo; of Himself and put it in front of all things, manifesting Himself before all things. This picture is man, Adam. Later, when God came to the earth and was manifested among men, His name was Jesus Christ. If we were to place Adam and Christ together and compare them, we would see that they bear the same image.</p>
<p>Man is a picture of God. This is not a careless statement. Genesis 1:26-27 says that man was created in God&rsquo;s image and according to His likeness. <em>Likeness</em> refers to the outward form; <em>image</em> refers to the inward parts, such as the mind, the emotion, and the will. When man was created, he had the image of God inwardly and the likeness of God outwardly. Created man bears the image of God; hence, man is a picture of God.</p>
<p>Some people have the wrong concept that God did not have the likeness of a man until He was incarnated. However, even in the Old Testament age, before Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, God appeared to people in the likeness of a man. In Genesis 18 Abraham received three guests, of whom two were angels and one was God (vv. 2, 10, 13-14, 22; 19:1). God appeared in the likeness of a man. Therefore, God had this likeness first, not man. Man was created according to God&rsquo;s likeness. Hence, when God was incarnated (John 1:14), the likeness that He put on was His likeness. Let us consider the earlier example. The picture that our friend in the United States takes of himself before his visit is according to his likeness. The picture was taken of him; hence, he possessed his likeness first, and then the picture possessed his likeness. Similarly, before Christ came to the earth, He already possessed His image and likeness. God created Adam according to the image and likeness of Christ. Hence, God&rsquo;s image and likeness were possessed first by Christ and then by Adam. When Christ came into the world, it seemed as if God put on the likeness of man; however, the likeness of man was originally God&rsquo;s likeness.</p>
<p>The utterance in Genesis 1:26-27 is very particular. Verse 26 says, &ldquo;Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.&rdquo; There is only one God, but the pronoun here is <em>Us</em> instead of <em>Me,</em> showing that God is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The image that the Triune God wanted to create in man is identified also with the pronoun <em>Our.</em> Verse 27 speaks of God&rsquo;s creation: &ldquo;God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.&rdquo; In this verse, however, a singular pronoun is used in the phrase <em>His own image.</em> What is the significance of this pronoun? In the Trinity only the Son, Christ, has an image. Second Corinthians 4:4 says that Christ is &ldquo;the image of God.&rdquo; Colossians 1:15 says that the beloved Son of God is &ldquo;the image of the invisible God.&rdquo; Hebrews 1:3 says that Christ is &ldquo;the impress of His substance.&rdquo; John 1:18 says that &ldquo;no one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; These verses reveal that Christ the Son of God is the image of God. Apart from Christ we cannot see God. Hence, when God created man in His own image, He created man according to Christ. This created man was Adam. For this reason, Romans 5:14 says that Adam is &ldquo;a type of Him [Christ] who was to come.&rdquo; This means that before Christ came to the earth, there was already a picture of Himself according to His likeness on the earth. This picture was Adam. Therefore, it is not that Christ is like Adam but that Adam is like Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
