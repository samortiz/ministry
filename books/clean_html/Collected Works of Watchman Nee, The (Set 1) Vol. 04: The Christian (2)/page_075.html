<P>Only those who sympathize with God, not only in mind but in conduct as well, can understand the meaning of the hidden manna. We cannot love what contradicts our mind and conduct. There is no compromise between rebellion and obedience, between pride and humility, and between rudeness and meekness. If we long after the form of Christ as manna on earth, we cannot help but live the same kind of life. What we long after speaks of what we are. When we look into the things that a man desires, we will know the kind of person he is. It is only when we live the true life of the wilderness that we can treasure the manna. How cold our heart is! If our hearts remain so cold, even if the hidden manna is given to us, we will not be able to enjoy it. May we stand on the same ground as the Lord did in the old days so that we can truly realize the loveliness of His rejection.</P><P>The hidden manna reminds us of the condition of Canaan, for it is hidden in Canaan. The wilderness is over, yet we can still enjoy the food of the wilderness. The manna was once eaten regularly. The hidden manna reminds us of what we ate before. In the wilderness the manna came only once a day; it did not last long. When a new experience comes, the old ones have to go. However, the hidden manna was collected from the wilderness. It was obtained from the wilderness, but it does not turn sour. Rather, it serves as an eternal memorial in Canaan. Those who have once eaten of manna will forever be reminded by the hidden manna of the fine taste and the heart-strengthening power of the wilderness manna. This is quite obvious. The hidden manna signifies the memorial of what we have once tasted. In other words, as we enjoy Christ by faith in this age, we will have a taste of this again in eternity.</P><P>From this, one can see what a close relationship there is between this age and the next! Many times we have separated the two far too much! We think that when we enter eternity, all blessings will be the same. Yet this is only our idea. It is true that everyone will become perfect then and that everything that is seen as through the mirror now will be over then. One will forever part with the problem of sin, and former hurts and failures will no longer haunt us with their frustrations. Our cup of blessing will be full. Yet, does it mean that our spiritual journey and history in this age have no bearing on the future? Here, the hidden manna will solve this problem for us.</P><P>Of course, in the Bible there are many passages that indicate the same thing. Yet they are beyond the scope of our discussion, and we will not cover them for now. We will only speak of what is before us. Those who receive the hidden manna must be those who had formerly received the manna in the wilderness. What is received now must be the same as what was received before. It is not a new experience; it is an old experience reviewed. Christ is no longer the rejected One typified by the manna. Manna is not something that belongs to Canaan; it is merely something that is brought into Canaan. Hence, it is strictly a memorial of past events only. As such, its meaning is all the more profound. All our spiritual history and our spiritual journey will be preserved forever. Our joy is not temporary; even in eternity, we will still be able to enjoy this joy. All our sufferings for the Lord, our works for Him, all our experiences in Him, whether in realizing His victory, in being filled with His life, or in tasting of His love, will all be reviewed in experience in eternity. Praise God that whatever we receive in this age will not be lost in the coming age!</P><P>For this reason, the hidden manna makes a most serious demand upon us. At the same time, it is the greatest encouragement to us. Unlike what some have said, there is not that immeasurable gap doctrinally between our present life and the future eternal life. Naturally, we admit that there are many differences between this age and the coming age, but we cannot say that they are completely different. In our spiritual experiences there will still be many gratifying recollections. The joy experienced now will still be felt in eternity. It is like a stone thrown into the pond; the ripples expand and continue all the way to the edge of the pond. Man's responsibility is limited to this present life only. He will be judged according to what he does while living on earth. We will receive either a reward or punishment based on our works. Our present conduct affects our life in the coming age. We may never have thought of this. In coming to this point, we have to be careful not to discredit the greatness of God's grace. It is true that grace has put us on the same position. Thank God that every saved and redeemed person has received the same standing, not through work but by grace. However, we should not stop here. If we do, we will be wrong. Although our standing is the same, the difference in the experiences of our enjoyment of Christ in the wilderness before will cause us to have different memories of these earthly experiences in the future. Because the experiences are different, and subsequently because the memories are different, the reliving of the joy in the enjoyment of Christ in the wilderness will also be different. Both the hidden manna and the white stone are rewards in the eternal age which issue from the experiences of this present age. All present spiritual experiences will be turned into happy memories in eternity. However, in those memories, there will not be the sufferings which accompany the present experiences. Those who experience little will have little to remember, and those who experience much will have much to remember. However, everything will be pure joy; there will be no mixture with the present suffering. What a scene that will be!</P>
