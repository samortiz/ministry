   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PSALM 2 THE DECLARATION OF GOD CONCERNING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The twelve verses of Psalm 2 can be divided into four sections, with three verses in each section.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first three verses predict the opposition of the world rulers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This prophecy began to be fulfilled at the time Christ was judged by Pilate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Its fulfillment will be continued until the time indicated in Revelation 19, verse 19.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the time Jesus was betrayed, the rulers, the kings, the princes of this earth, began to oppose Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So this Psalm says, "Why do the nations rage, and the peoples meditate a vain thing?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The kings of the earth stand up, and the princes plot together, against the Lord, and against his anointed."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This includes all the Caesars of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It includes, in the following centuries, all the rulers, kings and princes of this earth who arise and plot against Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Acts 4:25-27 refers to this prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is the prediction of the opposition of world leaders to Christ from the time of His crucifixion till the time the antichrist will be defeated by Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 4: "He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While those Roman Caesars were plotting against Christ, God was sitting in the heavens laughing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>While the other world rulers were plotting against Christ, God undoubtedly was in the heavens laughing at them and having them in derision.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hitler was in violent opposition to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But where is he today?</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Where will today's Christ opposing rulers be a few years from now?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is laughing and saying, "What are you doing?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Your opposition can only last a few fleeting years."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The princes and kings arise and fight against Christ, but eventually God will destroy them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Then shall he speak unto them in his anger and terrify them in his fierce displeasure."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And God said, "Yet have I anointed my king upon Zion, the hill of my holiness."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the declaration of God.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Both Acts 13 and Hebrews 1 tell us that this word refers to the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ was begotten as the Son of God by being resurrected.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This simply means to repent and believe.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The last three verses of Psalm 2 are the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These four sections, the section predicting the opposition against Christ, the section predicting God's declaration concerning Christ, the section predicting Christ's declaration about Himself, and the section predicting the gospel preaching include all the things related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to have the concept of such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Regardless of how much the world opposes Christ, God has appointed Him, God has anointed Him, and He has declared that now we must preach Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must tell the people to be wise, to repent, to fear and rejoice with trembling, to put their trust in Him and love Him.</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No one ever told me anything about Psalm 2.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christianity today still has only the human concept, the natural concept, the concept of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But we must drop this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must take the divine concept, the spiritual concept, the concept of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Though He is being opposed today, yet God has declared that He is the Anointed One, that He is resurrected, that He will obtain all the nations as His inheritance and rule over them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What have we to do but praise Him, be wise, be admonished, fear and rejoice with trembling, put our trust in Him and kiss Him.</S>
