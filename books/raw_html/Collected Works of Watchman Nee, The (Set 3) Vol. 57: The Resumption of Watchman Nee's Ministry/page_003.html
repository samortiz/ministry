<h1 class="title">FOREWORD</h1><p>By the mercy of God, the church in Shanghai experienced a great revival in 1947. When news spread to other places, the churches in the provinces of Fukien and Kwangtung, together with the church in Hong Kong, invited me to visit. At the same time co-workers from northern and southern China, together with co-workers from the West, decided to come together in Shanghai the following year for a co-workers' conference and to share the Lord's grace one with another. Toward the end of 1947 Sister Peace Wang, Sister Rachel Lee, and I went to Hong Kong. Then we went to Canton, Swatow, and Amoy. Finally, in March 1948 we went to Foochow. In all these places we held special revival conferences. After the meetings in Foochow, we went to have some private fellowship with Brother Nee at his home according to a previously-arranged schedule concerning the future of the Lord's recovery. When news of this went out, thirty to forty co-workers around the Foochow area unanimously requested that they be included in this fellowship. With Brother Nee's approval, they all attended the meetings. During these meetings, the need of "handing over'' oneself was brought out one day. Everyone enthusiastically agreed to do this. This subsequently brought in the recovery of Brother Nee's ministry. Brother Nee took care of the need of the meeting in Foochow first, and then went with me in April to Shanghai to conduct the nationwide co-workers' conference. Brother K. H. Weigh and his wife were in most of the meetings in various places, and the content of this volume is taken from their brief records.</p><p>I was present in all the meetings throughout this period of the recovery of Brother Nee's ministry, with the exception of the first two meetings, and I even helped conduct the meetings. I sat face to face with our brother and heard these messages with my own ears. The light that was released was like the shining of the midday sun. Even though forty-three years have elapsed since then, there is a present need to let this light shine forth once again as the rising sun. Under the Lord's sovereignty, we have the manuscripts of Brother Weigh and his wife. When I read them again, every message was filled with the dawning light. What impressed me the most and rendered me the greatest help concerned the following eight points: (1) the knowledge and realization of the Body of Christ, (2) the knowledge and denial of the self, (3) the knowledge of and submission to the authority in the Body of Christ, (4) the knowledge and acceptance by the co-workers of the "line of Jerusalem,'' (5) the service and coordination of the whole Body of Christ, (6) the need and practice of handing over oneself with all one has, (7) the leading and coordination among the co-workers, and (8) the importance of the Holy Spirit in the service in the Body of Christ. May the Lord grant us the mercy, the grace, and the blessing, that all the above points would be abundantly realized in our work and service of the Lord's recovery.</p><p>Witness Lee<br />Anaheim, California<br />July 19, 1991</p>
