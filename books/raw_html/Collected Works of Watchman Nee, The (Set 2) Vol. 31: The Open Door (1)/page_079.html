<h2 class="head2">Li-Ling, Hunan Province</h2><p>Due to the many things entangling me and to the fact that I do not have a settled place, I can only send a simple greeting to the brothers and sisters in the Lord. I hope that you will forgive me before God. After the hospital was destroyed last year on December 9, I took a train with some friends to Ch'ang-sha in the middle of the night on the eleventh. On the fourteenth I transferred to the Ju-Ping line and arrived in Li-Ling. I am staying at the house of a friend's aunt. I have been here for more than a month. I contracted the mumps more than ten days ago and find it difficult to read or write. I really thank God that having Him in a difficult situation is better than not having Him in an easy situation. Therefore, I feel that this is a good opportunity to learn the lesson of worshipping Him. I usually have a quick temper, but now I am forced to endure quietly. I am telling you about my situation so that those in the Lord who know about it will remember me before the Father for my weaknesses.</p><p>Liu Su-fang<br />January 21</p><p>(Sister Su-fang: I hope you will tell us your mailing address&mdash;Ruth.)</p><h2 class="head2">Chungking, Szechuan Province</h2><p>Greetings to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>Grace, peace, and joy from the Father and the Lord Jesus to you! After the recent unfortunate event, God's special grace has been very great and marvelous among His children. God is edifying His children through the environment and is spreading His gospel so that many people in the interior and remote regions can hear of salvation. Praise Him! It was really the Lord's arrangement and grace for me to come to Chungking. After I arrived in Chungking, I met a few brothers and sisters in the Lord. Thank the Lord, God had already sent His servant Brother Chang Yu-zhi to work here before we came. Later, Sisters Lee, Wang, and Chang came. They mainly preached the gospel in the missionary schools and held Bible studies. Thank our Lord for gaining a few in these meetings. In addition, many brothers and sisters have come to Chungking, and we often meet together. The meetings are in Brother Yuan Hou-tsai's home at 4-3 Shang-Chang Garden. This is all God's doing; we have not done anything at all. We began the table meeting on January 30. There were more than ten brothers and sisters. Thank the Lord, although there were not many people, the taste was precious. There is a prayer meeting every Thursday evening at 7:00 p.m. and a preaching meeting on the Lord's Day at 3:00 p.m. (at present it is for edifying Christians). We remember the Lord at 5:00 p.m. Over the Chinese New Year, we preached the gospel for ten days in special meetings apart from the regular ones (February 1-10) at the Cross Chapel. Brother Chang Yu-zhi was responsible for the speaking. On February 21 we began to have a Bible study meeting every evening in the meeting place. Brother Chang Yu-zhi is also responsible for the speaking. The Lord has already blessed His work. We had the first baptism on the nineteenth of this month. (Five brothers, Lee Yun-hsuan, Huang Ai-san, Hsia Wen-gan, Liu Yi-peng, and Niu Jin-fang, were baptized.) We will go to the southern hot springs on the twenty-sixth of this month for the second baptism meeting (two brothers and six sisters).</p><p>Brother Ge Shien-shen, Brother Lee Yun-hsuan, and I are responsible for the meetings. The responsibility for the assembly is very heavy. We are so weak and powerless and are really not worthy of such a task. May the Lord give grace and bless us in spite of our weaknesses so that His church may be preserved. We really need your prayers and advice. Brother Ge Shien-shen went to visit his relatives in Chekiang on the seventeenth. He will return to Chungking in about two months. There are dangers along the way, but our Lord is with him, so he will not fall into danger. Please remember him often in your prayers.</p><p>The Lord has begun a good work here and is gradually raising up people. On one Lord's Day there were thirty brothers and sisters in the table meeting. Praise the Lord! May He add the saved ones daily to His church. May the Lord be with you all until the day of His coming.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Liu Guo-hua<br />February 22, 1938<br />[Address omitted]</p>
