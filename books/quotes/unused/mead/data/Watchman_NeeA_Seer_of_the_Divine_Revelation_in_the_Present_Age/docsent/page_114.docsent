   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Trainings in Kuling Mountain</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>During Watchman's silent years, he took the opportunity to purchase many houses on a mountain which was called Kuling, close to Foochow, where many missionaries had their summer retreat.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>During World War II most of the missionaries left the country and gladly sold their houses at very low prices.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Watchman bought more than fifteen of their houses with the intention of preparing them for his trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then, following the revival which came to Shanghai in 1948 when his ministry was recovered, about eighty brothers and sisters went with him to Kuling Mountain and occupied those houses for a four-month training period, from June to October 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The following is a testimony of Chang Wu-cheng, one of his trainees:</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the opening of the training Brother Nee first gave some explanations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"First, this training is not a seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our purpose is not to pass on some scriptural knowledge or methods of work to the trainees, but to help those who are already following the Lord and walking on this way to go further.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>My ministry is somewhat different from that of Brother Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He can cause those who have no heart for the Lord to have a heart for the Lord, those who are incapable to become capable, and those who are not going on to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I admit that I do not have what he has.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For twenty years I have only been able to help those who had something already to have something more, and to help those who are seeking, to receive help.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether this training is a success or failure all depends upon what kind of people you are.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you are preoccupied and self-satisfied, you will not receive help.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if you really want to go on, I can help you go on further, and if you have some light, I can help you receive more light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My ministry is not to revive you or to change you, but to lead you if you are already on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My ministry is not to pull out those who are sitting at home and force them to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"Second, this training will cover four parts: 1 how to be a minister of God's Word, 2 how to help new believers, 3 things to pay attention to and the solution to problems, 4 how to administer the church affairs."</S>
