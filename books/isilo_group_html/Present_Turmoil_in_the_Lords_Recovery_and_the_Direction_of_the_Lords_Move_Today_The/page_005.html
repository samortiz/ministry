<p>A rebellion such as the one we are encountering now in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not only instigated by the evil spiritual source but also is carried out through human instruments. In Paul&rsquo;s charge to the elders from Ephesus in Acts 20:30, he warned them that from among themselves men would rise up to speak perverted things to draw away the disciples to be their followers. In the past nineteen centuries, Paul&rsquo;s warning has been fulfilled repeatedly. I would say that the present rebellion among us is another fulfillment of Paul&rsquo;s warning. Many words that have come out of those who are participating in this rebellion should be considered as &ldquo;perverted things.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">With the Winds of Teaching</h2>
<p>A number of the teachings put out by the four leading ones in this rebellion, especially in the past three years, are truly winds of teaching (Eph. 4:14), such as the Lord Jesus building up the church by Himself directly (implying not through others), absolute autonomy in the local churches, no delegated authority, no spiritual father, and democracy instead of theocracy. These winds of teaching have damaged some of the dear saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, who need the help through the light of the proper teachings of the New Testament, which are the teachings of the apostles (Acts 2:42).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Test to the Faithful Ones</h2>
<p>This illogical and unreasonable rebellion is a test to the faithful ones. Any saint who knows the New Testament teachings logically and reasonably and who is faithful to the Lord according to His holy and unchanging Word would not care for the unbridled speakings in the present turmoil. So, the rebellion is truly a test to the faithful ones for their approvedness (1 Cor. 11:19).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Purification to the Recovery</h2>
<p>A rebellion always brings about some sifting among God&rsquo;s people. This sifting can be considered as a kind of purification exercised by the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty to purify His collective people. Furthermore, the occurring of a rebellion also renders some purification to the faithful ones in their intention, their motive, their purpose, their aims, and other matters. To some extent I have been purified. During the turmoil, when I heard that people slandered me and defamed me, as the Lord said in Matthew 5:11, &ldquo;Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me,&rdquo; I checked with the Lord to find out if I was wrong. By such checking, I was purified.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER WAY TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEMS<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>Now we need to see the proper way to take care of the problems in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head2">With a Genuine and Sincere Concern<br />
for the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery</h2>
<p>To take care of the problems in the recovery, we must have a genuine and sincere concern for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, without any biased view concerning any matter. Furthermore, we should not have any element of self-interest, self-plotting, self-esteem, and self-consideration. We must be unbiased, fair, and pure, without any background that would affect us. We must abandon our self-esteem and self-consideration. We all have our own prestige, and we like to highly esteem ourselves. We also expect that others will esteem us highly. As long as we seek self-esteem in the church life, we become a problem. Perhaps we are always considering, &ldquo;What about me, my position, my future, and my interest?&rdquo; If we are considering ourselves all the time in this way, we are unable to take care of problems in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. In order to take care of the problems, we must be pure, tested, and checked by the Lord. When we have a pure, genuine, and sincere concern for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we are qualified to take care of the problems. Otherwise, we become a problem.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Present Turmoil in the Lord's Recovery and the Direction of the Lord's Move Today &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
