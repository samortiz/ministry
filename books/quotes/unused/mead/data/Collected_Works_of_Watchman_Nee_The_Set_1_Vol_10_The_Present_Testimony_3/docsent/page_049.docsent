   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Philippians 3:10 says, "To know Him and the power of His resurrection."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul said that the goal of his counting all things loss was to know the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He did not say he wanted to know resurrection, because once a person has believed, he has resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But on the subjective side he still needed to count all things loss in order to know the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ascension is the last great accomplished truth in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord's incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection and ascension are some of the greatest truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Concerning the Lord's ascension, you do not know how much time I spent shortly after I was saved thinking how good it would be if only I could daily sit in the heavenlies and have my sin under my feet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I was like an airplane in the sky that could not stay in the sky forever.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I continually besought the Lord that one day I would be able to sit steadily in the heavenlies and break my record of ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then one day I read Ephesians 2:6: "And raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I realized then that when Christians were raised up together with Christ, they were also seated together with Him in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not due to their diligence or prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is because Christ brought us into the heavenlies when He ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because He is in the heavenlies, I am also in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, I should allow the power of the Lord's ascension to be manifested in me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the other hand, Colossians 3:1-3 says, "If therefore you were raised together with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Set your mind on the things which are above, not on the things which are on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ascension means that our life has been hidden with Christ in God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because we have died, resurrected, and ascended, we ought to seek the things which are above and daily set our mind on the things which are above.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suppose a sinner hears that the Lord Jesus has died for him and thinks that since the Lord has died for him, he can go on sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all know that this is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have the position of ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, if we continually set our mind on the things that are on the earth, even our ascended position will do us no good.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we believe in Christ's ascension and, at the same time, continually set our minds on the things above rather than the things on earth, we will not only be in the heavenlies objectively, but we will also be in the heavenlies subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brothers, only having objective facts without having subjective experience is too theoretical; one will not have any taste of heaven from this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is absolutely necessary to believe all that Christ has done on the objective side.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is also absolutely necessary to obey what the Spirit wants to do on the subjective side.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All spiritual experiences come first from believing what Christ has accomplished and then by obeying the Spirit's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ's accomplishments cause us to gain the position; the Spirit's leading causes us to gain the experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The accomplishments of Christ are facts for us to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The leading of the Spirit is the principle for us to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All spiritual experiences begin from the objective side; there is no exception.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our anchor must be cast in Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John 15:4-5 says, "Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me. I am the vine; you are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The order in this passage is most important.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Being "in Me" is first.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The "Me" in this verse is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One must first be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the objective side.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then "I in you" follows.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"I in you" is Christ abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the subjective side.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must first have the objective aspect, then the subjective aspect will be added.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What follows thereafter is a promise that we will bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Being in the Lord is the objective side.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once we have the objective side, then we will have the subjective side of the Lord abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we believe in the objective fact, everything on the objective side will come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The issue of the objective plus the subjective is fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There will not be any fruit-bearing if we only have the objective side; similarly, we will not bear any fruit if we just have the subjective side.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever the objective and subjective sides are joined together, there will be fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the church began in Jerusalem, there were both men and women praying in the upper room.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In typology, men represent the objective truth, while women represent the subjective truth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The presence of men typifies the presence of objective truth or doctrine, while the presence of women typifies the presence of subjective truth or experience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The result of this was three thousand and then five thousand souls being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This was the way the church began.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the future, at the time of Christ's second coming, there will be the Lamb of God on the objective side.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There will also be the bride of the Lamb, "clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints" Rev 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Whether or not the Lord is pleased with a Christian's living depends on how balanced he is regarding these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the church today, some preach only the subjective truth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>An example of this is the so-called holiness group; they only have the female aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, others only teach the objective truth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>An example of this is the Brethren; they only have the male aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Both of these extremes suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>By paying attention only to the subjective side, one not only fails to gain any experience, but he also suffers daily.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>On the other hand, those who pay attention solely to the objective side and live a carefree daily life, thinking that they have died, resurrected, and ascended with Christ and, therefore, need not care for anything else, will not have any experience either.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God's way is not to pay attention only to the objective side or only to the subjective side.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The principle in the Bible is for us to first have the objective aspect and then the subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should first have the facts of Christ and then follow the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The result will be much fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>May God teach us to obey Him more and serve Him more according to His way.</S>
