Being the Urgent Need</h2>
<p>Before I went on this trip, I did not expect that the urgent need in every place is the building up of the house of God. Based on this need, the messages that I gave in Hong Kong were concerning the building of God. The main point in my fellowship was that the saints must build up the house of God in every locality.</p>
<p>The saints can testify that they see the building up the local church as the house of God, and they fellowship concerning this. Many messages have been given concerning this. However, after visiting so many places, my feeling concerning the building up of the house of God is even stronger.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SITUATION IN JAPAN</h2>
<p>Our first stop was in Japan. After we arrived, I realized that Japan is a large and modern country that has a large population and many Christians; however, God&rsquo;s house is not there.</p>
<p>The three largest cities in the world have about the same population. Tokyo, New York, and London each have between eight and ten million people. If we include the suburbs, metropolitan Tokyo, New York, and London have even larger populations. Even though I have visited these cities before, I had not been very interested in Tokyo. But this time when we were in Tokyo, I was amazed because from morning to night the streets are filled with cars and people. Even though Japan has a large population and two to three thousand missionaries, God does not have a house there.</p>
<p>While I was there, this feeling was constantly in me. Japan has so many people and so many Christians, but God does not have a house. Many of the Lord&rsquo;s seekers also feel that they do not have a home. The believers who meet in other groups and the saints in our meetings asked where they should go. They feel homeless.</p>
<p>There are Christian groups that were established by local Japanese believers, and there are mission groups that were established two hundred years ago by Western missionaries. Moreover, there are two to three thousand Western missionaries who labor diligently in Japan. However, the first thing that the seeking believers asked me was where they should go. Sometimes I inquired why they asked this question, and they replied that they do not receive much supply and help where they meet. In other words, there is no pasture with food to eat. They do not have a home that can give them food.</p>
<p>No matter what our children do or where they go to play, at a certain time they say that it is time to go home and eat. There is a place where they can rest and enjoy food when they are hungry and need to eat. However, many saints cannot say that they have a place where they can eat when they are hungry or can rest when they are tired. Their needs are not met.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SITUATION IN AMERICA AND CANADA</h2>
<p>After Japan we went to America. Wherever we went, from the West Coast to the East Coast, I tried to understand the situation of the Christian groups. We stayed in New York City for quite a while and thought that if we could understand the situation in New York, we would understand the situation in the whole country. New York City is representative of America, but other places are not representative of America. From my observation I saw that the large country of America, which has thousands of Christians, does not have a house for God&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>When we were in San Francisco, I attended the crusade of a famous evangelist. The crusade truly had the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and many people were saved. Someone said that more people were saved when this evangelist was in New York. However, after their salvation, the newly saved ones are like newborn babies who do not have a place to grow up. In other words, there is no home to feed and care for the newborn babies.</p>
<p>When we were in New York, we did not announce our meetings, but believers, especially the Chinese believers, wanted to attend our meetings. After they listened to the messages, they cried out that they do not have a home. There are several Christian groups among the Chinese believers, but they all said that they do not have food. They do not have a place to rest; they do not have a home.</p>
<p>In summary, the impression we received from our visit is that the children of God do not have a home. This is the situation in America and in Canada. We did not contact many people in Canada, but we made a special visit to a well-known group founded by Oswald J. Smith. While we were there, he was holding a revival meeting in another place. The group is called the Peoples Church. Over the past fifty years this Christian group has supported the largest percentage of missionaries. It is a well-known fact that they are still supporting more than two hundred missionaries. They meet in a small chapel, but they are zealous in their support of missionaries. When we were there, a group of sisters was meeting and praying.</p>
<p>The information we received concerning Canada is that Canada is desolate and without any large gatherings. In America there are evangelists who attract large crowds of people to hear the gospel. In Canada, however, there does not seem to be any activity. This indicates a desolate situation.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Perfecting of the Saints and the Building Up of the House of God &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
