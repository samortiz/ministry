<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Eating&#151;to Receive Something In&#151;<br>Being Critical to Man</H2><P>Eating is critical to us because eating is to receive something into us. If you eat the right food, you will receive the nourishment. If you eat something poisonous, you will die. The parents hide all the poisonous things from their children and keep them out of their reach. Even the chemical and drug factories put a warning label on certain things to show that they are poisonous, or they may put their drugs in special containers which cannot be opened by children. What man takes into him is critical. It is a matter of life or death. Eating is critical to man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. After Man Was Created,<br>God Not Asking Man to Do Anything</H2><P>After man was created, God did not ask man to do anything. God was concerned only about what His created man would eat.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God Only Charging Man Not to Eat Wrongly</H2><P>God only charged man not to eat wrongly. How man would turn out and what man's destiny would be was altogether dependent upon what he would eat.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Eat the Tree of Knowledge Being to Receive Satan as an Evil Life into Man's Being</H2><P>When man ate the tree of knowledge, he received Satan as an evil life into his being. All of these points regarding God's intention in man are altogether not according to man's natural concept. This is why we need to stress these points, expound them, and make them so clear and impressive to all the saints.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. God's Forbidding Commandment<br>Being a Warning to Man</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Indicating God's Greatness in Dealing with Man</H2><P>God's forbidding commandment was a warning to man, indicating that God was great in His dealing with man. Only a small man forces people to accept his opinion. No one who is great or honorable will coerce people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Indicating God's Love to Man</H2><P>God's forbidding commandment to man also indicates God's love to man. Because God loved man, He warned man not to eat the wrong thing.</P>
