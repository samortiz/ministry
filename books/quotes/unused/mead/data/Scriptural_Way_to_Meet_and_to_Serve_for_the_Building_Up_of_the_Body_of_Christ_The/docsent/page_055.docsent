   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How can the word be in our mouth and even in our heart?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is by being the embodiment of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must always remember that today the living word we speak is the embodiment of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This word is Christ, and this word is the Spirit, the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>My speaking is a major factor of my good health.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In like manner, when we exercise to speak the living word, this is very healthy to our spiritual being, to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The more we speak the living word in a living way, the more we exercise our spirit and the more we breathe the fresh air of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then our spiritual being, which is actually our intrinsic being, our spirit, becomes very, very healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>EXERCISING TO SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>WITH A SPIRIT-FILLED SPIRIT</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that we have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to make a thorough confession of our sins to get ourselves fully emptied.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then our spirit will be filled with the Spirit, and we will speak by our Spirit-filled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When our spirit is filled with the Spirit, we are qualified to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all have to practice being filled with the Spirit to speak by our Spirit-filled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>EXERCISING TO SPEAK</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE WORD OF CHRIST TO ONE ANOTHER</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Colossians 3:16 indicates that we need to exercise to speak the word of Christ to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is very good for the members of a family to speak the word of Christ to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to build up a habit of speaking the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This will enable us to render some help to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If speaking the word becomes our habit, we will speak in the meetings and the meetings will be greatly enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Presently for many of us, our habit is not to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To change our habit is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to build up the habit of speaking the word of the Lord until it becomes easy for us to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A person cannot live without talking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more we talk, the healthier we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Talking makes people healthy and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To keep ourselves quiet all the time is to choke ourselves, and to talk is to release ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am not encouraging you to talk in a profane and vain way 1 Tim 6:20 but to talk with the living word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then your entire spiritual being will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more release you enjoy, the more growth you will have.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You will grow by speaking the living word, which is the very embodiment of the Triune God, and you will enjoy what you speak.</S>
