<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Trusting in God for His Saving<br>and Shining upon Him</H2><P>David said, "But I trust in You, O Jehovah;/I say, You are my God./My times are in Your hand" (vv. 14-15a). This is a very good word, but the New Testament revelation is higher than this. David's times were in the hand of God, but our entire being is in Jesus. David's times were in God's hand, but we are now in Christ, the embodiment of God (1 Cor. 1:30a; 2 Cor. 5:17). It is much higher to be in Christ.</P><P>Verse 16a says, "Cause Your face to shine upon Your servant." David was seeking God's face to shine upon him. He wanted to be pleasant to God, and he wanted God to be happy with him. This verse is in the context of his desire to be delivered from his enemies and for them to be put to shame (vv. 15b, 17). Thus, the shining which David sought in Psalm 31 is not the kind of shining for which we are seeking. The kind of shining which we need to seek is the shining that exposes us. When we are under God's shining, we will see that we are ugly, not pleasant. When we get into the shining of God, we will prostrate ourselves on the ground to confess.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Blessing God and Exhorting His Godly Ones<br>to Love Him and to Be Strong and Encouraged</H2><P>In verses 21-24 David blessed God and exhorted His godly ones to love God and to be strong and encouraged.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. IN EXPERIENCING GOD'S FORGIVENESS</H2><P>In Psalm 32 David expressed his sentiment in his experience of God's forgiveness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Experiencing His Confession<br>and God's Forgiveness of Sin</H2><P>Verses 1-2a say, "Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven;/Whose sin is covered./Blessed is the man to whom / Jehovah does not impute iniquity." This implies a lot. If there were no Redeemer, how could the righteous God not impute our iniquity to us? If God did this without a Redeemer, God would be unrighteous. God's not imputing our iniquity to us is based upon Christ's redemption.</P><P>David said that the blessed man is the one to whom Jehovah does not impute iniquity and "in whose spirit there is no deceit" (v. 2b). On the one hand, David indicated that he had been forgiven of his sins, yet on the other hand, he indicated that in his spirit there was no deceit. This is altogether unscriptural. If there were no deceit within man, he would not be a sinner in need of God's forgiveness. Since you need God's forgiveness, you must realize that you are full of deceit. Who is the one that does not have any deceit in his spirit yet should confess his sins? This is not logical.</P><P>Verses 3-4a say, "When I kept silent, my bones wasted away/Through my groaning all day long./For day and night Your hand/Was heavy upon me." David's expression here is good in showing us that God was dealing with him concerning his sins. He continued by saying, "My life sap was dried up/As in the drought of summer. Selah./I acknowledged my sin to You,/And I did not cover my iniquity./I said, I will confess my transgressions to Jehovah./Then You forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah" (vv. 4b-5). The iniquity of his sin refers to the effectiveness of sin. God forgave not only our sin but also the effectiveness of our sin which was deserving of His punishment.</P>
