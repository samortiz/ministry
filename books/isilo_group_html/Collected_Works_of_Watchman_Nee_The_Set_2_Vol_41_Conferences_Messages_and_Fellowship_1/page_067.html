Three things are mentioned here: gifts, ministries, and operations. Gifts are of the Spirit, operations are of God, and ministries are of the Lord. These three things are related to the Triune God. In the past many people have paid attention only to gifts and neglected ministries and operations. We have to understand the position of ministries and operations before we can understand the value of gifts and the operations of these gifts. Gifts produce the ministries, and ministries produce the operations.</p><p>A gift is the skill of a person. A ministry is the work of a person, and an operation or function is the result of a person's work. For example, in a construction company, there may be concrete workers, stone masons, and carpenters. The three kinds of craftsmen each have their own skill. Actually, there are different skills just among carpenters. Some are good at floor work, and others specialize in making windows or doors. These different skills are like the different gifts mentioned in the Bible. Every servant of God has a certain kind of skill derived from his gift. The gifts are given by the Holy Spirit. There are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit. Everyone has his own gift, but all these gifts must be under the control of the Spirit (v. 11).</p><p>The Holy Spirit has not distributed gifts to men for them to work on their own. He dispenses gifts according to a certain plan. We receive gifts from the Spirit for the purpose of participating in certain works according to the Lord's assignment. The works that we receive from the Lord become our ministries. This is like saying that the construction company is building houses in many places, and many people are assigned to various places. Some are experts in floor work, and the foreman will assign them to work on floors. Others are experts at making doors, and the foreman will assign them to various places to make doors. They are still under the direction of the foreman. All the ones who are assigned have their own skills, which are their gifts. The works assigned to them are their ministries. A man's craft is his gift, while the work assigned to him is his ministry. The end result is not for anyone's personal gain but for the achievement of the common goal which the foreman set out to achieve.</p><p>What is the difference between the work of Paul and the work of Apollos? Paul planted and Apollos watered, and God caused the growth (1 Cor. 3:6). This is the operation. Paul and Apollos each had their own skill and ability, and the Lord assigned them work according to their abilities and skills. According to their different assignments, they ended up with different ministries. If you have a skill, then you have a gift. When you engage in the work assigned to you by the masterbuilder, you have a ministry. The end result of the works of all the ministries is the operations.</p><p>Today we must all ask the Lord what kind of gifts we have received from Him and what our ministry is. If we have received a gift and a ministry, we should ask the Lord to bring out our operation. In this universe, God has a great operation. How is He going to accomplish this great operation? He accomplishes it through the Holy Spirit. The Spirit distributes the gifts, and God directs everyone to use these gifts for the accomplishment of His goal. Our responsibility is to work faithfully in the ministries assigned by the Lord according to the gifts we have received. We do not have to worry about our functions, because we cannot do anything about them. That is God's business.</p><p>First Corinthians 12 puts gifts together with the Spirit, ministries together with the Lord, and operations together with God. This reveals that gifts are from the Holy Spirit, ministries are assigned by the Lord, and operations are realized through God. Paul could plant and Apollos could water, but God caused the growth. Paul had the planting ministry, and Apollos had the watering ministry. However, even with the planting and the watering, God still must give the growth. This is entirely different from the work of laying floor tiles or making windows and doors.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 41: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (1) &nbsp; pg 67</div><br></body></html>
