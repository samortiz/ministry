<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Lord's Teaching in the New Testament Being "Blessed Are Those Who Are Persecuted [Not Prosperous] for the Sake of Righteousness"</H2><P>The Lord's teaching in the New Testament says, "Blessed are those who are persecuted [not prosperous] for the sake of righteousness" (Matt. 5:10). A brother may be one who hungers and thirsts for righteousness (v. 6), yet he is persecuted. I would not say that this persecution is Job's sufferings, but I would say that it is according to God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. People to Whom the Law Was Given<br>Will Be Judged according to the Law</H2><P>People to whom the law was given will be judged according to the law (Psa. 1:5-6; Rom. 2:12). Paul tells us in Romans 2:12 that all human beings will stand before God to be judged one day. But those who have received the law will be judged by God according to the law. Those who never received the law will be judged by God according to their conscience (vv. 15-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Ended by Christ</H2><P>The law has been ended by Christ (Rom. 10:4a). Christ is the end of the law, the close of the law, the replacement of the law. Christ came to fulfill the law (Matt. 5:17) that He might terminate the law and replace it (Rom. 8:3-4). Thus, everyone who believes in Him receives God's righteousness, which is Christ Himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. The New Testament Believers<br>Not Being under the Law</H2><P>The New Testament believers are not under the law (Rom. 6:14b). Hallelujah! We are no longer under the law, but we are now under grace.</P>
