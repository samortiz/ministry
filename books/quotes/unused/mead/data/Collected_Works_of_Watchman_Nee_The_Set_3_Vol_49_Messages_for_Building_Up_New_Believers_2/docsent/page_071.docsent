   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHAT TO DO IF ENGAGED TO AN UNBELIEVER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some brothers and sisters have another problem: They are engaged to unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What should they do?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. It Being Best for the Unbelieving Side</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>to Take the Initiative in Breaking the Engagement</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is clear that the Lord does not want us to marry unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If someone is already engaged to an unbeliever, the best thing would be for the unbelieving fianc or fianc e to voluntarily break the engagement.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The two are not yet married; they only have an agreement to marry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the Lord opens the way for the unbelieving side to voluntarily break the agreement because the other one has believed in the Lord, that is the best solution.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. Not Annulling Any Agreement Arbitrarily</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, it is often impossible to have such a solution.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because a marriage agreement exists, the other party may not easily let go just because you have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At such times, you need to realize that an engagement to a person is a covenant with that person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such a covenant is a promise you have made before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A Christian cannot arbitrarily annul a covenant just because he has believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Any covenant is holy in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You can suggest a dissolution to the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The other party can initiate such a dissolution, or you can initiate it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The proposal need not be initiated by the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is different from the earlier case.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the case of a marriage, the other party must initiate it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the case of an engagement, you can initiate the dissolution of the engagement.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the other party insists that you fulfill the marriage agreement, you have to fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once something comes out of the mouth of a Christian, he has to honor it; he cannot annul it arbitrarily.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We receive salvation because God honors His word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If God did not honor His word, there would not be any salvation at all.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, you have to negotiate with the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the other party is unwilling to dissolve the relationship, you have to marry him or her.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Psalm 15:4 says, "Should he swear to his harm,/He does not change."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After the Israelites entered the land of Canaan, the Gibeonites deceived them with dry, moldy bread, old patched shoes, and worn garments.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They said that they came from a far country, and Joshua promised not to kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Later, he found out that they were actually from a near country.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because a covenant had been made with them, God would not allow the Israelites to kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the most, they were made woodcutters and drawers of water Josh 9:3-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Honoring one's covenant is a serious matter in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is all right for you to annul an engagement only if the other party is willing to annul it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if the other party is not willing to annul it, you cannot annul it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The covenant with the Gibeonites produced serious consequences.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rain was withheld from heaven because Saul slaughtered the Gibeonites.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>David was forced to ask the Gibeonites what he should do for them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Gibeonites demanded that seven of the sons of Saul be hung, and David had to comply 2 Sam 21:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God will not allow us to breach a covenant arbitrarily.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must learn to honor any covenant we make.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We cannot do anything that is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>C. Negotiating the Terms Beforehand</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You have been engaged to someone, and now you have become a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What should you do if the other party insists on marrying you?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here is something that you can do: Negotiate the terms with him ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You can say, "I will definitely marry you, but I would like to settle a few matters with you before marriage."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What are the few matters?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First, the other party must allow you to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You should not move into the other party's house with a false disguise; you should move in with an open banner.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You are now a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even though you are marrying the other person, he must give you the liberty to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He must not interfere with your service to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Second, when you have children, they must be brought up according to the teaching of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whether or not the other party becomes a Christian is up to him or her, but the children must be brought up according to the teaching of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You must settle this from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Put this on the table first and have an agreement ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you have an agreement, you will not face difficulties later.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But if you do not make an agreement beforehand, you will face difficulties down the road.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Marrying an unbeliever is always a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But you can minimize the loss and the headaches by coming to an agreement first.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The other party must agree to give you the freedom to lead your children to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You have become a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You will not go to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You will always be on the Lord's side.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If the other party is agreeable to this, you can proceed with the marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If the other party does not like it, he can annul the agreement.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We need to inform the other party about our future commitment.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This will tend to reduce the problems that will eventually come.</S>
