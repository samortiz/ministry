   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWING UNTO MATURITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BECOME THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Starting in the garden of Eden, the God of creation began to work in us to make us pure gold and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When His work is done, we will be in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time we will not only be in the New Jerusalem, but we will also be able to say that we are the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is God who is working heaven into us, and it is God who is working us into the heavenlies cf.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Heaven and man are becoming one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Heaven is the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the New Jerusalem is manifested, this dwelling place of God will be us, and we will be the dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Heaven is being built into us, and we are being built into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are not only being joined with God but also with heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, God s thought is not merely that man would be saved, have his sins forgiven, and have God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God wants man to be transformed, to grow in life unto maturity, to let Christ be formed in him, and to be conformed into the Lord s image.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then man will be built up to become the New Jerusalem, the eternal Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all need to see this light today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have been saved, our sins have been forgiven, and we have God s life, but we still must grow in life and become mature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God would never put a man of clay in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every stone built into the New Jerusalem is a precious stone that has been transformed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As soon as the life of God gets into man, transformation begins to take place within him to gradually build him into the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, strictly speaking, we do not walk into the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, God works us into it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, this requires the growth and maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be in the garden of Eden did not require the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once man was created, he was put in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Entering into the Paradise of Hades also does not require the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Believers simply enter into it when they die.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, to be in the Paradise of the New Jerusalem requires our whole being our spirit and soul with our body to be prepared and completely transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It requires the growth and maturity in life so that we may participate in God s eternal dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The cleansing of the precious blood delivers us from sins so that we do not perish.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, whether we can be transformed to become building material for the New Jerusalem depends on the extent to which the life of God grows in us and transforms us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everyone in the New Jerusalem is a precious stone, not a piece of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, the goal of our salvation is not merely to believe but to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The goal is not to go to heaven but to grow in life.</S>
