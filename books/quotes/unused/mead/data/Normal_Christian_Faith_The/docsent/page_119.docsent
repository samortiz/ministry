   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHO RULES THE UNIVERSE?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I do not know if anyone can be so bold as to say that there is no God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But let us set this question aside for now.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Consider the universe again.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is very big, but at the same time, it is very small.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Objects that are even undetectable to the microscope have definite structures, laws, and order.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is true with whatever micro-object you consider.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Men used to say that atoms were the smallest objects.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Later they discovered that electrons were smaller.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Recently, men have found that there are particles that are even smaller than electrons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although these particles are small, they have definite principles, laws, and order governing them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If there is no God, who is organizing these things?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How can it be a coincidence?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There must be a God who rules and arranges everything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Otherwise, how can we have the wonderful order that we have today?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The order of things can only speak of two possibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It can either be by chance, or it must be set into place by someone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It can only come by chance or arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Either someone has arranged these things, or they have come about by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One of the two must be right.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BY CHANCE?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Anything that happens by chance happens without a reason; anything that comes by arrangement speaks of someone behind the scene who is planning and executing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If no one in this universe is arranging everything, and if everything occurs by chance, then we are truly lost and bewildered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some friends have said that the universe was formed when one object collided into another and a third object was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I cannot understand this logic.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have never seen one object in this world that is the result of two things randomly colliding into one another.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My handkerchief did not come about by a few branches colliding with each other to produce cotton, and cotton colliding with cotton to produce threads, and threads colliding with each other to produce a handkerchief.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I simply cannot understand this logic.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is nothing in this universe that has come about by chance collision.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let me tell you a real story to illustrate this point about producing things by chance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A man was visiting a factory in America that manufactured meat grinders, and he talked with the factory manager.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These meat grinders can be found everywhere in Shanghai among butchers and meat hawkers; they are small machines that shred the beef into small pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>During the visit, the man discussed the origin of the universe with the manager.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The manager said that there must be a wise and powerful God who had set everything in the universe in order.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Another person who was there said, "There is no God in the universe, and everything came by chance."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The manager did not argue with him; rather, he led him to where the meat grinders were being manufactured.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He told the man, "My little machine is made up of only eight parts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since you have said that the universe came about by chance, please try and put this machine together by chance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I will put the eight parts and a few screws into a box.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please shake the box and see if you can make a meat grinder out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I have a few hundred workers in this factory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The most capable ones can assemble two hundred machines a day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If I hired a simple girl from the countryside, who has never seen such a machine, she could do the job within a few days no matter how slow she was.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if you shook the box like I said, you would not get one machine in a month or even a year.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is impossible!"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A little machine that is worth only 3.70 cannot be produced by chance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Could the vast universe have been produced by chance?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Is it possible that all the objects in this world were produced by chance?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A carpenter can make a chair like the one I am sitting on in half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But if we waited for it to be produced by chance, I am afraid that we would not have a chair to sit on today.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is too incredible for the many things in this universe to come about by chance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There must be someone who has designed the universe, in order for it to be as orderly and logical as it is.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even the most foolish and uneducated person in this world can come to this conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Unless a man is a fool, he has to believe that there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If he does not believe this, there must be something wrong with his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At any rate, there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is illogical for man to believe that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Those who do not believe in God must have something wrong in their mind.</S>
