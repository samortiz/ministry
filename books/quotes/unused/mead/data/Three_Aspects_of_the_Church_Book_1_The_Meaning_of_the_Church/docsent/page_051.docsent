   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Holy Place</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Proceeding inward from the outer court, a priest would enter the Holy Place, in which there were three items.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Table of the Bread of the Presence</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first item was the table of the bread of the Presence Exo 25:30 , also translated as the showbread table.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the north side of the Holy Place was a table on which was set the bread of the Presence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We know that the bread was displayed, as indicated by the translation showbread.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This bread signifies Christ becoming our food, our bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is something displayed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A person who liked watching movies in the past can be cleansed from condemnation through the Lord s blood and washed from the defilement of movies through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As he begins to learn to pray and fellowship with the Lord, he will enter the Holy Place and be able to experience Christ as his power of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He will even be able to testify that Christ is in him as the power of life, enabling him not to be defiled by earthly things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The power of life within him is displayed especially when he gives a testimony that is full of the power of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This, however, is merely the visible bread of the Presence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a superficial experience; nevertheless, in comparison to the experience of the laver, it is deeper and more inward.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lampstand</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second item was the lampstand vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>31-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The lampstand was on the south side of the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The light of the lampstand shone forth and was expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The display of the bread of the Presence signifies the power of life, and the shining forth of the lampstand signifies the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Both of these signify Christ in us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The bread signifies that Christ s life satisfies and strengthens us, and the light shows that Christ s life shines on us as our light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the Lord Jesus said, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger John 6:35 , and also, I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Incense Altar</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The third item was the incense altar Exo 30:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The incense altar was on the west side of the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fragrance of the incense ascended upward, the bread of the Presence was displayed, and the light shone forth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everything was visible and not hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The incense altar signifies Christ as our acceptance before God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that Christ is our acceptance before God and the power by which we live before God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ Himself is our strength, our light, and our acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through Christ we have the power to live the Christian life, the light to proceed on our way, and the means of being accepted before God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar were found in the Holy Place, they still were manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, they have both an inward and outward aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In contrast, the altar and the laver were entirely outward, being located in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the offerings offered on the altar, as well as the bronze laver, were located in the outer court and were altogether visible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Holy Place, however, was enclosed within the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The three items in the Holy Place the displayed bread, the shining light, and the ascending incense speak of outward aspects of inward matters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Holy Place typifies man s soul, the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Psychologists divide man into two parts: metaphysical and physical.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The outward, visible part is physical and is related to the outer man, whereas the inward, invisible part is metaphysical and is related to the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, to say that man s soul is inward and man s body is outward is very logical.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, the Bible and our experience indicate that even though man s soul is something inward, it belongs to the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What then is the inner man?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our spirit is the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only the spirit of the saved ones has the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that God is not in the Holy Place but in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, the Holy Place typifies the outer man, the soulish man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A person who has not been saved for a long period of time has normally experienced Christ as life, light, and acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It can be said that he is altogether in his soul and in his excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not bad to be in the soul, but it is superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Holy Place, Christ is our life, which is related to the bread of the Presence; Christ is our light, which is related to the lampstand; and Christ is our acceptance, which is related to the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, all these aspects are still shallow; they are outward aspects of inward matters.</S>
