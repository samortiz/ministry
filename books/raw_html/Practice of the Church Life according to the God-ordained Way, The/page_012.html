<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Hierarchy Built Up by the Ministry<br>and the Ministry Office</H2><P>After I returned to Anaheim from Taipei in December 1987, a letter from one of the dissenting ones was waiting for me in my home. In this long letter the writer rebuked me, saying that the nature of the Lord's recovery had changed and that he had no alternative but to withdraw from the work. In a second letter to me he accused me of building up a hierarchy to subdue and control the churches (see The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion, pages 56-57). At the end of December I went to Irving to take care of the winter training there. During the winter training, on a Lord's Day I invited this brother to my apartment. In the presence of approximately six or seven brothers I said to him, "Brother..., in your letter to me (of December 16, 1987) you blamed my office for building up a hierarchy. Please point out to me a real case. Where is such a real hierarchy? I would be the first one to tear it down." He hesitated for awhile and did not speak. Then he answered, "There is the tendency" (see The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion, pages 59-60). In his letter he did not say "there is the tendency." He said emphatically that a hierarchy had been built up. Now he changed and said that there is the tendency. There is a tendency on this earth for everything. I have not died yet, but there is the tendency that I will die. This is the way that the rebellion was going on, without any ethical standard.</P><P>Today, outside mainland China there are approximately twelve hundred churches around the globe. I would ask all the churches: If you are a church that is under a hierarchy built up by me or by my office, please tell me. Thus far, no one has pointed out such a thing to me.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The System of the Ministry</H2><P>The dissenters have also said that the ministry is a system, and all the churches have been systematized into this entity. The church in Rosemead declared that they would not be in the "system" of Witness Lee. The hall in Rosemead was built with funds from the sale of Elden Hall in Los Angeles, which was bought through my hand. In addition, the Living Stream Ministry gave the church in Rosemead $100,000 as a gift. Eventually, the rebellious ones in Rosemead took over the meeting hall and evicted in writing the two bona fide elders, Francis Ball and John Kwan. These two brothers were properly appointed elders who had been accepted by the saints, but at the time the rebellious ones were going to take over the hall, they wrote letters to the two elders, telling them that they could no longer set foot on the premises of the church in Rosemead and that if they attempted to do so, they would be forcefully evicted (see The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion, pages 52-55).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. "Ministry Churches," No Longer Local Churches</H2><P>The opposers also say that the churches that follow the ministry are "ministry churches" and are no longer local churches. The leading ones of the church in Raleigh, North Carolina, came to contact me. They came with a number of books in which they had underlined certain paragraphs. One section they had underlined was in Brother Nee's book The Normal Christian Church Life (published by Living Stream Ministry). There Brother Nee said that the missionaries who went to China built up mission churches instead of local churches. Every mission built up churches under its own name. Brother Nee said that it was right for the missionaries to go to China to preach the gospel, but it was wrong for them to build up their denominational churches. They should preach the gospel and build up only local churches. (See The Normal Christian Church Life, pages 135, 138-140, 162-164.) Then the leading ones from Raleigh applied this to me, saying that I do not build up the local churches but churches to my ministry. They should not "take the hat from a condemned one and put it on my head."</P><P>I have never built up any "ministry church." I have been in the recovery for sixty years, laboring continually. I was also with Brother Nee for twenty years. Neither Brother Nee nor I ever built up a church to ourselves. The churches built up through the Lord's ministry are not "ministry churches." Although Paul's ministry built up a number of churches, it is not right to call any of these churches "Pauline churches." Some of the Corinthians said, "I am of Paul," others said, "I of Apollos," and others, "I of Cephas" (1 Cor. 1:12); but eventually Paul said that he, Apollos, and Cephas were of the Corinthians, for all were theirs (3:21-22). The missionaries went to China and built up their mission churches, but our ministry has built up not "ministry churches" but local churches. Today it is difficult to find any local church on this earth that has not been built up by our ministry. Therefore, their accusing of me is not fair.</P>
