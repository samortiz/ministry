   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THROUGH THE BREAKING OF THE SHELL OF HIS HUMANITY BY HIS DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The glory of Christ's divinity was released through the breaking of the shell of His humanity by His death John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The death of Christ was a release.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In John 12:23 the Lord Jesus said, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For Him to be glorified was not to be exalted but to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is clearly indicated by the following verse: "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was His release.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a grain of wheat does not fall into the ground and die, it abides by itself alone and no one knows what is within the grain.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But when the grain enters into death, its content is released.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus likens Himself to a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When He was living in His humanity for thirty-three and a half years, no one, including His mother, knew who He was.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Others regarded Him as nothing more than a man, but no one knew what He was according to the contents of His inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was a man in the flesh, but there was another One in this man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This other One was God Himself, and God is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since God as glory was concealed in His flesh as a shell, He needed the release spoken of in John 12:24.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to be released and not to remain alone, the one grain of wheat had to fall into the ground and die.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through the Lord's death the glory of His divinity was released.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A. The Unique Grain That Contained His Divine Life with His Divine Glory</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Jesus was the unique grain that contained His divine life with His divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Concerning John 12:24 we often speak about the release of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we need to see that the divine glory of Christ was released with His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we received Christ, we received His life, and this life is His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>B. The Shell of His Humanity Being Broken through His Crucifixion, and All the Elements of His Divinity Being Released</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the shell of the Lord's humanity was broken through His crucifixion, which was the baptism He went through, all the elements of His divinity-His divine life and His divine glory-were released.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Luke 12:50 the Lord Jesus said, "I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord's baptism was His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He longed to be baptized, to be crucified, in order to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was pressed, constrained, in His flesh, and He desired to be released by the baptism of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through the breaking of the shell of His humanity by His death, His glory was released.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His release was His being glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to praise Christ for His death because His death was His release.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>C. The Life-releasing Death</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the sense explained above, Christ's death is considered the life-releasing death with His glory released simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot separate His life from His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When His life was released, His glory was released also.</S>
