   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE TO BE SAVED BY OUR BEING CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF THE SON OF GOD AND BY OUR BEING GLORIFIED Scripture Reading: Rom 8:28-30, 11; Phil 3:21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we will cover the last two items of God's saving in the life of Christ: our conformation to the image of the Son of God and our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These two items are unveiled in Romans 8:28-30, in the middle, not at the end, of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, these two will be the final, consummating items of God's full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, these two items are presented to you in the last chapter of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>BY OUR BEING CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF THE SON OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The full salvation of God as revealed in the whole book of Romans has a particular purpose, that is, to make us sinners His sons that we may be His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is the mysterious God and He is invisible, but He has a desire, as His good pleasure, to have Himself expressed through man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, He was expressed in His incarnated Son, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then He desires to enlarge this individual expression into a corporate one by making us, His chosen and called people, His many sons that His only begotten Son could be His firstborn Son among many brothers to express Him in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, we, the many brothers of Christ, need to be conformed to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Image of Christ as the Firstborn Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ was the only begotten Son of God from eternity past until the time that He was resurrected in His incarnated and crucified body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In His resurrection with His humanity He was born Acts 13:33 to be the firstborn Son of God Heb 1:6; Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the only begotten Son of God, He is God, the Second of the divine Trinity, having divinity only; as the firstborn Son of God, He is the God-man, the embodiment of the Triune God, possessing both divinity and humanity, bearing the image of the God-man, of God mingled with man, to manifest God through man, to express all God's attributes in man's virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Conformed to the Image of Christ as the Firstborn Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For us to be conformed to the image of the Son of God is to be conformed to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29 , the One who possesses both the divine nature and the human nature and who bears the image of God mingled with man, with God's attributes expressed in man's virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we are conformed to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God, we bear the image of divinity mingled with humanity, the image of His all-inclusive death, and the image of His resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we experience this aspect of being saved in the life of Christ, we become persons full of the proper human life with the expression of the divine life in resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The New Testament charges us strongly to express the firstborn Son of God with His divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must have our human virtues filled up with the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then what we express will be human yet divine, divine yet human.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Saved from Our Natural Life</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This kind of conformation saves us from the expression of our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we experience being conformed to the image of Christ as the God-man, we will be persons who are in the death of Christ, under the death of the cross, being conformed to the image of Christ, not to the fashion or image of the world or of our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to have such an expression, we must have the application of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The cross terminates our natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For Christ as the firstborn Son of God to live a human life, full of the expression of the divine attributes, He needed the death of the cross and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The expression of Christ as the firstborn Son of God requires the death of the natural life and the power of resurrection in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When our natural life is crossed out, divinity in the power of resurrection will be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This expression is the image of the firstborn Son of God, and this is the image to which we must be conformed through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was Paul's aspiration in Philippians 3:10 when he said that he wanted "to know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death."</S>
