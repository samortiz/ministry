The subject of these messages is the application of the interpretation of the New Jerusalem to the seeking believers
Its gates are pearls signifying the issue of the secretion of Christs redeeming and lifereleasing death and His lifedispensing resurrection
Its wall and its foundations are precious stones, consummated by the Spirit through His transforming and building work
In the past we released many messages to interpret this section of the Word on the mystery of the New Jerusalem
In this first message, we want to see and enter into the application of the significance and the base of the New Jerusalem
The holy city is a constitution in life of the processed Triune God mingled with His regenerated transformed and glorified tripartite elect
We human beings can dwell in a divine temple because we have been made God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead
In the old creation, represented by Adam, we were dusty men, but when we were regenerated, we became golden men
In the river grows the tree of life, signifying Christ, as the main supply to the entire city through the river
From the throne proceeds the river of water of life, signifying the Spirit, and this Spirit is God's flowing out
In the middle of the street is the river, which is God proceeding out to be life as water to quench the thirst of the entire city
These three things-the street, the river, and the tree of life-reach all the twelve gates, which signify God's redeemed elect
The divine fellowship brings God to all His redeemed people, to all the twelve gates, to bring all His redeemed people back to Himself
From the day you repented, you have felt that there is a throne and a golden street, a golden administration, within you
As we enter into the experience and application of the divine nature of God, we make ourselves genuine parts of the New Jerusalem
Even in the church life, we can make natural friendships with certain saints, but that is not the genuine fellowship
When an oyster is wounded by a grain of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the grain of sand and makes it into a precious pearl
Pearls signify the issue of Christ's secretion in two aspects: His redeeming and life-releasing death and His life-dispensing resurrection
Without God's revelation we can never realize that the death of Christ secretes, dispenses, to produce the gates of the city
We have to put not just Christ's death itself but the secretion of His death into our daily experience subjectively
Dear saints, the second application of the New Jerusalem is for us to experience subjectively the death of Christ in our daily life
No human being can do it except those who know the power of the resurrection of Christ they have the capacity the ability to practice this
By the power of the resurrection of Christ, we have the ability and the power to keep our pitiful self on the cross
The Spirit of Jesus Christ is Christ Himself as the life-giving Spirit, who is the reality of the resurrection of Christ
When we turn to our spirit, we meet Christ as the life-giving Spirit, who is the very reality of Christ's resurrection
In order to apply this we have to remain in our spirit all the time to meet Christ as the Spirit, who is the reality of His resurrection
The application of the gates of the city is first to remain on the cross by the power of Christ's resurrection
It is only through prayer that we can touch Christ in our spirit as the lifegiving Spirit the Spirit who is the reality of His resurrection
When we practice the death of Christ, we will be conformed to His death, having the image of a dead person on the cross
When we touch the Spirit we touch Christ in His resurrection and this will conform us to the image of the glory of the firstborn Son of God
Now there is an entry of Christ's death and resurrection which satisfies the requirements of God's righteous law
Revelation 21:12 says that the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel are inscribed on the twelve gates
Israel here represents the law of the Old Testament, indicating that the law is represented at the gates of the New Jerusalem
The law watches and observes as a gatekeeper to insure that the entrance into the holy city meets the law's requirements
If we have been crucified and resurrected with Christ, we are qualified to satisfy the righteousness of the Old Testament law
Such an entry today is available to all the people on this earth in four directions: east, north, south, and west
In Luke 15 we see the operation of the Triune God to receive the repentant sinners to enter into the New Jerusalem
In the previous message, we saw the subjective application of the Lord's death and resurrection to us in our daily experience
Paul also told us in Romans 8:13 that by the Spirit we put all the practices of our flesh to death that we may live
To apply the death and resurrection of Christ to our daily walk subjectively to make us divine, to make us golden, is by the Spirit
Christ, the One who accomplished crucifixion and who has consummated the resurrection, became the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection
Also, to apply Christ's resurrection in our daily experience, in our daily walk, is by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
It is only by the Spirit that we can apply Christ's death and resurrection subjectively to our daily life in our daily experience
We may have the base, redemption, and resurrection, but if we do not have transformation we are still not golden
God works Himself into us as the gold through Christ's redemption and resurrection by the transformation of the Spirit
God hath us regenerated In our spirit with His life; But He must transform us further- In our soul by His own life
Lord, transform us to Thine image In emotion, mind, and will; Saturate us with Thy Spirit, All our being wholly fill
The first function is to separate, to sanctify, the city unto God from all things other than God, thus making the city the holy city
When we came to this country, we put out messages to define the divine Father and to thus protect the riches of the divinity of the Father
Corinthians 15:45b emphatically says that the last Adam, Christ in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit in resurrection
His attainments which He consummated in His ascension are for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy through His heavenly ministry
He became our High Priest the Mediator of the new covenant the surety of the better covenant and the Minister in the heavenly Holy of Holies
Today in ascension He is also the Paraclete of the New Testament believers , and our Intercessor at the right hand of God
The rainbow is God's guarantee in His unfailing faithfulness that the earth will never be destroyed by the flood of water
After this fellowship we can see that the New Jerusalem's transformed and built up wall functions in four main ways
God would not let any of His things be mixed up with the things which are not of Him, so there is the need of separation
The wall of the holy city protects the interest of the riches of God's divinity and the attainments of Christ's consummation
God's appearance is like jasper and the light of the New Jerusalem is like jasper, so the whole city will express God
God the Father is the gold as the base; God the Son is the gates to bring people in; and God the Spirit transforms people to express God
The fourth function of the wall with its foundations is to guarantee God's unfailing faithfulness for eternal security
The New Jerusalem standing upon the twelve layers of its foundations in the colors of the rainbow guarantees God's faithfulness
In our created state we were dust, but God wants to transform us into something which is wonderful in His eyes
By His Spirit He transforms us through the renewing of our mind, emotion, and will, the components of our soul
The soul is the natural man, the natural man is the fallen man, and the fallen man is the man abandoned by God
In order to experience the transformation of God by the Spirit, we have to apply all the Bible teachings to our mind
Our stubborn will must be subdued to be a renewed will, which is so willing to submit itself to the will of God
We need to consider why the temple is considered a furnishing of the holy city and not part of the structure itself
The redeeming God is not only the basic factor for the structure of the New Jerusalem but also the very central furnishing
The holy city as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in, and the redeeming God as the temple is for the redeemed saints to dwell in
In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place for God and man for eternity
These co-kings are also the priests who serve God ; hence, they are the royal priesthood, the kingly priesthood
All the folks of the same divine family live in that temple, where they worship God and live as kings, making that living place a palace
Their dwelling place is the place not only for them to serve God but also for them to live as kings; it is a palace
The Japanese have their emperors, the British have their kings, but there has never been a situation where the whole family are kings
We believers in Christ, who are washed by the blood and regenerated by the Spirit, are the children of God who will eventually become kings
Our Father-King is the unique Father, but He will have millions of successors because we will all be His co-kings
The entire Bible tells us that we, the children of God, eventually will be the children-kings in the King's house
The reign in the holy city will be not only God Himself as the Father-King, but also His children as the co-kings with their Father
The illuminating glory of God is the light within Christ, and the redeeming Christ is the lamp containing the light
God's glory is the light of the city, and God is contained by Christ as the content, shining out through Christ
Also, the entire city of the New Jerusalem is the diffuser, diffusing the divine light over the nations outside the city
All the nations around the city will be under this diffusing with God as the light of glory and Christ as the containing lamp
Revelation tells us that in the New Jerusalem we do not need the natural light of the moon and the sun or the artificial light
Every day you have to realize that you are a person who is under the divine throne and who is also in the divine administration
If you can remember that you are a person under the divine throne and in the divine administration, this will change your daily life
Our natural knowledge, our natural ability in understanding and realizing things, is like the light of the sun and the moon
We should not realize or do anything according to our natural ability or according to all of the education we have received
For the building up of the Body of Christ, we walk and live under the divine, redeeming, and shining light through the word of God
As we have seen, the main structure of the city is of three factors: gold as the base, pearls as the gates, and precious stones as the wall
God is the shining light, Christ is the container of God as the lamp, and within the lamp is the oil, the Spirit
The basic structure of the holy city is the Divine Trinity, its furnishings are the Divine Trinity, and its supply is the Divine Trinity
The entire divine revelation in the holy Word shows how God in His Divine Trinity dispenses Himself into His chosen people
In this last and greatest sign in the Scriptures, the sign of the New Jerusalem, its structure, furnishings, and supply are the Triune God
The very God we preach and teach is the One who, according to the divine revelation, has been processed and consummated
It was only within the last forty years that we began to use the terms processed and consummated to describe the Triune God
If Christ had not been processed, how could He have become a man to die on the cross to take away all our sins?
Jesus was a genuine man, but through His death and in His resurrection, another two steps of His process, He became the life-giving Spirit
If He had not become the life-giving Spirit, how could He have entered into us to be our life and our life supply?
The Triune God has been consummated into one life-giving Spirit, and this Spirit is the flow signified by the river of water of life
The supply of the city is the Father as the source, the Spirit as the flow, and Christ as the content, typified by the tree of life
We have seen that everything we are and do in our move and work for God needs to be based upon the golden nature of God
Christ is our way to enter into the city, so He is signified by the pearl gates, which include the reality of His death and His resurrection
The supply Christ affords is for our nourishment and the water the Spirit brings to us is for our supply to satisfy us and quench our thirst
If we look at today's outward situation, we can see the lack of the building up of the Body of Christ which consummates the New Jerusalem
We need to release the truth that God became a man so that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead
Through this nourishment and divine beverage we members of the new city grow in the divine life and are built together
