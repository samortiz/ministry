</ol>
<p>Angels are a big topic in the Bible. As we consider the crucial truths in the Bible, we cannot avoid studying this topic. We should know this topic because angels have a close relationship with the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORIGIN OF ANGELS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;God, who made heaven...and all things in them&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 14:15).</p>
<p>God is the Creator of heaven and all things in it. Heaven and everything in it were created by God. Since angels are in heaven, they were created by God. They exist because they were created by God. God&rsquo;s creation is the origin of angels.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NATURE OF ANGELS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Are they not all ministering spirits?&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 1:14).</p>
<p>Angels are spirits, so their nature is spiritual. Their nature is different from physical things. Our physical eyes cannot see them, and our physical senses cannot sense them.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;They neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 22:30).</p>
<p>Angels are spirits, so they do not have differences in gender and thus are not involved in matters such as marriage like humans who have physical bodies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OTHER NAMES FOR ANGELS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The sons of God&rdquo;</strong> (Job 1:6; 2:1).</p>
<p>Angels are called the sons of God because they were created by God. Although they were not born of God and do not have the life of God, they were created by Him, and God is their source. Therefore, they are called the sons of God, just as Adam was called the son of God because he was created by God (Luke 3:38), even though Adam was neither born of God nor had the life of God. The status of angels is different from the status of regenerated believers, who are the children of God. Believers are born of God and have the life of God. Angels were created by God but do not have God&rsquo;s life. Even though angels do not have God&rsquo;s life, they are still from God and thus can be called sons of God. The Bible considers all who are from God to be sons of God, regardless of whether they were created by God or are born of God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The host of heaven&rdquo;</strong> (1 Kings 22:19).</p>
<p>In the Bible the angels are called the host of heaven because they are God&rsquo;s heavenly army. As God&rsquo;s army, they fight for God against the enemy (2 Kings 6:14-18; Dan. 10:18, 20-21; 12:1; Rev. 12:7; Matt. 26:53; John 18:36). This army of angels is in the heavens and is exceedingly numerous; therefore, the angels are called the host of heaven.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NUMBER OF ANGELS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 5:11; see also Heb. 12:22; Dan. 7:10).</p>
<p>The Bible says that the number of angels is ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands. This is a number that we cannot count. We know that the universe is very large. Just the angels alone, whom we cannot see, number ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands. There are so many that we have no way to count them! There are so many angels because in this immense universe there are many matters that require their attention.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE POSITION OF ANGELS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;What is mortal man...? / You have made Him a little lower than angels&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 8:4-5).</p>
<p>In this verse the psalmist says that God made man a little lower than the angels. According to the context of this portion, this speaks of the order in God&rsquo;s creation. In the order of God&rsquo;s creation, angels are higher than man, and men are lower than angels. Therefore, even the Lord Jesus in His incarnation was lower than the angels with respect to His humanity (Heb. 2:9). But in God&rsquo;s salvation we are children of God, whereas angels are servants of God and serve us (1:14); therefore, we are greater than the angels.</p>
