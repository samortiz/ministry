   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The history of Christianity is a history of the struggle for power.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This struggle is within each one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You may not realize it, but it is hidden inside you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eventually, the church life will be a test to our real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As long as we are in the church life, sooner or later we will be tested and exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Consider the rebels among the children of Israel in Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some rebels were on the border of the camp, some were with the mixed multitude, and some were very close to Moses, the leading one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now, in chapter sixteen, two hundred fifty leaders rebelled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In view of all this, we must believe that the struggle for power was in every one of the sons of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have been confronting this problem for over sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The elders know that if they serve in a certain local church for several years, they will surely offend others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some people are seeking for position and power, and if, because of the elders, they cannot get what they want, they will be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, in 1935 a co-worker in Shanghai rose up to take advantage of a tumultuous situation to seek for a "promotion."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Nee was away and had left the administration of the church and the leadership of the work to me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The brother who was trying to take advantage of the turmoil came to me, but I did not give him a positive answer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, this co-worker became an enemy to Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those in the church life or in the Lord's work who are somewhat in the position of taking the lead will unavoidably offend some who are greedy for power.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because their desire for power and their lust for position are not satisfied, these greedy ones get offended and become displeased with those taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In such a case, the book of Numbers gives us a map that helps us to know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In chapter sixteen, Moses was bold and faithful in confronting a large-scale rebellion, a rebellion of two hundred fifty leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although he fell on his face, he still did something.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He brought this matter openly to God, to let God come in to speak, to judge, and to vindicate.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In spite of what Moses did, those rebels, especially the leaders, were strong and stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They had made up their minds not to be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Moses asked Dathan and Abiram to come to the tent of meeting, that is, to the Lord, they accused Moses, saying that he had brought them out of a land of milk and honey Egypt , that he had made himself a ruler over them, and that he had not brought them into a land flowing with milk and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Finally, they said, "Will you put out the eyes of these men?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We will not come up" v. 14 . They were eloquent and very stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What should we do in this kind of situation?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In such a rebellious situation, it is better not to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord is still living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is still on the throne and is still sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is the sovereign Lord and the highest authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is the Head of the Body today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, we must always refer these things to Him and let Him be what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is all we can do, and this is what we must do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Concerning ourselves, we need to realize that without the Lord's mercy and grace we might be the same as Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But by His mercy we are here.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we must learn to be alert and pray regarding any kind of rebellious situation.</S>
