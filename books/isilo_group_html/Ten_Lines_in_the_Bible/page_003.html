<p>The name of God that occurs most frequently in the Old Testament is Jehovah or Yehovah. In Hebrew this name is composed of three words: <em>Je</em> represents a word, <em>ho</em> represents a word, and <em>vah</em> also represents a word. <em>Je</em> means &ldquo;is,&rdquo; <em>ho</em> means &ldquo;was,&rdquo; and <em>vah</em> means &ldquo;will be.&rdquo; Therefore, Jehovah translated into English is &ldquo;the One who is, was, and always will be.&rdquo; The verb <em>to be</em> can also be translated as &ldquo;to be present&rdquo;; thus, in Revelation 1:8 the Chinese Union Version says, &ldquo;He who is present, who was present, and who will be present forever.&rdquo; So <em>Jehovah</em> means that God is present, was present, and will be present forever, and also that He is, was, and will be forever. In addition, this word also means &ldquo;self-existing and ever-existing, without beginning or end, forever remaining and never ceasing to be,&rdquo; and &ldquo;forever unchanging.&rdquo; In Exodus 3:14-15, &ldquo;I AM WHO I AM&rdquo; is the meaning of <em>Jehovah.</em></p>
<p>In the New Testament, the Lord Jesus referred to Himself often as I Am. This can be seen in John 8:24, 28, and 58. I Am in the New Testament is Jehovah in the Old Testament. This name means that God is everything. It is mentioned more than seven thousand times in the Old Testament and is first used in Genesis 2:4. From the basic title <em>Jehovah</em> ten compound names and an abbreviated name are formed.</p>

<p>These ten compound names reveal Jehovah as something to us; therefore, we know that Jehovah is a particular name related to God&rsquo;s coming to have a relationship with man. In chapter 1 of Genesis there is only the name Elohim. The name Jehovah is mentioned starting from chapter 2 when speaking of the relationship between God and man. This name shows us that God is everything that man needs, just as the Lord referred to Himself as I Am in the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head4">k. Jah</h2>
<p>This word is an abbreviated form of <em>Jehovah;</em> it is first used in Exodus 15:2. In the book of Psalms, it is combined with <em>hallelu</em> to form the frequently used word <em>hallelujah,</em> meaning &ldquo;praise Jehovah.&rdquo; This name is also used in Isaiah. It is used forty-nine times in these three books.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Ten Lines in the Bible &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
