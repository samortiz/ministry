<p class="bold">WEEK 20 — DAY 2</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 27:34-35, 38-40, 42, 45-46, 48, 50</h2><p>34 &nbsp;They gave Him wine to drink, mingled with gall. And when He tasted it, He would not drink.</p><p>35 &nbsp;And when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments among themselves, casting lots.</p><p>38 &nbsp;At that time two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.</p><p>39 &nbsp;And those who were passing by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying,</p> <p>40 &nbsp;You who destroy the temple and build it up in three days, save Yourself! <sup>1</sup>If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!</p><p>42 &nbsp;He saved others; Himself He <sup>1</sup>cannot save!…</p><p class="bold">45 &nbsp;Now from the sixth hour darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour.</p> <p class="bold">46 &nbsp;And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, My God, <sup>1</sup>why have You forsaken Me?</p><p>48 &nbsp;And immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge, he soaked it with <sup>1</sup>vinegar and put it on a reed, and gave it to Him to drink.</p><p class="bold">50 &nbsp;And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and <sup>1</sup>yielded up His spirit.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Verses 27 through 32 show how the Lord Jesus was mocked by the heathen soldiers.…The Lord here, as the Passover Lamb to be sacrificed for our sins, was brought [v. 31] like a lamb to the slaughter, fulfilling Isaiah 53:7-8. [Following this, Matthew 27:33-44 reveals] how the Lord was mocked by men and killed.…Verse 34 says, “They gave Him wine to drink, mingled with gall. And when He tasted it, He would not drink.” The wine mingled with gall (and also with myrrh—Mark 15:23) was used as a stupefying drink. But the Lord would not be stupefied; He would drink the bitter cup to the dregs. [Furthermore], verse 35 says, “And when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments among themselves, casting lots.” The Lord was robbed to the uttermost by sinners, fulfilling Psalm 22:18. This too exposed the darkness of Roman politics.</p><p>Although the Jewish leaders rejected the Lord Jesus as their King, it was sovereign of God that they set up above His head as a charge “THE KING OF THE JEWS” (v. 37).</p><p>Verse 38 says, “At that time two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.” This was for the fulfillment of Isaiah 53:9a.</p><p>[By the time of Matthew 27:45, unrighteous men had exhausted their deeds. They had done everything they could. At that time, God came in, in a righteous way to judge this crucified Savior and to forsake Him.] This verse says, “Now from the sixth hour darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour.” The sixth hour was 12:00 noon, and the ninth was 3:00 p.m. The Lord was crucified from the third hour, 9:00 a.m. (Mark 15:25), until the ninth hour, 3:00 p.m. He suffered on the cross for six hours. In the first three hours He was persecuted by men for doing God’s will; in the last three hours He was judged by God to accomplish our redemption. It was during this time that God counted Him as our Substitute who suffered for our sin (Isa. 53:10). Darkness fell over all the land (Matt. 27:45) because our sin and sins and all negative things were being dealt with there; and because of our sin God forsook Him (v. 46). (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 808-811)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>40<sup>1</sup> This was a repetition of the devil’s temptation in the wilderness (4:6).</p><p>42<sup>1</sup> If He had saved Himself, He could not save us.</p><p>46<sup>1</sup> God forsook Christ on the cross because He took the place of sinners (1 Pet. 3:18)—He bore our sins (1 Pet. 2:24; Isa. 53:6) and was made sin for us (2 Cor. 5:21).</p><p>48<sup>1</sup> Offered to the Lord in a mocking way (Luke 23:36) for quenching His thirst (John 19:28-30 and note 30<sup>1</sup>).</p><p>50<sup>1</sup> This was His giving up of His spirit (John 19:30); it indicates that the Lord voluntarily yielded up His life (Mark 15:37; Luke 23:46).</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 808-812; Hymns: #94</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
