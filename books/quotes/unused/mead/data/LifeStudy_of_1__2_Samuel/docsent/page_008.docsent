   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ordained by God for His Eternal Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the midst of the chaos of the degraded Israel, Elkanah and Hannah remained in the line of life ordained by God for His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The line of life is a line to bring forth Christ for the enjoyment of God's people that on earth God may have His kingdom, which is the Body of Christ, the very organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Elkanah and Hannah remained in this line of life not merely for God's eternal salvation but for His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's salvation is mainly for our benefit, whereas God's purpose is related to the fulfilling of God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to ask ourselves whether we are here for our profit or for God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today on this earth everyone is concerned for his own profit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even the majority of Christians do not care for God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I can testify of Brother Watchman Nee that he was a man altogether for God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I would like to follow his pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Lord's recovery, we are for God's purpose, remaining in the line of life ordained by God for His eternal purpose, which is to gain the Body, the organism of the Triune God, that He may have a full expression in a corporate way.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Cooperation with the Move of God on Earth</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>for the Accomplishment of God's Economy</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This couple was in cooperation with the move of God on earth for the accomplishment of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Elkanah and Hannah were not the only ones moving; they were moved by the moving One, by the unique, divine Mover, who was moving secretly behind the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Under God's sovereign dealing, Hannah was suppressed in her soul with a burden in her spirit to pour out before Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because of God's moving in her, Hannah could not have peace until she prayed for a son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God, the sovereign One, kept moving her and motivating her so that she had to pray, even though Eli, the one taking care of the service in God's house, did not understand her.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In her prayer Hannah cooperated with the move of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God could motivate Hannah as a person who was one with Him in the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as He can gain such a person, He has a way on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I hope that at least some of us will be today's Hannahs and say, "Lord, if You have anything on Your heart to accomplish for Your purpose, I am here.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am remaining in the line of life for the carrying out of Your economy."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you do this, I have the full assurance that you will be the ones whom God will move.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He will come to you and motivate you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God needs many Hannahs, persons who can bring forth some Samuels to turn the age.</S>
