[1]  Taking Christ as Our Person for the Church Life CONTENTS
[2]  Experiencing the Power of Christ and the Person of Christ
[3]  AND THE PERSON OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:17-23; 3:16-21; 2:15-16, 18 THE TWO PRAYERS OF PAUL
[4]  Just as the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is a mystery and just as the person of the Lord Jesus the One who is both God and man is a mystery, the church is also a mystery.
[5]  The prayer in chapter 1 is related to our need for revelation in order that we might see the church as the Body of Christ, whereas the prayer in chapter 3 is related to our need for experience.
[6]  Recently, however, the Lord has shown me something more, something deeper, related to these prayers, namely that Paul s first prayer is related to the power of Christ and that his second prayer is related to the person of Christ.
[7]  We need our spirit as an organ to experience the Lord s power, and we need our spirit as our inner man in order to experience the Lord as our person.
[8]  Hallelujah! everything will be subdued, and we will enjoy the subduing power of Christ v. 22 . Then if we call O Lord! Amen! Hallelujah! we will live in the spirit all the more, experience His ruling power, and reign in our spirit v. 22 . We will be able to say, O Lord, I am seated with You on the throne.
[9]  Even though we can enter into the church when we touch our spirit according to Ephesians 1, we can have the church life only when we live according to the person of Christ in our inner man according to chapter 3.
[10]  In chapter 3 our spirit is not only an organ but also our inner man v. 16 . Before we were saved, our person was centered in our soul because our life was in the soul.
[11]  On the day of our salvation, the Lord Jesus entered into our being as His home, but since then, we have often confined Him to a small corner because we have given Him no consideration in any of our decisions.
[12]  He is the breadth, length, height, and depth, who alone can fill us unto all the fullness of God v. 19 . When we take Christ as our person, we are not only brought into the church, but we will also live in the church and have the church life.
[13]  IN EPHESIANS 1 Scripture Reading: Eph 1:17-23 TWO PROFOUND PRAYERS OF PAUL FOR THE CHURCH
[14]  Today the church is equated with organized Christianity, but organized Christianity does not reflect the Lord s desire.
[15]  This does not mean that we should recite his prayer in a rote manner; rather, we need to touch our spirit and pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him v. 17 . Most people think that a spirit of wisdom and revelation refers to the Spirit of the Lord.
[16]  When we call, we will turn from our mind to our spirit, and when we are in spirit, we will be clear concerning the way of the church and the practical expression of the church.
[17]  We need a spirit of wisdom and revelation, and we also need the eyes of our heart to be enlightened v. 18 . Once the light of God shines in us, we will be enlightened to know three things.
[18]  First, we will know the hope of God s calling.
[19]  In Ephesians 1 Paul prayed that the Father would give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation v. 17 . If we are fresh and strong in our spirit, we will be enlightened and receive revelation.
[20]  When we have a spirit of wisdom and revelation, we will also know the great power that can operate in us, which is the same power that God caused to operate in Christ.
[21]  This great power also subjected all things under Christ s feet v. 22 . Lastly, this great power operated in Christ to make Him Head over all things to the church v. 22 . This fourfold power which operated in Christ is available to us today as resurrecting, transcending, subduing, and ruling power.
[22]  It is one thing to enter into the church, but it is another thing to have the living of the church.
[23]  Knowing the church enables us to enter into the church, but we need to advance to living the church life.
[24]  In Paul s first prayer we see our need for a spirit of wisdom and revelation in order to enter into the church and to know the church 1:17 .
[25]  In Ephesians 1 Paul prays that we would experience the power of Christ, and in chapter 3 he prays that we would experience the person of Christ.
[26]  When she enjoyed the Lord s resurrection power, she was full of joy and testified in the meetings, but when she puts the Lord aside, she is outside of the church experientially and cannot live the church life.
[27]  Only when we experience the Lord as our person will we live the church life.
[28]  If we would take Christ as our person, we must see that our spirit is not merely an organ for us to contact God; we must see that our spirit is our person.
[29]  In chapter 1 our spirit is an organ for us to experience the power of Christ; in chapter 3 our spirit is our inner man for us to take Christ as our person.
[30]  We should not only experience the power of Christ so that we may know the church and enter into the church; we should also experience the person of Christ so that we may have the church life for God to be glorified in the church.
[31]  It shows that the church is not only the Body of Christ but also the one new man.
[32]  The church must not experience merely the power of Christ and the life of Christ but also the person of Christ.
[33]  The presence of so many opinions in the church proves that we have not taken Christ as our person so that we can be a proper bride for Him.
[34]  However, if out of love we would reject our person and take Him as our person, we would not only follow the Lord but inquire of Him.
[35]  The Spirit of the Lord in our spirit will spread to our mind and become the spirit of the mind v. 23 . In this renewed spirit of the mind we will put off our former manner of living and put on the life of the new man, the church.
[36]  CHAPTER FIVE THE TRIUNE GOD IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN Scripture Reading: John 14:7-11, 16-20; 16:13-15; 17:21-23 THE MYSTERY OF THE TRIUNE GOD
[37]  Concerning the Son as the expression 1:18 , we need to see the following sixteen points:
[38]  Concerning the Spirit as the realization of God John 14:17 , we need to see the following eight points:
[39]  In chapter 17 the Lord prayed to the Father, saying, That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us...that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one vv.
[40]  As the Word, God became flesh and manifested grace and reality on the earth in the Son v. 14 . Eventually, the Son, who was both God and man, died on the cross, releasing the divine life, and as the last Adam in resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit to enter into us 20:22 . The Triune God enters into us as a person.
[41]  On the evening when the Lord was about to be crucified, He said to His disciples, I am going to the Father...And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality...because He abides with you and shall be in you...I am coming to you 14:12, 16-18 .
[42]  When we keep His commandments, we are keeping His words, and He will manifest Himself to us v. 21 ; not only so, both He and the Father will come to make an abode with us v. 23 . When we have a normal experience of His words, we will have His manifestation, and He and the Father will come to make an abode with us.
[43]  If we allow the Lord s word to operate in us, His word will cleanse us, and if we abide in Him, His words will abide in us v. 7 . This is wonderful.
[44]  First, we abide in Him, and He abides in us v. 4 . Then we abide in Him, and His words abide in us v. 7 . As a result of this abiding, we will bear much fruit in which the Father is glorified v. 8 . If the Lord s words can gain ground in us, we will enjoy His rich life, which will bear fruit.
[45]  We know that the Lord is the Spirit in our spirit, and we can enjoy Him by calling on His name.
[46]  The Lord said, If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.
[47]  Although the Holy Spirit is already in us, when we receive a word from the Lord and keep that word, we have a deep sense of the Holy Spirit coming to us as another Comforter, because of the freshness of His taste.
[48]  Occasionally, we turn away out of our love for the Lord, but often we bargain with the Lord, saying, Lord, forgive me.
[49]  Yes, we still have the Holy Spirit in us, but our touch with the Lord is gone, and we even feel shameful before the Lord.
[50]  On the other hand, if we call, O Lord! when the Lord says, Go home, and say Amen, we will sense the Holy Spirit within us as another Comforter.
[51]  If we arrive at a department store and the Lord says, Go home, do you think that the Lord will manifest Himself to us if we do not listen to His word?
[52]  In this reality the Father is the source, the Lord is the expression, and the Spirit is the realization.
[53]  The shortest route to the growth in life is simply to take Christ as our person.
[54]  AND TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON Scripture Reading: Eph 2:15-16, 18; 3:16-19; 4:22-24 THE POWER OF CHRIST AND THE PERSON OF CHRIST
[55]  In chapter 1 the apostle s prayer is related to the initiation of the church, and in chapter 3, which is the kernel of chapters 2 through 6, the apostle s prayer is related to the living of the church.
[56]  For the initiation of the church in chapter 1, the organ of our human spirit needs wisdom and revelation, but for the living of the church in chapter 3, the person of our spirit, our inner man, needs to be strengthened.
[57]  Christians who pay attention to spirituality often speak of the church as the Body of Christ.
[58]  Even though this is a higher revelation, they do not see that the church is also the new man.
[59]  When the Lord was not able to get through to them, He had to ask, Where have you put him? v. 34 . When the Lord came to the tomb and asked for the stone to be taken away, Martha said, Lord, by now he smells v. 39 . This shows that it is not easy for us to take Christ as our person.
[60]  AND EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON Scripture Reading: Rom 14:6-9; 2 Cor 5:13-17; 6:8-10 GOD GIVING HIMSELF TO US
[61]  God s way of salvation is not according to our thought, and His desire in His salvation is beyond our natural comprehension.
[62]  Romans 14:6-9 says, He who regards that day, regards it to the Lord; and he who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who does not eat, does not eat to the Lord, and he gives thanks to God.
[63]  For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself; for whether we live, we live to the Lord, and whether we die, we die to the Lord.
[64]  Therefore whether we live or we die, we are the Lord s. For Christ died and lived again for this, that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.
[65]  Verse 8 says that we are the Lord s. In speaking of outward matters, Paul was very wise in his spirit.
[66]  If someone asks us why we do not eat a certain food, our answer should be that we do not eat it because the Lord is not eating it.
[67]  Romans 14 says that whether we live or we die, whether we eat or do not eat, and whether we regard a certain day or not, we belong to the Lord and should do everything to Him.
[68]  In Romans Paul uses the matters of eating and regarding a certain day as a test to see whether we have given ourselves to the Lord.
[69]  If we say that we have given ourselves to the Lord, can we be beside ourselves if that is what the Lord is doing?
[70]  When we give ourselves to the Lord and take Him as our person, old things pass away and all things will become new.
[71]  Old things are passing away and all things are becoming new in a person who has given himself to the Lord and who lets the Lord be the person in him.
[72]  If we have a sense that we are holding back a certain matter from the Lord, we should deal with it immediately, because it will become a problem in our spiritual journey if we do not deal with it.
[73]  THAT WE MAY GAIN ALL THINGS Scripture Reading: Phil 3:7-8, 12; 4:12 GOD DESIRING THAT WE GIVE OURSELVES TO HIM
[74]  In His salvation God gives Himself to us, but in order for us to enjoy Him, we must give ourselves to Him.
[75]  We do not need to give ourselves to Him because we are useful, but rather because we are not useful in ourselves, and we need to be reduced.
[76]  If we rely on the Lord only to do things for us, we will limit our experience of Him to knowing His power but not His person.
[77]  A married sister should take her husband as her person, but this often is difficult when the husband is not proper in every regard.
[78]  However, our Lord is a proper Husband in every matter.
[79]  As such, He is more than able to be a proper Husband to us, and we will not suffer any loss if we take Him as our person.
[80]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE LORD BEING A HARD MASTER Scripture Reading: Matt 25:14-15, 24-29; 1 Pet 4:10-11; Rom 12:1-2, 11
[81]  Before God, a Christian needs to pay attention to growth in life and usefulness in service.
[82]  When we live before the Lord, we love Him, pursue Him, follow Him, fellowship with Him, and await His return; in this respect we are all virgins.
[83]  The slave with one talent said that his master was a hard man.
[84]  In a certain sense the Lord is indeed hard.
[85]  When the Lord gives grace to people, He is broad and tolerant; however, in the Lord s arrangement for our service to Him, He is strict and without leniency.
[86]  Some saints may say, In the last two days the messages concerning taking Christ as our person were so good and so sweet; they touched us deeply.
[87]  If you can go home, please go, but even if I encourage you to go home, you will discover that you cannot leave, because you have been chosen by the Lord before the foundation of the world.
[88]  CHAPTER TWELVE SERVING ONES AND THE SERVICE Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1-2, 11; 1 John 5:16; John 15:4-5, 16a; 21:15-17
[89]  In the aspect of life, we are virgins, loving the Lord, fellowshipping with Him, living a chaste, pure life, taking our lamps, and going out of this dark age to meet Him as our Bridegroom.
[90]  After our body is presented, it is essential that our mind be renewed Rom 12:2 .
[91]  There are many different kinds of people in the church, and according to our nature, we all have some peculiarities.
[92]  Recently, we have had a heavy burden concerning how to take care of the many people whom we baptize each year.
[93]  We could ask the elders to take care of them, but there are only a dozen or so elders and more than ten thousand saints in Taipei.
[94]  OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: Luke 22:24-26; Matt 20:25-28; 23:8-12; 1 Pet 5:1-5; Rom 12:3-5 THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH
[95]  Furthermore, we should not have the thought that the elders, co-workers, or responsible ones are capable of doing everything.
[96]  In the Lord s service, the first lesson that we need to learn is to drop our opinions.
[97]  However, when we exercise to practice this, we will see that even in small matters related to the service, our opinions come forth, exposing the fact that Christ is not our person.
[98]  When we love one another in oneness, unbelievers will know that we are the Lord s disciples and that the Lord was sent by God John 13:35; 17:21-23 .
[99]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN SERVICE BEING IN THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Matt 18:15-20; Acts 5:11; 9:31; 12:5; 15:41; 20:28; Rev 1:11; 3:22
[100]  In the previous chapter we saw that Christians need to focus on two matters: life and service.
[101]  In this chapter we will see that life and service are related to the church.
[102]  The enjoyment of the Lord s life is for the church, and we can enjoy the Lord s bountiful life only in the church.
[103]  By His mercy, the Lord has led us to the ground of oneness; He is also leading us to live the church life in His life and by His Spirit in order to have the reality of the church.
[104]  Hence, when we speak of leaving the church, we are referring to leaving the ground of the church and losing the practical living of the church.
[105]  We dare not say that we have never made a mistake; however, by the Lord s mercy, we can absolutely say that the ground of the church on which the Lord has led us to stand is one thousand percent right.
[106]  Even if such a one were very spiritual and loved the Lord very much, the Lord said that the church should treat him as a Gentile and a tax collector simply because he has refused to hear the church.
[107]  We should never allow ourselves to come to a point that we feel we are right and the church is wrong, or that we feel we are more spiritual than the church and thus refuse to hear the church.
[108]  According to Acts 12:5, when Peter was in prison, prayer was being made fervently by the church to God concerning him.
[109]  However, if we have a problem with the church, we will limit the ability of the church to earnestly pray for us.
[110]  It is a strange thing that when a person leaves the ground of the church, regardless of what the Lord has done in the church and regardless of what happens in the church, he can only criticize and oppose.
[111]  Matthew 18:19 says, If two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens.
[112]  Two brothers can have great power when their standing related to the church is proper.
[113]  If, however, these two brothers have problems with the church, they will not be in harmony when they come together to pray, and even if they agree with one another, they will have no power because their standing related to the church is not proper.
[114]  In Acts 12 when Peter was imprisoned, prayer was being made fervently by the church to God for him v. 5 . When Peter was released from prison, however, he went to the home of Mary, in which there was a considerable number assembled together and praying v. 12 . It is not possible to say that those in Mary s house were the entire church.
[115]  Hence, when we go out to preach the gospel, we must not only believe that the Lord is with us and be filled with the Holy Spirit, but we must also have the assurance that comes from going in the strength of the church.
