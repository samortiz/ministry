The Gospel of Matthew says that after the Lord's resurrection, an angel told the women to tell His disciples of His resurrection
Three days before the resurrection Peter committed a great sin a sin that would cause the Lord not to confess him before the Fathers angels
Peter not only denied the Lord before men, he even denied the Lord before a maid who was despised by others at that time
If you know the Lords intention behind the words and Peter will you still turn away from Him instead of turning toward Him
Brothers and sisters, when you are at the Lord's table meeting remembering the Lord, are you still afraid of God in your heart?
Although Peter dared not come too close to the Lord, the Lord's heart attracted him and kept him from running away from Him
