   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Did you notice that all three of the Godhead are mentioned here?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you study these verses more carefully you will see something marvelous about the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These verses tell us that it was God the Father who planned in eternity past how everything would work together to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He chose and predestinated many people to be His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yet, to accomplish this required the work of the Son "in Whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus accomplished this by dying on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We know that His death was all-inclusive included everything : it crucified our sinful nature, crushed the Devil's head, and released God's divine life just as burying a grain of wheat releases the life within it .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hallelujah for the work of the Son!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Finally, we read that we "were sealed with the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This simply means that what the Father planned and the Son accomplished is applied to us by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Father is the planner, the Son is the accomplisher, and the Spirit is the applier.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the Triune God in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>GOD'S ECONOMY BEING THE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>OF HIS ESSENCE LIFE AND BEING INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not forget, though, that the Father, Son, and Spirit are essentially one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the Father planned, He was coinhering with the Son and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Son came to accomplish, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Son was in the Father and the Father was in Him; He was even called the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After His death and in His resurrection, the Son became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Spirit applies, He brings us both the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This Spirit is just the ultimate consummation of the Triune God applying to us all that the Triune God has planned and accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without this Spirit, man cannot enjoy the Father's selection or the Son's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit is the application.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are not a people who merely have the knowledge of God or some doctrine of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By this Spirit, we are able to enjoy all that the Father has planned and the Son has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now all that God is, all that Christ is, and what Christ has accomplished, obtained, and attained is made real to us by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That is why the Spirit is called the Spirit of reality John 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you now see why God must be triune?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is essentially one yet economically three in order that we can enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's economy is to dispense His entire being into us, yet if He were only one essentially but not three economically, He could not carry out His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then on the other hand if the Father, Son, and Spirit were three Gods but not one, we could receive only the Spirit, one of the Three.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We would miss all the riches of the Father and all the accomplishments of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But praise Him, He is three-one!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He as the Father has planned, He as the Son has accomplished, and He as the Spirit is now ready to apply the Triune God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we call "Lord Jesus," the all-inclusive Spirit comes into us bringing us the whole Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We get the Father, the Son, and the Spirit with all that He is and has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This Spirit is the all-inclusive package.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>QUESTIONS What is God's economy?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What are the distinct functions of the Father, Son, and Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What does it mean when we say the Father, Son, and Spirit are "essentially" one?</S>
