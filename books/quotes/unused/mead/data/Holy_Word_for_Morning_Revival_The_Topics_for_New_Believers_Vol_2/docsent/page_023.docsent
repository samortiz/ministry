   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 1:12-13 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rom 8:17 And if children, heirs also; on the one hand, heirs of God; on the other, joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In John 1:12-13 we see that the children of God have been born of God, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Blood here signifies the physical life; will of the flesh denotes the will of fallen man after man became flesh; and will of man refers to the will of man created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we became children of God, we were not born of our physical life, our fallen life, or our created life we were born of God, the uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For human beings to become children of God is for them to be born of God to have the divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The believers become children of God through their receiving of the Son of God by believing into His name.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>122 As God s children, who have God s life and nature, we can be like God, live God, and express God, thus fulfilling the purpose of God s creation of man.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Sons of God</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, the believers are children of God, and then they gradually grow up to become sons of God....</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans 8:14 says, As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that we may know that we are sons of God by the fact that we are led by the Spirit....</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By the Spirit we have the divine birth and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through the Spirit we grow unto maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because of the Spirit we have the position, right, and privilege of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>124 In Romans 8:16 children refers to the initial stage of sonship, the stage of regeneration in the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whereas, in Romans 8:14 sons are the children of God who are in the stage of the transformation of their souls.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They not only have been regenerated in their spirit and are growing in the divine life, but they also are living and walking by being led by the Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It indicates that there is a condition involved in being an heir.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not say that simply because we are children we are heirs.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is too hasty....The condition for being heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ is that we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may not like suffering, but we need it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Remember that suffering is the incarnation of grace.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This Triune God is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ Col 2:9 , who is the portion allotted to the saints as their inheritance 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Holy Spirit is the pledge, the guarantee, of this divine inheritance, which we are sharing and enjoying today as a foretaste and will share and enjoy in full in the coming age and for eternity 1 Pet 1:4 .</S>
