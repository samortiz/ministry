<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>One God as the Father of All, Who Is<br>over All as the Father, through All as the Son,<br>and in All as the Spirit, Dispensing<br>the Fullness of His Divine Trinity<br>to All the Members of the Body</H2><P>Ultimately, in Ephesians 4:6 there is "one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all." God the Father is in three situations: He is over all, through all, and in all. "Over all" indicates that He is the overshadowing One, covering us and taking care of us all the time. "Through all" means that He knows our situation intimately because He has passed through all of the things regarding us. If you are a manager of a company, you must go through all of the offices and rooms of your company in order to know what is going on. "In all" means that He stays within us. Thus, the Triune God is in three situations. "Over all" refers to the Father, "through all" refers to the Son, and "in all" refers to the Spirit. The Father functions as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Eventually, this One is the Triune God. The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow. These Three are one in reaching us.</P><P>The divine dispensing comes out of the Three of the Divine Trinity&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The divine dispensing taking place within us is the operating of the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, as the aggregate, totality, and consummation of the Triune God. This Spirit is moving in us, anointing us, watering us, feeding us, satisfying us, strengthening us, comforting us, saturating us, and permeating us. There are so many words to describe His dispensing within us. All of the foregoing items, such as watering, feeding, strengthening, permeating, saturating, and anointing, are matters of dispensing. Every day we should be built up by receiving the divine dispensing within us.</P><P>We should not expect to have a spectacular time each day in receiving the divine dispensing. I recently spoke a word to the trainees in the full-time training concerning their daily spiritual life. I told them not to expect to have a spectacular result in their Christian life. We should forget about having something spectacular. We must learn to be satisfied with ordinary days which are filled with regular and normal practices in the divine dispensing. In the morning we should have some time with the Lord to touch Him and be revived by Him. Then we need to pass through a daily routine to get ready for work. To live a life in the divine dispensing in a normal way will make us healthy both physically and spiritually. Whether or not we have good or bad days is not up to us; it is up to His sovereignty. He has already chosen us, and it is too late to turn back. We are blessed because the processed and consummated Triune God is within us. He is in us, not in a spectacular way but in a very ordinary way.</P><P>We should be blessed to be satisfied with ordinary days in the divine dispensing. The Triune God is certainly in us, but His being in us is not spectacular. Every day He is within us dispensing and positively strengthening and encouraging us. In the last three years, I have experienced many troubles, yet nothing has disturbed me. I have published more messages, I have visited more places, and I have held more conferences. However, this is not because I have had spectacular days. I have just lived an ordinary life of receiving His dispensing. The Epistles reveal that the work of Christ within us is a fine work of dispensing. I cannot tell you how much the fine dispensing has been going on within me during these last three years. Our destiny is to live an ordinary life in the divine dispensing. Our Father God has destined that we live in an ordinary way under His continual dispensing.</P>
