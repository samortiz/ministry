<h2 class="head1">TRUTH SETTING US FREE</h2><p>Do we not have the truth already? Yes, but a question immediately arises. Why is there a vast difference in what we are before the Lord and what we are in the world? The work of the cross is finished, but we are still not victorious. The Lord Jesus has changed us into one kind of person, yet on earth we still appear as another kind of person. This means that our condition does not match the truth that we hold onto before God. This is our problem. We often do not know what the truth is. We come to God according to our own feelings and experiences rather than according to God's truth. We must realize that God's truth is contrary to our feelings and experiences. The one issue we have to resolve is which of the two is real. Is the Lord's accomplishment for us before God more real, or are our own feelings and experiences more real? Which of the two is more real? This is the question.</p><p>We are often bound because we do not see what is real, what is reality. Once we see the truth, the truth sets us free; it liberates us. Let us mention a few things to illustrate what it means for the truth to set us free.</p><p>We will begin with salvation. Suppose someone hears the gospel and realizes that the Lord Jesus has died on the cross and shed His blood to forgive his sins. He believes in the Son of God for the forgiveness of his sins, and he receives the Lord into him. When others ask whether he belongs to the Lord, he says, "Yes." He is bursting with joy within. However, three or five months later, he may feel a little sick, and troubles and difficulties may arise in his family. Then his joy is gone; it seems as if joy has departed far from him. He feels as if he is no longer saved and is no longer a child of God. If others ask him whether he is a Christian and whether he is saved, he may answer, "I am quite bothered. I have lost my former joy. I do not know where the Lord Jesus is anymore. I do not know what to say about this." What would you say to him at this time? If you know God's truth, you would tell him, "You may feel that you are not saved, but in fact you are saved. In reality you are saved."</p><p>From what side are you looking at the matter? If you look at it from his side, you may feel that he is not yet saved. But if you look at it from the side of the Lord's work, you will say, "Brother, there is no change; you are still saved. You are saved when you feel hot, and you are still saved when you feel cold. Your feeling may change, but the work the Lord has accomplished for you and what God has given you will never change. You have to look at it from His end." The Lord says, "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free." When a man's eyes are opened to see that he has obtained reality and truth before God through the work of the Lord, he will be free and he will be liberated. We must remember that we are not freed according to our feeling. Only one thing frees us: the reality which is before God.</p><p>There was a brother who had definitely repented to the Lord and was a regenerated believer. After awhile, however, his inward feelings became different; he felt quite grievous, and he thought that he would surely perish. Another brother came along and said to him, "How do you know that you are going to perish?" He said, "I am not the same as before. I feel cold within. Neither my prayer nor my reading of the Bible is doing me any good." The other brother said, "That is the condition on your side, but let us consider a few questions from God's side. Has the work of the Lord Jesus been discounted?" "No." "Has the Lord's work changed from what it was before?" "No." "Has His work been annulled before God as if the new covenant were dissolved?" "No." "All right, we are sure that there is no change on His side. Therefore, according to truth and according to reality, you have not become unsaved before God. What has changed is your own feeling. You may feel that you are saved, and you may feel that you are not saved, but when God says that you are saved, will He change? You have to remember that salvation is a question of truth; it is not a question of feeling." When he heard this, he responded with tears, "It does not matter how confident I am; whatever I say or feel means nothing. If God says that I am saved, then I am saved." This is the truth setting us free. Spiritual reality liberates a man from his own feelings; it frees him.</p><p>Let us go one step further to see how the truth sets us free. God's Word shows us that when the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He bore our sins, regenerated us, and saved us. God's Word also shows us that when the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He put us into the Lord Jesus, and our old man was crucified with Him. The Lord's death was not the death of an individual; it was a corporate death. When He died on the cross, we died in Him also. Through His accomplishment, we became dead. This is truth, and this is reality.</p><p>However, before we see this truth, we are bound. When we look at ourselves, we still find our temper. When we touch our feelings, we still find our weaknesses. All the undesirable things we have from head to toe are still with us. The question now is: Are our experiences and feelings more real, or is the Lord's work more real? Many people are weeping as if nothing is more real than their bondage. But God's Word shows us that only one thing is real, that is, the accomplishments of His Son Jesus. Our old man is crucified with the Lord. This is truth. If we do not see this truth, we will become a slave to our temper and will be bound by our experience and feelings. What can set us free? Only the truth can set us free. Only reality can set us free. If we live by our feelings and experiences, we will fail again and again. But if we see the fact of our crucifixion with the Lord, we will be set free.</p><p>Let us consider another matter: the victory of the Lord Jesus. There was a brother who was under Satan's attacks for a few months in body and in mind. He tried all he could to pray and resist them. He even exhausted himself in prayer and resistance. Yet for three months straight, despite his resistance and prayer, he was still under the attack. One night he prayed to the Lord, "I cannot resist any longer. My power of resistance is exhausted. I cannot pray anymore, my strength to pray is gone. Lord, show me where the root of the problem lies." God opened his eyes and gave him a word. He had heard that word before, but when he had heard it previously, it was like seeing men as trees. Now he became clear. The word was: "Is Satan worth such resistance from us?" He had never before thought that one could be wrong for resisting Satan. On that day, he saw the reality. What is the reality? The reality is that the Lord Jesus has overcome. When we are joined to Him, we also overcome. It is not that the Lord Jesus is about to overcome, and we cheer Him on. The truth is that He has overcome. It is not that Satan will be defeated, and we pray for the Lord to defeat him. Thank and praise the Lord that Satan is already defeated. It is done; it is not something to be done. Once that brother saw this truth, the attacks stopped. Everything became quiet, and all the problems were over. This is the reality setting men free. This is the truth setting us free.</p>
