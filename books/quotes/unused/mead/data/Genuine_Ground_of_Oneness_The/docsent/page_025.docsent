   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD'S MOST THOROUGH DEALING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we go to the place of God's choice, we experience the Lord's most thorough dealing with us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are forced to be one with our brothers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sometimes we may not desire to see a certain brother.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although we may attend the meetings of the church, we may try our best to avoid him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we seek to avoid the presence of a certain brother, we shall not be able to enjoy the top portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to be thoroughly subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should pray, "Lord, have mercy on me so that I may be right with my brother.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I want to have no problem with him and to enjoy being in his presence."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This illustrates the fact that when we come to the place of God's choice, we are dealt with by Him to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose one Israelite had a problem with another and as a result did everything possible to avoid him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, three times a year all the Israelite males were required to go up to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who refused were to be cut off from the fellowship of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, any problem between the Israelites had to be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Otherwise, there would have been no way for them to come together in oneness on Mount Zion to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As they ascended Mount Zion, the Israelites had to chant the words of Psalm 133: "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in oneness" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the unique place of God's choice preserved the oneness of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As long as the children of Israel followed God's choice, they had no alternative except to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The situation is altogether different among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If one believer is not happy with another, he can simply go to a different place of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Most Christians regard themselves as free to choose a place to satisfy their own appetites.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this reason, among most Christians there is no subduing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if we do not abuse God's grace but are fully subdued by coming to the place of His choice, the oneness will be preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No matter what kind of disposition we may have, we need to be subdued by coming to the place of God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Otherwise, we shall be cut off from the fellowship of the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are subdued in this way, we shall be preserved in the proper oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE PLACE WHERE THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>HAS PUT HIS NAME</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we come to the matter of how to discern the place of God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first principle is that the place chosen by God must not have any name other than the name of God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Any place that has a name other than the name of Christ is not the place chosen by God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Deuteronomy 12 God charged the people to destroy all the places with all the names.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No name was allowed to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, the unique place of God's choice was the place where the Lord put His own name.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, the place to which we are to go is the unique place where the Lord has put His name.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For this reason, as we meet together in the church, we meet only in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Matthew 18 the Lord Jesus speaks of us being gathered together into His name.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever we come together, we must come into His name.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not adopt such denominational names as Methodist, Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Lutheran, or Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All those names must be destroyed.</S>
