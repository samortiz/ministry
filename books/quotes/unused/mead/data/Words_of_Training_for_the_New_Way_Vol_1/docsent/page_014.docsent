   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE WORD OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 6:63; 20:22 EIGHT IMPORTANT TERMS IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First let us read a few verses from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are two important terms in this verse: the Word and God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 14 says, The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse adds three more important terms: flesh, grace, and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Chapter six, verse 63, says, The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This verse also adds two important terms: spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Chapter twenty, verse 22, says, And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this verse there are also two important terms: breath and Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From these four verses in the Gospel of John, we have noted eight important terms: the Word, God, flesh, grace, reality, spirit, life, and breath.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You need to memorize these eight terms.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By remembering these eight important words, you will see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These eight items can be divided into three groups: spirit, life, and breath are one group; the Word, God, and flesh are another group; and grace and reality are a third group.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This morning I am giving these eight terms to you who are attending the training.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the training is over, when you go out to preach the gospel, you may preach eight messages consecutively with one message on each term.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You need to tell people what is the Word, what is God, and what is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It may seem that these three items the Word, God, and flesh are very concrete; yet they became the abstract Spirit, life, and breath.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The issue is grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a person has the first six of these items, it is guaranteed that he will have the last two items of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the universe, what could be better than grace?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Neither could there be anything in the universe better than reality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You should enjoy grace and reality every day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How did grace and reality come?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The source of grace and reality is the Word, God, flesh, spirit, life, and breath.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we call O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>O Lord Jesus! that is our spiritual breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the reason we practice calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This calling is the best spiritual breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can either breathe deeply or in a shallow way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we call O Lord Jesus! there is fresh spiritual air coming into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this calling we are breathing, and we are resting as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How sweet and how fresh it is!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moreover, the result is spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Gospel of John is a profound book.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the letters, this book is very simple, but according to the philosophy it contains, it is the most profound.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God...And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These words are very simple, so that even little children can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the philosophy they contain is very profound, beyond description.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you have received something of the Lord s grace, you may be able to understand a little.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even so, you may have no way to utter what you have received, and you may not be able to utter it thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life, and, I am the light of the world, and again, I am the way John 11:25; 8:12; 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These expressions could not be more simple, yet what He was talking about in those instances is so profound that no one is able to understand fully.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, you do not need to try to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You only need to say unceasingly, The Lord is life, the Lord is resurrection, and the Lord is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then you will receive something within.</S>
