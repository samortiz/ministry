   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S POWER BEING MANIFESTED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN MAN'S WEAKNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The apostle said that he had a thorn in his flesh 2 Cor 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I do not know what this thorn was, but I know this thorn made Paul weak.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He prayed to the Lord about the matter three times, hoping the Lord would remove the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the Lord said to him, "My grace is sufficient for you" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord said even though the thorn in his flesh made Paul weak, His power was perfected in this weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How is the Lord's power perfected in human weakness?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He said, "My power will tabernacle over your weakness," which means "My power will overshadow or cover your weakness."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christianity does not eliminate weaknesses, nor does it only look to the Lord's power.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christianity means that the Lord's power is manifested in man's weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christianity does not mean that a new race of strange angels is created on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christianity means that man's weaknesses can manifest God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let me give an example.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once I had a very serious illness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I was x-rayed three times in two months, and each time the report was very grave.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I prayed, I believed, and I hoped that God would cure my illness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At times my strength was greater than normal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before God, I confessed that I had been empowered, but I was angry because I did not know the reason God was treating me this way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At certain times I would be well and full of strength, but I would relapse without warning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What was the use of God giving me this temporary strength?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I was very sick at heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One day as I was reading the Bible, I came across 2 Corinthians 12.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul prayed to God three times about that thorn, but the Lord was not willing to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, He said, "My grace is sufficient for you."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord increased His grace because of the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord increased His power because of the weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I saw what Christianity was.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As I lay in bed, I asked the Lord to show me more clearly what this was all about.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Inwardly, I had the impression of a boat in a river.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The boat required ten feet of water for navigation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the river, however, a submerged rock rose five feet from the bottom of the river.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the Lord so desired, He could remove the boulder to let the boat pass, but within there was a question: "Would it be better for Me to remove the rock or to increase the water level by five feet?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God asked me if it would be better to remove the boulder or to increase the water level by five feet.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I told the Lord that it would be better to increase the water level by five feet.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From that day onward many of my difficulties were gone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I dare not say that I was never tempted again, but praise God, from that matter I discovered God has other ways to meet our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I repeat, Christianity does not remove the boulder; it increases the water level by five feet.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Are there difficulties?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yes, we all have difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Are there trials?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yes, we all are tried.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Are there weaknesses?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yes, we all have weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please remember one thing, however, that the Lord does not eliminate our weaknesses on the negative side nor give us unwarranted power on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God's power is manifested in weakness, just as our treasure is in earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE PARADOXICAL SPIRITUAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today I would like to say that no Christian has an earthen vessel that is earthy enough to prohibit the Lord's treasure from being manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No matter how weak we are, remember that the Lord's treasure is manifested in it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, we see a spiritual paradox in Paul and in us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do we know what people said about Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They said that his speech was contemptible 10:10b , that he took them by guile 12:16 , and that he was fickle and said "Yes, yes" and "No, no" 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They said his letters were weighty and strong enough to terrify people 10:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But paradoxically, God's treasure looks very good in such an earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God's treasure would not look so nice without the earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am saying that Paul was a genuine man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thank God that the Lord shined out, or broke out, from within him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He was not a man without feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But in his sorrow, he said, "I always rejoice."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was not rejoicing constantly or in sorrow constantly; rather, he constantly rejoiced in his sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Let me tell you that this is the special characteristic of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is a smile while tears are flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many Christians act better than Paul, but they do not live like a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They only can praise the Lord; they are not like a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many Christians think they can attain a state of never being sorrowful or troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There are others who are continually sorrowful and troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This means that the treasure has not been expressed in them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But here we have a man through whom the Lord Jesus could pass.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I have seen some of the Lord's most outstanding children.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When I saw them, I immediately knew who they were and what kind of persons they were.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But at the same time I knew what kind of persons they were before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today we do not want to see any trace of the earthen vessel when we look at people.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Sometimes, however, our eyes only see the earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Those who know God, however, are able to see the treasure in earthen vessels when they look at God's children.</S>
