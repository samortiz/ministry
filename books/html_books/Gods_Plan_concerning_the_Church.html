<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of messages and fellowship given by Brother Witness Lee. Chapters 1 through 3 are messages given at an unknown time and place. Chapters 4 and 5 contain key points of fellowship with different groups of people not meeting on the ground of the church. This fellowship was given in Taipei in April 1957. Portions of this fellowship are in chapter 2 of <em>The Ground of the Church and the Service of the Body.</em> These chapters were originally published in 1957 in <em>The Ministry of the Word.</em></p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>We will consider God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church from Ephesians 1 and 3. Verse 9 of chapter 3 says, &ldquo;To enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things.&rdquo; This verse says that a mystery was hidden in God, who created all things. Therefore, this mystery depends on God and is related to all things. In Greek <em>throughout the ages</em> can also be rendered &ldquo;from eternity.&rdquo; Hence, this mystery has been hidden in God from eternity. The word <em>economy</em> means &ldquo;management,&rdquo; &ldquo;administration,&rdquo; and &ldquo;arrangement.&rdquo; The mystery in verse 9 is managed by God and has been arranged by God.</p>
<p>Verse 10 says, &ldquo;In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church.&rdquo; This indicates that the economy of God&rsquo;s mystery is to have a church to express His wisdom. In the Bible wisdom includes everything related to God. God has arranged for the church to be the expression of His wisdom, that is, the expression of everything related to Him.</p>
<p>This expression is seen and made known to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies. Several verses in Ephesians are related to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies. Verse 21 of chapter 1 says, &ldquo;All rule and authority and power and lordship&rdquo;; verse 2 of chapter 2 says, &ldquo;The ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit which is now operating in the sons of disobedience&rdquo;; and verse 12 of chapter 6 says, &ldquo;Our wrestling is not against blood and flesh but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies.&rdquo; These verses reveal that the rulers and authorities are Satan and the angels under him. Therefore, the economy of God&rsquo;s mystery is to express His wisdom, which is everything related to Him, through the church so that the rebellious angels may be put to shame.</p>
<p>The economy of God&rsquo;s mystery, His arrangement, concerning the church is according to the plan that He made in Christ. Hence, 3:11 says, &ldquo;According to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; <em>Purpose</em> can also be rendered &ldquo;plan.&rdquo; This plan is eternal; hence, it is called the eternal purpose, or the eternal plan.</p>
<p>Verses 4 and 5 of chapter 1 say, &ldquo;He chose us in Him [Christ] before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love, predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.&rdquo; These verses reveal that God chose and predestinated us to be holy unto sonship, to be His sons.</p>
<p>According to verses 8 through 11, He caused grace to &ldquo;abound to us in all wisdom and prudence, making known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself, unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him; in whom also we were designated as an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One who works all things according to the counsel of His will.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>economy</em> in verse 10 is the same word used in 3:9 and means &ldquo;management,&rdquo; &ldquo;administration,&rdquo; and &ldquo;arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The above verses from chapters 1 and 3 reveal that the church was planned by God in eternity. The church is not an accident, nor did God improvise to have the church. The church was planned by God in eternity long before the foundation of the world. Most people have a natural concept concerning the church; they lack revelation. They think that the church is the gathering of a group of fallen and redeemed sinners to worship and serve God. This human concept is altogether according to time; it is not from eternity. Regardless of whether we are fallen or sinful, God in eternity past planned to have the church. Everything related to the church is out of God&rsquo;s eternal plan and is the issue of His arrangement.</p>
<p>Careful and enlightened readers of the Bible see that God&rsquo;s central purpose in creating the universe was to gain the church. Therefore, the church is the center of the universe and the goal of all things. If not for gaining the church, God would not have needed to create the universe and all things. The universe and all things were created for the church. God&rsquo;s plan, His desire, is to gain the church.</p>
<p>At the end of the Bible God&rsquo;s work will be completed. The ultimate manifestation of God&rsquo;s work takes the New Jerusalem as its center, the new creation as its means, and the new heaven and new earth as its realm (Rev. 21&mdash;22). The New Jerusalem is the ultimate and fullest manifestation of the church. Therefore, God created the universe and all things in order to gain the church. This is the purpose that God planned in eternity. We will now consider several points related to God&rsquo;s plan.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1 and 3 reveal that God has an economy in His plan concerning the church. His economy is a kind of management, administration, and arrangement. The Greek word for <em>economy</em> in these chapters has the same meaning as <em>economy</em> in economics. Before God created all things, He had a plan in Himself to manage something for Himself. This management requires an administration and an arrangement. If we read the Bible carefully, we will touch this thought of God.</p>
<p>Verse 2 of chapter 3 speaks of the stewardship of the grace of God. The Greek word for <em>stewardship</em> is the same word for <em>economy.</em> Hence, the stewardship of the grace God can also be rendered as &ldquo;the economy of the grace of God,&rdquo; &ldquo;the economics of the grace of God,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the administration of the grace of God.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s economy concerning the church involves His management of grace, that is, His economics of grace. God wants to manage His church in His grace.</p>
<p>We must pay attention to three points concerning the economy of God. The first point is related to the resources of the economy. An economy is managed with resources and uses all its available resources. What resources does God manage in His economy? In eternity God planned to have the church in Himself. Therefore, God in His plan manages His economy with Himself as the resources. He is the resources and the material for the producing of the church.</p>
<p>Verse 19 says that the church is &ldquo;filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; Colossians 2:9-10 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and you have been made full in Him.&rdquo; All the fullness of the Godhead is in Christ and is gained by us in Christ. Eventually, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God. This means that God provides Himself as the resources for managing His economy to produce the church. God is using all His fullness, which is Himself, as the resources for His management of His economy and as the material for His building of the church. God wants to work Himself into the church and to express all His fullness through the church.</p>
<p>The second point that we must pay attention to is that management requires not only resources but also power. Since God manages His economy with Himself as the resources, the driving power of His management is His great power. Ephesians 1:19 through 21 speaks of &ldquo;the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power.&rdquo; This power is exceedingly great; it is the all-transcending power of God that raised Christ from the dead and caused Him to ascend to the heavens.</p>
<p>Verse 20 of chapter 3 says that God is able to do superabundantly according to the power which operates in us. This power is not only God&rsquo;s creating power but also His resurrecting power. The Bible reveals that God calls things not being as being and also gives life to the dead (Rom. 4:17). God&rsquo;s creating power calls things not being as being, and His resurrecting power gives life to the dead. Both God&rsquo;s creating power and His resurrecting power are His power. However, God&rsquo;s resurrecting power includes His creating power and surpasses His creating power. Whenever we speak of God&rsquo;s resurrecting power, we are speaking of all His power. God is using His power as the driving power in the management of His economy to produce the church. Thus, He can express His infinite power through the church.</p>
<p>The third point that we need to pay attention to is that in addition to resources and power, management also involves methods. In managing and building a house, we need materials, power, and also methods. The method that God uses in His management of His economy is His wisdom. Concerning what God is to the church, Ephesians and Colossians speak of God&rsquo;s fullness, God&rsquo;s power, and God&rsquo;s wisdom. God&rsquo;s fullness is the resources for His management of His economy to produce the church. God&rsquo;s power is the driving power of His management. God&rsquo;s wisdom is the method of His management.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:8 says that God caused His grace to the church &ldquo;to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence.&rdquo; Also, verse 10 of chapter 3 says, &ldquo;In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church.&rdquo; Concerning Christ, Colossians 2:3 says, &ldquo;In whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.&rdquo; This means that all God&rsquo;s wisdom is hidden in Christ. All God&rsquo;s wisdom is gained by us in Christ and is expressed through us. God&rsquo;s wisdom is the method by which He manages His economy. Eventually, God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom will be expressed in the universe through the church.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s management He is the resources, His power is the driving power, and His wisdom is the method. Everything is out of God; there is no room for anything that is out of man. God does not need human power or wisdom in His management of His economy to produce the church. Those who have been taught by God know that in touching the church, they must reject their own power, wisdom, and everything.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING ETERNAL</h2>
<p>In eternity God&rsquo;s plan was concerning the church. Before the creation of the universe and all things, before time began, that is, in eternity without beginning, this plan was in God. Ephesians 3:9 says, &ldquo;The economy...which throughout the ages has been hidden in God.&rdquo; The phrase <em>throughout the ages</em> means &ldquo;from eternity.&rdquo; Hence, this economy, this plan, is an eternal plan.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan was made in eternity and also for eternity. The plan was made in eternity, and the purpose of the plan is for eternity. From God&rsquo;s perspective, there is only eternity. From our perspective, there is eternity past and eternity future. So from our perspective, God made this plan in eternity past for eternity future. In other words, in eternity past God had a &ldquo;blueprint&rdquo; of the church. This can be compared to a blueprint for building a house. In time God is building the church according to His blueprint. When His building work is finished in eternity future, God&rsquo;s building will be manifested. This building is the New Jerusalem as the ultimate and fullest manifestation of the church.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish His eternal plan in time concerning the church, God worked in two steps. The first step of God&rsquo;s work involves creation, and the second step involves redemption. Creation calls things not being as being, but redemption gives life to the dead. According to its precise definition, redemption does not give life to the dead. However, the focus of God&rsquo;s redemption is to give life to the dead. What God created through His calling things not being as being is the first creation. What God made through giving life to the dead is the new creation. The first creation was corrupted by Satan and became the evil and defiled old creation. The new creation is the issue of Christ&rsquo;s redeeming death and His resurrection. The old creation is in Adam, but the new creation is in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17). The old creation in the fallen Adam is soulish, natural; the new creation in the resurrected Christ is spiritual (1 Cor. 15:46-48).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s building will be completed when what is soulish and natural becomes spiritual. The so-called old heaven and old earth are part of the old creation. The new heaven and new earth are part of the new creation. The new heaven and new earth come when the entire old creation becomes new (Rev. 21:1). The New Jerusalem, the eternal building that God planned to build and to accomplish in eternity, will be the center of the new creation (v. 24).</p>
<p>Materials need to be prepared for God&rsquo;s plan, and a building must be built. The building can take place only after the materials are prepared. God&rsquo;s creation by calling things not being as being is for His preparation of the materials. God&rsquo;s redemption and His giving life to the dead are for the building of these materials. Therefore, in time God is manifested first as the God of creation and then as the God of resurrection. Romans 4:17 says that Abraham believed in the God &ldquo;who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s calling things not being as being is His preparation of materials for His eternal plan, but His giving life to the dead is for His building of these materials to accomplish His eternal plan.</p>
<p>We were created by God; hence, we are the materials for God to build the church. However, when there is only the element of creation without the element of resurrection, there are only materials but no building. The materials must pass through death and resurrection in order for there to be God&rsquo;s building. Therefore, our being built by God depends on our experience of death and resurrection. The extent to which we experience death and resurrection is the extent to which we are built by God. Without passing through death and resurrection, we are natural materials that cannot be built into the church. In order for us to be built into the church, we must pass through death and resurrection.</p>
<p>A descendant of Adam is created by God, but he is not a member of the church; he is only a piece of material. He can become a member of the church when he passes through redemption, that is, through death and resurrection. Furthermore, a person may be saved, but he may still have many natural things in him that are of Adam and that have not passed through death and resurrection. In other words, he is raw material that has not yet been built. However, the more he experiences the cross, knows resurrection, and allows God&rsquo;s work of death and resurrection to gain ground in him, the more he is built into the church. This is the way for a believer to be built by God into the church.</p>
<p>In eternity past God had a blueprint of the church. In eternity future God will gain a building that is completed according to His blueprint. In time God first created, and then He accomplished death and resurrection; that is, He first prepared materials and then began building. When He is finished building, the holy city, New Jerusalem, will be manifested in eternity future (Rev. 21&mdash;22). Hence, God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church existed in eternity past and is for eternity future.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING OUT OF GOD HIMSELF</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church comes out of God, because He planned it in Himself. This plan is not out of anything apart from God, nor was it produced by any influence apart from God. There was no creation when God made His plan. Therefore, there was nothing to suggest to God that He should have a plan. God&rsquo;s plan was altogether out of His own pleasure. Furthermore, no proposals were made to God related to His plan. The design of the plan was conceived in God; it was His pleasure, His determination, and His plan. Every part of God&rsquo;s plan came out of God and depends on Him. God is the source of this plan and the realm of this plan.</p>
<p>The church is the issue of God&rsquo;s plan; it is not the issue of human intention. Hence, we should not initiate anything related to the church; we should only live in God and allow Him to fulfill His plan concerning the church. Both the establishing of the church and the building of the church should be for the upholding and fulfilling of God&rsquo;s plan, not for the carrying out of man&rsquo;s will through human persuasion. This is a great test and limitation to man. Human opinions, zeal, decisions, and methods must be dealt with and restricted in relation to the church. The church is God&rsquo;s plan, not man&rsquo;s intention. The church involves God&rsquo;s desire, not human opinion. The church involves God&rsquo;s operation, not human initiation. The church involves God fulfilling His plan, not man carrying out his will. For the church our thoughts must be governed by God, and our activities must be controlled by God. This requires us to have a genuine fear of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ACCORDING TO THE GOOD PLEASURE<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S WILL</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:9 says that God&rsquo;s economy concerning the church, His plan concerning the church, is &ldquo;according to His good pleasure.&rdquo; This means that within God there was a good pleasure. God&rsquo;s good pleasure is embodied not only in His will but also in His purpose. Based upon God&rsquo;s will, He made a purpose. In His will and purpose there is His good pleasure. Then God made a plan. The church is God&rsquo;s plan according to the good pleasure of His will; the church is also the target of His purpose. The church is on God&rsquo;s heart and gives Him the greatest pleasure. God loves the church; therefore, He planned to have the church. The church was not invented by God because He had mercy on sinners who have been saved. God planned to have the church because He loved the church. The church came out of God&rsquo;s love and is the good pleasure of His heart. Long before anything was created, God had a good pleasure within Himself. Hence, He made a plan concerning the church according to this good pleasure.</p>
<p>Whenever we touch the church, we should take care of God&rsquo;s good pleasure. The church was planned by God according to His good pleasure to satisfy His desire. Therefore, our preferences and our pleasure must be dealt with when we touch the church. If we keep our preferences and pleasure when touching the church, our heart is not pure, and we are not considerate of God&rsquo;s desire. This is a serious lesson for us to learn.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>Everything that God is to the church is in Christ (vv. 3-23). This great matter needs further explanation. The Lord has two particular statuses. He is the Son of God, and He is the Christ of God (Matt. 14:33; Mark 1:1; Luke 9:20). When Peter received revelation concerning the Lord, he said, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (Matt. 16:16). The Son of God is the Lord&rsquo;s status according to His person. The Christ of God is His status according to His work. According to the Lord&rsquo;s person, He is the Son of God. According to the Lord&rsquo;s work, He is the Christ of God. This is similar to a crown prince of a country being appointed king. The crown prince is his original status, but the kingship is the work to which he is appointed. Christ is the Son of God appointed to be the Christ of God.</p>
<p>The title <em>Christ</em> means &ldquo;the Anointed.&rdquo; When God needs someone to work for Him, He first anoints that person. When God needed the Old Testament priests, kings, or prophets to accomplish His will, He anointed them. Therefore, God&rsquo;s appointing of His Son to be the Christ is His commissioning of His Son to be the Anointed in order to accomplish His plan concerning the church. The accomplishment of this plan is the work to which God appointed His Son in making Him the Christ, the Anointed.</p>
<p>When did God anoint His Son to be the Christ? Hebrews 1:2 says, &ldquo;The Son, whom He [God] appointed Heir of all things, through whom also He made the universe.&rdquo; God appointed His Son in eternity, before the creation of all things. In eternity God had a plan concerning the church, which was according to His good pleasure. He then appointed His Son as the Christ to accomplish His plan. Therefore, God anointed His Son in eternity (v. 9). However, the Son&rsquo;s being anointed was not manifested before men until the Holy Spirit descended upon Him when He was baptized (Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:10).</p>
<p>Three categories of people were anointed in the Old Testament: priests (Exo. 29:4-9), kings (1 Sam. 9:15-16; 16:12-13), and prophets (10:1, 6). These three kinds of people had to be anointed when they entered into office. Therefore, they were the anointed ones. However, it is difficult to find a person who was a priest, a king, and a prophet at the same time. Only David, a king, also wore the ephod of the priest and was called a prophet (16:12-13; 2 Sam. 6:14; Acts 2:30). David typifies Christ because he had the three statuses of king, priest, and prophet. However, these statuses were not fully developed in him.</p>
<p>When Christ came, He was God&rsquo;s Priest, God&rsquo;s King, and God&rsquo;s Prophet; He holds all three statuses (Zech. 3:8; Heb. 5:5-6; Rev. 1:5; Deut. 18:15; John 3:34; 14:24). God anointed Him to be the Priest, the King, and the Prophet so that He could accomplish God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church. God wanted Christ to accomplish everything that He determined to accomplish concerning the church and for the church. Everything that God is to the church is accomplished in Christ; apart from Christ, God is doing nothing related to the church.</p>
<p>God appointed His Son as Christ so that His Son would not only accomplish His plan concerning the church but would also inherit this plan. In typology Abraham typifies the Father God, Isaac typifies the Son of God, and Rebekah, typifies the church. Abraham sent his servant to find Rebekah, who became Isaac&rsquo;s wife (Gen. 24). Abraham&rsquo;s intentions were for his son Isaac. Similarly, God&rsquo;s eternal arrangement, management, and plan concerning the church are for Christ. The church is the counterpart of Christ and the Body of Christ (Eph. 5:25; 1:23). God&rsquo;s eternal plan is to gain the church for His Son by building the church to be Christ&rsquo;s counterpart and to be the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s plan, Christ not only accomplishes God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church and inherits the church. God&rsquo;s plan is also to make Christ everything in the church (vv. 3-23). This is the meaning of the phrase <em>in Christ. In Christ</em> is not only Christ accomplishing and inheriting but also Christ becoming everything. God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church is for Christ to become everything to the church, for everything of the church to be Christ, and for the church to be Christ.</p>
<p>When we meet a brother or sister who is deep in the Lord, we sense that this person has the savor of Christ. Sitting in front of this person is like sitting in front of Christ. This, however, is but a foreshadow and a foretaste of the things to come. A day will come when all things will be Christ, and we will sense Christ in everything we encounter. This is the purpose that God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church will achieve, and this is also the full significance of the phrase <em>in Christ.</em></p>
<p>God Himself is the resources with which He manages the church, the power of God is the driving power with which He manages the church, and the wisdom of God is the method with which He manages the church. But we must ask where God is. Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;In Him [Christ] dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily,&rdquo; and 1 Corinthians 1:24 says, &ldquo;Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.&rdquo; Hence, Christ is God, He is God&rsquo;s power, and He is God&rsquo;s wisdom. Therefore, Christ is the resources, the power, and the wisdom in the management of God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church. God in His eternal plan appointed His Son to be the Anointed, the Christ, in order for Christ to accomplish this plan, inherit this plan, and be everything in this plan. Then everything in this plan will be Christ and will be full of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to consider God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING UNTO SONSHIP, BEING HOLY,<br />
AND BEING TO GOD</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1 shows that God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church is for the believers to be unto sonship (v. 5), to be holy (v. 4), and to be to God (v. 5). These three items are related and are the central significance and purpose of God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being unto Sonship</h2>
<p>In the original Greek the emphasis of <em>unto sonship</em> in Ephesians 1:5 is not on being a son but on becoming sons who inherit the position and status associated with sonship. God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church is to gain a group of people to be His sons with His sonship.</p>
<p>The Bible emphasizes two aspects of being sons: the aspect of life and the aspect of inheritance. Life makes a person a son, but a son might not inherit the birthright. Esau is an example. He was Isaac&rsquo;s son, but he did not inherit the birthright (Heb. 12:16). According to His plan, God wants a group of people not only to be His sons with His life but also to have His sonship in order to inherit everything that He is. Those who have a share in the church have God&rsquo;s life and are His sons. In addition, they will obtain the sonship and inherit everything of God. God has not only given Himself in His life to the believers; He is causing those who have the status of sons to gain everything of Him as their inheritance.</p>
<p>God has given us His life to make us His sons; that is, He has given Himself to us so that we may gain Him. Our relationship to Adam is an example. On the one hand, Adam died; on the other hand, he is still living. Everything of Adam is in his life, which was given to us. Therefore, Adam is still living on the earth today. Adam is living in his descendants, because his descendants inherited everything of Adam in his life. God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church is to make a group of people His sons. God has given Himself in His life to us for us to inherit Him. We have received God&rsquo;s Son. John 1:12 and 13 say that as many as received God&rsquo;s Son, &ldquo;to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten...of God.&rdquo; To be begotten of God is to receive God. All that God is, is in His life, and this life has been given to us.</p>
<p>Romans 8:14 says, &ldquo;As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God,&rdquo; and verse 17 says, &ldquo;If children, heirs also.&rdquo; Being sons is a matter of life, but being heirs is a matter of inheritance. God has made us His sons; hence, He has also made us His heirs to inherit all that He is and all things. This is a glorious matter. The God of glory has entered into us; hence, we are now His sons. However, we have not yet been manifested as His heirs. The world regards us as the scum of all things (1 Cor. 4:13). But in that day we will enter into the glory of God to inherit all that He is and all things. This is the sonship that God has given us.</p>
<p><em>Unto sonship</em> in Ephesians 1:5 means to become sons with the sonship. Being sons is a matter of life; obtaining the sonship is a matter of inheritance. Life enables us to gain God; inheritance enables us to enjoy God and everything that God has. This is what God determined to accomplish in His eternal plan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Holy</h2>
<p>Verse 4 says that God chose us in Christ to be holy. In Greek the emphasis here is on being holy rather than being clean. Those who translated the Bible into Chinese added the character for <em>clean</em> to make this a two-character expression. When <em>holy</em> and <em>clean</em> are put together, people have the incorrect concept that this verse refers to being clean. The Greek word does not have the meaning of cleanness but of separation. Someone who is holy is separated. Our concept concerning being holy must be changed from cleanness to separation. We should regard <em>holy</em> as a matter of separation, not of cleanness.</p>
<p>The Bible says that God is holy (Lev. 11:44-45; 1 Pet. 1:16). God is holy, distinct, and separate from everything else. God&rsquo;s heart is love, and His nature is holy. God&rsquo;s nature is His substance, which is holy. The nature of a wooden chair is wood, and the nature of an iron rod is iron. Similarly, God&rsquo;s nature is holy. This means that He is distinct and separate from everything else. He is different not only from the filthy things in us but also from the clean things in us. He is separate not only from the bad things in us but also from the good things in us. God&rsquo;s nature is symbolized by gold, which is distinct from everything else. God is different not only from filthy things but also from very clean things. God is separate not only from bad things but also from the best things. The Bible uses gold, which is distinct in nature from everything else, as a symbol of God&rsquo;s nature. Gold indicates that God&rsquo;s nature is distinct from the nature of all creation and separate from the nature of everything else. Because God is distinct and separate, He is holy.</p>
<p><em>Holiness</em> refers to God Himself, God&rsquo;s nature. God&rsquo;s eternal plan is to make the church holy. In a superficial sense, this is to separate the church unto God. In the Old Testament sanctification refers to being separated unto God. There are thousands of oxen and sheep that belong to the world and are used by the world. When an ox or a sheep was brought to the altar of God and offered up to God, the ox or sheep was separated unto God and thus was sanctified. Likewise, God&rsquo;s plan to make the church holy is His separating the church from all things to Himself. In a deeper sense, however, God&rsquo;s plan to make the church holy is His mingling the church with Himself, that is, His making earthen men into men of gold. Whatever is earthen is common; whatever is gold is holy. We were originally earthen, that is, common, but God is making us gold, that is, holy.</p>
<p>There is a picture in Genesis 2. God formed man from the dust of the ground (v. 7) and placed this man of dust in front of the tree of life (v. 9) and by a river that issued in gold (v. 11). This indicates that through His life, God wants to change the man whom He created from the dust of the earth into gold. Therefore, at the end of Revelation, a &ldquo;man-city&rdquo; of pure gold appears; this is the holy city, New Jerusalem (21:10, 18). The wall of this city is jasper, the foundations of the wall are adorned with every precious stone, and the gates are pearls, but the city itself is pure gold, and the street of the city is pure gold (vv. 18-21). This indicates that when God&rsquo;s work is finished, the church will be pure gold, completely holy. At that time, the church will no longer be dust but will be transformed into gold; that is, the church will be completely of God&rsquo;s element.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, sanctification begins with separation and ends with transformation, a change in nature. When we were saved, God separated us from the world. But that was merely a beginning. Since the time of our salvation, God&rsquo;s life has been working to transform us. Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we are being &ldquo;transformed into the same image.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s life in us is transforming us, changing our nature, until we are fully in His image.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2 the man of dust, whom God made, could stand before God, but God had not yet entered into him; God was God, and man was man. But because God is in His believers and is transforming them, God is completely mingled with them as one by the end of Revelation, and they have God&rsquo;s element. They no longer have a nature of dust but a nature of gold. In the process of transformation we have God&rsquo;s life as a treasure that is of pure gold, but we are still earthen vessels outwardly (2 Cor. 4:7). Therefore, God&rsquo;s life must continue to transform us. In resurrection our outward earthen body will be the same as the Lord&rsquo;s body of glory. Then the church will be completely holy. Thus, the manifestation of the church, the ultimate and fullest city, is called the holy city (Rev. 21:2). Sanctification begins with separation and consummates with transformation.</p>
<p>We should have experiences of both aspects of sanctification. After we are saved, we are different from our relatives, friends, neighbors, colleagues, and schoolmates. But this is only a beginning. We must ask, &ldquo;Has my nature changed? Do I live and walk by myself or by God being mingled with me?&rdquo; Sanctification is not merely believers coming to serve God in the meetings in contrast to unbelievers, who go watch movies. We must ask, &ldquo;Do I come to serve God in the meetings by myself, or do I come by God transforming me and mingling with me?&rdquo; Even regarding speaking from the podium, we should ask, &ldquo;Am I speaking by myself, or is the Spirit of God transforming me and mingling with me in my speaking?&rdquo; If we are speaking by ourselves, without the transformation of the Holy Spirit, then at the most we have an outward kind of sanctification. We are not sanctified merely by not doing worldly things. Our being sanctified depends on whether we take care of the things of God by ourselves or by God transforming us and being mingled with us. Even when reading the Bible, we must ask, &ldquo;Am I reading by my clever mind, or am I letting the Spirit of God transform me and mingle with me in my reading?&rdquo; If we are reading by our clever mind, it is only an outward &ldquo;sanctification&rdquo; without inward transformation. The Holy Spirit must transform us and mingle with us in our reading. This is sanctification according to the inward aspect of transformation.</p>
<p>After we are saved, we have two natures. Hence, we should not be the only one speaking; the Lord should be mingling with us and speaking with us. We should not be the only one walking; the Lord should be mingling with us and walking with us. Whatever we do should not be done by ourselves; we should let the Lord mingle with us and transform us. Everything we do should be by the Lord&rsquo;s transformation and should cause His element to increase in us. This is sanctification according to the inward aspect of transformation. This is sanctification in our living, that is, an inward sanctification, a practical sanctification, and a completing sanctification. Such sanctification not only separates us outwardly but also transforms us, changes our inward nature. The coming holy city, New Jerusalem, will not only be separate and distinct from all things outwardly but also changed in nature inwardly. It will be gold in nature; it will not have an earthen nature. The New Jerusalem will be a completely transformed and sanctified city.</p>
<p>Most believers do not have this experience. Some brothers and sisters conduct themselves properly and are without fault in their interactions with others, but they still bear a common and earthen flavor. Their humility, gentleness, considerateness, and blamelessness have an earthen, human, and common flavor. The world may praise such people, but those with a spiritual sense know that such people are altogether earthen, not holy. Such people are good outwardly, but they are not changed in their nature to be holy inwardly; they do not let God&rsquo;s life transform them.</p>
<p>Someone who lets God&rsquo;s life transform him may not have any particular strengths, but when we contact him, we sense that he has the flavor of God. Something in him makes him an extraordinary and uncommon person, one who is distinct from everyone else. When we contact him, it is as if we are contacting God. This condition is called holiness. Such ones have been mingled with God and transformed by God. The extent to which a person lets God mingle with him and transform him inwardly is the extent to which he is holy.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal plan is for the church to arrive at the goal of sanctification, that is, for the church to be extraordinary, distinct from all else, and to be full of God&rsquo;s element. Then one day in the universe the church will be completely transformed by God to be a city of pure gold, in which all the elements are God Himself. This is to be holy. If we have this vision, we will realize that most Christians are earthen, common, and outside of God. The church must be absolutely holy and must not be mixed with any common element. The church is not the city of Babel, which was built of burned bricks (Gen. 11:2-4, 9). The church is the holy city, New Jerusalem, made of pure gold. Hence, we cannot use worldly methods, which are the earthly, earthen, or human methods, in our carrying out activities in the church, working in the church, administrating the church, or leading the church.</p><h2 class="head2">Being to God Himself</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan is for us to be His sons and to be holy so that we can be to Him, that is, so that we can be brought into God and be mingled with Him as one. Being brought into God and being mingled with Him are the issue of God&rsquo;s life; this life makes us His sons and transforms us. The extent to which we let God&rsquo;s life transform us is the extent to which we are brought into God; and the extent to which we are transformed by God&rsquo;s life is the extent to which we are mingled with God. When we are transfigured into His glorious image, we will be brought completely into God and fully mingled with Him.</p>
<p>Romans 6:3 says that we have been baptized into Christ; that is, we have been brought into Christ through baptism. Everyone who has been baptized was baptized into Christ, that is, brought into Christ. This was planned and determined by God in eternity. Then in time through Christ&rsquo;s redemption God accomplished His plan so that we can be to Him, that is, so that we can be brought into God and mingled with Him as one.</p>
<p>To be holy is for God to mingle with us; to be brought into God is for us to be mingled with God. When the holy city, New Jerusalem, appears, this mutual mingling will be complete. At that time, God will be fully mingled with us, and we will be fully mingled with God. He and we will be completely mingled to become one, being inseparable, and having the same nature and the same glory. This ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s eternal plan will be accomplished in the future, but we can experience it today. When we are in our spirit, we sense that God is mingled with us and that we are mingled with God to the extent that God flows out of us. Many saints have had such experiences. These experiences prove that our mingling with God into one is practical.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s primary purpose in having the church is to work Himself into man and to work man into Himself so that He may have a union with man and be completely mingled with man. When God made a counterpart for Adam, He said that it was not good for man to be alone (Gen. 2:18). This indicates that it is not good for God to be alone in the universe. God needs a counterpart in the universe, and this counterpart is the church that He planned to gain. The church is God&rsquo;s counterpart. Without the church to match Him, God is alone, which is not good for God. This means that it is not good for man to not be joined to God as God&rsquo;s counterpart. When God gains the church and when man becomes God&rsquo;s counterpart, God and man will be fully joined and mingled together. Then God will be satisfied, man will be at rest, God&rsquo;s problem will be solved, and man&rsquo;s problem will also be solved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING THE MULTIFARIOUS WISDOM OF GOD<br />
KNOWN TO SATAN AND HIS ANGELS</h2>
<p>On the one hand, God&rsquo;s eternal plan concerning the church is for the man whom He loves to have His life and be mingled with Him. On the other hand, God&rsquo;s eternal plan concerning the church makes the multifarious wisdom of God known to His enemy, Satan and his angels, that is, to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies (Eph. 3:10). Satan thinks that he is shrewd and clever; he does not know that he always gives God the opportunity to express His wisdom. Satan&rsquo;s tricks give God the opportunity to express His wisdom. God&rsquo;s wisdom is fully expressed, because Satan provides a contrast.</p>
<p>The history of the whole universe is like a play. A good play always involves changes in the plot to demonstrate the wisdom of the playwright. The plot of the play of the universe has numerous rich and epic developments that express God&rsquo;s wisdom. In the universe the church can fully express God&rsquo;s wisdom. Therefore, 1 Corinthians 4:9 says, &ldquo;We have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s wonderful doings in the believers are manifested to the men of the world and to the angels, especially to the angels who followed Satan to rebel against God, so that they may know the multifarious wisdom of God. God&rsquo;s creation is wonderful because it can express God&rsquo;s wisdom, but God&rsquo;s creation expresses only a part of God&rsquo;s wisdom. God&rsquo;s wisdom is fully expressed only in His making fallen sinners into His sons to be His church.</p>
<p>After God created man, Satan came in to seduce man, which caused sin and death to enter into man, making man a sinner with a record of sin before God. This was Satan&rsquo;s trick to prevent God from reaching His purpose in man. However, God became flesh and lived on the earth as a man in order to accomplish His plan as a man. From the day that this man, Jesus, was incarnated, Satan searched for opportunities to destroy Him. Satan seemed to eventually succeed when He was crucified. With Christ&rsquo;s death, Satan must have thought that God could no longer do anything. Satan did not know that Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion afforded God the opportunity to deal with all his tricks in humanity. Through the death of the Lord Jesus, God dealt with man&rsquo;s record of sin and the power of sin in man. Furthermore, the death of Jesus gave God an opportunity to express His resurrection power.</p>
<p>Satan put the Lord Jesus to death, but God raised Him from the dead. This resurrection dealt with the death that Satan had injected into man and enabled man to receive God&rsquo;s uncreated life. When God&rsquo;s life enters into someone, he is changed inwardly and brought into God in order to become a member of the mystical Body of Christ to express everything of God. This mystical Body of Christ will become the New Jerusalem in the future to fulfill God&rsquo;s desire and express God&rsquo;s glory. Then Satan will be silenced in awe of God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom. The &ldquo;plot&rdquo; of God&rsquo;s redemption expresses His wisdom. The emphasis of God&rsquo;s plan is not individuals but the church.</p>
<p>In addition, because sin entered into man, God gave the law. When the law was given, the children of Israel also came under the law of the commandments in ordinances. Hence, the law of the commandments in ordinances became a wall of partition that separates the children of Israel from the Gentiles, that is, separates into two the people whom God chose in eternity for the accomplishing of His plan. The law, however, gave God a further opportunity to express His wisdom. Ephesians 2 says that God abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances and broke down the middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles through Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross; thus, Christ created the two into one new man, into His mystical Body (vv. 14-16, 18), which is the church, in the Holy Spirit through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection from the dead. In producing the church, God dealt with the problem of the law of the commandments in ordinances so that His wisdom might be expressed through the church. Therefore, all the matters pertaining to the church express the wisdom of God.</p>
<p>Colossians 2 says that in Christ &ldquo;dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily&rdquo; (v. 9) and that &ldquo;all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden&rdquo; in Christ (v. 3). This means that the wisdom of God involves everything of God. Without God or His power, God&rsquo;s wisdom is empty. God&rsquo;s wisdom cannot be expressed without Himself as the resources or without His power as the driving power. God&rsquo;s wisdom can be manifested because He is the resources and because His power is the driving power. God expresses His wisdom through the church by expressing Himself and His power, that is, by expressing everything of God. Through the church God is making known His multifarious wisdom to Satan and his angels; that is, God is manifesting all the fullness of the Godhead through His power and through His work in the man whom Satan corrupted.</p>
<p>When the condition of the church is normal and spiritual before God, men sense that the church has a method, way, wisdom, and power that are not of man. There is something in the church that is beyond worldly knowledge and capabilities. This is God&rsquo;s wisdom. Many eminent scholars acknowledge respectfully that something is in the church and in the people who fear God and belong to Him. That something is God Himself, God&rsquo;s wisdom.</p>
<p>God is the wisdom of the church. When a church lives before God, it manifests wonderful things that are not seen in the world. However, when a local church loses its divine nature and its heavenly position, it cannot express God&rsquo;s wisdom. We are not yet in that glorious day, but men can see God&rsquo;s wisdom in a church that is according to God&rsquo;s standard.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s wisdom involves everything of God, which today is hidden in Christ. When we partake of Christ, we partake of this wisdom. God has made Christ wisdom to us (1 Cor. 1:30). Christ is wisdom and everything to us from God. When we live by Christ, live Christ, and let Christ live in us, we will be wise and have a way. Then we can experience and express everything of God. If the church is full of Christ and lives Christ out, it will express God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom before Satan and his angels and put them to shame. This is God&rsquo;s purpose concerning the church in relation to Satan. God intends to deal with Satan, the power that rebelled against Him in the universe, through the church. God wants to express His wisdom to Satan through the church in order to put Satan to shame and to silence him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that the purpose of God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church is for the believers to obtain the sonship, to be holy, and to be to God (Eph. 1:4-5). This purpose also involves making known His multifarious wisdom to Satan and his evil angels (3:10). In this chapter we will consider another purpose of God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church, which is to head up all things in Christ (1:10).</p>
<h2 class="head1">HEADING UP ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>Obtaining the sonship, being holy, and being to God solve the problem between God and man. Making God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom known to Satan and his evil angels deals with the problem of Satan. Heading up all things in Christ deals with the problem of all things. Thus, God&rsquo;s plan deals with the problem between God and man, the problem of Satan, and the problem related to all things. The church is the means by which God deals with every problem. Without the church, the problem between God and man, the problem of Satan, and the problem related to all things would not be resolved. The solution to these problems depends on the church. If the Lord opens our eyes to see how crucial the church is, our whole being will be subdued to understand that nothing apart from the church is the solution to these problems. This is revealed in Ephesians.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Universe Cohering in Oneness</h2>
<p>In order for us to understand how God heads up all things through the church, we must know that the universe coheres in oneness; everything in the universe depends on this oneness. The source of the universe is one, the system of the universe is one, and the center of the universe is one. Everything in the universe coheres in this oneness, and this oneness is God. The universe coheres in oneness because the universe is out of God, and God is one. There was no chaos in God&rsquo;s creation; there was only harmony due to this oneness. Thus, the universe was one, and it was without chaos.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Satan Damaging the Oneness of the Universe</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, Satan rebelled. From the time of his rebellion, the harmony of the universe was lost; it became chaotic. There is now chaos in the universe because the rebel Satan wanted to be head; he wanted to exalt his throne and to be equal with God (Isa. 14:12-14). When chaos entered into the universe, the order that was in the universe was lost.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Restoring the Oneness of the Universe</h2>
<p>God cannot allow chaos to continue in the universe. He will restore all things by heading them up. The oneness of the universe was originally the oneness in creation, but even though it became chaotic, it will be restored in oneness. This process involves God&rsquo;s redemption and God&rsquo;s life. The original oneness in creation was damaged by Satan, but God is restoring this oneness through redemption and life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Satan Damaging by Death</h2>
<p>Satan damaged the oneness in creation by death. Death has three spiritual consequences. First, death severed the relationship between creation and the Creator. Second, death caused creation to lose its function before the Creator. Third, death corrupted creation. When death severed all things from God, all things lost their center, and the oneness in creation was lost.</p>
<p>The center of the universe is God; therefore, the oneness of the universe is God Himself. When all things were severed from God, they lost their center, their oneness. This oneness is referred to as peace in Colossians 1:20: &ldquo;Through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross&mdash;through Him, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens.&rdquo; When all things were severed from God, peace and harmony were lost. Peace and harmony are what the Chinese call accord. When all things have a proper relationship with God, they are not severed from God, and they are in accord because there is peace and harmony. This is the great oneness in the universe.</p>
<p>Because Satan brought death into all things and severed all things from God, all things are not at peace or in harmony; the oneness in all things has been lost. Many situations on earth prove that the peace and harmony among all things have been lost. For example, mosquitoes and fleas bite people. This proves that all things are not in harmony or at peace and that the oneness in the universe has been lost. When creation was severed from the Creator, it fell into death and confusion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Restoring by Life</h2>
<p>Satan damaged the oneness of the universe by death, but God restores the oneness by life. Only life can overcome death, swallow up death, and eliminate all the problems brought in by death. Based on His redemption, God&rsquo;s life restores the peace, harmony, and oneness that had been lost.</p>
<p>Formerly, we were dead in our offenses and sins and alienated from God (Eph. 2:1, 12). But one day God&rsquo;s mercy reached us. Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption on the cross and through our believing, God forgave us our sins and imparted His life into us (v. 4; 1:7; John 3:16). When His life entered into us, it brought us into union with God. This life not only restores our relationship with God in creation; it also brings us into a life relationship with God. Through this relationship with God we are joined to Him (Gal. 2:20). As a result, our function toward God is restored. This function, which certainly includes serving God, exercising God&rsquo;s authority, and accomplishing God&rsquo;s purpose and will, primarily involves living out God (v. 20; Phil. 1:20-21). The corruption that was brought in by death is swallowed up by life. This results in full peace and harmony and brings in oneness.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s recovery is a recovery of life, a recovery that involves transformation in life and nature. Satan&rsquo;s corruption brought his death into creation; God&rsquo;s recovery works His life into created man through redemption. Satan&rsquo;s death destroyed the oneness in creation; God&rsquo;s life recovers the oneness through redemption. Where there is no life of God, there is death, which is the absence of oneness. Wherever God&rsquo;s life flows, there is resurrection, which is oneness. Hence, wherever God&rsquo;s life is, there is oneness. Death is the opposite of oneness; it is the annihilation of oneness. Only life can swallow up death and eliminate death. Wherever God&rsquo;s life flows, death is swallowed up, and the oneness destroyed by death is recovered.</p><h2 class="head2">The Restored Oneness Having the Nature of God</h2>
<p>God created all things by His might and held all things in accord without chaos. Through Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, this oneness in creation was brought into the realm of death, and the universe became chaotic. God is restoring this oneness not only by His power but also with His life. In this process He gives His resurrection life to created and redeemed man to recover the oneness that was damaged by death (Col. 1:15-20), thus making the oneness in creation again possible through the oneness in resurrection. The oneness in creation is related only to God&rsquo;s might, not God&rsquo;s life. Hence, the oneness in creation did not have God&rsquo;s nature. However, the oneness in redemption involves resurrection. This oneness has not only God&rsquo;s might but also God&rsquo;s resurrection life. Hence, it has God&rsquo;s nature (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Restoration Beginning with the Church<br />
and Then Spreading to All Things</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s work to restore the oneness in the universe begins with the church. God is working His life into the church so that oneness may be recovered first in the church. When oneness is completely recovered in the church, God will enlarge this oneness out from the church and through the church into all things in order to restore the oneness of all things. When God fully recovers the oneness in the church, all things will be headed up (Eph. 1:22-23).</p>
<p>James 1:18 says that God &ldquo;brought us forth by the word of truth, purposing that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.&rdquo; We are the firstfruits among God&rsquo;s creatures. Firstfruits are a matter of life. A house cannot ripen, because it has no life, but fruit ripens because it has life. God has imparted His life into created and redeemed people. This life is working to ripen them. The ones who ripen first are the firstfruits. The issue of ripening is oneness. God&rsquo;s life must first enter into the church and operate in the church to swallow up death so that the church may be the firstfruits among all things and be the first to enter into one accord. When medication is injected into the body, it first acts at the point of injection. When the church is fully matured and in one accord, God will bring in the restoration of all things so that all things will be headed up. This stage can be likened to medication working throughout the body.</p>
<p>The disharmony, discord, among all things in the universe will continue until the restoration of all things (Acts 3:21), that is, until the coming of the kingdom age. Romans 8:21-22 says, &ldquo;In hope that the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God...The whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now.&rdquo; Because creation has been corrupted, it is still groaning and suffering pain. Creation hopes to be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of glory, which we, the children of God, will obtain. Creation&rsquo;s being freed from the slavery of corruption is the restoration of all things. When God&rsquo;s operation in the church is finished, the children of God will obtain the freedom of glory, and all things will be restored.</p>
<p>When God&rsquo;s work in the church is finished, all elements of the old creation in the church will pass away, and everything will be related to the new creation (2 Cor. 5:17). The church will be in one accord; there will be no discord. Furthermore, the whole church will enter into God&rsquo;s new creation, which is in glory. Then God will be able to free all things from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the new creation, that is, to free all things from the disharmony of the old creation into the oneness of the new creation. Romans 8:19 says, &ldquo;The anxious watching of the creation eagerly awaits the revelation of the sons of God.&rdquo; All creation is anxiously watching and waiting for the revelation of the sons of God. This indicates that God will first work the oneness thoroughly into the church and then work the oneness into all things.</p>
<p>It is not yet time for God to deal with all things; rather, it is the time for Him to deal with the church. If the church is not brought into oneness through God&rsquo;s dealings, all things will not be in oneness in the future. God regards the church as the firstfruits among all things; hence, He is working to first recover all things in the church into one accord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The One Accord in the Church<br />
Being out of Life</h2>
<p>God is not using methods, might, or conduct to recover the one accord in the church; His work of recovery is altogether by life. The more God&rsquo;s life operates in the church, the more the one accord is recovered in the church. The more God&rsquo;s life transforms the church, the more the one accord is manifested in the church. The extent to which God&rsquo;s life operates in the church is the extent to which the one accord is manifested in the church.</p>
<p>Some people, matters, and things in the church are in confusion and disarray. These things cannot be cleared up through man&rsquo;s doing or exhortation but by letting God&rsquo;s life flow through the church, that is, by giving God&rsquo;s life sufficient opportunities to transform. When everyone in the church has the inward flow of life and is gradually being transformed, one accord will spontaneously be manifested in the church.</p>
<p>The oneness in the church comes out of growth. If we do not let God&rsquo;s life grow in us, we cannot be one with the brothers no matter how much we try. Being united is not oneness. Oneness is God; hence, oneness can be manifested only through God&rsquo;s life. If we do not let God&rsquo;s life transform us, we cannot be one, nor can we have the oneness of the church. Politeness, humility, meekness, and self-cultivation cannot make us one, nor can they give us the oneness that God desires. The oneness of the church is the life of God being lived out of us. This is the oneness of the church in resurrection. This oneness is not the oneness in creation but the oneness of life.</p>
<p>God is our life in Christ. The only way to recover the oneness of the church is by God&rsquo;s life. Hence, only when we live Christ, live out His life, can there be genuine oneness in the church. In ourselves we can never be one. Only when we live in Christ can we have true oneness. This oneness is just Christ.</p>
<p>The oneness of God&rsquo;s life is inseparable from the fellowship of life, because the fellowship of life is the oneness of life. When we let God&rsquo;s life inwardly transform us, the fellowship among us will deepen. As this fellowship deepens, the oneness increases. Fellowship is not based on having the same views or having a common faith; fellowship is based on life, because fellowship is life. Death severs all things from God and brings all things into disharmony, but life joins us to God and makes us one with one another.</p>
<p>Whenever we touch life, we sense that we are entering deeper into God, and our oneness with those who are in life increases. Therefore, when life comes, oneness comes, because this oneness is life. When we reject ourselves and live in Christ&rsquo;s life, there are fellowship and oneness among us. If there are elements in us that are still not in Christ&rsquo;s life, then these elements are not in Christ&rsquo;s fellowship. Anything that is not in fellowship is in discord and is dead. Hence, God needs to operate in us until everything in the church is in Christ&rsquo;s life, and the church is in one accord and is headed up.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:13 says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&rdquo; The word <em>at</em> is used three times here: <em>at</em> the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, <em>at</em> a full-grown man, and <em>at</em> the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. The oneness, the heading up, that God desires to recover in the church is the full-grown man, that is, the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ in the church. As long as the church lacks Christ, the church has a deficiency. As long as an element in the church is not up to the standard of Christ, the church has an element of disharmony. The harmony that God desires, the oneness that He wants to recover and arrive at in the church, is Christ. This is God in Christ becoming our life.</p>
<p>Such harmony and one accord through life in the church are the conditions of the coming New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the crystallization of God&rsquo;s recovery work by His life. Everything in the New Jerusalem is in one accord. This one accord is the issue of the river of water of life flowing out of the unique throne of God in the New Jerusalem. Everything in this one accord is according to God&rsquo;s nature of pure gold and the flowing of God&rsquo;s life. Revelation 22:1-2 says, &ldquo;A river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing...fruit each month.&rdquo; The river of water of life with the tree of life flows through the city. Everything that this city has and expresses is the issue of the circulation of life. Therefore, there is oneness in this city, not discord. Everything in this city is of the same life and same nature.</p><h2 class="head2">The One Accord in the Church<br />
Being under Christ&rsquo;s Headship</h2>
<p>Where there is life, there is oneness, and where there is oneness, there is the headship. With life comes headship, and with headship comes oneness. Oneness and headship are inseparable. Where there is oneness, there is headship. Without oneness, there is no headship. If there are many heads, there is no oneness. If a body is missing a head, the oneness is gone. If there are members but no head, the body will collapse.</p>
<p>When we are all in Christ&rsquo;s life and under the headship of Christ, everything in the church will be in one accord and harmony. This is the condition of the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem the river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. This indicates that the one accord in the New Jerusalem is the issue of the flowing of God&rsquo;s life, which brings everything within the city under the authority of God and Christ.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s life will bring us under His headship. No one can live in Christ&rsquo;s life and not be under His headship. When we live in Christ&rsquo;s life, we are under His headship, and the one accord is among us. The one accord in the church is not only out of life; it is also under Christ&rsquo;s headship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Heading Up All Things<br />
through the Shining of the Church</h2>
<p>When God&rsquo;s operation in the church is completed, the church as the firstfruits will be fully ripened, and the New Jerusalem will be manifested with the light of God&rsquo;s life shining out of it. God will place the New Jerusalem at the center of the new universe, and the nations will walk by its light (21:24). Without the light of this city, the nations would be in darkness. Since darkness is a sign of death, being in darkness is to be in death, and being in death is to be in discord. When the nations, who represent all things, walk by the light of the New Jerusalem, all things will be delivered from the darkness of death and from the chaos of darkness and will thereby be made one by the light.</p>
<p>Today all things are in discord because they are in darkness and in death. God has chosen the church, separated the church from all things, and imparted His life into the church. God&rsquo;s life is circulating in the church in order to bring His authority, which is His throne, into the church so that everything of the church may be headed up in God. When this life fills the church, the church will be the New Jerusalem, and God&rsquo;s light will shine out of her to bring all things into the light. Wherever light shines, darkness is eliminated, death has no ground, and all things are brought into one accord.</p>
<p>We should ask the many brothers and sisters who are living in the workers&rsquo; house if they are in one accord and headed up? If they are separate individuals and do not let life flow, they will be dead, not headed up, and not in one accord. To be dead means to be in darkness by being severed from Christ and from God&rsquo;s authority. However, if one brother has the operation of life within him, this life will bring God&rsquo;s throne into him. Then the river of water of life with the tree of life will flow in him until his whole being is under God&rsquo;s authority, and everything in him is in the realm of oneness. Then this brother will be like the New Jerusalem, which is pure gold, without impurities, and is altogether in one accord. Everything in this brother will be Christ and God; there will be no mixture. When he is in the workers&rsquo; house, it will be full of light. The light of life will shine out of this brother to illumine the workers&rsquo; house, and everyone will walk in this light. The light of life will kill all the darkness in the workers&rsquo; house, and the power of life within him will swallow up all the death in the workers&rsquo; house. Even if the saints in the workers&rsquo; house express opinions and the flesh, when this brother shines like the light of the New Jerusalem, those who are contentious will no longer be in darkness. Rather, they will be terminated under this shining, and the flesh will no longer be expressed. Then the saints in the workers&rsquo; house will walk in this light, darkness will be eliminated, death will be swallowed up, and everyone will be in one accord. Such a brother will be like the firstfruits of God&rsquo;s work in the workers&rsquo; house, and everyone will be brought into oneness.</p>
<p>When the life of Christ is fully expressed in the church and shines forth from the church, all things will be headed up in the shining of the church&rsquo;s light. When Ephesians 4:13 is fulfilled in the church, the heading up of all things in Christ in 1:10 will also be fulfilled. When there is the oneness in 4:13, there is the heading up in 1:10. When God&rsquo;s work in the church is complete, the church will become a transparent city of pure gold that shines forth God&rsquo;s light. This light will eliminate the darkness in all things and kill the death in all things, thus heading up all things.</p>
<p>Verse 10 of chapter 1 is not for us to merely study as a prophecy; it is for us to see the purpose that God desires to achieve through the church. When the church matures, God&rsquo;s purpose will be achieved. This is not a matter of prophecy but a matter of life. We should not pay attention to the fulfilling of this prophecy but to the maturing of life; we should let Christ&rsquo;s life transform us so that He may shine forth from us and bring us unto maturity.</p>
<p>When we are mature, the nations and all things will walk by our light. Furthermore, they will come under God&rsquo;s authority, and they will be headed up by this light. Thus, every saint bears responsibility. We must ask ourselves: How much do we let Christ work in us? How much do we let Christ shine in us? How much do we let Him shine out through us? This is the key to all matters. If ten saints serving together in the church cannot be in one accord, we cannot expect all things to be headed up. God is heading up all things by His life through the shining of the church. God&rsquo;s life will work in the church until it can shine forth from the church and become the light of all things. Then all things will be headed up in this light.</p>
<p>Satan destroyed the accord in the universe by bringing death into all things. Death brought in darkness, and darkness made all things chaotic. God is restoring the accord in the universe by working His life into a group of people. This life is operating within these people and becoming their light of life. This light of life will then shine out of them to become the light of all things and to make all things one. Thus life brings in light, and light makes all things one. These two sides can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p> Satan&#150;Death&#150;Darkness&#150;Chaos</p>
<p> God&#150;Life&#150;Light&#150;Oneness</p>
<p>If the lights in the meeting hall suddenly went out during an evening meeting, everyone would be groping in the dark. All people, matters, and things would fall into confusion and would not be able to proceed as usual. If the lights are bright, however, everything will be in good order. Another example is that there may be numerous saints and complicated affairs in a large church, but the church will not be chaotic if it is headed up by one administration. Such oneness is brought in only by the light of life. Whenever there is no light, darkness prevails. Furthermore, people, matters, and things fall into confusion, and the oneness is lost.</p>
<p>All things will be headed up by the light shining forth from the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem can shine forth light because there is a flow of life. As the river of water of life flows within the New Jerusalem, light shines forth. The nations will walk by this light and be headed up. When we have the flow of Christ&rsquo;s life within us, we will have the shining of His life. When electricity flows within a lamp, light shines. The shining of the electricity that is within the lamp is light. This light keeps people from being in darkness and chaos. Similarly, when the light of life shines forth from the church as the light of the nations, the nations will walk by this light, and all things will be headed up in this light.</p>
<p>The Bible says, &ldquo;God is light&rdquo; (1 John 1:5). God as light is the light of life (John 1:4; 8:12), which does not shine onto all things directly from heaven but is placed first in a vessel in order to shine through this vessel. This vessel is the church as a corporate vessel (Phil. 2:15). God wants to impart Himself into this corporate vessel and operate in this vessel. Then He will shine forth from this vessel to become the light of all things and to head up all things.</p>
<p>People in the world do not have a proper understanding of human life. Hence, many newspapers, magazines, and books have differing views and opinions concerning the human life. Such a chaotic situation is due to man&rsquo;s being in darkness. Philosophical writings on human life are in darkness. If philosophical writers do not know where they came from or where they are going, how can they know the meaning of human life? They can only grope in darkness and point at one thing or another. Furthermore, some are unconventional, and others are cynical. People do not know whose opinion to follow. Such a confusing situation will end when God&rsquo;s life shines forth from the church onto people in chaos so that they see light. All theories, views, philosophies, and interpretations are annihilated in God who is the light of life. God as the light of life will bring all things into one accord.</p>
<p>The saints have many different occupations and come from many different nationalities, cultures, and races. Before we believed in the Lord, our views concerning human life rarely agreed. What some regarded as good, others disliked, and what some took for granted, others rejected. After we are saved, we still have different occupations, nationalities, and cultures, but our view and speaking concerning human life are in one accord. We all say, &ldquo;Come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah&rdquo; (Isa. 2:5).</p>
<p>Religion, doctrines, Christian dogmas, and even Bible teachings do not bring us into one accord; only the shining forth of life in us brings us into one accord. Whoever the shining of the light of life reaches is in one accord and is headed up in this light. There is no other way for us to be in one accord or to be headed up, except through the light shining forth from this glorious life.</p>
<p>Having the same faith or the same opinion is not what enables us to work together for the Lord. Those who have the same faith or are of the same opinion can still contend and quarrel. We can work together because we let this living life operate and shine in us. If God&rsquo;s light of life can shine upon us and if we can be restricted by the operation of this life, we will be able to work together in one accord and be headed up.</p>
<p>All things can be headed up only by God&rsquo;s life shining forth from the church and becoming the light of the nations. God&rsquo;s life is within the church, but if the light of life is not able to shine through the church, all things will not be headed up. All things can be headed up because God&rsquo;s life is shining through the church.</p>
<p>Only the light of life can make all things one. All things will be in harmony and in one accord during the restoration of all things because the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah (11:9). The knowledge of Jehovah comes from His shining. Therefore, the earth being filled with the knowledge of Jehovah means that everything on the earth will be shined upon by God. At that time all things will be in harmony; the vipers will not harm, nor will the lions destroy. Isaiah describes the situation during the restoration: &ldquo;The wolf will dwell with the lamb; / And the leopard will lie down with the kid, / And the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; / And a young boy will lead them about. / The cow and the bear will graze; / Their young will lie down together; / And the lion will eat straw like the ox. / The nursing child will play by the cobra&rsquo;s hole, / And upon the viper&rsquo;s den / The weaned child will stretch his hand. / They will not harm nor destroy / In all My holy mountain, / For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah, / As water covers the sea&rdquo; (vv. 6-9). Such harmony is the result of all things being shined upon by God and being filled with the knowledge of Jehovah. Then all things will know God, and the people will say, &ldquo;Come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah&rdquo; (2:5).</p>
<p>Death severed all things from God and brought all things into a state of collapse. Therefore, in order for God to restore His relationship with all things and to restore the harmony among all things, He must first work Himself into a group of created and redeemed people to be their life and then shine forth from within them. There will be harmony when this light shines on all things.</p>
<p>Two portions in the Bible speak about the harmonious condition of one accord among all things that will be in the future. Revelation 21:24 says, &ldquo;The nations will walk by its light,&rdquo; and Isaiah 2:5 says, &ldquo;Come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.&rdquo; Both portions speak of walking in God&rsquo;s light when all things are in harmony and one accord in the future. Hence, in the future all things will be in harmony, in one accord, and headed up because they will be in God&rsquo;s light. God&rsquo;s light annihilates the discord in the darkness and heads up all things. This all-things-heading-up light will shine on all things through the redeemed, that is, through the church, which is the coming New Jerusalem. Therefore, God will head up all things in the universe through the shining of the church.</p><h2 class="head2">The Shining of the Church Heading Up All Things</h2>
<p>God will gather all things into one through the shining of the church because the shining of the church will bring all things under one Head, Christ, who was appointed in eternity and exalted at His ascension by God (1 Tim. 1:17; Acts 5:31). Revelation 21:24 concerns the relationship between the nations on the earth and the New Jerusalem: &ldquo;The nations will walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.&rdquo; When the light of the New Jerusalem shines forth, the nations will walk by the light of the city and bring their glory into the city. The light of the city gathers the nations and all things unto Christ the Head. God will head up all things by her shining.</p>
<p>The coming New Jerusalem will have not only the flow of God&rsquo;s life as her content and the shining of God&rsquo;s light as her outward expression but also the ruling of the throne of God and Christ as her center. Her outward shining of light is based on her inward flow of life, and her inward flow of life is from the ruling of the throne at her center. Her outward light is joined to the throne at her center; her outward shining depends upon the ruling at her center. Therefore, all that she shines on will be brought under the ruling of the throne at her center. In other words, all that are in her light will be under the throne. Her light will bring people under the throne, and her shining will subject people to an inward ruling. Therefore, for the nations to walk by her light means that all things are subject to the throne of God and Christ, that all things acknowledge the authority of God and Christ, and that all things are under Christ as the God-appointed Head, who is heading up the church.</p>
<p>Today the world cannot be one, because the world does not acknowledge the headship of Christ. All things are not in harmony, because they lack the ruling of Christ. Only when God brings the world and all things under the ruling of Christ and the headship of Christ through the shining of the church can the world be one, and all things be in harmony and one accord. There is one accord only when there is the headship of Christ. Only by being subject to Christ the Head can everything be gathered into one under His Headship. When God brings all things under the authority of Christ through the light shining forth from the church, all things will be gathered into one under Christ the Head.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Subjecting All Things under the Head, Christ,<br />
through the Church and to the Church</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:10 is complemented by verse 22. These two verses speak concerning two sides of one thing. Verse 10 implies that God heads up all things in Christ through the church. Verse 22 says that God gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church. According to verse 10, God&rsquo;s heading up of all things in Christ as the unique Head is through the church. According to verse 22, God&rsquo;s subjecting all things under Christ&rsquo;s feet and giving Him to be Head over all things is to the church. In verse 10 Christ can head up all things through the church. Without the church, Christ cannot head up all things. In verse 22 Christ is the Head over all things to the church. Therefore, these two verses show that God subjected all things under Christ&rsquo;s authority and gave Him to be Head over all things not only through the church but also to the church. The church is both the means and the aim of God&rsquo;s subjecting all things under the Head, Christ.</p>
<p>God is subjecting all things under the Head, Christ, not only through the church but also to the church, because the church is not only God&rsquo;s vessel but also the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (v. 23). If the subjecting of all things is only through the church but not to the church, the church would merely be a vessel for God&rsquo;s use, just as a light bulb is a vessel for the passing through of electrical current. The Bible says that we are God&rsquo;s vessels (Rom. 9:23-24), but it also says that we are the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23). We are not only vessels; we are also the Body functioning as vessels. The way we treat our physical body is different from the way we treat a vessel. We do not need to care for a vessel&rsquo;s feeling or enjoyment; we can put a vessel anywhere. However, we need to care for the feelings and enjoyment of our physical body and consider the environment in which we live.</p>
<p>Because the church is not only God&rsquo;s vessel but also the Body of Christ, God&rsquo;s subjecting all things under the Head, Christ, is not only through the church but also to the church. In the subjecting of all things, the church has not only a function but also an enjoyment. When the Head rules over all things, the Body rules together with Him. When all things are subjected under the authority of the Head, all things are subjected under the authority of the Body. The Head&rsquo;s heading up of all things is to the Body. God&rsquo;s subjecting all things under the feet of the Head is also to the Body. The Body enjoys and possesses the authority with the Head. When the Head is enthroned, the Body is also enthroned. When the Head rules, the Body also rules. The subjecting of all things is not only through the church but also to the church.</p>
<p>Hence, the Body and the Head are a matter of matching. In order for the Body to rule with the Head, the Body must match the Head. Therefore, we must soberly ask ourselves, &ldquo;Do our situations and conditions match Christ? Are we ruling together with Christ? Are we royal? Do our conduct and activities match Christ the King?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:19 through 22 says that God caused the surpassing greatness of His power to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead, in seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, and in subjecting all things under His feet to make Him Head over all things. However, Hebrews 2:8 says that &ldquo;we do not yet see all things subjected to Him.&rdquo; Why does this verse say that all things are not yet subject to Him? The answer is in verse 10, which says, &ldquo;In leading many sons into glory.&rdquo; All things are not yet subject to Him, because we have not yet entered into glory. According to Romans 8, the whole creation is still groaning and travailing in pain and is not yet subject to the headship of Christ, because the children of God have not yet entered into the freedom of the glory of God (vv. 21-22). In other words, the bride in Revelation 21:2 is not yet prepared or adorned. The bride is the holy city, New Jerusalem, the Body of Christ. When she is ready, that is, when she is clothed in fine linen, bright and clean (19:7-8), God&rsquo;s sons will be brought into glory, and all things will be subjected under Christ&rsquo;s feet. By then all things will be under Christ the Head through us and to us. He will shine forth through us, and we will reign together with Him.</p>
<p>The condition of the church does not yet match the glory of God. Therefore, we do not yet see all things subjected under the authority of Christ. We must let Christ&rsquo;s life work in us daily until we let Christ rule in us. Then all things will be subjected under the authority of Christ, which is to be subjected also under the authority of the church. In the Old Testament Joseph and Daniel let God reign in them. As a result, the Gentiles were subjected under God&rsquo;s authority, which was also to be subjected under the authority of Joseph and Daniel. They brought the Gentiles under God&rsquo;s ruling, and they ruled with God and enjoyed the glory of that ruling (Gen. 41:39-44; Dan. 2:46-48). God was on the throne, and they too were on the throne. God ruled in Babylon through Daniel and to Daniel, and God ruled in Egypt through Joseph and to Joseph. When we let Christ&rsquo;s glorious, royal life live out of us and let God&rsquo;s light shine forth from us, God will gather people to Himself through us and to us. For example, when the elderly Jacob was set before Pharaoh in Egypt, God did things through him and to him. Jacob could stretch out his hand and bless Pharaoh (Gen. 47:7). We may say that Egypt was not only under his hand but also under his feet.</p>
<p>God is the glory of the church and the enjoyment of the church. One day we will see all things under Christ the Head through the church and under the church because of the Head. This will be a glorious day. In principle, we can be saved today to the extent that all things are through us and to us. The key is that we must enter into glory. We do not yet see all things subjected under the feet of the Head, because we, as sons, have not yet entered into glory. When the church is in glory, there will be nothing that is not under the Head and nothing that is not under the church. In order for the church to enter into glory, she must fully let God live forth and let His glory be expressed. When the church fully expresses God&rsquo;s glory, everything will be subject under the feet of the Head and under the church. The church is the Body of the Head, and the Head is Head over all things for His Body and to His Body. This is the ultimate purpose that God wants to achieve and the ultimate standing that the church must obtain. This is great, high, and glorious. For this we bow our heads and worship Him!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">TALKS CONCERNING<br />
THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">NOT FORMING ALLIANCES<br />
WITH OTHER CHRISTIAN GROUPS</h2>
<p><em>Question: I acknowledge that your group is closest to God&rsquo;s will; hence, I am willing to fellowship with your group. However, I also have a work, and I speak with other Christian groups because my commission is to work in alliance with Christians in general. What is your view of my commission, and why does your group not form alliances with other Christian groups?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This matter is related to God&rsquo;s purpose concerning the church on the earth today. It is not easy to explain, because most of God&rsquo;s children do not have revelation concerning God&rsquo;s purpose. However, I would like to briefly mention a few points.</p>
<p>First, according to the revelation in the Scriptures, the proper expression of the church, which God desires to gain in this age and in every place, is entirely different from the present condition of Christianity. In other words, the condition of Christianity is altogether not according to God&rsquo;s intention. According to the biblical revelation, there is and can be only one expression of the church in each locality. This unique expression within a locality is the representation in that locality of the one universal church, and its purpose is to carry out the proper function of the Body of Christ. However, today the condition of Christianity is absolutely not according to God&rsquo;s intention. Hence, we truly hope that we will be able to accomplish this matter for the Lord.</p>
<p>Second, we feel that God raised us up in the Far East, especially among the Chinese-speaking population, for the purpose of gaining the expression of the church that He desires. When we say this word, we are cautious and fearful, because we deeply sense that in uttering such a word, we may seem to be proud. Actually, we realize that we are so small and unworthy that we hardly dare to say such a word; nevertheless, based upon the desire in our heart and the truth, we feel that we must speak this word.</p>
<p>Third, because we have this feeling, for the past thirty years we have been in fear and trembling lest we neglect God&rsquo;s intention. For this reason, although there are many things that other people like to do and have the boldness to do, we dare not do them. This is not due to a desire to show that we are different but because of a forbidding, a fear, and an uneasiness within us that causes us to be unable to adopt the same attitudes and actions as others. On our part, we should never care simply for doing things properly, while ignoring whether or not God even desires these things.</p>
<p>Fourth, many in Christianity who are orthodox in their beliefs and who are zealous for the gospel are promoting alliances and cooperation among believers. Their intention is good, but the nature of these alliances is unavoidably contrary to the oneness of the church. The oneness of the church is the oneness of the believers in Christ and in the Holy Spirit, without the differences of sects. However, the distinction of sects remains in the alliances and cooperation that people are promoting. People are trying to form alliances and cooperate with one another while remaining in their sects. This is a compromise; it is an attempt to shake hands over a wall. This is not the absolute oneness but a hindrance to the genuine oneness of the church. It distorts the testimony of the church and sacrifices the Lord&rsquo;s interest. We feel that this kind of alliance and cooperation is not of the Lord; it is not His desire. We do not want to participate in such alliances in order to maintain the testimony for which the Lord wants us to stand. When we say this, it seems that we are professing to be different and higher than others. However, the fact is that we have no alternative. It is not our intention to profess to be different or higher than others.</p>
<p>Fifth, we feel that what we are doing is not only for ourselves but for all Christians, for the entire Body of Christ. We deeply realize that in this age God needs some to take the lead to follow Him with all their heart so that He can present a testimony that is pure and of a high standard. We dare not say that we are able to do such a thing, but we truly feel that this burden is upon us, constraining us to carry it out. Whether we can accomplish this matter depends upon God&rsquo;s mercy to us and whether we are faithful to Him.</p>
<p>Sixth, we are quite provoked by the past history and present condition of Christianity. Therefore, it is difficult for us to trust the works and activities of Christianity, as well as the organization of its groups. The history of Christianity and the existing practices in Christianity cause us to lose faith in this kind of alliance. Although a good number of its works and activities, as well as the organization of its groups, may appear to be good and pure, if we investigate them further and look at them from other angles, we will see that these works and activities still involve a number of impure factors. As a result, because we believe that the Lord raised us up for the purpose of maintaining a high standard for His testimony, we should not be involved with such impure factors and lower the Lord&rsquo;s standard.</p>
<p>Seventh, due to the above reasons, we do not encourage the brothers and sisters to participate in any work or activity in Christianity or to be involved with any organized Christian group.</p>
<p>Eighth, we confess that our Lord is great and that He is sovereign. Under His sovereignty He can use many saints who have a ground that is different from ours to do a good work for Him. We acknowledge that the Lord uses many, even those in the Catholic Church. This fact is clearly proved by history, and no one can deny it. Even though we strongly criticize the Catholic Church, we do not deny what history has proved. The Lord is so great that even Nebuchadnezzar, a king of Babylon who greatly opposed Him, was His servant and was used by Him.</p>
<p>As those used by the Lord, we need to consider what category we are in. Not all whom the Lord uses are pleasing to Him, and not all of their works are according to His will. Nevertheless, they are under the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty for His interest. Hence, although we do not approve of or encourage the brothers and sisters&rsquo; participation in any work or activity in Christianity or their involvement with any organized Christian group, we do not oppose these groups, because we are afraid that we will damage or hinder the sovereign work that God is doing for Himself.</p>
<p>Ninth, the brothers and sisters&rsquo; attitude toward the work and activity in Christianity, as well as its organized groups, is a matter that we leave entirely up to the brothers and sisters and the leading that they receive from the Lord. We do not approve, encourage, or interfere. We cannot and do not want to control anything.</p>
<p>Tenth, people in Protestantism, especially the missionaries, seem to have an unfair view. In their view, Catholicism should be forsaken and isolated, but Protestantism should not be forsaken or isolated. However, we do not recognize the Catholic Church, and neither do we recognize the Protestant churches. In principle, according to our view, the Protestant churches are no different than the Catholic Church. Although they differ in degree, they are the same in principle. Therefore, in terms of principle, just as we do not want to have any part in Catholicism, we also do not want to have any part in Protestantism.</p>
<p>Today people in Protestantism do not want and will not have a part in Catholicism, but they blame us for not having a part in Protestantism. If people in Protestantism blame us for not participating in or uniting with Protestantism, we must ask them why they refuse to participate in or unite with Catholicism. It is the same in principle. The reason they do not participate in or unite with Catholicism is the very reason that we do not participate in or unite with Protestantism. We cannot do anything in regard to Catholicism, and we also cannot do anything in regard to Protestantism. We only want to walk before the Lord in a humble and simple way according to the enlightenment that we have received.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESULT OF THE WORK</h2>
<p><em>Question: Your intention is good, but is your practice too extreme and unable to accomplish its purposes? If you would change your way slightly and form an alliance with other Christian groups, would your work not have a better result?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Like you, we also fear going to extremes. Hence, we do not make decisions according to our own will, nor do we rely on others&rsquo; opinions; we take only God&rsquo;s Word as the standard. The Word of God is never extreme. We should be faithful to God&rsquo;s enlightenment and not be disobedient to His vision. If we act contrary to what God has shown us, we will have no peace in our conscience. Therefore, we find it very hard to change our way in order to form alliances with other groups.</p>
<p>Although we pay attention to the result of the work, we feel that the Lord wants us to focus on the testimony of His church. We should not emphasize the result of the work and neglect the testimony of the church, nor should we sacrifice the testimony of the church for the result of the work. Many who are zealous and love the Lord pay more attention to the work than to the testimony of the church. Their work saves sinners and edifies the saints, but it also tears down the building of the local churches and damages the testimony of the church. We feel that this is not the Lord&rsquo;s intention or the way that He desires. The Lord&rsquo;s intention is to build up the local churches. His way is for the work to contribute to the testimony of the local churches. We are not saying that we do not care about the propagation of the Lord&rsquo;s work but that we would rather propagate our work according to the Lord&rsquo;s intention and way.</p>
<p>Some people propagate the work on the one hand, but they greatly kill the Lord&rsquo;s work on the other hand. If they were willing to do their work according to the Lord&rsquo;s intention and way, the propagation of their work would be unlimited. For many years we have been learning to care for the Lord&rsquo;s work without deviating from His way and testimony. If the children of God would care for His testimony in their work for the Lord, the result would be unlimited and immeasurable. Man&rsquo;s priority is reversed, his order is confused, and his wisdom and perspective are foolish. When people pay attention only to opportunities for their work and the result of their work, they do not realize that they damage the opportunities for the work and kill the result of the work. When we drop the opportunities and the result of our work for the sake of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, the Lord will give us an opened door that no one can shut. Then the result will be unlimited and immeasurable. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we would rather have the foolishness of God than the wisdom of man (1 Cor. 1:25). If we abandon the testimony that God entrusted to us and join ourselves with others for the sake of opportunities and the result of the work, I do not believe that we would be blessed by the Lord. The results that we have today are all due to stressing the ground of the church and not yielding or compromising regarding this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEANING<br />
OF THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><em>Question: Are you saying that only you are the church and that no one else is the church?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We have never said that only we are the church. Such words are naive and immature. However, we testify that only we are standing on the ground of the church.</p>
<p><em>Question: What is the ground of the church?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The church is universally one, but her local expressions are many. Nevertheless, there should be only one expression in each locality. The ground of this local expression is what we mean by the ground of the church. In the Old Testament Jerusalem was the ground upon which the children of Israel could be God&rsquo;s people. It was where they needed to be. Likewise, the church should be expressed locally on the earth. Just as Jerusalem was the proper ground for the children of Israel, a locality is the proper ground for the church. When the children of Israel were taken captive to Babylon, they left Jerusalem and lost the ground. In the same way, when the church was divided into sects and left the ground of locality, it lost the ground for the expression of the church on the earth.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the church in Jerusalem was expressed on the ground of Jerusalem (Acts 8:1). The church was also expressed in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2), which was the ground for the expression of the church in that locality. If the church in Corinth had later divided into the four different groups, such as the Pauline church, the Petrine church, the Apollonian church, and the church of Christ, then these four groups would have left the local nature of the church and lost the ground of locality, which is the ground of the church. Suppose the people in the Pauline church in Corinth had gone to Samaria and had set up a Pauline church there. If some believers from Jerusalem had later gone to Samaria and found a Pauline &ldquo;church&rdquo; without a local nature, they would begin to meet on the ground of locality. Thus, even though there are two &ldquo;churches&rdquo; in that locality, which one has the proper ground and is on the ground of the church? Surely, the Pauline church does not have the proper ground, whereas the group meeting on the local ground has the proper ground. The ground of the Pauline church is not local but sectarian; hence, it is wrong. Only those who meet on the local ground can express the church, because their ground is local and proper.</p>
<p>According to the example above, the church in Jerusalem was on the ground of the church. The church in Corinth was also on the ground of the church, but when it later divided into four groups, it was on sectarian grounds. The ground of the church is the ground of locality. Various sects have lost the ground of the church because they do not take the ground of locality. They do not stand on the ground of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT STANDING ON THE GROUND<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><em>Question: Are the believers who are not on the ground of the church no longer the church? Are they no longer acceptable?</em></p>
<p>Answer: When the children of Israel were taken captive to Babylon, they left Jerusalem and lost the proper ground, but this does not mean that they were no longer Israelites. It is foolish to say that the children of Israel who were in Babylon were not Israelites. The children of Israel lost the ground of God&rsquo;s people, but they were still God&rsquo;s people. In the same way, many believers are not on the ground of the church, but they are still part of the church.</p>
<p>Although the Israelites in Babylon were God&rsquo;s people, it was not right for them to remain in Babylon. They needed to return to Jerusalem. Those who knew God&rsquo;s will and cared for His intention returned to Jerusalem when the seventy years of their captivity were fulfilled (Dan. 9:2; Ezra 1:3, 5). They might have exhorted each other, saying, &ldquo;As God&rsquo;s people, we should be in Jerusalem instead of Babylon; we should go back.&rdquo; However, some among them might have said, &ldquo;It is not necessary to return. Since we are already God&rsquo;s people, it does not matter whether we are in Babylon or in Jerusalem; all that matters is that we fear God and live before Him. Daniel fears God and lives before Him, but he has remained in Babylon. As long as we are like Daniel, fearing God and living before Him, we can be anywhere. It does not matter whether we are in Babylon or Jerusalem.&rdquo; We cannot justify such teachings, nor can we say that this is right. The fact that Daniel remained in Babylon was something of God&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement for the interest of God&rsquo;s people; moreover, when he was in Babylon, he prayed three times a day toward Jerusalem (Dan. 6:10), praying desperately for God&rsquo;s people to return to Jerusalem (9:16, 20). Therefore, no one can take Daniel&rsquo;s remaining in Babylon as an excuse.</p>
<p>Just as it was wrong for the children of Israel to remain in Babylon, it is also wrong for believers to not stand on the ground of the church. All the Israelites who cared for God&rsquo;s intention returned to Jerusalem. Likewise, all the believers who care for God&rsquo;s intention should return to the ground of the church. Just as the Israelites should not have taken Daniel&rsquo;s remaining in Babylon as an excuse and thus have refused to return to Jerusalem, the believers today should not take spirituality as an excuse and thus refuse to return to the ground of the church. Some believers do not care about the ground; they care only about being spiritual and full of Christ. As long as they are spiritual and full of the stature of Christ, the fullness of Christ, the ground that they are on does not matter to them. These believers say that they do not need to be concerned about whether they are on the ground of the church. We cannot justify or agree with such a view and teaching, nor can we say that this is right. Some spiritual believers are not on the ground of the church. However, because of God&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement, we dare not judge them, just as Daniel was under God&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement. Nevertheless, we can say that no matter how spiritual a person may be, he should return to the ground of the church. If he has to remain somewhere apart from the ground of the church, he should be like Daniel and set his heart toward the God-ordained ground and pray for the ground instead of opposing the ground or discouraging people from returning to the ground.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN<br />
THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH AND<br />
SPIRITUAL CONDITION</h2>
<p><em>Question: Some of the saints who have returned to &ldquo;Jerusalem,&rdquo; that is, to the ground of the church, are not spiritual and strong. However, some of the saints in other Christian groups love the Lord fervently, serve the Lord zealously, and do their best to keep the Lord&rsquo;s word. Are they wrong?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This is indeed true. The spiritual condition of many of who went back to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel was very improper. Some married Gentile women (Neh. 13:23), some were not in one accord (6:17-19), and some were timid (4:10-12). All these conditions were discouraging. Nevertheless, although their condition was poor, the ground they stood upon was right. They were in Jerusalem. Although the condition of Daniel was good, we cannot say that the ground he stood on was right or that he should have stood there. He was not in Jerusalem but in Babylon, a ground that God opposed and cursed. This shows clearly that spiritual condition and the ground of the church are two entirely different matters. It is possible to have one and not the other. God&rsquo;s intention is that we pay attention to both our condition and the ground. Even if someone is as spiritual as Daniel, we cannot say that the ground he is upon does not matter.</p>
<p>Let us consider several people. The first example is Madame Guyon. I am afraid that hardly anyone among us loves the Lord more and has a greater measure of Christ than Madame Guyon. However, we cannot acknowledge that she stood on the proper ground. She was in the Catholic Church, on a ground that we oppose. Her case clearly shows that although a believer may be very spiritual, he may be on an improper ground. He may be right in his spirituality, but the ground on which he stands may be absolutely improper.</p>
<p>Andrew Murray was also a strong and influential saint, but he was in organized Christianity. His ground was organized Christianity, not the genuine church. He was not on the proper ground. Dr. F. B. Meyer was renowned in recent church history, and even T. Austin-Sparks greatly commended him, yet he too was still in organized Christianity. It can be said that his spiritual condition was very proper, but the ground of the church on which he stood was absolutely wrong. We need to completely separate considerations of spiritual condition from the ground of the church. We should not take a person&rsquo;s spiritual condition as the standard for the ground of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH EXISTING BUT LOSING THE GROUND</h2>
<p><em>Question: Was there no church at the time of Madame Guyon, Andrew Murray, or Dr. Meyer?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The church was there, but it had lost the proper ground. Madame Guyon had a strong and influential role in the church, but we must acknowledge that she did not stand on the ground of the church. She stood on the ground of the Roman Catholic Church, not on the proper ground of the church. Similarly, Andrew Murray and Dr. Meyer were strong and influential in the church, but in terms of the ground of the church, they were in organized Christianity. Their ground was organized Christianity, not the genuine ground of the church. They were a part of the church, but they did not stand on the ground of the church.</p>
<p>We are not saying that spirituality is unimportant. We confess that it is basic and important, but merely having this is inadequate. Rather than asking, &ldquo;What are you?&rdquo; we need to ask, &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; Let me use another illustration. A member of a family should live at home. If he goes anywhere else, whether to a place where he feeds hogs and eats carob pods or to a grand and luxurious palace, it is the wrong place. It is insufficient to merely be a member of a family; a member should also live at home. Therefore, it is not a question of who we are but of where we are. It was not a question of whether we are the church but of what ground we are on. Are we on the ground of the Catholic Church or the Protestant churches? Are we on the ground of the various denominations or on the ground of the church? In the case of the children of Israel, it was not a question of whether they were God&rsquo;s people but of where they were. Were they in Babylon or in Jerusalem? Were they in the wilderness of Arabia or in the land of Assyria or Samaria?</p>
<p>We deeply sense that among those who stood up to speak for God in the past several centuries, too many knew only who they were. Hardly anyone who has stood up to speak for God has genuinely asked this one question on God&rsquo;s behalf: &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; Throughout the ages God has recovered much, but there is still one matter that has yet to be recovered, that is, the matter of &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; The recovery of this matter began among us almost thirty years ago. Nevertheless, we must continue to ask, &ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; It is not sufficient merely to do things correctly. We will be right only when we are in the proper place. Sadly, until today, those who are saved by God focus only on what they are, but they neglect, or even greatly oppose, the matter of the ground. Some who have much spiritual knowledge strongly oppose, blame, and condemn us concerning this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A SUBTLE SCHEME OF THE ENEMY</h2>
<p>A subtle scheme of the enemy is to undermine the recovery through men who are very spiritual. This scheme of Satan is able to come in through almost anyone. No one is so spiritual that he cannot be used by Satan to damage the recovery. Satan is able to use any spiritual matter or any matter of faith as a covering. Today, at this critical juncture, we need to consider this matter clearly and carefully. Although what we have encountered and heard may cause us to feel troubled, we cannot let ourselves be easily shaken. In the past thirty years we have paid a great price and suffered innumerable attacks. We have been slandered and reproached many times because of our desire to maintain the ground of the church. But despite this, we should rise up to speak a clearer word concerning the ground of the church. The truth concerning the cross has been recovered and adequately preached, and the truth concerning resurrection has also been clearly and sufficiently preached. However, the matter of the ground of the church has not been adequately preached. This is the result of the enemy&rsquo;s scheme.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TARGET UNDER<br />
THE ENEMY&rsquo;S CONTINUAL ATTACKS</h2>
<p>In spiritual warfare the enemy continually attacks the place where there has been a &ldquo;military deployment.&rdquo; In the past thirty years people have not opposed us for the gospel. Neither are we wrong in regard to the truth. For the past thirty years we have been attacked fiercely, being accused and forsaken by other Christians. All this friction is due to the fact that we stand firmly on the ground of the church. In the past thirty years this has been the very item that the enemy has constantly sought to defeat. We are determined to guard this truth, and we must guard it. Moreover, if the Lord is merciful to us, we need to further strengthen this matter.</p>
<p>Brother T. Austin-Sparks once said that since God was unable to get what He was after in the West, He came to the East. We believe that this principle can also be applied to the matter of the ground of the church. Over the past century the matter of the ground has been damaged by much action, work, and speaking. As a result, people in the West avoid speaking of this matter and consider it a shame to do so. If someone were to ask about it, he would be regarded as being the same as the Brethren. My point is that God has had no way in the West. As a result, He was merciful to us by coming to the East.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S FURTHER RECOVERY</h2>
<p>In the past thirty years it seems that we have not cared for any other matter. At the time of Martin Luther it seemed that he did not care about any matter other than justification by faith, although we know that this is not true and that he did care about other matters. However, the reason people have an inaccurate impression is that Martin Luther emphasized the main point that God was recovering through him. Perhaps he could have discarded all the other points, but God would not let him discard this one point. We deeply sense that God has recovered many things and that He is now recovering the ground of the church. He wants to show us the importance of the ground of the church. We cannot and dare not believe that it is erroneous to say that God wants us to focus on this matter. We believe that the ground of the church is God&rsquo;s further recovery today.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is continually advancing. Through Robert Pearsall Smith the Lord recovered the matter of consecration unto holiness. Following this, through Andrew Murray the Lord recovered the matter of fellowshipping by abiding in Him. Then through Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis He recovered the matter of identification with Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion. Through T. Austin-Sparks the Lord continued and recovered the truth concerning His resurrection. He did not stop at the recovery of the truth concerning resurrection; rather, He advanced to recover the ground of the church. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is according to His purpose for the accomplishing of His economy. Justification by faith, revival, consecration, fellowship by abiding in Christ, and identification with Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion and resurrection are gold, silver, and precious stones. Where should these valuable things be placed? Should they be in Babylon or in Jerusalem? The Lord has recovered the ground of the church in order to uphold the items of gold, silver, and precious stone.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s recovery is wonderful. We believe that God does all things well. The order, the sequence, of the Lord&rsquo;s work of creation is wonderful, and we believe that the order of His work of recovery is also wonderful.</p>
<p>The history of the recovery shows that God first recovered justification by faith. Then He recovered the matter of consecration. After a person is consecrated, there is the need to have fellowship with the Lord and to know the indwelling Christ. The next item is a believer&rsquo;s identification with the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion and resurrection. Then in resurrection the Body of Christ is produced. This Body needs to have a practical expression, an actual appearance, on earth. Where should this expression be? In other words, where should the gold, silver, and precious stones be placed? We cannot say that the gold, silver, and precious stones are the site; they are the building materials. On the day of Pentecost, God established the ground of locality. For example, Jerusalem is a city, and it was the ground of the church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1; 11:22). Moreover, the many cities in Galatia became the ground for the churches in Galatia (Gal. 1:2). One who sees this light should immediately return to the ground ordained by God. God has already presented the ground of locality in the Bible. There is no need for us to look for the ground; we just need to return to it.</p>
<p>The children of Israel built the temple on the site that God designated, but the temple was destroyed by the enemy. The children of Israel were taken captive to various places, and the materials for the temple&mdash;the gold, silver, and precious stones&mdash;were lost. Later some of the children of Israel who were in captivity returned to Jerusalem; similarly, we should return to the ground of the church. Beginning with the recovery of justification by faith through Luther, there has been the recovery of consecration, fellowship by abiding in Christ, and identification with Christ&rsquo;s cross and resurrection. Figuratively speaking, these are the gold, silver, and precious stones that have been recovered for the rebuilding of the temple of God, but where can the temple be built? Will it be built abstractly in the universe? No, it is built practically in various localities. God needs to recover the ground of locality because it has been lost.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GROUND OF LOCALITY</h2>
<p>The return of the children of Israel to Jerusalem typifies the return of God&rsquo;s people to the proper ground of locality. The children of Israel in captivity had to return to Jerusalem. It was wrong for them to stay in Babylon. After they left Babylon, however, it was also improper for them to linger halfway and not fully return to Jerusalem. Similarly, God wants His people to leave the ground of organized Christianity&mdash;Babylon&mdash;and return to the ground of locality&mdash;Jerusalem. Leaving organized Christianity without returning to the ground of locality does not match up to God&rsquo;s intention. This is to linger on the ground of a &ldquo;halfway shelter.&rdquo; God rejects the ground of Babylon and any other ground that does not match the ground of Jerusalem. God rejects not only the ground of organized Christianity but also the ground of a &ldquo;halfway shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many groups have left organized Christianity but have not returned to the ground of locality. Hence, their ground is still wrong and rejected by God. Only one ground is right and accepted by God&mdash;the ground of locality. Only one ground is right&mdash;Jerusalem. The grounds of Babylon, Assyria, and even neighboring Samaria were not right. Likewise, the grounds of the Catholic Church and all the denominations are not right. All grounds other than the local ground are not right.</p>
<p>The matter of the ground is serious. If the children of Israel had built a temple in Babylon with the same materials that they used to build the temple in Jerusalem, they would have been completely wrong. Such a mistake would have been due not to the materials or the work but to the ground. This clearly proves that besides the matter of spirituality, there is still the matter of the ground. Both the ground and spirituality are necessary and indispensable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A GREAT RESTRICTION</h2>
<p>When I began to serve the Lord over thirty years ago, I had doubts concerning Christianity. I saw in the Bible that the condition of Christianity was altogether improper. I also saw that the ground of Christianity was improper. The improper condition is an outward matter, but the improper ground is a deeper matter. Actually, it is the source of almost every problem in Christianity. The confusion and errors of Christianity are mostly due to the improper ground. For example, the church has become very worldly and very much according to the human will. Although this is a matter of condition, the condition is the result of an improper ground. The proper ground of the church is locality. If the believers all kept the ground of locality, the many denominations that exist today would no longer exist or be produced. The ground of locality requires that the believers pay the highest price, the price of being dealt with in their flesh and in their natural life.</p>
<p>Today there are many Christian groups because people are not willing to be restricted by locality. Many groups have appealing names, but these are only an expression of man&rsquo;s desire. It may seem that these groups are only declaring that they love the Lord, are zealous for the Lord, preach the gospel, and are accomplishing a certain work. However, their organization becomes a support and a symbol of man acting according to his own will. If everyone saw that the expression of the church should be local and that it must be restricted by the local ground, all these groups would no longer exist. Regardless of how good a person may be, he should be in a local church. Regardless of how spiritual he may be or how strong his desire to save sinners may be, he should be in a local church. Regardless of how good his work, motive, intent, and result are, he should not establish a group apart from the ground of the church. If he dares to establish a group apart from the ground of locality, the attitude that &ldquo;having separate groups is acceptable&rdquo; becomes his covering. A person who has the boldness to use such a covering has not seen the ground of the church. If he sees that everything related to the church must be on the ground of locality, he will not dare to establish a group apart from the ground of locality. Thus, all the groups and activities that are according to man&rsquo;s will cannot receive God&rsquo;s covering, because they are restricted by the local ground of the church.</p>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s goal today is to annul the ground of locality in order to give people absolute freedom of action as a pretext to establish denominations. The only thing that can nullify this is the ground of the church. Once we speak concerning the ground of locality, no one has an excuse for doing whatever he desires. The ground of locality is a great restriction to our flesh, our private intentions, and our natural man.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">TALKS CONCERNING<br />
THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">AN INACCURATE CONCEPT</h2>
<p><em>Question: By paying attention to the ground of the church, are we making Christ a small Christ, a local Christ, and are we making the church only a small church, only a local church?</em></p>
<p>Answer: By paying attention to the ground of the church, we are not making Christ a small Christ, a local Christ, nor are we making the church only a small church, only a local church. Within the denominations, even in the Catholic Church, there are many Christians, who have the life of Christ and who belong to the church. Nevertheless, the ground upon which they stand is not the ground of the church but the ground of sects and denominations. However, since a Christian belongs to the church, he should return to the ground of the church. If he does not return to the ground of the church, he is standing on an improper ground even though he belongs to the church.</p>
<p><em>Question: By paying attention to the ground of the church, will we lose Christ as our center and become detached from Christ? Will we also become narrow-minded and thus limit the move of the Lord?</em></p>
<p>Answer: By paying attention to the ground of the church, we are taking Christ as our center and also taking care of God&rsquo;s purpose; we are not detached from Christ. Paying attention to this ground makes Christ as our center a reality, and it also meets the need for Christ to be our center. Furthermore, when we pay attention to the ground of the church, we are caring for the intention in God&rsquo;s heart; we are not being narrow-minded or limiting the move of the Lord. Paying attention to the ground of the church does not limit the Lord&rsquo;s work; rather, it becomes a great limitation to man&rsquo;s naturalness and flesh. Any kind of correction is a great restriction and limitation to man. The truth concerning the ground of the church strongly corrects the various situations within Christianity today. It restricts many human actions. Following what is revealed in the Lord&rsquo;s Word can never limit His move or work.</p>
<p>If all of God&rsquo;s children came to the local ground, God&rsquo;s work would spread extensively. We do not mean that God works only on the ground of locality. Rather, as we have said repeatedly, God works on many different grounds. He has carried out a considerable amount of work even in the Catholic Church, which is full of fornication and idolatry. Nevertheless, the Lord&rsquo;s intention is that those who have been worked on by Him would return to the ground of locality so that He may gain a group of people for His pure testimony. This is not to limit the Lord or to be narrow-minded. After the children of Israel were taken captive, not all of them returned to Jerusalem. Some wanted to stay in Babylon. However, through His prophets God repeatedly urged His people to go back to Jerusalem, the original ground (Ezra 1:1-3; Neh. 7:5-6; Ezek. 34:13; 36:24). This was not narrow-minded or limiting. We acknowledge that the Lord works in the various Christian groups; however, many children of God are scattered on different grounds.</p>
<p><em>Question: There have been many spiritual men who neither stood on the ground of the church nor paid attention to this matter, but they were greatly blessed by the Lord and had His presence. Should we pay attention to these ones?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The age of the church is the age of grace. In this age God gives grace freely. As long as someone affords Him a little opportunity, He will give grace to that person. Hence, receiving grace is only relative; it is not absolute. Therefore, we cannot conclude that a person or a group of people who have been blessed have no problem before God, nor can we take their condition as a standard. Some in the Catholic Church have been greatly blessed. However, we cannot take the condition of the Catholic Church as our standard. This also applies to the ground of the church.</p>
<p>Furthermore, beginning in the age of Martin Luther, God has been moving forward in His recovery. Those who take the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery can measure those who took the way before them. This is because the Lord has gone further in them. However, those who took the way earlier cannot measure those who come after them according to the standard of their age, because such a measurement would be short. The Lord has never stopped with any one person but has advanced to others. For example, Mrs. Penn-Lewis could measure Andrew Murray, who was before her, in regard to identification with Christ&rsquo;s death, which was recovered through her. However, she could not use what was recovered through her to measure T. Austin-Sparks, who came after her, because the Lord advanced further to recover the matter of resurrection through Brother Sparks. Therefore, we cannot use what God recovered in the past as a standard to measure His present recovery. To do so would be inaccurate and unfair.</p>
<p>We accept all the correct and scriptural revelations that have been recovered through the past two thousand years, regardless of whom these things came from. However, we say no to everything that is not good or proper related to these things. We want the spiritual things from Madame Guyon, but we refuse to take her ground, the ground of the Catholic Church. We want the spiritual things from Mrs. Penn-Lewis, but we refuse her inaccurate expositions. Likewise, from a spiritual person, we can accept only what is spiritual, not what is murky. We are not biased. We accept everything that is right and proper that has been recovered throughout the past two thousand years, regardless of whom it came from. If the ground of the church was ordained by God originally, it must be what God desires to recover today. We cannot accept anything that makes this matter murky. We believe that God is recovering the truth concerning the ground of the church. However, quite a number of spiritual ones are not clear regarding this.</p>
<p><em>Question: Paying attention to the ground of the church easily provokes opposition. Should we avoid speaking about the ground of the church?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We should not avoid speaking the truth concerning the ground of the church simply because we fear that people will not understand and may even despise this truth. The teaching of the New Testament shows that the Lord Jesus and His disciples&rsquo; attitude and preaching were definite and clear and that they never avoided speaking something for fear of men&rsquo;s lack of understanding or disagreement. In the same way, we should vindicate what is right and condemn what is wrong. For example, when Paul saw Peter&rsquo;s hypocrisy, he was afraid that this would bring confusion into the gospel and thus opposed Peter to his face (Gal. 2:11-14). Our environment is very similar to that of Paul. Because the truth of the ground of the church is not sufficiently clear, there is confusion today. Although other people can ignore this truth, we cannot. We have no choice but to speak unreservedly until people understand and see that this is a truth in the Bible. We should never speak ambiguously in order to please people or consider that if they do not understand or accept the truth, we should speak the truth only behind closed doors. We should not be like this. Rather, we need to specifically underscore the truth that believers most urgently need to see today, that is, that the expression of the church is local and that any work apart from the local ground tears down God&rsquo;s building.</p><h2 class="head1">HAVING FELLOWSHIP WITH OR<br />
DOING A WORK ON OTHER GROUNDS</h2>
<p><em>Question: According to the truth that we preach, if we return to the local ground of the church in order to worship and serve together, should we have absolutely no contact or fellowship with the believers on other grounds and no union with them in their work?</em></p>
<p>Answer: With regard to this question, we need to answer it according to two aspects. The first aspect is concerning fellowship. If you fellowship in the Lord with individual saints, it is absolutely proper and acceptable; however, if you have any involvement with a work or organization that is not on the ground, we believe that such involvement is wrong. The second aspect is concerning the work. We have had much consideration concerning whether we should work or preach on a different ground. Both Daniel and Ezekiel were prophets in the land of captivity. They were not in Jerusalem but in the land of captivity. Nevertheless, both had a ministry raised up by God. Hence, we need to ask, &ldquo;What was their ministry?&rdquo; As prophets doing the work of God, they told the people that Babylon was not the proper place and that, as God&rsquo;s people, they should return to Jerusalem (cf. Ezek. 34:13; 39:25, 28; Dan. 9:2-27).</p>
<p>According to this principle, when we go to preach on a different ground, our basic attitude should be, &ldquo;I come here to speak Christ and the word of God to you, but you are on a ground that is not proper and is condemned by God. You should return to Jerusalem.&rdquo; If your preaching is a different kind of preaching that strengthens and solidifies their ground, not only will we say that this is not right, but everyone else will also say that this is not right. In the end, we can only say that the matter of serving on a different ground is something that should be decided by each person according to his own conscience; this is altogether a matter of a person&rsquo;s enlightenment. Some people have a conscience enlightened to the extent that they dare not and cannot do a work on a different ground; hence, we do not want to control. Rather, each one should live before the Lord with a pure conscience and according to the light that he has received. In seeking fellowship, no one should have a definite opinion or preconception, claiming that our refusal to interact and work with other Christian groups is sectarian and wrong. This kind of speaking is wild and rough. We should allow every believer the freedom to walk before God with a pure conscience.</p>
<p><em>Question: If a person breaks bread with you and is thus in fellowship with you, can he do a work among you?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Our Lord&rsquo;s table is absolutely open. We do not refuse any saved one who wants to break bread with us&mdash;regardless of his background, the ground he stands on, or his current involvements. We must receive and break bread with anyone whom God has received, that is, every believer, unless he has committed a gross sin that God condemns. Nevertheless, we feel that since the Lord has commissioned and raised us up to bear a particular testimony, we cannot open the responsibility for the ground to everyone. Only those who are willing to bear the same testimony can bear responsibility among us. A believer can break bread with us, but he cannot participate in the responsibility, because this is related to the testimony of the church. If we make the Lord&rsquo;s table and the matter of receiving the believers narrow, then we have become an exclusive sect. This is something that we cannot do. The Lord&rsquo;s table is for all children of the Lord. Nevertheless, since the Lord has commissioned and raised us up to bear a particular testimony in this age, we cannot carelessly open the responsibility for the ground to everyone.</p>
<p>Partaking of the Lord&rsquo;s table is one thing, whereas bearing responsibility within the church is another thing. If people condemn us, saying that we are an exclusive sect because we do not allow others to bear responsibility for the church, this is a word of slander. The Lord&rsquo;s table is open, but we cannot open the responsibility for the ground to everyone or allow everyone to do whatever he wants.</p>
<p>Regardless of the kind of view a brother holds, he may come and break bread with us. If he wants to do any kind of work apart from us, we will not interfere, because that is his personal business. However, if another comes and breaks bread with us, while openly or secretly doing another kind of work among us, we cannot agree with that.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FACTORS OF OUR BLESSING</h2>
<p>In every locality the Lord has blessed us because of three factors: first, we emphasize spirituality; second, we pay attention to the ground of the church; third, we emphasize coordination. The second item, the ground of the church, entirely upholds the first and the third items. If we were to take away the ground of the church, I am afraid that we would not have any blessing. Without the ground, although we may be spiritual, our spirituality will not serve any practical purpose. Also, without the ground there can be no practical expression of coordination. I would like to ask those who pay much attention to spirituality how much coordination they have in reality. This is the reason that they repeatedly give messages that are accurate and spiritual but do not see much result. This can be likened to a person who draws water from a well but does not have a vessel to contain the water; hence, it is continually poured out upon the ground. The reason the water cannot be preserved but instead ends up on the ground is that there is no vessel to contain it. Since we pay attention to the ground of the church, we are able to retain the small amount of blessing that God has given us. If we were to give up the ground of the church, we would be like a broken &ldquo;teapot&rdquo; and the &ldquo;tea&rdquo; would completely escape. If the ground of the church is the truth, we cannot give it up. Rather, we should hold it in a balanced way. Spirituality is important, and the fullness of Christ is central; however, we cannot give up the ground of the church and just focus on spirituality and the fullness of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR GROUND, OUR PRACTICE, AND OUR ATTITUDE</h2>
<p><em>Question: What are you?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is better to answer this question according to three aspects: our ground, our practice, and our attitude. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, I will list several items with each aspect.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Ground</h2>
<p>1. We are neither the Roman Catholic Church nor a Protestant church.</p>
<p>2. We are neither the so-called &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; nor &ldquo;open&rdquo; Brethren.</p>
<p>3. We are not a small free group that has left the Catholic Church or the Protestant churches, which do not have the proper ground.</p>
<p>4. We are not another sect or denomination.</p>
<p>5. We are simply a group of believers who are saved by grace, have left and reject Christian organizations and free groups, and have returned to the ground of the church to meet together, worship God, and serve the Lord.</p>
<p>6. The New Testament clearly reveals that the ground of the church is local. It is the ground of oneness in every locality. Hence, our returning to the ground of the church is our returning to the ground of oneness in every locality.</p>
<p>7. We do not stand on any ground of organized Christianity, which is a divisive ground, nor do we linger on any free grounds, which are scattered grounds. We have returned to the original ground of the church, which is the ground of oneness. According to Old Testament typology, we do not remain in Babylon or anywhere between Babylon and Jerusalem; we have returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>8. We do not consider only ourselves to be &ldquo;the local church&rdquo; in a locality. Rather, we acknowledge that we are a part of the local church in a particular locality. We are standing on the ground of the local church in every place, which is the ground of the oneness of the church. We are also coordinating in service according to the principle and nature of the local church in order to have the proper living of the Body of Christ and to manifest the life of Christ for the testimony of the church.</p>
<p>9. We do not belong to any Christian organization or denomination, nor are we involved with any Christian organization or denomination. We are simply believers outside of any sect or denomination, and we are standing on the ground of the oneness of the church in every place as the Lord&rsquo;s testimony of the church.</p>
<p>10. We do not have any designation. &ldquo;Church Assembly Hall&rdquo; is merely the way we identify the place where we meet; it is not our designation. Therefore, it is wrong for others to call us the brothers and sisters of the &ldquo;Assembly Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>11. We do not have a special creed. Except for the one faith by which we are saved (Eph. 4:5), we do not consider any truth, or any interpretation of the truth, to be our creed.</p>
<p>12. We do not have a special fellowship. Our fellowship includes all the believers who have been redeemed by the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood and have the life of God, regardless of the Christian group that they belong to or what view that they hold concerning the truth.</p>
<p>13. We serve the Lord on the ground of locality in every place, but we are not isolated from one another; we are not without the universal fellowship. We fellowship with all the believers who stand on the ground of the church in every place.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Practice</h2>
<p>1. We emphasize the testimony of the reality of the church as well as the ground of the practicality of the church. We have the outward ground of the practicality of the church to match the inward testimony of the reality of the church, just as the Israelites in the Old Testament had the outward Tent of Meeting to match the inward Ark (Exo. 40:1-3, 34).</p>
<p>2. We do not want to set up &ldquo;our meeting&rdquo; in every place; rather, we would like to meet and serve the Lord on the ground of the oneness of the church with all those who have forsaken the denominations and sects.</p>
<p>3. We would like to have fellowship with all the brothers and sisters in the denominations and in the Catholic Church, but we will not participate in any denomination, sect, or organized group that is outside of the ground of the local church, the ground of oneness.</p>
<p>4. We accept different views as long as they do not compromise the faith of salvation. However, we cannot tolerate division.</p>
<p>5. We are willing to meet and serve the Lord on the ground of the oneness of the church with any group of believers who are willing to not be divided or to stop their division, regardless of what views they may hold.</p>
<p>6. We receive all believers, including the saved ones in the Catholic Church, who have different opinions but are not involved in any sin that God condemns.</p>
<p>7. We let the Holy Spirit bear responsibility for spiritual fellowship. We have received some believers who may still have problems with the Lord in their spiritual fellowship. We cannot take responsibility for this. Only the Holy Spirit can be responsible. We can only receive them according to their status of being saved. Only the Holy Spirit can be responsible for their fellowship with the Lord in the spirit and their being in the fellowship of the Body. On the one hand, we receive them; on the other hand, we let the Holy Spirit take responsibility for their spiritual fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Attitude</h2>
<p>1. We do not recognize the Roman Catholic Church or the Protestant churches.</p>
<p>2. We acknowledge that those who are saved in the denominations and sects, including in the Catholic Church, are our brothers and sisters in the Lord and are members of the Body of Christ, even though they have lost the ground of the church. They are part of the church, but they are not on the proper ground of the church. Those who know the truth cannot acknowledge the ground of the Catholic Church as the ground of the church, even though there are indeed saved ones in the Catholic Church who are godly, love the Lord, and are spiritual. Similarly, there are many saved and spiritual ones in the Protestant churches, but their ground is not proper.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FINAL WORD</h2>
<p>The intention of this fellowship is to help the seeking ones understand the ground of the church; we have no intention to argue with anyone. We are open to criticism, but we do not like to argue. We would rather present what we consider as proper to the seeking believers in a straightforward way without hiding anything. Please forgive us for the frankness and bluntness of our words. What we can do is truly limited. May the Lord have mercy and pour out His blessing.</p></body></html>
