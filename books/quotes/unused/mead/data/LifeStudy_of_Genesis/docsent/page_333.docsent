   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 Slumbering and Sleeping</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Lot became drunk, he slumbered and slept.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The same condition prevails among the free groups today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning the testimony of God, the leaders are slumbering and sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They may be very active in the things which they are pursuing, but they are asleep as far as God's testimony is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>3 Being Befuddled</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, Lot was befuddled, having lost the sense of life 19:33b, 35b .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the first daughter came in to lie with him, "he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The same occurred with the second daughter the next night.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What sin can surpass this?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He even had no sense about his daughters' lying with him!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The leaders of many free groups today have also lost the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are not aware of the violation of some of the governing principles ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>c The Mother the Helper in Life</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have seen that the mother, who, as the wife, should have been the helper in life, became a pillar of salt because of her worldliness 19:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Lot's family came into the cave, there was no function of life, for there was no function of the proper wife.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As a result, they turned to incest, using such a sinful thing to replace the lost function of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is also the situation among many so-called Christian groups.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They have lost the function of the Body of Christ, the proper function of life, and use worldly methods to fill the gap.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Like Lot's group, they cannot produce the proper "Isaac" for the fulfilling of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because they use incest to secure seed, they produce "Moabites" and "Ammonites."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>d The Daughters the Members</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have seen that the leader was drugged and befuddled and that the function of life was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the daughters, the members of this free group, still wanted to bear fruit and have the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although they had neither the proper leadership nor the function of life, they had an evil way of acquiring the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The same is true among many free groups today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to bear fruit, we should live by Christ, live out Christ, pray, and help people to receive the living word of God so that they might be reborn.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the way to bring forth the proper fruit to be the "Isaac" for the fulfilling of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But look at today's situation: some groups use rock music, dancing, drama, movies, and games to satisfy their desire of securing the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the eyes of God, this is spiritual incest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The free groups adopt these methods because the wife, being worldly, has lost her function.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the churches we need the function of life to produce seed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once people have lost the proper wife with the function in life, they use ugly and worldly means for securing the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the way of "incest" which brings forth "Moabites" and "Ammonites."</S>
