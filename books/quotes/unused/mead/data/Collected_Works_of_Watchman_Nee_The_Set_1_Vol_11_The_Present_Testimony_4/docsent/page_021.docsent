   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PREPARATION MESSAGES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE THIRD OVERCOMER CONFERENCE 2 THE HIDDEN LIFE Scripture Reading: S.S. 4:12; Hosea 14:5-7; Mark 4:5-6, 16-17 A Shallow Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Mark 4 speaks of the condition of man's heart and how it receives the word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It does not apply only to sinners hearing the gospel, but also to believers receiving the word of edification.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the kind of life that pleases the Lord and lasts long?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why have some failed or turned back halfway?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why are there so few who have followed the Lord all the way?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some people are very willing at the beginning to give up everything to consecrate themselves fully to the Lord and to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But when they encounter something along the way which is contrary to their will, they decide not to follow the Lord anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you have never been dealt with by the Lord or have not fully consecrated yourself, the day will come when the Lord will take you to a place where you do not want to go, and you will reject His choice.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The price will be too high for you, and you will find that you cannot pay it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why you must be dealt with by the Lord until you are fully consecrated to take up the cross to follow Him all the way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the ones who turned back or failed halfway are the ones with the shallow ground.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"It sprang up" Mark 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This refers to those who have received the word and made a start outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the result is not good because there is no root; when the sun rises, it is scorched and withers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every word brings with it affliction and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God prepares circumstances behind every word of His to test if we have received His word properly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The sun is the ultimate sign of the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The cross not only separates the sinners as to who are saved and who are perishing; it also separates the believers as to who are the overcoming ones and who are the defeated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Spiritual dryness comes because one argues with God and defeats Him by allowing himself to win.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Miss Barber once said, "All the bread that is in the Lord's hand, He will surely break."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many times we put ourselves in the Lord's hand, while at the same time we pray privately, "Please do not break me!"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why do the ones on the rocky place, who spring up quickly, also wither quickly?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, they have "no depth of earth" v. 5 . All those who live in their environment or their emotions are those who are in shallow earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who are deep live above their circumstances; they deny their feelings and live in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They receive God's supply, support, and power beyond their environments.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, they are without root.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who have life in an outward way are like the plant stalk, but those with life in an inward way are like the roots.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Roots denote a hidden and secret life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord says that we have to shut the door and pray in secret Matt 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God will see us, not hear us, in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The most dangerous life is one that is only before men.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The safest life is one that is before God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who have been dealt with by God in secret, who have deep roots, will overcome all affliction and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Third, there are rocks under the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the surface, one place is the same as all other places.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But underneath, it is different; there are rocks underneath.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>1 The rocks are the hardened heart Heb 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we want to hear the Lord's word, we cannot harden our hearts or have our own prejudices.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those whose self is still hidden within them and who have not been broken by the Lord cannot have deep roots.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>2 The rocks are also hidden sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As long as these sins have not been removed, the roots cannot go down deep.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only those who tremble at God's word and are feeble as little children will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord has to smash all the hardened hearts and human prejudices.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He can ride on a colt that has never been sat on before, and he can deal with those who have never obeyed Him before.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A Life in the Depth</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hosea 14:5-7 mentions Lebanon three times: 1 the lily in contrast to Lebanon, 2 the olive tree in contrast to Lebanon, and 3 the vine in contrast to Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the whole world, the trees with the deepest roots are the cedars of Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should go down and take root in the depths; we should direct our growth to the depths.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although the lily looks pretty, it grows in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are the lily in the valley, not in the pot.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are not cared for by the gardener but by God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We do not receive any supply from men but from God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The rain from heaven is watering us, and we are sustained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The beauty of the olive tree is not in its flower but in the oil-bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should bring forth the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The flower of the vine is very small.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Before a man can discover it, it has turned into grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The flowers are for fruitbearing, not for beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A Hidden Life</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Song of Solomon 4:12 mentions "a garden inclosed."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is a garden, not a park.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is enclosed, not open.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Within the garden are fruits and flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The things we have which are for the Lord alone should be enclosed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All the things we have within us should be for the Lord alone.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As such, they should be enclosed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>"A spring shut up, a fountain sealed."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the Chinese Union Version, spring is translated well.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A well is something man-made, while a fountain is something natural.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A well is there to serve man, while a fountain is there to receive from God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The well is directed toward men, while a fountain is directed toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although we are directed toward men and are for men's use, we are "shut up," and we wait for the Lord to open us and use us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although we are directed toward God and are here to receive from God, we are "sealed."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should be closed to both God and men.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should allow the cross to do a deeper work in us and deal with our self, so that we can have a deeper life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should maintain a hidden life before God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Afternoon, January 22</S>
