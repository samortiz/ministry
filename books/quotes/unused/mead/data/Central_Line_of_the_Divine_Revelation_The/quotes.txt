[1]  CONTENTS God 1 God 2 The Divine Economy The Divine Dispensing God's Creation of Man in the View of the Divine
[2]  Although Christ's crucifixion and His second appearing clear up the universe, the old nature of the old creation will still remain.
[3]  Then there is a need of a burning through which the old heavens and old earth will become new.
[4]  The new heaven and new earth are produced through a baptism, not of water but of fire 2 Pet 3:7, 10, 12-13 .
[5]  THE DIVINE TITLES OF GOD A. Among the Many Titles for God
[6]  This means that He does not have a beginning or an ending.
[7]  A circle is a good illustration of eternity, since in appearance it does not have a beginning or an ending.
[8]  At a certain place on the circle, we may place a cross signifying the crucifixion of Christ.
[9]  Adonai, in Hebrew, denotes Master Gen 15:2, 8; Exo 4:10; cf.
[10]  Another divine title used in the New Testament is Father.
[11]  Father, in Greek Pater, denotes that God as the Father is the origin, the source, of all the families of God's creatures Eph 3:15 .
[12]  Christ, in Greek Christos Matt 1:16b , equals Messiah in Hebrew John 1:41; Dan 9:26 .
[13]  To be anointed means to be appointed by God to be His Christ, to be His anointed One, for the accomplishing of His eternal economy Luke 4:18-19 .
[14]  In this message, we come to the hardest point in the Bible the person of God.
[15]  In a sense, it is not very difficult to know the names of God, the titles of God.
[16]  The Spirit is the flow of the Trinity, the realization of the Son for His reaching and entering into His believers John 7:38-39; Rev 22:1; John 14:16-20 .
[17]  The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow.
[18]  The Son is the embodiment of the Father for the Father's expression.
[19]  Then the Spirit is the realization of the Son for the Son to reach us and enter into us.
[20]  The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit.
[21]  Now the Spirit reaches us and enters into us.
[22]  The Spirit of God was there from the very beginning Gen 1:1-2 , but the Spirit as the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , was not yet at the time the Lord spoke this word, because He was not yet glorified.
[23]  He lived on earth in this humanity for thirty years, and He worked and ministered for another three and a half years.
[24]  In Exodus 30 the compound ointment is a wonderful type of the compound Spirit.
[25]  Oil is a single element, but an ointment is a compounded entity.
[26]  The compound ointment has the olive oil as a base, and this olive oil is compounded with four kinds of spices: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia.
[27]  In these messages we are burdened to see the central line of the divine revelation.
[28]  The intention of God's economy is to dispense Himself into His chosen people, making Himself one with them.
[29]  The Bible reveals that God dwells within His chosen people and that He desires to make Himself fully one with them.
[30]  God's intention in His economy is also to dispense Christ with all His riches to His believers chosen by God for the constitution of the Body of Christ, the church, to express the processed Triune God Eph 3:8-10 .
[31]  In the previous message, we saw that the divine economy is the issue of God's will, purpose, good pleasure, and counsel; hence, God's will, purpose, good pleasure, and counsel are all for the divine dispensing.
[32]  The divine element, of which the believers in Christ are made God's excellent inheritance, is dispensed into the believers through God the Son's redemption unto God's economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ Eph 1:7-10 .
[33]  Third, the divine essence, of which the believers in Christ enjoy the processed Triune God, is being dispensed into us through God the Spirit's sealing and pledging Eph 1:13-14 .
[34]  In eternity the Triune God must have held a council and made a counsel concerning the creation of man Gen 1:26a; Eph 1:11b .
[35]  Man was created by the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit Matt 28:19 .
[36]  Man was created not only in the inward image of the Triune God but also after Their outward likeness.
[37]  This likeness is the form of God's being Phil 2:6 , the expression of the essence and nature of God's person Heb 1:3 .
[38]  Christ existed in the form of God, that is, in the likeness of God.
[39]  He laid aside the form of God, but He did not lay aside the essence of God.
[40]  A Body, Formed with the Dust of the Ground,
[41]  Over the past years, it has been difficult for me to understand what the image of God is.
[42]  Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the image of the invisible God.
[43]  According to the Bible, we Christians now have two different inner men Rom 7:22; 2 Cor 4:16 .
[44]  In Romans 7:22 Paul said, "For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man."
[45]  B. With a River, Signifying the Flow of God
[46]  After this, God caused all the living creatures that He had created to pass before Adam to see what he would call them.
[47]  However, Adam could not find one that matched him vv.
[48]  In making man, God formed a piece of clay to be man's body, breathed the breath of life into it, and caused it to become a living soul.
[49]  In creating man, God used clay to form man's body as his outward, physical organ with the physical consciousness to contact the physical world.
[50]  Then God breathed His breath of life into that body, and this breath became man's inward organ, his spirit.
[51]  God's breath is not God Himself, but it is very close to God.
[52]  God's inheritance is the New Jerusalem, and eventually, we as the precious stones will be built together to become His inheritance.
[53]  GOD'S ANTICIPATED REDEMPTION AND SALVATION 1 Scripture Reading: Gen 3:15; Isa 7:14; Matt 1:16; Gal 4:4; John 1:1, 14; Matt 1:23; Heb 2:14; Matt 1:20-21; 1 Cor 15:53-57; Gen 17:8; Gal 3:16; Matt 1:1-2a, 6; Gen 12:3; Gal 3:14; John 14:17-20; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rom 8:9; Acts 26:18; Eph 1:14a; 2 Sam 7:12-14a; Matt 22:42-45; Rom 1:3; Rev 22:16; Acts 2:30-31; Matt 16:16-18; Acts 13:32-35; Isa 55:3-4; 2 Tim 2:12; Rev 20:4, 6 THE FOUR AGES
[54]  The creation of the universe was the beginning of the creation of life.
[55]  Genesis 1 is a record of the creation of life.
[56]  In Genesis 1 the Spirit came in and began to do many marvelous things.
[57]  The first point in the record of life in the Bible is man's creation, and the second point is man's fall Gen 3:1-6 .
[58]  When man fell, God came immediately to give man the promise of the seed of woman v. 15 . After Adam and Eve sinned, they were afraid of God v. 10 and tried their best to cover themselves v. 7 . So God called to Adam and said, "Where are you?" v. 9, NASB . This was the first sentence spoken by the creating God to the fallen man.
[59]  Eventually, God found Adam and Eve and had a gospel visit with them.
[60]  First, God questioned Adam concerning whether or not he had eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil v. 11 . Adam answered, "The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat" v. 12 . Adam blamed God for giving the woman to him.
[61]  The period from Adam to the present time is approximately six thousand years.
[62]  This period can be divided into three sections of approximately two thousand years each: from Adam to Abraham, from Abraham to Christ, and from Christ to our present time.
[63]  A. In the Promise of the Seed of the Woman
[64]  Today in the heavens He is still a man.
[65]  The subject of Hymns, #62 is Christ's humanity, and the fourth stanza of this hymn indicates that in the heavens Christ is still a man:
[66]  B. In the Promise of the Seed of Abraham
[67]  In the beginning, God created man in His own image and after His own likeness.
[68]  The Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God for the dispensing of Himself into the believers of Christ is the seed of Abraham 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rom 8:9 .
[69]  The divine economy and the divine dispensing are also seen in the promise of the seed of David 2 Sam 7:12-14a; Matt 1:1, 6; 22:42-45; Rom 1:3; Rev 22:16 .
[70]  The seed of David refers to the resurrected Christ, who carries out God's New Testament economy for the dispensing of the processed Triune God into the members of His Body Acts 2:30-31; Matt 16:16-18 .
[71]  The resurrected Christ is God's sure mercies, of which Christ is the center and reality, shown to David through his descendant Mary, the mother of Christ Matt 1:16 , for the dispensing of God Himself into all the believers of Christ in His resurrection Acts 13:32-35; Isa 55:3-4 .
[72]  AND THE DIVINE DISPENSING MESSAGE NINE A COMPLEMENTING WORD ON CHRIST
[73]  INCARNATION BEING THE DISPENSING OF GOD HIMSELF INTO HUMANITY
[74]  Christ's being the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David strongly implies the dispensing of God Himself into man.
[75]  The seed of the woman Gen 3:15 refers to the incarnation of Christ.
[76]  Isaiah 7:14 confirms the promise in Genesis 3:15, and the birth of Christ in Matthew 1:22-23 and 25 was the fulfillment of Isaiah 7:14.
[77]  In that divine conference the Triune God made a counsel, and this counsel became His economy.
[78]  The third item of God's positive intention in His economy is to be received by man as man's life for his inward constitution that man may become the counterpart of the Triune God Gen 2:8-9, 22-24 .
[79]  THE NEGATIVE NEED CAUSED BY MAN'S FALL THROUGH THE TEMPTATION
[80]  Christ as the seed of Abraham, the last Adam, the God-man, has become the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, the consummated and indwelling Spirit, the divine Spirit processed and compounded with Christ's humanity, His death and its effectiveness, and His resurrection and its power, the unique and all-inclusive Spirit, the Spirit as the aggregate of the blessing of the full gospel of God in Christ , to impart Himself as God's embodiment and life into us that we may be regenerated and transformed and conformed to the glorious image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 8:9b, 11; Rev 22:17a; John 3:5-6; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rom 8:29 .
[81]  The first man, Adam, was not a God-man.
[82]  But the last Adam was a God-man, a man wrapped up with the element of God.
[83]  As the last Adam, Christ died and resurrected, and through death and resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .
[84]  It is significant that Paul inserted the adjective life-giving before the word Spirit.
[85]  Since life is God Himself embodied in Christ, this life-imparting Spirit is also the God-giving, or God-imparting, Spirit, the Spirit who imparts God into us.
[86]  Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Savior, has become a Spirit who gives life, a Spirit who imparts God.
[87]  The eight items of blessing, including the last Adam, the God-man, the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, the consummated and indwelling Spirit, the divine Spirit, the unique and all-inclusive Spirit, and the Spirit, are all wrapped up with Christ as the seed of Abraham.
[88]  Christ as the seed of David, the king anointed by God, was begotten through His resurrection to be the Prince the King in His humanity that we may share His kingship for God's administration Luke 1:31-32; Acts 13:33-34; 5:30b-31a; 2 Tim 2:12a; Rev 20:4, 6 .
[89]  Third, we must live Him as the pneumatic Christ by the bountiful supply of His Spirit Phil 1:19b-21a .
[90]  The Spirit of Jesus Christ has the bountiful supply to support us so that we can live the pneumatic Christ, who is not in the flesh but in the spirit, in the pneuma.
[91]  The Bible is a record of Christ as a threefold seed in humanity who became a life-giving Spirit, as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God, for our portion.
[92]  On the day of His resurrection, the processed and resurrected Christ, who has become the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God, came back to His disciples and breathed Himself as such a life-giving Spirit into His disciples for them to receive as the Holy Spirit to be their life, their person, and their everything John 20:22 .
[93]  The old creation of man came out of the breathing in Genesis 2:7.
[94]  The new creation also came out of a breathing.
[95]  In Genesis we can see only the breathing of a breath, not of the person of the Divine Trinity, for the creation of man as a part of the old creation.
[96]  The breathing in John 20:22 took place after Christ had passed through the processes of incarnation, human living for thirty-three and a half years, crucifixion, and resurrection.
[97]  Before His ascension, on the day of His resurrection, Christ came back to His disciples.
[98]  As the revealing Spirit, the Spirit shows us the deep things of God concerning Christ as our portion for our enjoyment, foreordained, prepared, and given to us by God but having never been seen or heard by man and having never come up in man's heart, for the dispensing of all the mysterious riches of Christ into our spiritual being for our glory 1 Cor 2:7-12 .
[99]  According to 1 Corinthians, Christ is rich first in His being the power of God and the wisdom of God 1:24 , and then in His being righteousness, sanctification holiness , and redemption to us v. 30 . He is rich in at least twenty items in the book of 1 Corinthians.
[100]  As the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of life, the Spirit indwells us to dispense the divine life into our spirit, soul signified by the mind , and body Rom 8:2, 6, 9-11 .
[101]  As the Comforter, the Spirit convicts us, the sinners, concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment, that we may repent and believe in the Son, and He regenerates us by imparting Christ as the divine life into our being that we may become the children of God John 16:7b-11; 3:5-6; 1:12-13 .
[102]  The life-giving Spirit is the compound Spirit, and the compound Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit, because He has been compounded with the elements of divinity, humanity, Christ's death with its effectiveness, and Christ's resurrection with its effectiveness.
[103]  The third section of the "tunnel," or process, was His resurrection.
[104]  In His resurrection He entered into another realm the divine, spiritual, and heavenly realm.
[105]  Before His resurrection He was in our realm, and before His incarnation He was in the eternal realm with the Father.
[106]  In the first section of His process He was the complete God becoming a perfect man in humanity with blood and flesh.
[107]  The all-inclusive Spirit is the firstfruits of our enjoyment of God as our inheritance, dispensing His riches into us until the redemption the glorification of our body, that is, our divine sonship of glory.
[108]  The all-inclusive Spirit, as the Spirit of our sonship, leads us, the sons of God, by the Father's life and nature dispensed into our being in our daily life, that we may be the sons of God in practicality Rom 8:14-15 .
[109]  The all-inclusive Spirit is the compound Spirit, compounded with both the divine nature and the human nature of Christ, and with both Christ's death and resurrection, to be the anointing ointment, anointing us with all His compounding elements, that we may abide in the Lord to receive His dispensing for our knowledge of the truth of the Divine Trinity in God's economy 2 Cor 1:21; 1 John 2:20-27 .
[110]  The reality mentioned in this verse must be the reality of the Triune God, Christ, and the divine life.
[111]  The all-inclusive Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus Christ, supplying us with His bountiful supply that we may magnify Christ by living Him Phil 1:19b-21a .
[112]  Quite early in my Christian life I was told that I should live out Christ and magnify Christ.
[113]  Philippians 1:20 speaks of magnifying Christ, and verse 21 mentions the matter of living Christ, but I did not see that the way to live and magnify Christ is found in verse 19.
[114]  The life-giving Spirit, the compound Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, is the indwelling Spirit, strengthening us through the divine dispensing into our inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts, that we may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints the breadth, length, height, and depth, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God, which is the church Eph 3:16-19 .
[115]  The Spirit is the oneness of the Body of Christ, being the essence of the Body, which is constituted with Christ as the element, out from the origin of God the Father, to consummate the mingling of the Triune God with the Body of Christ through the divine dispensing Eph 4:3-6 .
[116]  Brother Nee was saved at the age of seventeen, and he began to minister in 1922 at the age of twenty.
[117]  In that year the first local church in mainland China was raised up through his ministry.
[118]  In chapter eight, Christ is in us v. 10 , and the Spirit of Christ also is in us v. 9 . Christ is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is one with Christ.
[119]  Today there is a great debate concerning the way to build up the church.
[120]  The all-inclusive Spirit, whom the all-inclusive Christ as the threefold seed in humanity has become, is the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God in Christ Gal 3:14 , for the divine dispensing according to the divine economy.
[121]  As the Spirit of life, this Spirit fills us inwardly with Himself as the life-giving Spirit that we may be saturated and permeated with the unsearchable riches of Christ to be the fullness of Christ for His expression Rom 8:2; Acts 13:52; Eph 3:8; 1:23 .
[122]  W. As the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus,
[123]  The all-inclusive Spirit as the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus directs the move of the ministers of Christ through the inward guidance by the divine dispensing Acts 16:6-10 .
[124]  As the transforming Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit conforms us, His many transformed brothers, to His image, the image of the firstborn Son of God, that we may fully be what He is Rom 8:29; 1 John 3:2 .
[125]  The Spirit's transformation has a goal, and that is to conform us to the image of the firstborn Son of God.
[126]  Christ as the firstborn Son of God is the model, the mold, to which we all must be conformed.
[127]  As the renewing Spirit, He transforms us, and as the transforming Spirit, He conforms us.
[128]  Then as the conforming Spirit, He glorifies us with the divine glory of God and of Christ that the divine glory within us today may be expressed outwardly, in which we will be the same as Christ is in the glory of God Rom 8:30b; Heb 2:10a; 1 Pet 5:10a; Col 1:27 .
[129]  In my early Christian life I was taught that although we are very mean and low pieces of clay, one day, when the Lord Jesus comes, we will be brought into the glory of God.
[130]  As the seven Spirits, the sevenfold intensified Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit speaks to the churches as Christ Himself to transfuse and infuse all that Christ is, as Christ declared at the beginning of each of the seven epistles, to the saints who are seeking to be overcomers Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 26-29; 3:5-6, 12-13, 21-22 .
[131]  This consummated Triune God marries the transformed, tripartite, redeemed saints, that He and we, we and He, may be a universal couple for His redeemed ones to enjoy the riches and fullness of the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive blessing of the New Jerusalem through His dispensing according to His economy for eternity Rev 22:17a .
[132]  AND THE DIVINE DISPENSING MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE AGGREGATE OF THE ALL-EMBRACING BLESSING
[133]  After the first promise in Genesis 3:15, twenty-seven centuries passed until the time of Isaiah, who repeated God's promise: "Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel" Isa 7:14 .
[134]  This son borne by the virgin is the seed of the woman.
[135]  For two thousand years after the first promise was given, nothing took place to fulfill that promise.
[136]  The way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God, is first by God's revealing of Christ in us Gal 1:16a .
[137]  As God, on His side, is revealing, we, on our side, are receiving.
[138]  The third way in the book of Galatians to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is by being born according to the Spirit and by being given the Spirit of God's Son into our hearts Gal 4:29b, 6 .
[139]  We receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit also by putting on Christ through the baptism that puts us into Christ Gal 3:27 .
[140]  In this message we will continue to fellowship concerning the way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God.
[141]  First, I would like to present something further regarding the matter, mentioned in the previous message, of our being identified with Christ in His death that it may be no longer we who live but Christ who lives in us Gal 2:20 .
[142]  To be identified with the Lord is to be one Spirit with Him.
[143]  It is a fact that Jesus today is the Spirit waiting to enter into anyone who believes in Him.
[144]  If a person exercises his inner being to call on Jesus, regardless of his race, color, or culture, Jesus comes as the Spirit and enters into him.
[145]  The sixth way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is by living and walking by the Spirit Gal 5:16, 25 .
[146]  Living and walking by the Spirit is equivalent to having our being by the Spirit.
[147]  Romans 12:2a says, "And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind."
[148]  This indicates that to have Christ formed in us is to have the three parts of our soul our mind, emotion, and will renewed.
[149]  with the Desire and Aim of the Spirit in View,
[150]  Another way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is by sowing unto the Spirit with the desire and aim of the Spirit in view, to accomplish what the Spirit desires Gal 6:7, 8b .
[151]  The first way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in the Gospel of John is by receiving Christ as the Son of God through believing into Him, to be born of God 1:12-13 .
[152]  To receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ, we must take Him as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world 1:29, 36 .
[153]  Jesus was called the Lamb of God because in the eyes of God He was the sacrifice, the offering, for the sin of the world.
[154]  We also receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ by receiving the Spirit from Him not by measure John 3:34b .
[155]  If the Spirit whom we receive from Christ were measurable or limited, He would not be adequate for us to enjoy.
[156]  We receive, experience, and enjoy Christ also by hearing Christ's word and believing the Father who sent Him, that we may live in our spirit and have eternal life John 5:24a, 25 .
[157]  Eternal life is difficult to explain, but according to our experience we can testify that from the day we believed into the Lord Jesus, the Triune God the Father, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the life-giving Spirit entered into us.
[158]  Another way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is to eat the word spoken by Christ as spirit and as life.
[159]  Christ speaks the word, the word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is life.
[160]  The Speaker of the word is the processed Triune God, and His speaking transmits the processed Triune God into us in the form of the word.
[161]  Another way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ in the Gospel of John is by leaving the sheepfold of religion and following Christ according to His voice to enjoy the freedom of His salvation and partake of the riches of His feeding pasture 10:1-4, 9 .
[162]  The Gospel of John speaks of the fullness of Christ.
[163]  John 1:14 says that Christ came as the incarnated One, full of grace and reality, and verse 16 says that we have all received of His fullness.
[164]  This shows us that Christ came in incarnation for one thing: that we may receive Him.
[165]  The mystery of God is Christ Col 2:2 , and this Christ became incarnated.
[166]  The Gospel of John concerns the Triune God, God in His trinity, becoming the riches as the fullness that He may give, impart, and dispense Himself to us on His side, and that we may receive the Triune God on our side.
[167]  According to John 3:16, the Son is for the Triune God to give Himself to us.
[168]  In the Gospel of John the Son is likened to food and water.
[169]  Jesus said that He is the bread of life 6:35, 48 , the bread from heaven v. 51b , and the living bread v. 51a . This is marvelous.
[170]  Simpson was one of the most spiritual persons the United States has produced in the past one hundred years.
[171]  He enjoyed breathing in the Lord's fullness and breathing out all the negative things within him.
[172]  Another way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is by following Him in His death to release the divine life and to receive the Father's honor 12:24, 26 .
[173]  The way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is by loving Him and keeping His word to gain the Father's love and to have Christ manifest Himself to us and have the Father and Him make Their abode with us John 14:21, 23 .
[174]  If we love the Lord and keep His word, we will have three results.
[175]  Another way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is by being convicted by the Comforter, the Spirit of reality, concerning sin from Adam , concerning righteousness Christ , and concerning judgment the devil's eternal portion , that we may be justified and regenerated 16:8-11 .
[176]  The way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is also by being one with the believers to partake of the oneness of the Divine Trinity that the people of the world may believe in Him 17:21 .
[177]  The first item in Romans concerning the way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit is to walk according to the spirit Rom 8:3-4 .
[178]  Romans 8:4 tells us to walk according to the spirit, and verse 5 tells us to set our mind on the spirit.
[179]  The way to enjoy Christ is by participating in the fellowship of Christ as our portion 1 Cor 1:2b, 9 .
[180]  First Corinthians 1:2b says, "...to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours."
[181]  We enjoy Christ also by partaking of Christ as the Lamb of the Passover and the unleavened bread that we may become a new lump 1 Cor 5:7-8 .
[182]  We enjoy the all-inclusive Christ also by eating the spiritual food and drinking the spiritual drink 1 Cor 10:3-4 .
[183]  The way to enjoy Christ is also by the life-giving Spirit as the writing ink in our ministry 2 Cor 3:6b, 3 .
[184]  Second Corinthians 3:3 says, "Since you are being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh."
[185]  By Being Renewed in Our Inner Man Day by Day
[186]  That Christ May Make His Home in Our Hearts
[187]  The way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is also by the strengthening of the Spirit that Christ may make His home in our hearts that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God Eph 3:16-19 .
[188]  of the Body of Christ by Christ as the Head
[189]  To be nourished and cherished as a member of the Body of Christ by Christ as the Head Eph 5:29 is also a way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ.
[190]  To pursue Christ that we may gain Him as the excellent Christ Phil 3:8-14 is another way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ.
[191]  Christ is not only the all-inclusive Christ but also the excellent Christ.
[192]  To receive Christ and walk in Him as those living in the God-given good land Col 2:6 should also be considered as a way to experience and enjoy Christ.
[193]  Another practical way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is to rejoice always, pray unceasingly, give thanks to God in everything, not quench the Spirit, and not despise the prophesyings, that we may be wholly sanctified and saturated with the element of God's holy nature in our spirit, soul, and body 1 Thes 5:16-20, 23 .
[194]  To eat the word of righteousness as the solid food Heb 5:13-14 is a strong way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ.
[195]  Another wonderful way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is by abiding in the Lord according to the teaching of the divine anointing 1 John 2:27 .
[196]  God's full salvation typified by the experience of the children of Israel includes ten aspects: the blood of the lamb, the flesh of the lamb, the unleavened bread, the bitter herbs, the arm of Jehovah, the Angel of Jehovah, the cloud, the manna, the water, and the healing of the Physician.
[197]  In the wilderness the children of Israel also had a problem concerning water.
[198]  God gave them water out of the cleft rock 17:1-6 .
[199]  According to Paul in 1 Corinthians 10:4, the rock followed them through the wilderness.
[200]  IN THE TYPES A. In the Enjoyment of the Items of the Passover
[201]  First, the flesh of the lamb was to be eaten by God's redeemed people v. 8a . This signifies that the redeeming Christ is to be dispensed into His believers as the life supply 1 Cor 5:7b . The Lamb, which is the redeeming Christ, is dispensed into His believers in order to give them the strength and energy to go the way ordained by God.
[202]  But Christ has come into us to be another element within us, a sinless element.
[203]  AND THE DIVINE DISPENSING MESSAGE TWENTY IN THE PROMISES AND TYPES
[204]  The types in the Old Testament show us how to enjoy God as our life supply that He may dispense Himself into us.
[205]  The meal offering to be eaten by the priests signifies Christ in His humanity to be dispensed into us for us to live a priestly life Lev 2:1-3; 6:14-18; 7:9-10 .
[206]  The peace offering to be eaten by the clean persons signifies Christ, who is our peace, to be dispensed into us, who are clean, for our spiritual enjoyment in the fellowship with God Lev 7:15-21 .
[207]  The wave offering of the breast of the peace offering and the heave offering of the right thigh of the peace offering were to be eaten by the offering priests, signifying that the Christ of love and the Christ of strength are to be dispensed into us as the offering priests for our enjoyment of Christ in His love and in His strength Lev 7:28-36 .
[208]  God's dispensing is typified by the enjoyment of the offerings at the annual feasts Lev 23 .
[209]  The Feast of Pentecost signifies the New Testament believers' enjoyment of the outpoured Spirit as the aggregate of the rich produce of the resurrected Christ Lev 23:15-21; Acts 2:1-4, 32-33 .
[210]  The Feast of Pentecost came fifty days after the Feast of the Firstfruits, indicating that the outpoured Spirit is the aggregate of the rich produce of the resurrected Christ.
[211]  Before the resurrection God did not have any sons besides His only begotten Son, but through Christ's resurrection we were all begotten of God to be His many sons 1 Pet 1:3 .
[212]  This signifies that the resurrected Christ, after being presented to God in His freshness John 20:16-17 , is to be dispensed, with all the riches of His resurrection, into us for our enjoyment Lev 23:14; 1 Cor 15:14, 17; Rom 4:25b; Phil 3:10a, 11b .
[213]  In the New Testament, especially in the Epistles, many verses use the preposition in to form phrases such as in Christ 2 Cor 5:17 , in Him Eph 1:4, 10; 3:12 , in the Lord Jesus Christ 2 Thes 3:12 , in Christ Jesus Rom 6:23b; 8:2; 1 Cor 1:30 , in God 1 Thes 1:1 , and in the Spirit Col 1:8 .
[214]  Matthew 1:20 says, "But while he pondered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit."
[215]  The word Christian means "a person who belongs to Christ."
[216]  As Christians, we belong to Christ and are His counterpart.
[217]  Luke 1:35 says, "And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore also the holy thing which is born will be called the Son of God."
[218]  The holy thing mentioned in this verse is God Himself, that is, Christ as the embodiment of God.
[219]  Christ came through incarnation with God as reality and grace for His dispensing into His believers.
[220]  In His resurrection Christ as the grain of wheat produced many grains for the dispensing of His divine life into His many believers that they may be His many members John 12:24 .
[221]  When this wonderful and unique man named Jesus came in His incarnation, He did not come empty-handed.
[222]  Rather, John 1:14 says, "And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father , full of grace and reality."
[223]  His entire being was not full of commandments, ordinances, and regulations but was full of grace and reality.
[224]  John 5 tells us that whether or not we are in the tomb, we all are dead persons; but the Lord comes to us that we may have life.
[225]  Moreover, His life is transmitted into us by His word.
[226]  If we receive His word and believe the One who sent Him, we receive Him as life, which transfers us out of death into eternal life v. 24 . Again, this is the transmission, the impartation, the dispensing, of the Triune God as life in the Son into us.
[227]  Those who heard the Lord's word in John 6 did not understand Him v. 60 . Therefore, He said, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life" v. 63 . When we hear the Lord's speaking, we spontaneously receive the dispensing of Christ as God into us.
[228]  In John 11 Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead.
[229]  To be resurrected from the dead is to receive the divine dispensing.
[230]  In John 12:24 Jesus said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."
[231]  IN THE BREATHING OF THE ESSENTIAL SPIRIT INTO THE BELIEVERS
[232]  In His word to Mary the Lord Jesus referred to the disciples as His brothers, and He referred to God as His Father and their Father, and His God and their God.
[233]  IN THE OUTPOURING OF THE ECONOMICAL SPIRIT UPON THE BELIEVERS
[234]  The outpouring of the economical Spirit goes with the inward filling of the essential Spirit, and the infilling of the essential Spirit is the dispensing of the processed Triune God as life into the believers Acts 13:52b .
[235]  The accomplishment of God's full redemption and salvation in Christ progresses in the subjective sanctification of the saints Rom 6:19, 22 .
[236]  Subjective sanctification is the dispensing of the holy nature of God into the saints, separating the saints unto God by the saturation of God's holy nature into the saints' being 2 Pet 1:4; 1 Thes 5:23 .
[237]  The second great revelation in the New Testament is Christ in His all-inclusiveness.
[238]  The knowledge concerning Christ and the apprehension concerning Christ were released to a surpassing degree in the writings of Paul.
[239]  The Body is not mentioned in the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament.
[240]  According to Romans 12, we must present our physical bodies v. 1 for the mystical Body of Christ v. 5 . When we present our bodies and are renewed in our mind, we see, discern, and prove by testing that the will of God is to obtain a Body for Christ to be His fullness and expression v. 2 .
[241]  If we desire to know the dispensing of the Triune God, we must know God in His economy, Christ in His all-inclusiveness, the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God, the spiritual and divine transformation of the believers, and the Body of Christ.
[242]  Galatians 6:15 says, "For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters."
[243]  In the Bible the New Jerusalem is the consummation of newness Rev 21:2 .
[244]  Christ as the embodiment of God is very real; He is the reality John 14:6 .
[245]  These items include the incarnation of Christ John 1:14 , the resurrection of Christ John 12:24; 1 Pet 1:3 , the breathing of the essential Spirit into the believers John 20:22 , the outpouring of the economical Spirit upon the believers Acts 2:17, 33; 10:45; Titus 3:6 , the regeneration of the believers 1 Pet 1:3 , and the subjective sanctification of the saints Rom 6:19, 22 .
[246]  I have discovered through my travels that all young people are the same in loving the world, regardless of their race or nationality.
[247]  The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God Rom 8:9a .
[248]  When He comes in, God comes in. The Holy Spirit dispenses God as the very element into us.
[249]  Thus, when the Spirit of Christ comes into us, Christ Himself comes in. When we have Christ, we have God as the element.
[250]  Last of all, the Spirit gives life to our body Rom 8:11b .
[251]  The Spirit renews the believers by dispensing the newness of Christ's resurrection life into the believers' inward being Rom 6:4 .
[252]  The reason that we pray, read the Word, and pray-read the Word is that we need the continuous dispensing of the Spirit with the resurrection life element of Christ into our being.
[253]  Such a thought is divine, spiritual, and abstract; thus, it is not a part of our natural logic.
[254]  According to our logic, we must work for everything that we want to obtain.
[255]  Regeneration is to have the divine life added to our human life.
[256]  Sanctification is to be separated unto God and for God from anything other than God.
[257]  This causes us to become holy, not by our doing but by our receiving the holy divine nature.
[258]  At the time of our salvation, the Spirit of God entered into our spirit to regenerate us, to make us new in our spirit John 3:6 .
[259]  The foregoing definition of transformation is based on two verses, Romans 12:2 and 2 Corinthians 3:18.
[260]  Then, in 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul said, "But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."
[261]  The transformation of the renewed believers is by the dispensing of the Lord's divine element in His resurrection life into His believers' inward element.
[262]  AND THE DIVINE DISPENSING MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX IN THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF
[263]  The accomplishment of God's full redemption and salvation in Christ is in the conformation of the transformed believers.
[264]  While Christ lived on this earth as one person, on the one hand, He expressed God's divine attributes, such as love, light, holiness, and righteousness, and on the other hand, He expressed the human virtues, such as meekness, humility, and forbearance.
[265]  Today we are His believers, and He is dispensing Himself into us in both His divinity and His humanity.
[266]  When He was on this earth, He was both divine and human in the way of mingling.
[267]  Eventually, in His resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God Col 1:18; Rom 1:4; 8:29 .
[268]  Thus, as a God-man who walked on the earth, He was both God and man, but His humanity had not yet been brought into divinity.
[269]  God conforms the transformed believers to the image of His firstborn Son by dispensing the element of the resurrected Christ as the firstborn Son of God into the believers for their conformation.
[270]  We need to realize that all day, from morning until evening, God is working in us to dispense the element of the resurrected Christ into us.
[271]  God is dispensing, and we must respond to His dispensing by taking the resurrected Christ in His divinity and in His humanity as the model of a God-man, that is, of One who is both divine and human.
[272]  In the foregoing messages we have seen that the divine dispensing was prophesied in God's promises to us, was typified in the types of the Old Testament, and is carried out in the accomplishment of God's full redemption and salvation in Christ.
[273]  In the remainder of this message we will cover the concluding point in the accomplishment of God's full redemption and salvation in Christ the glorification of the conformed believers.
[274]  First, God called us; then He justified us, regenerated us, sanctified us, renewed us, transformed us, and conformed us to the image of the firstborn Son of God.
[275]  As a young believer, I was taught that the glory of God was objective, far away in the heavens.
[276]  I was told that when the Lord Jesus comes, in the twinkling of an eye He will bring us into the heavens to enter into an objective realm of glory.
[277]  This teaching was based on Hebrews 2:10, which says, "For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
[278]  According to this teaching, the destination to which Christ is leading us is the objective glory of God in the heavens.
[279]  When our mind becomes the spirit of our mind, the divine life will gradually spread from our spirit through our soul and eventually into our mortal body Rom 8:11 .
[280]  The reality of divine healing is that our mortal body is saturated with the divine life from our spirit through our soul.
[281]  Such an experience of the divine life spreading to our body can heal our body and prolong our life.
[282]  God's conformed sons are glorified through the Spirit as the firstfruits dispensing the divine essence into the believers' entire being Rom 8:23 .
[283]  Since the tree of life in Genesis 2 is a figure of speech, indicating something mysterious, invisible, and glorious, the same tree of life mentioned in the last chapter of the Bible must also be a figure of speech.
[284]  The tree of life grows in the New Jerusalem Rev 22:2 .
[285]  I. THE NEW JERUSALEM, AS GOD'S HOLY CITY, BEING: A. God's Universal Building
[286]  for His New Creation out of His Old Creation
[287]  The New Jerusalem as God's holy city is God's universal building for His new creation out of His old creation 1 Cor 3:9b; 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15 .
[288]  The New Jerusalem is the mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite people.
[289]  The New Jerusalem is a composition of two groups of people God's Old Testament saints and Christ's New Testament believers.
[290]  The inward constitution is with God the Father as the substance, signified by the pure gold, with God the Son as the initiation entrance through His redemption, signified by the pearls, and with God the Spirit as the building the wall with its foundations through His transformation, signified by the precious stones Rev 21:18-21 .
[291]  The holy city is also a constitution of precious stones.
[292]  The Spirit works to transform the redeemed and regenerated saints into precious stones.
[293]  THE CONTENTS OF THE NEW JERUSALEM A. God's Glory as the Uncreated Light
[294]  The river of water of life flows from the throne of God and of the Lamb in the midst of the street to the twelve gates of the city to water the entire city Rev 22:1a .
[295]  Where there is the street, there is the flow of life.
