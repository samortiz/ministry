   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can we acquire the ability to listen and understand?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we must not be subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Please remember that subjectivity is one of the main reasons that people are poor listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everyone who is subjective finds it difficult to understand what others are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we have our own subjective concepts and ideas about people, it will be difficult for us to hear what others are saying because our mind is already full.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can be so set in our opinions that others' opinions cannot penetrate our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the situation with many people who are subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are firmly persuaded of their own ideas, opinions, and views.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nothing can shake their ideas, opinions, and views.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They have decided to give their "castor oil" to everyone, no matter how varied the needs may be.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their only panacea is their "castor oil."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How can they hear what others are saying?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When weak saints come to them, they have no heart to find out their problem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead, they are set in their mind as to what they want to say, and they have nothing to say other than their own premeditated admonitions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are very confident of themselves, yet they are completely ignorant of others' problems.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How can these ones work for the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must ask the Lord to save us from this kind of subjectivity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should pray to the Lord, "Lord, may I not be prejudiced when I talk with others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May I not force my diagnosis upon others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I should not be the one to determine their illness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Lord, You have to show me their illness."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to learn to give up our subjectivity, to listen carefully, to hear what others are saying, and to find out their problem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Second, our mind must not wander.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many believers have never learned the proper lessons in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Their thoughts flow on uninterruptedly both day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Their thoughts are never in focus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They just let their thoughts roam hither and thither.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They accumulate so many things in their mind that there is no room for anything more when others try to convey their thoughts to them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people are too active in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They have a capacity only for their own thoughts and no capacity to take up other people's thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a result, they can never understand how others think.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They cannot take up others' thoughts because they have never learned to be quiet in their own mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order for us to hear what others are saying, our mind first must be disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If our mind is always turning like a flywheel, nothing will lodge in it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In learning to listen to others, a worker of the Lord has to steady his own mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not only must he reject all subjectivity; he must learn to be calm in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must learn to think as others are thinking and to understand what others are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must also learn to comprehend the hidden meaning behind their words.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are unable to do this, we will not be of much use to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Third, we must learn to enter into the feelings of others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A fundamental qualification for understanding others' words is to be able to empathize with their feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot understand what others are saying merely by understanding their words; we have to be able to feel what they feel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If someone comes to us in deep distress and trouble and we maintain a breezy manner, being untouched by his grief, we will never be able to help him, no matter how long we listen to his words.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If our feeling cannot match his, we will not understand what he is facing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who have never been dealt with in their emotions can never feel what others feel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A person with hardened feelings cannot enter into the feelings of others, and he cannot understand what others say.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have not been dealt with by God, we will not be able to sing "hallelujah" when others express their joy, and we will not be able to share their grief when they express their sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We will be unable to identify with their feelings, and their feelings will never touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is why we have to understand their words.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How can we feel what others feel?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In order to do this, we must be very objective in regard to our own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may feel something, but we must be objective in regard to our own feelings before we can have the capacity to feel what he feels.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But if we are too busy with our own feelings, we will not be sensitive enough to consider his feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must remember that we are the servants of the saints for Christ's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Not only should we give our time and strength to them; we should make our affections available to them as well.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Not only should we help them solve their problems; we should accommodate their feelings with our feelings as well.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our feelings should be available to share in others' feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is what the Scripture means when it says that the Lord Jesus, who was tempted in all respects like us, is touched with the feeling of our weaknesses Heb 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Brothers and sisters, our emotions have to be dealt with by the Lord so that they can become available.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If our emotions are overactive and we are preoccupied with our own feelings, we will never be able to enter into others' feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, we must make not only our time available to others but our emotions as well.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that our love, joy, and sorrow should not be occupied, but rather available, when others are speaking to us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If our whole being is occupied by a certain feeling, there will not be any space within us for others' feelings; we will not have the capacity to meet others' needs.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we do not have any joy or sorrow of our own, but are fully available before the Lord, we will be able to enter into others' feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we are constantly busy with our own feelings, we will be too preoccupied to feel for others when they come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God has a very high standard for those who serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A servant of the Lord has no time to feel happy or sorry for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we indulge in our own laughter and tears and in our own likes and dislikes, we will have no room within for the needs of others.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must remember that a servant of the Lord must be empty within.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we cling to our own pleasures and griefs, begrudging the letting go of this and that, we will be too full to take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We will be like a room that is full of furniture; it has no space to accommodate anything further.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many brothers and sisters cannot work for the Lord because they have expended all their love on themselves and have none to spare for others.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We need to realize that there is a limit to our soul-strength just as there is a limit to our physical strength.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Our emotional energy is not boundless.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we exhaust our soul in one direction, we will have nothing to give in another direction.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>For this reason, anyone who has an inordinate affection for another person cannot be the Lord's servant.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord Himself said, "If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters,...he cannot be My disciple" Luke 14:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is because when we love these things, our love is exhausted on them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We have to love the Lord our God with our whole heart, our whole soul, our whole mind, and our whole strength Mark 12:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This means that we have to give all our love to God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is a good thing for us to discover that we are limited in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must realize that our capacity is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Our vessel is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we fill it with other things, we will not have any space for more.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We are limited by our capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In order to enter into others' feelings, we have to make our own feelings available.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Our mind and emotions have to be available before we can identify with others' feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If our hands are filled with assignments, we cannot take up any requests from others.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If our hearts are weighted down by burdens of our own, others cannot share their burdens with us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Hence, whoever makes himself most available is capable of embracing the most.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Those who love themselves or their families too much have little love for the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>A man's capacity for love is only so big; he has to drop all other loves before he can love the brothers and understand the meaning of brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Then he will be able to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The fundamental requirement of everyone who is engaged in the Lord's work is to know the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>A man who does not know the cross is useless in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If you do not know the cross, you will always be subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Your thoughts will wander unceasingly, and you will live constantly in your own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>You have to come back to the knowledge of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>There is no cheap and easy way.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>You must receive fundamental dealings from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Without these dealings, you will be spiritually worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>May the Lord be merciful to us and deal with us so that we will not remain complacent in our subjectivity.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We do not want to have unchecked thoughts, nor do we want to be insensitive in our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>A worker has to open up himself to embrace others' problems.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If we do this, we will know what others are saying as soon as they come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We will know the words that they have not said, as well as the words that are in their spirit.</S>
