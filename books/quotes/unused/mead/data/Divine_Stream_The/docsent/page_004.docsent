   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE STREAM IN RELATION TO GOD'S PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The eternal purpose of God is to mingle Himself with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is working toward this one thing today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This oneness is not simply a joining or a uniting together; it is far more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is a mingling together, a blending together, which is much deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature until they become one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The entire Scripture is concerned with this one basic and central matter, that of God mingling Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must now ask, How will God accomplish this?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is clearly revealed in the Word that in order for God to do this, He must come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When God becomes our life, He will automatically be mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How can God come into us as our life?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is divine and quite mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only with the divine life, but also with human life there is an element of mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If asked, What is life? one would find it difficult to define.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Scripture God uses a figure to describe how He could be life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This figure is a stream of water.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He comes into us to be our life just as a stream of water flowing out and flowing in, flowing out from heaven and flowing into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I think it is easy to understand how this flowing stream can come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We simply drink of it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God Himself is the stream of the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God flows out of heaven onto this earth, and flows into you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is there a stream of God flowing within you today?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is a stream within me which is always flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes when I wish to sleep, this stream stirs me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I say, "Lord, I would like to rest; I'm tired"; but this stream flowing within does not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It gives me the impression: "You are tired, but I am not tired.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am still flowing, and My flowing will strengthen you."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is a stream continually flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Oh, brothers and sisters, do you have the flowing?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE SOURCE AND NATURE OF THE STREAM</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have seen that after man was created he was put before a tree called the "tree of life."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By the side of the tree of life there was a river, and by the flowing of this river there were some precious materials: gold, pearl, and onyx stone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is the meaning of these items?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are most significant.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Remember that this is in the second chapter of the whole of Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the end of Scripture, we find the same things again in the last two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There we see a city made of gold, pearls, and precious stones, the same kind of materials listed in Genesis chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There we also see a river flowing, and in its midst grows the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here you have the river and the tree of life once more.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How many times throughout the Scriptures God is spoken of as a flowing stream of water!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"Thou wilt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For with thee is the fountain of life..."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Psa 36:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Jesus tells us that the water that He gives will become a fountain of living water springing up unto eternal life John 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He says again that whoever is thirsty may come to Him and drink, and whoever believes on Him will have rivers of living water flowing from within him John 7:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All these words relate to one thing that God has flowed out and is still flowing on this earth into humanity as the life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may ask, In what form has God flowed out?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has flowed out first in His Son, in Christ; and then He has flowed out as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God is the spring, the very source; Christ the Son is the fountain, the reservoir, of this divine water; and the Holy Spirit is the living stream, flowing all the time.</S>
