   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Being Full of Emotion,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Yet Not Living by our Emotion</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The second thing is the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All spiritual persons are people with strong emotions, but, at the same time, all spiritual persons are those who do not live by their emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, those who are dull and have no feelings at all cannot be a spiritual person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the other hand, although a man may have emotion, he cannot live by his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those of you who do not have emotion have to learn to have emotion; you have to learn to laugh and to weep.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those of you who have emotion have to learn not to live by your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If your exercise turns you into a man of wood or stone, your exercise is not a spiritual one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am afraid that some among us never wipe their sweat or their tears.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not think that such a kind of person is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In church history, every spiritual person is full of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, on the one hand, we have to be full of emotion; on the other hand, we must not live by our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some sisters are full of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are attached to children, old folks, and even to small cats and dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All year round they are busy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today they go to this house, and tomorrow they go to another house.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If they become attached to you, they will come to your house at least once or twice a week.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A few of such ones may be one in their emotions, but they are not one in their minds.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This kind of fellowship is the fellowship of the emotion; it is not the fellowship of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Where are you living today?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In your contact with the brothers and sisters, have you dealt thoroughly with the elements of emotion?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps the reason you are in darkness and are not transparent is that you are too much in your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before God, and in your contact with the believers, you have to learn to live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to fellowship with the saints in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need an emotion, but our emotion has to be broken, and it must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not right to be without any emotion, and it is also wrong to live by the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>C. Being Strong, Yet Broken in the Will</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moreover, our will needs to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some people's will is like the northern Chinese noodles: if you hold them up by one side, the other side flops, and if you hold them up by the other side, this side flops.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you hold them up by the middle, the two sides flop, and if you hold them up by the two sides, the middle flops.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are too weak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the way many people's will is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to realize that a man whose will is not firm cannot be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only those who have a strong will, yet a broken will, can be spiritual, and only they can receive the light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>D. Keeping Oneself from Touching</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Right and Wrong</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Another thing that makes us opaque is the matter of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we want to be delivered from darkness and be a transparent person, we have to keep ourselves from touching any right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The fruit of the knowledge of good and evil brings in sin, and sin brings in death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One cannot judge anything by its right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One cannot act according to right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You have to learn to judge and to act in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many things cannot be determined on the ground of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you make judgments based on right and wrong, you yourself will also fall into the same entanglements, and you will end up being in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today our problems are these four things: the mind, the emotion, the will, and the right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are delivered from these things, we will be a spiritual and transparent person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we reject these things and learn to be a person living in our spirit, we will become a transparent person.</S>
