   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FULL-TIMERS NOT REPLACING THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Recently, several leading brothers related to me how their oneness had been recovered and how they are now on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They asked me to assign a small number of full-timers to their area.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In my fellowship with them, I told them that they should not expect the full-timers to do the work for them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The full-timers should not do anything to replace others or to replace others' work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The work of the full-timers, if they are really capable, is to show others a pattern and to develop others so that the others can do more.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The full-timers have been trained to work directly and not to do anything to replace others' work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But I am concerned that the full-timers are doing a replacing work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reason for my concern is that the brothers have often told me, "Brother Lee, thank the Lord for the full-timers who have come to help us."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When they use this word help, I realize that the full-timers might actually be replacing others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The full-timers must condemn themselves if they do anything in a place to replace the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is to repeat the clergy-laity system, which is condemned by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The full-timers are neither clergy nor laymen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are simply ordinary members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who are not full-timers should do the same thing as the full- timers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The only difference between the full-timers and the other saints is the amount of time that each one puts in. Saints who are not full-time have a job and may have a family, so they do not have a great deal of time to invest in the Lord's work directly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The full-timers have dropped their jobs in order to put all of their time into the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In principle, the saints and the full-timers are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The difference between them is only in the amount of time each one gives to the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This does not mean that the full- timers put in the time to work for the Lord and that the others do not need to work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the system of clergy and laity in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>RECOVERING THE FUNCTIONING OF ALL THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>IN THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The way of Christianity is to use big speakers with a good meeting place to attract people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is their facade.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>People can go there, attend a service, and relax after working all week.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But in the churches, we do not have this kind of attraction.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our attraction is that everyone functions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When other Christians come to visit our meeting, they may be shocked to see so many functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The elders must bear the responsibility to stir up each member in their church to function.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to do this, the elders must have personal contact with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This requires their time and energy, and this is a real sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In a previous message, I said that a good elder should contact twenty people a week.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This may sound like a large number, but actually it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You can contact people by telephone at least three times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You can call one in the morning, another one at noon, and still another one at night.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you did this seven days a week, twenty-one people could be contacted.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In your contact, you should not just inquire about the saints' welfare.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Take the opportunity to fellowship with the saints about the Lord's interest on earth, and take the time to have a little prayer with them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you contacted twenty saints in this way, after one month you would see a fresh situation in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To contact the saints makes a big difference.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To be an elder today, the major thing is to contact people, but you must contact people in the new way.</S>
