   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Dissenting Accusation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our Attitude toward Other Christians</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Our attitude toward other Christians is one of belittling them and thinking we're superior to them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I don't know how many times we've heard this expression, 'Poor Christianity!'</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We say that we're speaking only of the system, not of the people, but our attitude has definitely spilled over to the people..."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Practical Truth</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Concerning John's accusation in this item, we must distinguish Christianity from the Christians and the genuine church that is according to the divine revelation of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Matthew 13 the Lord Jesus showed us clearly in His parables the difference between the wheat the real Christians and the tares the nominal Christians , the difference between meal fine flour Christ as food to God and men and leaven evil things such as heresies, false teachings, and evil practices , the difference between the mustard seed Christ as the seed of life and a big tree the abnormal development of the church Christianity , and the difference between the tares, leaven, and the abnormally developed tree, and the treasure hidden in the field the kingdom of the heavens and the pearl of great value the genuine church .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The nominal Christians, the heresies, the evil practices, and the abnormal development have transmuted the church, which is composed of the genuine Christians and Christ as the seed of life and the spiritual food to be the precious pearl and the hidden treasure, into Christianity, which is not acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today, for the Lord's recovery, we must realize the difference between the genuine church, composed of the real Christians, and the abnormal Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we say "Poor Christianity!" we refer to the abnormal Christianity, with no intention of belittling or despising any real Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do recognize real Christians as our beloved brothers and sisters in Christ and respect those among them who are seeking the Lord and His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, we cannot justify the very Christianity of which they are members and for which they work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, in the Lord's recovery, quite often in teaching the saints we must present the truth concerning the genuine church of the Lord as His organic Body by pointing out the poor situation of today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We prefer to speak about others in a positive way, but in today's abnormal situation we simply cannot avoid pointing out the abnormality that exists among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>14.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Dissenting Accusation</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>an Overstressing and Distortion</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>of the Teaching concerning Deputy Authority</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"There has been to some extent an atmosphere of fear brought in among the saints and among the churches, bringing the conscience of the saints into bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I believe this has been done by an over-stressing and distortion of the teaching concerning deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This has brought the saints into a condition where they are fearful to follow their conscience, to be one with their spirit, and sometimes to speak their genuine concerns."</S>
