HENCE, THE LEARNING OF THE DIVINE TRUTHS<br />
BY STUDYING THE TRANSLATED AND INTERPRETED<br />
HOLY WRITINGS IS NECESSARY</h2>
<p>Since the holy writings have been translated and interpreted, we need the understanding of the holy writings. Hence, the learning of the divine truths by studying the translated and interpreted holy writings is necessary (2 Tim. 3:15). We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, open my ears so I can hear, and open my eyes so I can see.&rdquo; Paul prayed in Ephesians 1 that the Lord would grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation (v. 17). A line in <em>Hymns,</em> #1255 says, &ldquo;When we exercise our spirit, / Our vision is so clear.&rdquo; In order to have the proper understanding of the translated and interpreted holy writings, we need to exercise our spirit. We need to contact God, praying to Him and humbling ourselves by saying, &ldquo;Lord, I know nothing. I need You.&rdquo; I can testify that when I come to the Word in this way, the light is there and I understand it.</p>
<p>Many saints have purchased a complete set of the Life-studies of the New Testament. But some leave them on their bookshelf and do not get into them. We need to learn the divine truths by studying the interpreted holy writings. In these days the Lord needs some to go to Europe and Russia. Europe and Russia are suffering from a famine of the divine truths. If we mean business for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must study all the books we have published. In addition to the Life-studies of the New Testament, we have also published Life-studies on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, and Isaiah. Many of us can testify that after these books were expounded, they became new to us. We must learn the truths in these books by studying their proper interpretation.</p>
<p>We hope that many saints will emigrate to Europe, according to what is recorded in Acts 8 when the disciples were scattered from Jerusalem while the apostles still remained there. I hope that many will go to Europe to teach the Bible. Some of the seeking ones in Europe have asked the brothers to send people to them to teach them the Bible. This is our burden.</p>
<p>We should not have the concept of going to Europe to have big meetings in the old way. The young people who are burdened to study in the universities there can talk to their classmates one by one about the truths concerning God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s dispensing, Christ, and the church. We will save and gain people in this way. Some may also go to Europe to take a job or do a business. One brother said that many of the houses in eastern Germany are very old and need remodeling. He said that one of the best businesses for the brothers from the United States would be to go there to remodel these homes. As the brothers are working there, they can contact people to gain them for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The best way to prepare ourselves for going to Europe is by studying all the writings we have published to open up the holy Word. We need to learn the divine truths and then spread them to the whole earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HISTORY OF THE INTERPRETATION OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>There is a history of the writing and translation of the Bible, and there is also a history of the interpretation of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Time of the Church Fathers</h2>
<p>After the Bible had been composed and completed, it began to be interpreted in the time of the church fathers. They began to open up the truth concerning the Divine Trinity and the person of Christ. Their study of Christ&rsquo;s person is referred to as Christology. By the fourth century there were many disputes concerning the person of Christ and the Divine Trinity. Constantine the Great, who was the emperor of Rome at the beginning of the fourth century, called a council at Nicaea in A.D. 325 to settle these disputes. Out of this council came the Nicene Creed.</p>
<p>By the end of the sixth century, the Roman Catholic Church was established with the papacy. The Bible was locked up by the Roman Catholic Church. Only the Catholic clergy who knew Greek, Hebrew, and Latin had access to the Bible. This period of time when the Bible was locked up is referred to in history as the Dark Ages.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Time of the Reformation</h2>
<p>Eventually, the Lord used Martin Luther in the sixteenth century to unlock the Bible, to release the Bible from &ldquo;prison.&rdquo; The interpretation of the Bible advanced during this time of the Reformation with the recovery of the truth concerning justification by faith.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Time of the British Brethren</h2>
<p>The British Brethren were raised up by the Lord in 1828 under the leadership of John Nelson Darby. He took the lead to open up the interpretation of the Bible. His <em>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</em> is a great help to understanding the entire Bible. In his synopsis he opens up the principles of every book. There were also a number of other great teachers among the Brethren. During the early part of the nineteenth century, the light came to them like a flood. Many books full of the truth were published by them. The Lord&rsquo;s move among the Brethren for the release of the biblical truths lasted about one hundred years.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
