<h2 class=head1>TAKING THE WORD OF THE SCRIPTURES FOR THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</h2><p>You also need to be confirmed by the word of the Scriptures. In other words, you have to take the word of the Scriptures for the assurance of salvation. If you recognize the person of Christ and that Christ died to bear your sins, and if you receive His salvation and pray and open yourself to receive Him, then you need to know according to the word of the Bible that you are saved. The Bible has many verses that say you are saved. Your sins are forgiven, Christ today is within you, and you have the eternal life; therefore, you are saved. In the Scriptures there are many verses of such an assurance and confirmation of salvation. Now, by this assurance and confirmation, you have to be at peace that you are saved. You are a person saved by Christ, and you are a son of God, a child of God. This is wonderful! Do not look to anything else. Gradually, day by day from now on, this living Lord will work out many things with you and within you.<p>I would ask you to realize the above five points: who Christ is, what Christ did for you, the salvation prepared for you, the proper way to partake of this salvation, and the full assurance of this salvation in the Bible. Recognize that the Christ in whom you believe is the very God, that He became a man and died on the cross for your sins, and that He resurrected. Today He is the Spirit as the living Savior and the almighty Lord. Recognize this, open yourself to Him, and contact Him in a living way. I assure you then that you are saved. This is not confirmed by me but by this covenant, this testament, this will. It is confirmed, so you have the assurance of salvation. So you have to say, “Hallelujah, praise the Lord! I am saved. Regardless of how evil and how pitiful I am, I am saved!” Then whenever you sense you are wrong, simply confess. It is very easy, and it is so pleasant. To confess to Him whatever you sense within is a pleasant way to contact Christ.<h2 class=head1>WORKING WITH PEOPLE IN LOVE AND IN PATIENCE</h2><p>All the new ones can be helped by this message, but this speaking is also for all the brothers and sisters. You will have more time to contact people and work with the promising ones in this way. Help them to realize these five points, and work these five points into them. Maybe you cannot work out all these points in one night. I have done it in a brief way, but please do not be as brief with them. You need some time to deal just with the first item. Help them to open the Bible, read it, and understand it word by word. Then after three or four contacts like this, they will be helped to be very clear. The Holy Spirit always follows this kind of work. We simply pave the way. The more we work in this way, the more the Holy Spirit will follow, and He will work it out. People will be impressed, painted, and anointed by the Holy Spirit. Then you will see the difference. We have to learn to work with people in love and in patience. I believe that in these days people will be helped not only to be saved but also to be very clear about the way of salvation.
