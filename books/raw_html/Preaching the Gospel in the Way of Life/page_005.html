<h2 class=head2>Helping People with Some Practical Verses</h2><p>Following this, we have to tell people that if they are going to receive Christ as the living One, they have to make a thorough confession. They need to confess their sins. No doubt, we must tell them that their sins have been borne away by Christ and forgiven by God. However, for their experience of Christ, there is a need for them to confess all of their sins. We should help them to realize how many sins they have, how sinful they are, and help them to repent and confess their sins in a thorough way. They may ask how to confess. We can tell them that they should confess according to what they feel. There is nothing legal. They should simply contact the Lord and confess whatever they feel is sinful or dirty, the more the better.<p>We must also give people some practical verses from the New Testament, and sometimes from the Old Testament, to prove to them that they have really been saved. There are four main items that we have to help them to see.<h2 class=head3>Showing Them That Their Sins Have Been Forgiven</h2><p>First, by quoting some verses we must help them to know that their sins have been forgiven. The remission of sins has been given to them. The best verse concerning the forgiveness of sins is Acts 10:43, which says, “To this One all the prophets testify that through His name everyone who believes into Him will receive forgiveness of sins.” We should read this verse to people and ask them also to read it. This is the way to point out this item of the will. In the will there is such an item telling us that if we believe in His name, our sins are forgiven; the remission of sins has been given to us. We may also use Ephesians 1:7, but Acts 10:43 is the best verse. In this way we must give people some practical verses from the New Testament to confirm them, to prove that what we have been preaching is not a theory but an item of the will.<h2 class=head3>Showing Them That They Are Justified by Faith</h2><p>After reading the words in the will concerning the forgiveness of sins, we should read to them about justification by faith. From the Word prove to them that they have been justified by faith. There are many such verses. I prefer Acts 13:38 and 39, which say, “Therefore let it be known to you, men, brothers, that through this One forgiveness of sins is announced to you; and from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified.” These two verses tell us two things, that forgiveness is announced and that justification has been given in this One, that is, in Christ. We may also use many verses from Romans 3 and Galatians 2, quoting the best verses to confirm that as long as a person believes in Jesus, he has been justified by God in Christ. This is the forgiveness of sins and justification by faith.<h2 class=head3>Showing Them That They Have Eternal Life</h2><p>Third, we should read some verses confirming that they have eternal life within them. There are many such verses, such as John 3:16 and 36, 5:24, 6:47, and others. We need these verses to confirm, to prove, that they have eternal life in them.
