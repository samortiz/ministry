   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Myrrh</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Flowing myrrh, smelling sweet but tasting bitter, signifies the precious death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Bible myrrh is used mostly for burial.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, myrrh is related to death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to John 19, when Nicodemus and others were preparing to bury the body of the Lord Jesus, they used myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Myrrh comes from an aromatic tree.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This tree drops its juice either as a result of being cut or through some kind of natural opening or incision.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In ancient times, this juice was used to reduce the suffering of death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Lord Jesus was being crucified, He was offered wine mixed with myrrh to reduce His pain.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, He refused to take it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No doubt, the myrrh in Exodus 30 is a symbol of the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>C. Cinnamon</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The effectiveness of Christ's death is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This Spirit is like an all-inclusive dose of medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some medicines are all-inclusive, containing some elements that nourish us and other elements that kill germs.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The all-inclusive Spirit is an all-inclusive dose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we take in this all-inclusive Spirit, it will heal us, no matter what our illness is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Within this Spirit is the nourishing element and the killing element.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The killing power of the death of Christ today is in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Colossians 3:5 Paul says, "Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and unbridled greedy lust, which is idolatry."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In our sinful members is the law of sin, which makes us captives of sin and causes our corrupted body to become the body of death Rom 7:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, our members, which are sinful, are identified with sinful things, such as fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and unbridled greedy lust.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Galatians 5:24 says, "They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ has accomplished an all-inclusive crucifixion, and we may now apply it to our lustful flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Note, however, that this is absolutely different from asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This corresponds to Romans 8:13: "For if you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By ourselves we are not able to put to death the practices of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Likewise, we are not able to crucify ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our attempts to put to death the practices of the body are nothing more than asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although we are not to practice asceticism, we are to put to death the negative things in us by the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to do this, we need to open to the Spirit and allow the Spirit to flow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through the Spirit's flowing, we shall experience the effectiveness of Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not asceticism; it is the operation of the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can experience this killing work in our daily lives.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose a brother does not care for the indwelling Spirit, but instead, rejecting the Spirit, quarrels with his wife and says some very unkind things to her.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, suppose this same brother prays himself into the Spirit, lives in the Spirit, and walks in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This will make it extremely difficult for him to argue with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As soon as he opens his mouth to quarrel with her, he will experience the element of Christ's death operating within him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then he finds it impossible to argue with her.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many married brothers have had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You may not be married, but you should apply this to your own situation with your family and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>D. Calamus</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The calamus in Exodus 30 is a reed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Hebrew root of the word myrrh means flowing, and the root for calamus means standing up.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Calamus grows in a marsh or muddy place.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But even though it grows in a marsh, it is able to shoot up into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the sequence of the spices, this calamus signifies the rising up of the Lord Jesus from the place of death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord was put into a marsh, into a death situation, but in resurrection He rose up and stood up.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Calamus, therefore, signifies the precious resurrection of Christ.</S>
