   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT THE CONSECRATION OF AARON AND HIS SONS 1 Scripture Reading: Lev 8:1-21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will begin to consider the consecration of Aaron and his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Hebrew, the word consecrate Exo 28:41; 29:9, 33, 35 means "to fill the hands."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through Aaron's consecration to receive the holy position of high priest, his empty hands were filled Lev 8:25-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word consecration is sometimes translated "ordination."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Consecration is on our side; we consecrate ourselves to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ordination is on God's side; He ordains us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a result of my study of Exodus and Leviticus, I am convinced that for Aaron and his sons to be consecrated to serve as priests meant that their empty hands were filled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Aaron and his sons appeared empty-handed before Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But when they were consecrated, their empty hands were filled with the type of Christ in different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first seven chapters of Leviticus describe five categories of offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then five kinds of laws are given concerning the application of the five kinds of offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The result of the application of these offerings is peace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Peace is the totality of what Christ is to us with God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Under Christ's redemption, we are enjoying Christ as a totality, and this totality is peace, which implies rest, enjoyment, and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After the record of the offerings, Leviticus describes the consecration of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that the offerings in chapters one through seven are for the consecration, or ordination, of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the spiritual significance of this book, we all are priests.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have been reborn, regenerated, to be priests Rev 1:6; 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As long as we have been regenerated, we are the real priests.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, we need a day of consecration on which we give ourselves to God and say, "Lord, I am Yours because You bought me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You redeemed me with Your blood, and You have regenerated me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now that I have Your life and the enjoyment of Your redemption, I would like to offer myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I give myself to You to serve You as Your servant, even as Your slave."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God will immediately accept our offer and ordain us to be His serving ones, His priests.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, consecration is on our side, and ordination is on God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Leviticus is not a book for ordinary people; it is a book for priests.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since we have been sanctified and separated from ordinary people, we are no longer common.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are a particular people we are priests.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the offerings refer to Christ, and whatever Christ is to us and does for us is to constitute us priests.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This constitution is the divine ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God constitutes us to be something different from what we are by our natural birth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In our first birth, our original birth, we were constituted sinners Rom 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Regardless of their class or social status, all human beings have been constituted sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All are sinners by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But through our second birth, we who believe in Christ have been constituted priests.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now we need our consecration and God's ordination to make our priesthood official.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Let us now consider the details concerning the consecration of Aaron and his sons.</S>
