   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DETERMINING AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE CO-WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have a few words to say about the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The basic need in the work is to know people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A doctor can use instruments such as a thermometer to measure temperature and a blood pressure cuff to measure blood pressure and pulse.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For the workers, our spirit is our instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If our spirit has been dealt with, we will know what kind of persons others are as soon as their spirit touches ours.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you are a piece of rough stone, and another rough stone is put on top, the roughness of the other stone will not be accented.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But if you are a smooth and flat piece of stone, and another piece of rough stone is placed on you, its angles and corners will be accented, and you will feel immediately which part is crooked and which part is not flat.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may not be able to pinpoint a person's mistakes, but when you touch such a one, you should be able to sense the rough parts in that person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In some places brothers have accepted co-workers on our behalf and have created many problems for us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is because many of the ones that have been accepted are uneven and rough.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I hope that we will have a deeper discernment concerning the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The workers who work in different places should bring letters of recommendation, without which they cannot be considered as our co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>WITNESS LEE'S FELLOWSHIP The Gospel Work in Foochow</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have traveled along the coastal regions of China.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have also been to the inland regions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Of all these places, no place is as good as Foochow today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While I stayed in Foochow for forty days, I saw people being saved in a very quick way, and their salvation experience was quite solid.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we were about to leave at the end of our work, God suddenly did a strong work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Originally, we thought that as long as we had ten or twenty that were willing to be baptized, we would baptize them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, we made an announcement on Thursday that we were going to talk with the candidates on Friday.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the time came, over eighty came, and over seventy were accepted for baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As soon as some came in and sat down, the brothers were clear that they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The answers the brothers received far exceeded what they hoped for.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first time we held a baptism, one hundred twenty people were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second week there were seventy to eighty.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In addition to these, there were many other ones who were waiting to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Campus Work in Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we sent all the co-workers left in Shanghai to the campuses, it would not be enough to meet the need of the three universities.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I venture to say that it is not suitable for the co-workers here in Shanghai to go to Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At Chiao-Tung University, National Medical University, and Shanghai Medical University alone, we have enough work to do already.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Chiao-Tung University has two to three thousand students.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Shanghai Medical University has a thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Western missionaries came to preach the gospel in the past, they had to build their own houses and hire their own people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But now everything is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The ones to preach the gospel are there, and the ones to hear the gospel are also there.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Chairs and lights are in the auditoriums already, and everything is so convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today we have seventy to eighty university students among us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At Chiao-Tung University sixty students are breaking the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At National Medical University we have a few dozen students.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But we are short of people, and we are short of money.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are short of these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Recently we bought a car, two passenger vans, and a big bus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Campus Work in Nanking</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Nanking we have not officially started our work yet.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But presently there are five hundred people breaking bread.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Nanking there are students who come from the remote regions of China.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Presently, there are some brothers in the church who can speak the native Sinkiang language.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once when I was preaching the gospel, the dean of a certain school stood up to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After these brothers and sisters receive four years of spiritual education, they can become our "commando'' units when they graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we do not let them go, then there is nothing to it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if we let them go, these ones will go back to their home provinces to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They will go to Mongolia, Sinkiang, and Tibet.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The problem is still the lack of money.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These schools are in the Shia-Kwang district.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is a problem for the students to come up with enough money to come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God has done much work on the campuses, and the door of the gospel is wide open.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>WATCHMAN NEE'S FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Perhaps Brother Lee will say that I have left too few co-workers in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But it is not an easy thing to make arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have opened up my spirit to the brothers, and I hope that the brothers will also open up their spirit to me.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Presently, the need in Shanghai cannot be met yet.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Brother Lee's family cannot move here yet, and Brother David Hsu's family cannot move here either.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Brother Chang Yu-zhi said that he will have to return home.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Brother Kang has quit his job at the China Textile Corporation, and he can no longer live in its dormitory.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Brother Tang Shou-ling will also quit his teaching job soon.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have a big need in preparing the outward matters to match the spiritual move.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many people criticize us in a cheap way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the end they will not move even a little finger.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We co-workers are working with a burden on our shoulders; we are not working in a light-hearted manner.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some people are here only as spectators.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our words are not for you.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Today in the Northwest, some still testify to their faith with their own blood.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We can only help them in our prayers.</S>
