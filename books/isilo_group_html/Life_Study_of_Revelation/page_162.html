THE FOURTH BEAST IN DANIEL 7</h2><p>The beast out of the sea in 13:1 is the last and crucial part of the fourth beast in Daniel (Dan. 7:7-8,19-26). Both in Daniel and in Revelation the beast out of the sea refers not only to the Roman Empire but specifically to Antichrist. Hence, eventually Antichrist is the beast out of the sea, the fourth beast in Daniel 7.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Dreadful and Terrible</h2><p>This beast is dreadful and terrible (Dan. 7:7, 19). In the past the Roman Empire did dreadful and terrible things. In the future Antichrist will also do terrible things to damage people. Both are cruel and dreadful.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Strong Exceedingly</h2><p>Daniel 7:7 reveals that the beast is &ldquo;strong exceedingly.&rdquo; The Roman Empire was the strongest heathen power in history, and Antichrist will also be extraordinarily strong, even strong in the power of Satan. As the Roman Empire conquered all the neighboring powers, so Antichrist will subdue and conquer all the powers around the Mediterranean Sea.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Having Great Iron Teeth and Brass Nails</h2><p>The beast also has great iron teeth and brass nails (Dan. 7:7, 19). The iron teeth are for eating or devouring, and the brass nails are for standing or treading.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Devouring the Whole Earth<br />and Breaking It in Pieces</h2><p>This beast devours the whole earth and breaks it into pieces (Dan. 7:7, 19, 23). Along with all the other aspects of the description of the beast, this applies firstly to the ancient Roman Empire with its Caesars and then to the coming Antichrist.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Stamping the Residue with Its Feet</h2><p>The fourth beast stamps the residue with its feet (Dan. 7:7, 19, 23). Whatever remains after the devouring and breaking will be stamped by the beast. This was true of the Roman Empire in the past, and it will also be true of Antichrist in the future.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Having Ten Horns</h2><p>The beast also has ten horns (Dan. 7:7, 20, 24). These ten horns correspond to the ten toes of the great image in chapter two. According to the vision of the great image in Daniel 2, the ten kings represented by the ten toes are, in God&rsquo;s view, the lowest part of the body. However, in the vision in Daniel chapter seven these ten kingdoms represented by the ten kings are exalted as the ten horns. In chapter two these kings are the lowest, and in chapter seven they are the highest. Whether these kings are the lowest or the highest depends upon our viewpoint. If we view them from the perspective of heaven, they will be the lowest. However, if we view them from a worldly perspective, these kingdoms will seem to be the highest. Furthermore, worldly politics and worldly kingdoms are, in the eyes of God, like wild beasts which do nothing except damage and devour people. But in the eyes of Nebuchadnezzar, that is, in human eyes, the worldly kingdoms seem to be a great and glorious image.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_161.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_163.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Revelation &nbsp; pg 162</div><br></body></html>
