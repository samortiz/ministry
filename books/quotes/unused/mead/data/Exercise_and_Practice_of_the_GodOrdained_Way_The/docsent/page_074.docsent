   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>USING LIFE LESSONS IN THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In six months of taking care of the home meetings in a weekly way, you should mainly try to help the new believers according to the lessons in Life Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Of course, you cannot finish all forty-eight lessons in only twenty or so weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But as those caring for the home meetings, we should become acquainted with all forty-eight lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The book Life Lessons was written according to the sequence of Christian experience, not according to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet these lessons should not be taught as a textbook.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You should put these forty-eight lessons within your heart, becoming very familiar with their content.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then as you prepare to go to the home meetings, you will have a deep sensation concerning which point you need to work into the new ones by feeding them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your purpose and goal may be to help the new brothers to know and experience their regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But when you arrive at the home meeting, the atmosphere and the real need may be altogether different.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The urgent need may be to share with them something about dealing with idols.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To postpone this matter another week would be too late.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, you must put aside the matter of the human spirit and immediately pick up the matter of dealing with idols.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By sharing this matter, you cover another one of the forty-eight lessons on that visit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On your next visit, you may still have the human spirit as your goal in feeding the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The atmosphere, however, may still not be for the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It may be on knowing the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With such an atmosphere, to insist on discharging your burden concerning the human spirit would be something of legality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It would also be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You must fit into the situation, sensing the atmosphere and giving a word concerning the Bible, the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By doing this, you spontaneously cover another lesson among the forty-eight.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may not have used a copy of the book Life Lessons, but you covered one of its lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By doing this again and again, you will eventually cover each lesson in the book in a living and flexible way according to the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To work in the home meetings is to nourish the new believers with the baby food contained in the Life Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Each lesson is like a jar of baby food.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You should keep each lesson in the "pocket" of your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then whenever there is a need, like a medical doctor after the diagnosis, you are able to meet any patient's need.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You not only know what medicine to prescribe, but also will have the medicine on hand to give to them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to nourish the babes with baby food.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not conduct the home meetings in an aimless way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should always conduct the home meetings with the aim of injecting one of the Life Lessons into the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may not be able to finish all forty-eight lessons with one new believer in six months, but we may be able to complete at least twenty within that period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The material contained in one lesson may be too much for one injection, but we must realize that each lesson is like a "basket of peaches."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Perhaps only a portion of the basket is needed for the new believer we are caring for.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must feed the new believers according to their need.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>LEARNING TO CARE FOR PEOPLE BEING A LIFELONG MATTER</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For many years in the churches, we have suffered loss for two reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We did not feed people in home meetings, and we did not know how to feed people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the past someone may have been baptized, and we may have had the burden to visit him; but after several visits, we lost interest because we did not know what to do, and there was little result.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Likewise, the new believer we visited had little interest in continuing to receive our visits.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all must learn to do the work of home meetings to nourish the new believers with baby food.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From 1940 to 1943 in the church in Chefoo, I began to learn how to visit the homes and how to take care of new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now I am just opening some doors for you to learn as much as you can.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this training, I am simply opening the doors and giving directions for you to go and learn more.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Gradually, day after day, as we take care of two or three new believers year-round, we will bear two or three remaining fruit yearly into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the course of our lifetime, we may bring one hundred to one hundred fifty into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Be assured that when we enter into the eternal tabernacles Luke 16:9 , these one hundred to one hundred fifty will welcome us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What a wonderful life this is!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Doing the work of nourishing the believers in the home meetings builds the church and helps us to know what it means to be built up with others.</S>
