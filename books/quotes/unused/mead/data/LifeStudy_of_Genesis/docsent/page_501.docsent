   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE FLOW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One day Brother Nee told me that he and the other co-workers were burdened that I move to Shanghai with my family to stay with them and work with them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He asked me to bring this matter to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As I took the matter to the Lord and prayed about it, the Lord showed me from the book of Acts that in His move on earth there is only one flow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This flow started from Jerusalem and spread to Antioch, and from Antioch it turned to Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord told me that for His move in China there should not be two flows or two origins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I had been burdened for north China.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before I had gone to see Brother Nee, I had conducted a thorough study on the Song of Songs in the summer of 1933.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But although I was definitely burdened for north China, Brother Nee and the co-workers felt that I should move to Shanghai, stay there, and work with them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At this time the Lord showed me that I had to get into the one flow that had started from Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I saw that from Shanghai the flow would proceed to the north and to other parts of the country.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, I decided to move to Shanghai and to stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From that time onward, I have been in the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have been absolutely clear that this is the Lord's flow and His move on earth in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Using today's word, I knew that I had found Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE MINISTRY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FLOW</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because I knew I was in the Lord's flow and that this flow had already started, I also realized that there was a ministry responsible for that flow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the result of seeing this, I strongly decided to forget all my past learning and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fact that I had been able to conduct a detailed study on Song of Songs indicates that I had some knowledge and that I could do something.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I had learned a good deal about the Bible in my seven and a half years with the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I knew the types, the prophecies, and various other things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Moreover, a church had been established through me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, I realized that the Lord's flow on the earth must be one, that the flow had already begun, and that there was a ministry carrying on this flow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I knew that I had to be in the flow and to be under the ministry responsible for the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who were with us in the early years can testify that, apart from the messages I gave in the meetings, I never said anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In view of the fact that Brother Nee was present, I dropped all my concepts, all my learnings, and all my experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was the one used by the Lord to start the flow and he had the ministry to carry on the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There was no need for my opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, this does not mean that I did nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>During the next eighteen or twenty years, I did a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But everything was according to Brother Nee's leading, not according to my opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I never ministered anything according to myself; I only ministered the messages delivered by Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In those years I never expressed my opinion or concept; instead, I wholly followed Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord is flowing in His move on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This flow was not started by you, but by others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, there is a ministry responsible for the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is difficult for me to speak about this because now the matter is very much related to me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If I were still on the mainland and the flow were related to Brother Nee's ministry, I would have the ground to say much more.</S>
