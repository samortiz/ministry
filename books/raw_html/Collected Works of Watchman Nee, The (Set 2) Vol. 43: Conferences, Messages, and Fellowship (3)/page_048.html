<h2 class="head1">REALIZING THAT WE ARE HOPELESS<br />AND ACCEPTING CHRIST AS OUR VICTORY</h2><p>During the past two years, I have seen two kinds of sickness among many believers. One is temper, and the other is anxiety. Many people only know that temper is a sin. They do not realize that anxiety is also a sin. Many people cannot deal with their temper. Neither reading the Bible nor praying will help them. They struggle for eight or ten years, yet still remain the same. They can do nothing about themselves, and they see no change in them at all. God knows that we do not have a way in ourselves. This is why He gave us another way. His way is to remove us and have the Lord Jesus be our life and victory within and to live instead of us. Many of us have not seen this. As a result we wonder what we should do.</p><p>When I was preaching in England, a friend of mine invited me to his home which was not far away. He had several sons. He and his wife could not overcome, and they were continually defeated. When one child cried, he became unhappy. When the second one cried, he became angry. When the third child cried, he could not hold back his temper. He often tried his best to suppress his temper, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not suppress it. He insisted that I come to his house to tell them how they could overcome.</p><p>When I went that evening, his wife said, "Mr. Nee, you know what victory means. Both of us want to overcome, but our children are very trying on us. We can overcome everything else, but our children are our real test. We can be patient when we are among our friends and in the church. But we fail completely with our children." When I heard this, I laughed because I realized that here were two more persons whom Christ could deliver. Some people are too moral and too refined; they can never realize the meaning of victory. The Lord only has a way with those who cannot find their own way. This was why I laughed; I felt that they were ready for deliverance.</p><p>I asked the wife, "Why do you want to be patient?" She said, "Because I have a quick disposition. I have asked God to give me patience so that I will not lose my temper." I said, "You can do nothing about this, and you have asked God for patience, but He has not given it to you. Is that right?" She said, "That's right. I have prayed for eight or nine years, but God seems to have ignored my prayer; He has not given me any patience." I said, "You have asked God for patience, but He knows that you do not need it. He has not given you patience, because you are not lacking in patience." She said, "Mr. Nee, what do you mean? I have never heard of such a teaching. Don't you think that I lack patience? Are you saying that I do not need patience?" I said, "That is right. You lack only one thing&mdash;Christ. God has put Christ in us to be our life, righteousness, holiness, redemption, and patience. Everything that God wants to give us is in Christ. God has given us Christ so that Christ would overcome on our behalf."</p><p>Then she realized that the way to victory had nothing to do with her. It is not we who overcome; it is Christ who overcomes. This is the biblical secret to victory. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. It is not the power of Christ that lives in me, but Christ Himself who lives in me. I no longer live; it is altogether Christ who lives. This is victory. This was God's goal in the garden of Eden&mdash;that Christ would live for man within him. God's goal is for Christ to be life to man.</p><p>Once I was at a brother's house, and his wife said to me, "Mr. Nee, something has been wrong with me for the last few days. Everything with my family has been fine except for my few children, who have been very naughty. If I lock them up in the house, they become rowdy, and if I let them out of the house, they fight with other children. They cannot keep quiet in the house, and I worry about them when they leave the house. Many times I am driven to tears by anxiety over them. I cannot do anything about it. What should I do?" I smiled because when man does not have a way, the Lord will have a way. I said to her, "Is victory something of yourself or of Christ? If it is of you, you will not know what to do when there are three or four more children. But if it is of Christ, will three or four children fighting with each other be too much for Christ to overcome? Of course not! You are failing because you are bearing this burden. This is why you cannot be patient. But if Christ lives for you and Christ disciplines your children for you, you will be patient."</p>
