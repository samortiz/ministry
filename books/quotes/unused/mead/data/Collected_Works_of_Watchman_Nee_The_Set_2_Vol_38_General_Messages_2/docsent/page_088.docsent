   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE EXPOSITION OF ROMANS 5:12 8:39 ROMANS 5:12-21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 5:12-21 says that everyone in the world is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man is born in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A man becomes a sinner first, and then he sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He does not sin and then become a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He sins because he is already a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Romans 1:1 5:11 speaks of the sins that man has committed; it deals with what man has done, not with what man is in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 5:12-21 speaks of what a Christian is; it speaks of the inward constitution of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our deliverance is through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This passage of the Scripture says that the sins committed in Romans 1:1 5:11 are forgiven and that we will rejoice in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, this does not mean necessarily that our hearts can rejoice at present.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Salvation and deliverance are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Salvation refers to God's forgiveness of what we have done our sins and this is once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Deliverance refers to freedom from the power of sin, from what we are inwardly our person so that we are no longer under any bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is something we can experience day by day and moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>ROMANS 6:1-11</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans 6:1-11 shows that God's way of deliverance is to put us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First, He terminates us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then He gives us a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The way of deliverance is by death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The starting point of deliverance is a revelation of our relationship with Adam; it is seeing that we are of Adam and in Adam and are hopeless sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All that we are is nothing but sin, and all that we can do is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We inherited everything that Adam was and had.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This realization of our relationship with Adam and the fact of our hopelessness is the beginning of our deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The realization of our deliverance also comes through a revelation of our relationship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has "grafted" the believers into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through baptism we are "grafted" into the Lord's death, and through resurrection we are "grafted" into Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is like the grafting of the fruit tree; the poor tree is grafted into the good tree.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A branch of the poor tree is first cut off and then grafted into the good tree.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way, the poor branch is joined to the good tree and absorbs into itself the nature of the good tree.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Grafting" means the adoption of a new nature, while "crucifixion" is a discarding of the dried branches so that old branches will not grow again.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are grafted into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our old nature is crucified because we are joined to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are delivered from the old nature through death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the same time, we are joined to Christ through resurrection, through our union in life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why we have to reckon ourselves dead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our deliverance from sin is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>ROMANS 6:12-23</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Romans 6:12-23 says that from this point on, the believers must consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Consecration means that we are no longer our own.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We consecrate because we have died and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Consecration does not mean that we offer what we originally had to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is offering what He has accomplished in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The result of this consecration is sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Consecration means that we no longer take control of ourselves; rather, we allow God to take control of us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We no longer live; instead, Christ lives for us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we allow God to take control of us and live for us, the new life will grow and the new nature will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How beautiful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>ROMANS 7</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Romans 7 speaks of a man who wants to do good by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This brings in trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Romans 6 shows that the old man and sin have been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Romans 7 speaks of the flesh trying to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Actually, God has no intention that man do good.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His intention is that Christ live within us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He wants Christ to live instead of us, and He wants Christ to work instead of us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, God has no intention that we act according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must be delivered from the law and not try to please God by keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The law is God's demand; it demands that man do good.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But today, God is not after men who do good.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He wants men to do things through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God wants us to accept Christ as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His intention is that we no longer sin and also that we no longer try to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we do not try to do anything, we will be delivered from sin as well as the righteousness that is according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When the old man dies, we are delivered from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the new man lives, we belong to Christ.</S>
