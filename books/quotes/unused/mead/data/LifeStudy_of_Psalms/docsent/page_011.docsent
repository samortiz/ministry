   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As a Concubine, Symbolized by Hagar</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Second, the position of the law is that of a concubine, symbolized by Hagar Gal 4:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul told us in Galatians 4 that Abraham had two wives.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One was the orthodox wife, Sarah, and the other was the concubine, Hagar vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>22-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all know that a man's concubine does not have an orthodox position.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul indicated that Sarah signifies the new covenant of grace, and he pointed out that Hagar symbolizes the old covenant of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, the law's position is that of a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In God's creation, He did not ordain man to have a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He ordained that man should have one wife Matt 19:3-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Anyone that has more than one wife enters into corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not try to bring a concubine into God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are appreciating and uplifting the law, we are bringing a concubine into God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is absolutely against God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The law as a concubine entered in alongside the main line of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whoever is of the law, is a child of the concubine, not a son of the free woman.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The law does not have an orthodox position.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The followers of the law are not the children of the orthodox wife.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ishmael, the son of the concubine, Hagar, was looked down on and was chased away.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was chased away from the main line of God's economy, the line of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must remember this point in our interpretation of Psalm 1.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The writer of Psalm 1 uplifted the law according to the human concept, which is contradicting to the main line of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>B. Its Nature 1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Holy, Righteous, and Good</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we need to see the nature of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In its nature, the law is holy, righteous, and good Rom 7:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Spiritual</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The law is also spiritual 7:14a .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is because the law was God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since the Ten Commandments are God's speaking, they are God's breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All Scripture is God-breathed 2 Tim 3:16a .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The entire Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible considered as the law, is God's breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's breathing, of course, is altogether spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, in this sense, the law is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although the position of the law is not right, the nature of the law is good.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the point where troubles can arise in our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The positive school stands on the nature of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They point out that Paul said that the law is holy, righteous, good, and even spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then they ask, "How could you say the law is negative?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is true that the nature of the law is good and spiritual, but its position is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A lady may be good and spiritual in her nature, yet still be a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This lady may be a "golden" lady, a spiritual lady, but she does not have an orthodox position.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The nature of the law is good because the law is spiritual, being the word of God Psa 119:103, 105, 130 and the breath of God 2 Tim 3:16a .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why we may have a problem in our understanding of the law when we come to Psalm 119.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to realize that Psalm 119 refers to the word again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No other psalm refers to the law as God's word so much.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In verses 147-148, the psalmist said that he anticipated the morning dawn that he might meditate in the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The psalmist said here that he meditated, not in the law but in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Psalm 119:103 does not say that the law is so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead, the psalmist declares here how sweet the Lord's word is to his taste.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because the law is the word of God, it is good and spiritual in its nature.</S>
