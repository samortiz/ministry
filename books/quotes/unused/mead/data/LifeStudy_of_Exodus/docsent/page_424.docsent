   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR THE ADEQUATE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we as the church would be the breastplate of judgment, we must fulfill certain requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, we need to be transformed and transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then Christ as the letters of the spiritual alphabet must be inscribed into us clearly and definitely.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is to have the adequate experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Recently a brother testified that often, when the leading ones speak to new ones or young ones about the experience of Christ, these leading ones realize that they themselves do not have the clear and definite experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not try to minister Christ to others, we may not realize how short we are concerning the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we try to speak to others about the experience of Christ, we may find that we ourselves are still very short of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may have little of the real experience of Christ to minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As those who would shepherd the saints, we need the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Otherwise we shall lack the proper spiritual vocabulary required for ministering Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may want to minister Christ to others, but what experience of Christ do we have?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To some extent, we may be able to teach the Bible, for we may have been reading and studying it for years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when it comes to ministering Christ, we have a shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not have that much of Christ inscribed into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps we have only part of a letter inscribed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the situation of many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, it is very difficult to know the Lord s leading through the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because there is such a shortage of transformation, transparency, inscribing, and enlightening, we need to pray that we may become transparent, have more of Christ inscribed into us, and experience more enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then we shall realize that, even if we are full of Christ, we still have a shortage, for something of Christ s riches is still lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what is indicated by the marvelous picture of the breastplate with the Urim and the Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>RECOGNIZING OUR NEED FOR MORE EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With the breastplate and the Urim and the Thummim we see two kinds of alphabets.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One kind of alphabet is for inscribing, and the other kind is for completing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are not yet full of Christ, what we need is the inscribing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ must be inscribed into us until we are full of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is when we are full of Christ that we recognize the need for completion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, if we are not full of Christ, we need Him as the alphabet for inscription.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But when we are full of Him, we need Him as the alphabet for our completion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Believers like the Apostle Paul, those who are full of Christ, realize that they still need Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, those who are short of Christ may not sense the need for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many of today s lukewarm Christians do not have any realization of how much they need Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is when we have Christ inscribed into us that we realize we are still short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we shall seek Him to be our completion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It surely is a mercy of the Lord we can speak about Christ inscribed into us and Christ completing us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not easy to find Christians who speak concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What we need now is more experience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only through experience can we understand what it is to have Christ inscribed into us and to have Him complete us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we all need to pray more regarding these things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I hope that every local church will become a breastplate according to the picture in Exodus 28.</S>
