   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXAMPLE OF ABRAHAM'S JUSTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verses 21 through 25, two examples are given.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Both are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They show us what justification by faith really is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 21 says, "Was not Abraham our father justified by works in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>James 2 mentions the case of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Galatians 3 and Romans 4 also mention the case of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul says that man is justified by faith, not by works, and he uses the case of Abraham as proof.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both Romans 4 and Galatians 3 prove that man is justified by faith rather than by works.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>James also mentions the case of Abraham, but he uses it to prove that man is justified not only by faith, but by works as well.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If he had used other persons, we might not understand this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But in mentioning the case of Abraham, we can surely understand what justification by faith really is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In using the case of Abraham, Paul refers to Genesis 15, whereas James refers to Genesis 22.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Genesis 15 God promised Abraham that his seed would be like the stars in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Galatians 3, Paul puts strong emphasis on God's promise to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the book of Galatians, Paul repeatedly talks about the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word promise is used very frequently in the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul uplifts the promise in Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do you know what a promise is?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the whole world, there is only one way for man to receive a promise, and that is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no other way for a man to receive a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is only this one condition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If God says that we must do something and we do it, it is work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But God did not tell Abraham that He would give him something if Abraham did this or that.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, God said that He would give him descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How did Abraham receive the promise?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There was no other way but by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suppose a brother tells his son that if he memorizes a list of vocabulary words tonight, he will receive five pieces of candy tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the son is to receive the five pieces of candy, he has to memorize the words.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if the brother simply promises his son five pieces of candy, what does his son have to do?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Will he say, "I have to do this or that before I can get the candy"?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The child does not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All he has to do is believe that his father will do it for him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Genesis 15 God did not give Abraham one single thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is as if God said, "I will do it for you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I will give you descendants."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Abraham believed in God, and that was reckoned to him as righteousness Gen 15:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Going back to the example of the brother's son, the child may say, "Will my father really give me five pieces of candy?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It does not seem like such a good thing could ever happen."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If he thinks this way, he does not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everyone who wants to understand the book of Galatians must realize that a promise is without condition and without work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One does not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Father has done everything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thank the Lord that everything that God promises He will accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As long as God is trustworthy, everything is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even if one tries to do a work, it will not avail.</S>
