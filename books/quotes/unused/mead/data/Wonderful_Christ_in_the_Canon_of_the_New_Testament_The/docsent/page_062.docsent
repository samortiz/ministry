   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRECIOUS STONES, NOT BRICKS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we must see something of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everyone knows that to build a proper building there is the need of the proper materials.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is why for God s building there is the urgent need for transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that the New Jerusalem is built with precious stones Rev 21:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Precious stones are not created, but transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, for the building of the church, we all need to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Naturally speaking, we were made with clay.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But God could never make the New Jerusalem with clay.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the buildings of Satan, such as the city and tower of Babel, the pleasure cities of Egypt, and Babylon, were built with bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Bible, brick is the production of man s natural work, of man s human labor with clay.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But precious stones are something transformed, not made with human labor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All of Satan s cities were built with bricks, but God s city is built with precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All natural things are not good for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For God s building transformation is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is clear that we all have different kinds of personalities.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some are quick, some are slow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some are humble, others are proud.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some are kind, and others are hard.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But none of these are good for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are all muddy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Regardless of how loving you are, your love is a muddy love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Your humility is muddy and your kindness is muddy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everything natural is muddy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why the Lord has brought all of us to the cross and terminated us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not one of our natural dispositions is good for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All of our dispositions must go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we need something new, something divine, something heavenly, something holy, and something eternal to replace our natural make-up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why we need transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Among today s Christians, it would be difficult to find a place where you could hear someone give a message on transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Most of the messages are on correction, adjusting, and improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They even quote 2 Timothy 3:16 to say that the Bible is good for correction.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the Lord does not need the corrected things; He needs the transformed things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For the building up of the church, we must have transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The building up of the church could never avail by our natural character, regardless of how good we are.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is just building with bricks, but there is no place in God s building for bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the New Jerusalem there is only one kind of material the precious stones which have been transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What God needs is the transformed precious stones for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE REAL FOOD AND THE REAL DRINK</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>FOR TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Transformation is not something corrected; it is something transformed from one essence into another element.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, we need another element to get into us, and this other element is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, eating and drinking cause a great deal of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Day by day our body is undergoing a process of metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>New elements get into our body to discharge and replace the old.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is called metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our body is constantly being metabolized, which gives us the daily newness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the same way we must take Christ in daily.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why the Bible tells us that Christ is our food and drink John 6:35, 57; 1 Cor 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This should not be just a term; it must be our spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then Christ will get into us to be the new element to replace and discharge all of the old things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this way we will have a divine metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only transformed brothers and sisters are good for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How much we could be built into the church depends upon how much we will be transformed, and the way to be transformed is to eat and drink Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the New Jerusalem there is the tree of life and the river of water of life Rev 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is why the whole city is something transformed because the whole city is maintained by eating the tree of life and drinking the water of life Rev 22:14, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today, the church life is a miniature of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What we need for the church is simply the daily eating and drinking of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Trying to correct or improve ourselves will never work.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What we must do is learn to take Christ in every day, eating Him by pray-reading the Word, and drinking Him by calling on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All day long we must call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I know that some people are opposing this kind of calling, saying that it is just vain repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Yes, it is repetition, but it is not vain.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Breathing is repetition, but I do not suggest that you stop.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We can never graduate from breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I have been breathing for over 70 years, but I do not plan to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Eating is also repetitious; every day we eat at least three times.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All of the things that sustain life must be repeated.</S>
