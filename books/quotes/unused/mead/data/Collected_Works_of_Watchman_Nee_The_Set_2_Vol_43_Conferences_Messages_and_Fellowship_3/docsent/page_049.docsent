   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OVERCOMING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING AN EXCHANGE, NOT A CHANGE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My friends, have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You cannot do anything about yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You can only fail.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Victory is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot make it, but Christ can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The problem with us is that even though we cannot make it, we try to bear the burden ourselves and refuse to let Christ bear it for us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many people are ignorant of the way of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They only know how to seek after power and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Little do they realize that when they have Christ, they have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Victory is a matter of substitution by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not overcome by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Please be very assured before the Lord of this fact: Victory is not a change in ourselves; it is Christ overcoming for us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The overcoming life is an exchange, not a change.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not a change from our own failures to our own victories.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have failed, and God has terminated the defeated "I" through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He has put the victorious Christ within us to live for us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our life has been exchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We were defeated, but God has put Christ within us and has replaced our "I" with "Christ" so that now we can overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The secret to victory is in the little word exchange.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many people hope to change, but no matter how hard they try, they are still themselves!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only when Christ lives for us within will we experience victory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Two years ago I spoke about the subject of victory in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I said that victory is not a matter of changing our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not a changed life, but an exchanged life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man only wants to change himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But in God's eyes, we are wicked beyond hope.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are thoroughly corrupted, and there is no way for us to be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every kind of sin dwells within man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the sins of the world dwell within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not say that others can be robbers and prostitutes and that we cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can commit any sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We do not commit them because by God's mercy we are not faced with that environment and temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God has crucified our old man through the cross of the Lord, and Christ is living within us to be our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our life is totally exchanged; it is not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>GOD'S SALVATION BEING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>FOR CHRIST TO LIVE FOR US</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once, over ten years ago, I had six dollars in my pocket, and I bought a watch for myself, which cost five dollars and eighty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was a watch with a famous American brand name.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I purchased it, I was given a certificate of warranty, guaranteeing free service and maintenance on the watch for two years from the date of purchase.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I took the watch home, and on the second day, it was off by two and a half hours.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Other watches worked for twenty-four hours, but my watch only worked twenty-one and a half hours.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I took it to the shop and asked them about it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The men said that they would fix it for me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After two days I took the watch home, but it was an hour off after only one day.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I took the watch back for repair, and it was supposedly fixed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After I took it home again, it was in the same position after just one day; it had not moved at all.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I again took the watch back and asked why it did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The men could only say, "Okay.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not complain anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We will fix it for you."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I took the watch home a week later, and the next day I noticed that it was three hours faster.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I took it back and said, "I have had this watch for just twenty days.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But fourteen of these days, it has been in your shop.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I had it for only six days.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Is this watch yours or is it mine?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since you cannot fix it, can I exchange it for another one?"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The men insisted that there was no such guarantee; the warranty only guaranteed that they would fix it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If the watch broke down, I could bring it back to the shop as often as needed, and they would fix it until the two-year period expired.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>My friends, do you see what I am talking about?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Repair and exchange are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Repairing something is fixing something that is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But exchanging something is turning in the old thing for something new.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God's way of salvation is the way of exchange.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Man wants God to give him the strength to do good, but a broken watch cannot be changed into a good one no matter how much one tries to fix it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The only way is to exchange it for a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God's way of salvation is not to help us overcome, but for Christ to overcome in our place.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Have you seen what Galatians 2:20 is about?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is simply us not living; our living has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is no longer us, but Christ who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Victory has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have nothing to do with victory itself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Christ is living for us and living out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is not a matter of living by Christ, through Christ, because of Christ, or by the power of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is a matter of not being us at all.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have absolutely no part; Christ is living on our behalf.</S>
