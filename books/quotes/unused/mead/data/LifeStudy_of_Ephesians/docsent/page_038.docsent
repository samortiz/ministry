   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE TWELVE SEALED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have pointed out that 1:3-14 can be divided into three sections: the well-speaking of the Father vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>3-6 , the well-speaking of the Son vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>7-12 , and the well-speaking of the Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God the Father has purposed, God the Son has accomplished what the Father purposed, and God the Spirit is applying what the Son accomplished according to the Father s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the Father purposed, the Son accomplished, and the Spirit applies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In these verses we have a purpose, an accomplishment, and an application.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this message we come to the application.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE SEAL AND THE PLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to 1:13 and 14, the Spirit s application is of two aspects: the seal and the pledge, or, as I like to say, the sealing and the pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Spirit s application is His sealing and His pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, the Spirit Himself is both the seal and the pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Both the seal of the Spirit and the pledge of the Spirit involve movement within us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the seal is actually the sealing, and the pledge, the pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not only is the Spirit a seal upon us, but He is now sealing us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not only is He a pledge guaranteeing our inheritance, but He is now pledging within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this message we shall consider the sealing of the Spirit, and in the next message, the pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE SEAL SIGNIFYING OWNERSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I was young, I heard the Brethren teachers speak about the seal of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I also read about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But I never heard about the sealing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The seal is one thing, and the sealing is another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be sealed with the Holy Spirit means to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have been made God s inheritance v. 11 . At the time we were saved, God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God s image signified by the seal, thus making us like God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose a brother puts a seal on his Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When he does so, his Bible bears the image of the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This seal indicates that the Bible belongs to him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, the seal signifies ownership.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of God sealed us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This signifies that God is our owner and that we belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I was young, I was told strongly that I belonged to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I was also taught that no matter how much we grieved the Holy Spirit, He would never leave us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those from the Arminian school of theology, however, disagree with this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Years ago a German mission in China published a booklet concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One of the pictures in this booklet showed a dove, signifying the Holy Spirit, flying away from a believer who had grieved Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Brethren attacked this teaching, saying that after the Holy Spirit has come into us, He never leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Their teaching regarding the seal of the Holy Spirit was very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They said, Once the seal has been put on you, it cannot be taken away, no matter what you do.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I agree with the teaching that the Spirit will never leave us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this matter the Brethren were correct; however, they were too doctrinal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE SEAL BEARING THE IMAGE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every seal has an image.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the seal is square, then the image is also square.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Spirit as the seal of God upon us bears the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This implies that the seal of the Holy Spirit is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When you bear the Holy Spirit as the seal of God upon you, you bear the image of God and the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I first read about this in a book by Brother Nee, I was very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Not only did I have the seal indicating that God was my owner, but along with this seal I had the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That happiness, however, did not last very long.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After a short while, I discovered that I did not actually have the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yes, the seal of the Spirit was upon me, but I did not have the image.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The seal was one thing and I was another.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I had the seal upon me, but I did not live a life of the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whenever we come to know a certain truth or doctrine apart from experience, we shall eventually be troubled by our lack of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The doctrine may be very good, but we may have very little experience of it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This causes us to be puzzled, for the Bible says one thing and our experience says another.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What we are simply does not correspond with what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Bible says that we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means that we bear the image, the expression, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, according to our experience, it seems that we do not have the seal or the image.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I do not want to be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am troubled whenever the Bible says one thing and my daily life says another.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Later I found the secret in the matter of the seal in 1:13 and 14.</S>
