<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(3)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 19, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER K. H.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. When I was a baby, I received the rite of sprinkling. Later I attended Bible classes. When I was a teen-ager, I received confirmation and became a regular member of the church, eligible to partake of the holy communion. All of these were formalities of the Anglican Church. During my first year in college, I was led to a clear knowledge of salvation through private conversations with Brother Nee. After I was saved, I began to meet with the local church in my locality. In 1935 I attended the Overcomer Conference under Brother Nee in Chuanchow, Fukien province, and consecrated myself completely to the Lord. After my consecration, I found my life completely changed. In the summer of 1936, I quit my teaching job and began to serve the Lord full-time. First, I worked in Canton and then in Hong Kong. Following this I preached the gospel and built up churches in K'un-ming and other cities in Yunnan province. In 1941 I returned from K'un-ming to Hong Kong and served with the saints in the church. In the spring of 1948, I went to Shanghai and attended the national co-workers' and elders' conference. This summer I find myself able to attend this four-month training at Kuling Mountain, Fukien. I would like to ask my brother a question: How can we tell what our own ministry is?</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Following the Lord by Violence</h2><p>In his pursuit of the Lord, our brother has to be more violent and aggressive (Matt. 11:12). He has to take a few violent steps. When God brings you to a crossroads, you have to make a violent choice. If you do this, the lessons you learn in two or three years will equal what you otherwise could learn only in twenty or thirty years. Our brother has a pure spirit, and he has been going on step by step in a very solid way.</p><h2 class="head2">Controlling Our Smile While We Speak</h2><p>I have known Brother Weigh for a long time. I would ask for his permission to say something. Perhaps I do not have to ask for permission. I want to mention one very small matter. If you want your spirit to be fully released, you have to hold back your smile a little. Your facial expression, voice, and attitude all should be focused in one direction. Your smile sometimes becomes a distraction to you. At times of solemnity, your smile is like a brake on a bicycle rolling down the hill. Your smile in your preaching is a brake; it frustrates the release of your spirit. In ministering the word to others, the smile on our face is a frustration to the power within; it is inversely proportional to the amount of power we have within. We cannot peddle a bicycle and apply the brake at the same time. This will strip our ministry of the word of its effectiveness.</p><h2 class="head2">Rich in Thoughts</h2><p>In the ministry of the word, thoughts are useful. You have to ask the Lord to grant you mercy to have rich thoughts. When God wants to speak through man, the Holy Spirit supplies the speaker with active, living thoughts. When we read the Bible, we have to meditate on the Lord's word by means of the Holy Spirit. This will make our thoughts rich. If our thoughts are not rich, we will lower the level of the Spirit's speaking.</p><p>You have to be more violent in following the Lord. When you speak you have to control your smile. At the same time your thoughts have to be rich and active. You must also push out your spirit to release the word.</p><h2 class="head2">The Formation of Ministry</h2><p>The ministry we possess is based on the work that God performs on us. When God brings us through trials, He makes us certain persons. The kind of pathway a man takes and the trials he suffers determine the kind of ministry he has. Paul suffered much, and he was comforted much. He was able to comfort those who needed comfort. Whatever God has done and is doing in us will make us the kind of person we are. That will be our ministry. We can only handle what we ourselves have experienced. A young man can learn to say something, but the words will be somewhat awkward to others' ears. It will be like a Foochow native speaking Mandarin; the Foochow accent will always be there. If we want to serve all men, we have to go through all kinds of trials. The greater the ministry, the greater the trials. C. H. Spurgeon once stated simply, "If you have never wept for sin, you will tell a sinner not to worry about sin; you will tell him that there is no need to weep." This is, of course, the greatest mistake in the whole world. A doctor with little training cannot rush to treat patients. This will not work. He must have experience with an illness before he can treat others with the same illness.</p><p>If God's intention is to commit more responsibilities to us, we should not be surprised when we face more trials from different directions. Paul received the greatest ministry. This is the reason 2 Corinthians tells us of his many trials. The most precious book in the entire New Testament is 2 Corinthians. Ephesians is the highest book; it tells us about the Lord. But 2 Corinthians is the most precious book; it tells us about a man who reached the loftiest height, and about the kind of things he saw and attained. Other books do not show us as much about the person of Paul. He was a lofty man. This is the reason God gave him all kinds of revelations and allowed him to be tried materially, psychologically, physically, supernaturally, spiritually, and in things related to the church. Whatever way God leads us, that is the ministry that He will work out in us. The lessons we learn will determine the ministry we have. We should not think that we can receive a cheap ministry from the hand of the Lord. God will never let us go. The discipline of the Holy Spirit is arranging everything day by day. We can never escape this education. It is most foolish for a man to try to run away from God or to circumvent His dealings.</p>
