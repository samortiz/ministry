<h2 class="head1">A FULL VIEW OF THE UNIVERSE</h2><p>Paul, the new man in Christ, was on the one hand caught away to the third heaven. On the other hand, he was caught away to Paradise, the comfortable section of Hades. Because Paul came to know the things in heaven and the things under the earth as well as the things on earth, he had a complete view of the universe. Anyone who would have a full view of the universe must know these three sections: the third heaven, the earth, and the region under the earth.</p><p>Paul was an educated person concerning the things on the earth. One day the Lord took him away to the third heaven and let him see what was there. He also took him away to Paradise to show him what was there. Regarding Paradise, Paul said that he heard things &ldquo;which it is not allowed a man to speak&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:4). Thus, he was not at liberty to tell the Corinthians about them. Paul, a new man in Christ, certainly had a complete knowledge and a full view of the entire universe.</p><p>Compared to Paul, the Judaizers were like frogs in a well. They could not see beyond the circle of the well of the Old Testament and of Judaism with its rituals. But Paul could boast of visions and revelations of the Lord. He could say, &ldquo;Corinthians, the Lord has given me a wonderful view of the whole universe. He brought me away to the third heaven, and he brought me to Paradise. In Paradise I heard utterances which I am not allowed to speak of.&rdquo; No wonder Paul refers to the transcendence of the revelations given to him (v. 7). Only two people, Jesus and Paul, have received such a full view of the universe.</p><h2 class="head1">REVELATION FOLLOWED BY SUFFERING</h2><p>In verses 6 and 7 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;For if I should desire to boast, I shall not be foolish, for I will speak the truth; but I refrain, lest anyone should account of me above what he sees of me or hears from me. Wherefore also, that I should not be exceedingly lifted up by the transcendence of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, that he might buffet me, that I should not be exceedingly lifted up.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;transcendence&rdquo; also means superabundance, exceeding greatness, excess. The word for thorn is often used in classical Greek in the sense of a stake or of a sharp-pointed staff. Here it may refer to a kind of physical suffering, like the trouble Paul had with his eyes. The Greek word for &ldquo;buffet&rdquo; means to beat with a clenched fist. This is different from the word rendered buffet in 1 Corinthians 9:27, a word that means to beat under the eye.</p><p>Verse 7 indicates that revelation is always followed by suffering. For a human being to see a view like that beheld by Paul is very dangerous. Even for Paul there was a risk in seeing such a view. The danger is that after receiving this kind of transcendent revelation, Paul would be lifted up and become proud. In His sovereignty, the Lord, in order to enlarge Paul and to broaden his view to a universal extent, brought him to the third heaven and also to Paradise. But the Lord also knew that there was the danger that Paul would be spoiled or damaged by this. Therefore, He sent Paul a thorn, a messenger of Satan, to buffet him and cause him pain. The purpose of this thorn was to bring Paul down and keep him low.</p><p>Here we see that it is not a simple matter to be in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. Sometimes the hand of the Lord will lift us up. But after the Lord has lifted us up, He will bring us down. Because the Judaizers were not in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, with them there was neither lifting up nor putting down. Rather, they were like a plain. But Paul&rsquo;s experience was full of mountains and valleys. This means that the Lord lifted him up and then brought him down.</p>
