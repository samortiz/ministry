   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 Bringing in Christ as the Son of Sorrow Benoni</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and as the Son of the Right Hand Benjamin</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 18 says, "And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, for she died, that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This child was given two names, one from his mother and one from his father.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Benoni means "the son of sorrow."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rachel gave him this name because she was suffering and in sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But Jacob immediately changed his name to Benjamin, which means "the son of the right hand."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this whole universe there is only One who is both the Son of sorrow and the Son of the right hand and that One is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand Christ is Benoni, and on the other hand He is Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is a wonderful Person with these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No one has suffered as much sorrow as Christ, and no one has been exalted as high as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Isaiah 53:3 describes Him as "a man of sorrows," Acts 2:33 says that He has been "exalted to the right hand of God," and Hebrews 1:3 says that He is seated "on the right hand of the Majesty on high."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Firstly, Jesus was the Son of sorrow, the Son of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rachel was not the only one to experience this sorrow; Mary, the mother of Christ, also experienced it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to Luke 2:35, her soul was pierced by the sufferings of her son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But after thirty-three and a half years, in resurrection and ascension Christ became the Son of the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, no one can deny that Benjamin was a type of the suffering and exalted Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose you had been Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Would you have been willing to gain this Christ at the cost of losing the desire of your heart?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As long as you stay in the church, experience Bethel, set up a pillar, and pour yourself out upon it as a drink offering, you will have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rachel must die that Benjamin might be born.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hallelujah, Rachel has gone and Benjamin has come!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>More than fifty years ago, I heard messages and read books about expressing Christ and manifesting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But I was bothered by the fact that I did not know how to lift up Christ or to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For many years I was not able to find the way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some said that in order to express Christ we must be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But how can a person crucify himself?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is impossible for anyone to nail himself to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually I learned that the way to lift up Christ and to express Him is in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through the church life "Rachel" will have a marvelous and encouraging delivery, dying that the wonderful Christ may come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have tried every way to uplift and express Christ, and I can testify strongly that none of these ways has been effective.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, after I came to the church and stayed here for a period of time, my "Rachel," my natural choice, was taken away, and Benjamin was brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The record in the Bible of the death of Rachel and the birth of Benjamin is surely admirable.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What a wonderful record it is!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why did Rachel's death not come before Jacob's experience at Bethel?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Certainly this was according to the sovereignty of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In God's sovereignty, Rachel's death occurred right after Jacob's marvelous experience at Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 16 Jacob must have been full of joy from his experiences at Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Also, he eagerly anticipated the birth of another child of his beloved wife, Rachel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But as Rachel's child was being born, Jacob's natural choice was dying.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although Rachel named her second son Benoni, a name of sorrow, Jacob immediately changed the name to Benjamin, a name of encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The fact that Jacob changed the name of his son proves that he was not disappointed or discouraged by the loss of Rachel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead of being despondent, he was filled with assurance, faith, and hope.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jacob seemed to say, "No, his name must be Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is not the son of sorrow he is the son of the right hand."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What faith and hope Jacob had!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, if this had taken place before Jacob's experience at Bethel, he would have said, "Amen, his name must be Benoni because he is a son of sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Indeed, this experience is sorrowful."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But after his experience at Bethel, Jacob was a transformed person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verse 21 indicates that Jacob had truly been transformed: "And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here, after the death of Rachel and the birth of Benjamin, Jacob is actually called Israel for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are not told that Jacob journeyed, but that Israel journeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By that time Jacob had become a transformed person.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Prior to this, his name had been changed from Jacob to Israel 32:27-28; 35:10 , but he had never actually been called by his new name.</S>
