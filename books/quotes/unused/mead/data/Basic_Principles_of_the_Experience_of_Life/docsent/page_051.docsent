   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORLD BEING A SATANIC SYSTEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Food, protection, and pleasure are necessary for human existence and living, but because humans have lost God, they now care for their own living, protection, and amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Humans sense the need for these things, and without a doubt we do need them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The problem, however, is that the enemy of God, Satan, came in to take advantage of these needs to organize a system, a kosmos, which is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The world is a satanic system, an organization systematized by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Satan has systematized all these needs and organized them in order to systematize people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Being That Which Is More Than We Need for Our Living</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The world is that which is more than we need for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This brief definition is adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The enemy utilizes the needs of human life and adds something to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may illustrate this with marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Marriage in itself is not something of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, it is ordained by God for human existence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In all the Scriptures the best example of marriage is that of Isaac and Rebekah.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this case there was only a marriage and not a system of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Isaac married Rebekah due to the need for human existence, but there was no system in that marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today, however, there is a system of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In China, for example, as part of the agreement of marriage, a woman may demand that fifty tables be prepared for the marriage feast in a large rented hall which can seat five hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then a veil and a long wedding gown to be borne by several small girls must be prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, one family may have to pay one thousand dollars, and the two families may bargain for a greater or lesser amount.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many times the families come to a deadlock until after two months they restart the arguing and bargaining.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These are some of the terms and conditions of the marriage agreement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Isaac and Rebekah never talked about such matters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They simply were married without any system.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now we can see what the world is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Marriage is not the world; the system of marriage is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The enemy has utilized the necessity of marriage to create a certain kind of system, and many young people today, both in the West and in the East, have been systematized by marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eating is also necessary for us to live.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eating in itself is not sinful or worldly, but today a system has been added to eating.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people prefer particular foods and drinks and certain places to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For some, a five dollar meal is not good enough; their meals must cost over ten dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the system that is added to eating.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In principle, clothing is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A human must be clothed, which in itself is right, but today a great system has been added to clothing, and many people are systematized by it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Far East many women are bound by the matter of clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Day by day they know nothing but dressing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A woman may spend only twenty dollars for eating but five hundred or one thousand dollars for dressing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without the system of clothing, many department stores would close.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same way, we need a house to live in, but a terrible system has been added to housing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the West there is the western system, and in the East there is the eastern system.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>People have been very bound by the matter of housing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If someone is poor, he has nothing with which to be systematized; he is not rich enough to be systematized and bound.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The richer someone is, however, the more he is bound.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many rich men have become bondservants to their house.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we ask people to serve the Lord, to have a Bible study, or to pray, they may say that they do not have the time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, they have much time to be bondservants to their house.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the system added to the necessities of human life.</S>
