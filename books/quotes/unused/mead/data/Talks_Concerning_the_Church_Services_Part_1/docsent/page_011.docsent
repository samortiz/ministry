   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SERVING IN CHRIST, NOT IN THE NATURAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Whatever we do in the church life as a service rendered to anyone must be done with a proper spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must pray, Lord, I am serving You.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I want to minister You to these dear ones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Apparently we are serving the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually, we are serving Christ to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If so, we will not offer our own service, but the issue of our service, the parts of the corporate Christ, that is, the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the past we may have done a great deal of service in helping others, but the result was not so much the building of His Body because our service was by the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may have rendered much help, yet it was from the natural source of human affection and friendship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When serving in the church we must try our best to avoid friendship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We only have brothers and sisters; we do not have friends.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Building up a kind of friendship is typified by honey in the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Honey was prohibited in the meal offering because it is considered the same as leaven Lev 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our natural love in nature and result is the same as hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hatred is typified by leaven while love from the natural life is typified by honey, which ferments into leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Apparently, it is sweet and good.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, this honey will ferment and become a kind of leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We help a brother just because he is a brother and we render help to a sister just because she is a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This kind of help is pure, not out of our natural affection which ferments.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even when we give material things to the needy ones, we may do it with a mixture or purely with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>May all of our services be so pure that they issue in the supply of Christ to others for the building up of the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee to the church in Anaheim, California on October 5, 1989</S>
