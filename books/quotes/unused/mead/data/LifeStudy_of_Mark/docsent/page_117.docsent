   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 13:9-13 the Lord speaks concerning the preaching of the gospel and persecutions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 9 the Lord says, But you yourselves beware; they will deliver you to sanhedrins, and you will be beaten in synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 10 the Lord goes on to say, And the gospel must first be preached to all the nations.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The emphasis of the gospel of grace is on forgiveness of sin, God s redemption, and eternal life; the emphasis of the gospel of the kingdom is on the ruling of God and the authority of the Lord.</S>
