   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHANGING THE SYSTEM TO LEARN THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND TO MEET THE NEED OF THE WHOLE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The purpose of changing the system is so that every brother and sister will learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If any of the older saints are sixty years old and begin reading two verses from the Bible a day, they will only be seventy-one years old when they finish reading the New Testament, and they will still be very useful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a short-term benefit, if we read two verses a day, what we read will become very useful by the time we begin a home meeting in six months.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We also hope to see the young generation gained by the Lord in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Presently, there are about one thousand churches on six continents.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The whole world is open to the Lord s recovery, because the Lord s recovery has the proper ground and is full of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Five hundred young saints who can speak Spanish and who can go to Central and South America would not be enough to meet the needs there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is a need everywhere in the United States, Canada, East Africa, West Africa, South Africa, and North Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we must learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not take the easy way of listening to famous speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to take classes and be educated by learning the Bible word by word and item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we practice this, we will achieve a definite educational standard in twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>CHANGING THE SYSTEM BEING RELATED TO</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>CONTACTING THE LORD EVERY MORNING</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Changing the system is to help us to speak for the Lord; hence, we must cooperate.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Previously, the brothers and sisters came to the meeting hall for morning watch every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not deny that having morning watch corporately is helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, it is not sufficient to have morning watch without fellowshipping with the Lord in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The blessing we receive from having corporate morning watch can never replace the personal contact we have with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to spend five to ten minutes to contact the Lord every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No matter how busy we are, we should grasp every opportunity to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even while we bathe or take a walk, we can consider and meditate on the verses we read.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This will be a great benefit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not contact any person, thing, or matter before we contact the Lord in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This practice is included in our learning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>MAKING A RESOLUTION TO LEARN THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to make a resolution to learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not say, It is useless to make a resolution, because the result will be as Paul says: To will is present with me, but to work out the good is not.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord who is living in us will help us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everything depends on whether we are willing to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord said to Jerusalem, I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Matt 23:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now the Lord is asking us, Will you contact Me for a few minutes every morning?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Will you pray-read two verses?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Will you learn Truth Lessons in the church meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many people can testify that reading any kind of book, newspaper, or magazine cannot compare with reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At my present age, I am still alert and sharp without any confusion because I have the words of the Lord in me all the time; His words in me are everything to me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have joy whenever I read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Reading the Bible is good medicine for healing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord s word is the factor of our happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we speak the Lord s word every day, we will be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is even more necessary for the older brothers and sisters to learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we know the truth, we can teach our children and grandchildren, and when they live with us, our conduct and behavior will be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the tongue of a grandfather is the pen of a ready writer Psa 45:1 and that home is filled with a scholarly atmosphere, the children and grandchildren who are living together will benefit greatly even if they have little contact with the grandfather.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Similarly, the most basic requirement for all the brothers and sisters in the church to manifest their function is to learn and know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Without an education in the truth, it is difficult for us to develop or manifest our function.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the problem in today s Christianity, and it is also a big lack among us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>USING TRUTH LESSONS TO LEARN THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I hope that after such fellowship, we will all learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord has prepared Truth Lessons for us, and it is the best means for us to learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to use Truth Lessons, we must be prepared before we come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There will be no need for us to pray as we did in the past: Lord, today Brother So-and-so will speak the message.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Please strengthen him so that his words will penetrate our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>O Lord, touch all the brothers and sisters so that they will come to listen to the message.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Such prayers are for listening to famous speakers; they are not prayers for the brothers and sisters to speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Instead, we should pray, Lord, I will learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Lord, bring new ones to us so that we can learn the truth together.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should not come to the meeting with the expectation of listening to a speech.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we come to a meeting, we should not wait for someone to lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When it is time to begin, we can open Truth Lessons and read.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We do not even need to wait until everyone is present.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the latecomers arrive, they can join in the reading.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>During the meeting we can read with emphasis; we can also pray-read and sing-read.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All the brothers and sisters should open their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should change our old concepts and not long for messages given by famous, eloquent speakers who use good stories and examples.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We no longer have famous speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Every one of us is a small member, and none of us can speak well.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Nevertheless, we cannot sit in a meeting and look at each other.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should exercise to call hymns and read the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Everything should be carried out by the brothers and sisters themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We can give testimonies, pray, and pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Such a meeting in which everyone functions is much better than a meeting by a famous speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>May all the gatherings in the churches in Taiwan be like this in two or three years.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>May every gathering be living, with everyone speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We do not have idle talk in the meetings; neither do we consider everyday matters.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the meetings we speak concerning the Lord, the truth, and the gospel.</S>
