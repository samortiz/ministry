<p>Another aspect of the traditional way to meet and to serve, which looks very good but is not so encouraging, is the preaching of the gospel. The preaching of the gospel in the Christianity way is not prevailing. Its way of preaching the gospel also accommodates the poor situation and dead condition of the function-annulled and life-choked Christians. The main factor of the old way in preaching the gospel is to set up a meeting with an eloquent speaker and invite people to attend the preaching meeting to listen to the speaker. In this way, there is no need of the development of the spiritual function of all the members of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>One thing that concerned me to the uttermost was the low rate of increase among the churches. In Orange County, from 1974 to 1984, there was very little increase. We did baptize some new ones, but as a whole the balance showed a debit that was greater than the credit. This indicates that our gospel preaching has not been very effective or adequate.</p>
<p>By studying these matters, I realized that we needed to have a new start in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. In principle, we should not try to gain people from the denominations, but we should try to help people from among the Gentiles to be saved. Based upon this realization, I began to study how to preach the gospel. At this time the matter of visiting people by knocking on their doors came to my understanding. There is no other way that is as effective in contacting people as door-knocking. However, in order to carry out the practice of door-knocking, everyone who was burdened had to pay a price.</p>
<p>Although we had somewhat practiced visiting people in their homes in the past, it was not so effective because we did it in a natural, untrained way. After returning to Taiwan, we set up a training. The first point we studied and investigated thoroughly was how to be effective in visiting people by knocking on their doors. We formed our discoveries into instructions, which became a part of the training. We practiced our discoveries and we found out the way which was the most effective. I never expected to baptize as many as we have baptized. In less than two years, we baptized thirty-eight thousand people in Taipei.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BINDING AND ANNULLING THE ORGANIC FUNCTION<br />
OF THE LIVING MEMBERS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The traditional way has bound and annulled the organic function of the members of the Body of Christ for many centuries. This has been done under a very pleasant covering. Some would say that we need to have a meeting not only to help the sinners get saved by preaching the gospel to them, but also to help the new ones get fed and edified. This sounds very good, and everyone would say that this is needed, but the subtlety of the evil one is present here.</p>
<p>The denominations have millions of members, but very few of these members are useful. On the one hand, the clerical class, the professionals, may help their so-called churches to be increased. But on the other hand, they annul the function of the members of the Body of Christ. There may be a great number among them, but most of them are annulled in their function. Many remain in this condition for their whole life. With this kind of situation, where is the possibility for the saints to be built up in an organic way&mdash;where their spirit has been regenerated, their souls are being transformed, and they are growing in spirit by the transformation in their souls together with other fellow members? Where are the saints experiencing the all-inclusive Christ and growing with Him, having the freedom and opportunity for their spiritual, organic function to be developed, and being built up together in the spirit so that not only a local church but also the whole Body of Christ can be built up as the full expression of God?</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
