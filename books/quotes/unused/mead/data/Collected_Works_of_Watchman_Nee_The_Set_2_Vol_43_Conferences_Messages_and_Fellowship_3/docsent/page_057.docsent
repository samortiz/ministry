   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEARING THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let me mention one more thing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As long as we are righteous in ourselves, we should be contented; it should matter little whether or not others know about our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who are constantly trying to justify their attitude before others do not know the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As long as we are right in ourselves, that is good enough; it should matter little whether others say that we are right.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As long as we are right in our attitude, that is good enough; it should matter little whether others say that we are good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The principle and standard of the Christian life are not right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The standard of our living is the bearing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The bearing of the cross is the unique standard of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The whole issue rests on whether or not we are bearing the cross, not on right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before the Lord, are we willing to empty ourselves to suffer loss?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The basic principle in managing the church is not in determining right and wrong for others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should have only one standard: If there is the bearing of the cross, it is right; if there is not the bearing of the cross, it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Forget about whether or not others are right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just ask whether or not they are bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The cross is the greatest "wrong" in the whole universe; it is a terrible "wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jesus Christ the Son of God had no sin, yet He was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our sins are too deep, yet we do not have to die.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not have to shed our blood; we are freely forgiven and freely saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do we not realize that this is the greatest wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If it were a matter of right and wrong, then the most right thing to do would be for us to go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have sinned and deserve to die.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, bearing the cross means accepting all the wrongs, not complaining, not reasoning, and being filled with joy all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The world can endure, but it endures by swallowing its grudges.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no joy in such endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But we can accept unjust treatment with much rejoicing in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>GIVING UP EVERYTHING</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I would like to mention one more thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The mind of Christ Jesus is one which gives up everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who give up everything have the mind of Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>May God be merciful and gracious to us, and may we be those who willingly give up all things, those who gladly suffer losses.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A Christian should give ground to others; he should lay the tracks for others to go through.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In speaking of the trespass offering, Leviticus 6:5 tells us that one should add one-fifth to what is owed when paying back that which is owed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should learn to be those who suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should put ourselves under the trampling of others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ Jesus did not need to be a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet He put off the form of God and took the form of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He relinquished what He rightfully owned and received what He should not have received.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the days ahead may we learn more to be those who suffer persecution willingly and who remain joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If it pleases God to put us in a certain place, we will accept it with joy and gladness, because bearing the cross is more important than all the glory and position the world can afford.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What does bearing the cross mean?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is described in the words: "He saved others; Himself He cannot save" Mark 15:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A true bearer of the cross does not save himself and his own glory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In particular, he does not save his own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God will bless all those who are willing to go this way.</S>
