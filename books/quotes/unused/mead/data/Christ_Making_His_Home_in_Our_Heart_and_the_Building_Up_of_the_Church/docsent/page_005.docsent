   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ALL HUMAN BEINGS WHETHER GOOD OR BAD,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NEEDING TO BE REGENERATED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should never think that only fallen men need to be born again, or that a person who is not fallen would not need to be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even if man were not fallen, he would still need to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even the best man is only human; he does not possess the element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He has only man s life, not God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God ordained that His element and His life would enter into man so that God would be mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, whether a person is good or bad, he needs to be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man needs God to enter into him to be his life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Besides the created life in him, man needs to obtain another life, the uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Regeneration means that in addition to our life, we obtain another life, God s life, which is a second life, the eternal life, the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How can a person obtain this life?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After God created man, God placed man in front of the tree of life so that man would receive God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If man had received Him, God would have entered into man to be man s life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In other words, the life of the tree of life would have entered into man; the tree of life would have been planted into man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, God would be in man, and man would have obtained the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I hope that this picture will be deeply etched into us: human beings need to have God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not that we are fallen and thus we need God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even if man had not fallen, he would still have needed God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s intention is to work Himself into us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not have a religious concept and think that God wants us to worship Him and do things for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not God s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has only one intention: He desires that we receive Him into us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>HAVING CHRIST AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>IN ORDER TO LIVE OUT THE HIGHEST LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In John 3 Nicodemus went to see the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nicodemus was a religionist who was full of religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He addressed the Lord as Rabbi, because he thought the Lord Jesus had come from God as a teacher v. 2 . A teacher teaches others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nicodemus considered the Lord Jesus to be a teacher, who came for the sole purpose of teaching people in order to improve them and make them better persons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, if a brother loses his temper often, someone may come to teach him, and say, Do not lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You should speak with patience and have a good attitude, because God does not like people to get angry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our anger does not fulfill God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Blessed are those who are meek.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To give this kind of advice is to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us use another example.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose a brother is narrow-hearted and often jealous of others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the sisters are praised, he becomes angry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Someone may come to him and say, You should not be bothered when the sisters are praised, because brothers are different from sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The sisters have their heads covered, and the brothers have the headship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, you should enlarge your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is an attempt to improve the brother, to make him better.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A person with dirty clothes and messy hair can be given clean clothes and a comb, but this would improve only his outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This can be likened to the work done in a mortuary.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>People who work in a mortuary dress up dead people and make them look nice.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The dead people in a mortuary may be dressed up and look nice, but they still have the appearance of death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They do not have a desirable appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who are teachers can be likened to a mortician in a mortuary.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a person attempts to teach you in this way, you should say, Do not teach me in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not do the work of a mortician on me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yes, I am dead, but the work of a mortician cannot help me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may change my clothes, but I am still dead; you may put makeup on my face and wash me, but I am still dead.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What I need is life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I do not need outward improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is what the Lord Jesus revealed to Nicodemus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nicodemus seemed to be saying, Lord, since You have come from God as a teacher, I have come to You to let You do the work of a mortician on me to change me, teach me, and improve me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, the Lord Jesus replied, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God v. 3 . The Lord told Nicodemus that teaching and improvement availed nothing; Nicodemus needed to obtain another life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Without this other life, Nicodemus was in a different sphere, a different realm, and a different kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God s kingdom is God s sphere, God s realm.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Without obtaining God s life, Nicodemus could not understand the things in God s sphere, God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He needed to obtain God as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Similarly, we need to have God s life, not only our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do not think that we are asking you to join a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Please remember that all the work in religion is the same as the work done in a mortuary.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If anyone attempts to teach us, telling us to be patient and meek and to have good behavior, we should tell him not to do the work of a mortician on us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We do not need any dead work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to have God s life within.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need to eat the tree of life and receive its fruit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only when a man receives Christ as his life can he live out the highest living.</S>
