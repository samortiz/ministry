<h1 class="title">GOING DOOR-TO-DOOR TO VISIT PEOPLE<br />
AND LEAD THEM TO THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 15:4-5, 16; Mark 16:15-16; Matt. 28:18-20; Gen. 3:7-9; 1 Tim. 1:15; Luke 19:5-6, 9-10; John 4:3-7; Luke 9:1-4; 10:1-6; Acts 16:13-15; Rom. 12:1; 8:4; Acts 13:52; 4:8, 31; Phil. 1:27; 2 Tim. 1:8</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SALVATION CAUSING PEOPLE<br />
TO BE FILLED WITH JOY</h2>
<p>The focus in our practice of the new way is to go door-to-door in order to visit people and lead them to the Lord. Going door-to-door is to visit people and lead them to salvation. The Lord Jesus lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, of which the last three and a half years were the period of His ministry. During this time He preached the word to many, and after He was resurrected from the dead, His parting word to His disciples was, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19). A common characteristic of Christians is that they love to see people receive salvation. You may be zealous, indifferent, uplifted, or depressed, but as long as you are a Christian, you are filled with joy when you see someone receive salvation.</p>
<p>I have preached the gospel in different situations: in large meetings and in small gatherings, in meetings that were filled with excitement and in meetings that were calm and quiet. The first time I preached the gospel in a large gathering was in a basketball stadium in Taipei in 1958 with over ten thousand in attendance. Last year in Taipei we preached the gospel specifically to high-school students, with approximately fifteen thousand in attendance. Probably two-thirds of the students stood up at the end as an expression of their desire to receive the Lord.</p>
<p>Regardless of the occasion, a person who is saved rejoices, and those who witness his salvation also rejoice. Every believer has the desire to preach the gospel. We know that preaching the gospel is good and right, but we often have many reasons that discourage us from preaching the gospel. In truth, however, there is only one reason&mdash;our spirit is low. When our spirit is uplifted, we do not have problems, but when our spirit is low, everything poses a problem. A common excuse for not preaching the gospel is, &ldquo;I am not in the mood,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I do not have a heart to preach the gospel.&rdquo; Preaching the gospel, however, is not a matter of being in the mood or of having a heart; it is a matter of whether or not we are burning in spirit.</p>
<p>I have over sixty years of experience in preaching the gospel. The first time that I preached the gospel, I went by myself to the villages. I had been saved for less than a year and was not quite twenty years old, but I began preaching the gospel. I wrote a gospel tract entitled <em>The Wonderful Way for Souls to Be Saved</em> and printed the title in big characters on pink paper. It was very attractive. I went by myself every Lord&rsquo;s Day to the villages. Although I did not have any companions, my heart was burning within me. I would leave early in the morning and walk for several hours, speaking the gospel to whomever I met. The villagers thought that I was strange and wondered why I spoke to everyone. At first they could not understand what I was saying, but they listened attentively because they felt that what I spoke was reasonable and that I was educated.</p>
<p>I did not have enough experience at that time, nor was there anyone who could teach me. Today we are blessed because we are being taught how to prepare for the gospel. At that time I did not know how to prepare for the gospel. Furthermore, after leading people to salvation, I did not know how to baptize them or where to baptize them. I did not have anyone to assist me. Although I walked several hours to the nearby villages, preached the gospel for the whole day, and was exhausted by the time I walked back home, there was an unspeakable joy in me. Hence, if we desire to be rejoicing Christians, we need to lead people to salvation. Once we stop leading people to salvation, our joy disappears.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING APPOINTED AND COMMANDED<br />
TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that the Lord has appointed and commanded us to preach the gospel. The Lord appointed us to bear fruit (John 15:16), and He commanded us to proclaim the gospel and to disciple all the nations (Matt. 28:18-20). Therefore, preaching the gospel is not of our own initiation; it is the Lord&rsquo;s commission to us.</p>
<p>The four Gospels, particularly the Gospel of John, contain a charge from the Lord concerning the gospel. We need to be impressed deeply with this matter. The Lord says that He is the vine and that we are His branches (15:5). The branches of the vine are special. When I was young, there was a vineyard in the courtyard of our house. Vines do not have pretty flowers; a person must look closely in order to notice the flowers. Hence, they are not like peach, apricot, or apple trees. Furthermore, unlike pine trees, cypresses, and firs, vines are not for producing wood. The branches of the vine have just one purpose&mdash;bearing fruit. When the Lord Jesus spoke concerning the vine in John 15, His emphasis was on fruit-bearing.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
