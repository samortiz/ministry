<p>We are fellowshipping concerning a change in our concept, not concerning a change in the way we meet. It is not a matter of changing our scheduled time for the meetings or of singing first and then praying or of praying first and then singing. It is a matter of changing our concept. The ministry of the word is strong, but our spirit is not strong enough; it is not living or released. We must exercise our spirit by praying when we come to a meeting. Our intention should not be merely to attend a meeting but rather to serve with our spirit. Our intention should not be merely to listen to a message but to serve with our spirit. When I was in Manila and in Hong Kong, I told the churches not to focus only on the matter of coming together to meet. We meet in order to serve. We meet so that we can use our spirit to worship and serve God. We should have the concept that we come not to meet but to serve. Although our meetings should be a feast, we often come and only look at the food. Some brothers and sisters attend meetings, but their spirit does not move.</p>
<p>Instead of saying that we are going to a meeting, we should say that we are going to serve, to minister. When we say that we are going to a meeting, we often mean that we are going to the meeting hall to sit. After a day&rsquo;s labor we take our Bibles and go to the meeting hall in the evening and allow our spirit, soul, and body to rest while the leading brothers bear the responsibility of the meeting. This is a great mistake! We should go to the meetings in order to serve others with God. Hence, we should be diligent in our spirit to fellowship, to pray, to praise, to give thanks, to worship, and to serve. If we would have such a spirit, the words that are released will be spirit and life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GENUINE SUPPLY OF THE CHURCH<br />
DEPENDING ON THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The sequence in the Gospel of John concerning the Spirit is excellent. Chapter 3 says that the Spirit regenerates our spirit; the Spirit begets the spirit (v. 6). Chapter 4 says that God is Spirit and that we need to worship Him in spirit (v. 24). This means the spirit worships the Spirit. Chapter 6 says, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life;...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (v. 63). First, the Spirit regenerates a person, and then this person needs to worship God in spirit. As a result, this one who has been regenerated by the Spirit and who worships God in spirit will be like the Lord; when he speaks, his words will be spirit and life. Because he is filled with the Spirit, what he utters will be spirit. &ldquo;Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks&rdquo; (Matt. 12:34). John 7 goes one step further and says that when the Spirit comes forth, He becomes rivers of living water (v. 38).</p>
<p>If we are willing to exercise our spirit, that is, to worship and serve in spirit, we will be filled with the Spirit, and the words that we speak will be the flowing of the Spirit as rivers of living water. If we read and speak the Bible, listen to messages, and read spiritual publications without exercising our spirit, we will eventually have more knowledge but less of the Spirit. As a result, the church will receive dead letters, not the genuine spiritual supply.</p>
<p>We must see that the supply to the church depends on the Spirit and not merely on the ministry of the word. In His work of recovery the Lord first uses the Word, but He must ultimately match the Word with the Spirit. Otherwise, the Word will become dead letters; it will be without the Spirit, and it will not be the Spirit; and the church will become deadened. If we can match the ministry of the word with the exercise of our spirit so that we serve in spirit, then the ministry of the word will be Spirit-filled, strengthening, enlightening, uplifting, and releasing. Furthermore, those who listen to our speaking will be enlivened, and their spiritual capacity will increase. This will draw out more words from those who minister the word. In this way, the church will receive a fresh and living supply, and all the saints will be able to know Christ, experience Christ, and touch the riches of Christ in their spirit. For this reason, we must exercise our spirit to pray regularly until we can pray in any place and at any time. This is the way for our spirit to be enriched and strengthened, for our service to be uplifted, and for the church to be built up.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> </body></html>
