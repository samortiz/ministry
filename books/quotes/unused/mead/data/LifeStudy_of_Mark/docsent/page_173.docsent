   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HEALINGS OF PARTICULAR ORGANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The four cases of healing in chapters one through three are all in the same category, the category of general healings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After chapter four the Lord Jesus goes on to carry out further healings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But these healings are of particular organs: the hearing organ, the speaking organ, and the seeing organ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to contact others, we must have these organs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are deaf, dumb, and blind, what contact can we have with others?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We could not have any contact at all since we would not be able to hear, speak, or see.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As our representative, Peter was healed of his fever, leprosy, paralysis, and withered condition; however, still he could not hear, speak, or see.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the four cases of general healing, we have in Mark four cases of the healing of specific organs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 7:31-37 we have the healing of a deaf and dumb man; in 8:22-26, the healing of a blind man in Bethsaida; in 9:14-29, the healing of a boy who had a dumb spirit; and in 10:46-52, the healing of blind Bartimaeus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In these four cases three particular organs are healed: the hearing organ, the speaking organ, and the seeing organ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>TWO CASES OF BLINDNESS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us consider briefly the two cases of the healing of blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When they came to Bethsaida, a blind man was brought to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Taking hold of the hand of the blind man, He led him forth outside the village; and having spit in his eyes and laid His hands on him, He asked him, Do you see anything?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The man looked up and said, I behold men; I see them as trees walking v. 24 . Then the Lord laid His hands upon the man s eyes again, and he looked intently and was restored, and he saw all things clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Is this not a picture of our spiritual condition?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we first saw the Lord, we did not see Him clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We did not see spiritual things exactly as they are.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then after further contact with the Lord, we began to see all things clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The second case of the healing of blindness is the healing of blind Bartimaeus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the Lord Jesus asked Bartimaeus what he wanted Him to do for him, the blind man said, Rabboni, that I may recover my sight!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>10:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then Jesus said to him, Go, your faith has healed you v. 52 , and immediately Bartimaeus recovered his sight and followed the Lord on the road v. 52 . This is the last case of healing recorded in the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>OUR NEED FOR PARTICULAR HEALING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Spiritually speaking, our relationship with God depends upon the hearing organ, the speaking organ, and the seeing organ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we cannot hear God s word, if we cannot talk to God, and if we cannot see God s vision, we cannot have any relationship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If such were our situation, we would be like a dumb idol standing before God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we need the healing of our hearing, speaking, and seeing organs.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The New Testament reveals that, spiritually speaking, we were dead, but the Lord Jesus has made us alive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When He came to us and sowed Himself into us, we were enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We were then healed of our fever, leprosy, paralysis, and withered condition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Praise the Lord that we have been made alive, that we have been regenerated!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, after being regenerated, we may still be deaf, dumb, and blind, in need of the Lord s particular healing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Was this not your experience with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I can testify that it was my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I was regenerated in 1925, but it was not until 1932 that my ears began to hear God s voice, my eyes began to see His vision, and my mouth was opened to speak for God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I praise Him that today, through His mercy, I can hear, speak, and see.</S>
