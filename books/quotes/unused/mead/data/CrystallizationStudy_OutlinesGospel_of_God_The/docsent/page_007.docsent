   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>faith</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>. The righteousness of God is the procedure of God s salvation judicially vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>16-17: God cannot forgive sinful people without meeting the demands of His righteousness Psa 103:6-7 ; according to His righteousness, the soul who sins, he shall die Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>18:4 and the wages of sin is death Rom 6:23 : Christ died a vicarious death as the Substitute for sinners, a death that was legal according to God s law and was recognized and approved by God according to the law Isa 53:5-6; 2 Cor 5:21; Matt 27:45-46.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ, the righteous One, was judged on behalf of us, the unrighteous, by the righteous God according to His righteousness, that He might remove the barrier of our sins and bring us to God 1 Pet 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the cross Jesus was made sin for us, condemned sin in the flesh, and by dying on our behalf fulfilled all God s righteousness; now for the sake of His righteousness, God must forgive us 2 Cor 5:21; Rom 8:3, 10; John 19:30.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because God is bound by His righteousness to forgive us, righteousness is the power of God s salvation and the unshakable foundation of our salvation Rom 1:16-17: Our experience of Christ rests on the foundation of God s righteousness, which is the solid, steadfast, and unshakable foundation of His throne Psa 89:14 and the base on which His kingdom is built Rom 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God has put Christ to death on our behalf, He has recognized the death of Christ as the full payment of our debt of sins, and the resurrected and ascended Christ sitting at the right hand of God is the receipt of this payment 4:24-25.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, whenever we claim the blood of Jesus and appeal to God s righteousness, He has no choice except to forgive us 1 John 1:9; Hymns, #1003.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Life is the goal of God s salvation; thus, justification is of life ; through justification we have come up to the standard of God s righteousness and correspond with it so that now He can impart His life into us Rom 5:18.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The life of Christ is the purpose of God s salvation organically v. 10: The result of our justification is the full enjoyment of God in Christ as our life; in God s organic salvation we have love, grace, peace, hope, life, glory, the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God as our enjoyment vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1-11.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The saving life of Christ is accomplishing the organic goal of God s dynamic salvation in the following ways v. 10: We have been justified by God in Christ as the righteousness from God to us so that we may live in this life before God 1:17.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This life makes the God-justified believers the many sons of God 8:14; Heb 2:10 , who are the many brothers of Christ Rom 8:29 through regeneration 1 Pet 1:3 by the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 with God s producing and multiplying life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This life is imparted into the dying believers so that they may grow in Christ out of death unto maturity v. 11.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The indwelling Christ moves in the believers by the Spirit of life so that they may enjoy Christ s life with its peace vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>5-6.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This life sanctifies us with the holy nature of God as the holy element 6:19-20.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This life renews us, by the Spirit of life, based upon the washing of regeneration, from the old element of our old man into the new constitution of our new man 12:2b; Titus 3:5.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This life transforms us metabolically by the Spirit of life with the element of Christ s divine life, from our old constitution to our new constitution, for the building up of Christ s organic Body Rom 12:2b, 5; 2 Cor 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This life conforms us to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God so that we may be full-grown God-men for the Triune God s expression Rom 8:29.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This life glorifies us through the redemption of our body so that we may enter into the freedom of glory and our full sonship vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>21, 23, 30.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This life makes us reign as kings over Satan, sin, and death 5:17, 21.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the above ten items are for the producing and building up of the organic Body of Christ expressed as the local churches; this is covered in the last five chapters of the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The faith of the believers is the substantiation of God s salvation practically Heb 11:1: The faith of the believers is actually not their own faith but Christ entering into them to be their faith Rom 1:12; 3:22 and footnote 1; Gal 2:16 and footnote 1.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our believing into Christ is our appreciation of Him as a reaction to His attraction Rom 10:17; Heb 12:1-2a; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Acts 14:27.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Faith comes out of the hearing of the word; when we come to the living Word Christ in the written word the Bible , He becomes the applied word the Spirit of faith to us Rom 10:8, 17; Gal 3:2; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Heb 3:12.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When man hears Christ, knows Him, appreciates Him, and treasures Him, He causes faith to be generated in man, becoming the faith in man that enables man to believe in Him 12:2a; Rom 10:17; Gal 3:2, 5; 5:6.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Faith is to believe that God is and we are not; He must be the only One, the unique One, in everything, and we must be nothing in everything Heb 11:1, 5-6.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As believers, we live by faith and infuse Christ as faith into others by exercising our spirit of faith 2 Cor 4:13; Rom 10:14-17; Acts 26:22-29 so that they may be brought into the following organic relationships with Christ for His purpose: Christ is the cultivated olive tree and the vine, and we are His branches Rom 11:17, 24; John 15:1-8.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is the Head, and we are His members 1 Cor 12:12, 27.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ is the breath of life, the water of life, and the bread of life, and we are His breathers, drinkers, and eaters John 20:22; 4:10, 14; 7:37-39a; 6:35, 51-63, 68.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is the Bridegroom, and we are His bride 3:29-30; 2 Cor 11:2-3.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Faith is the subjective God applied to our being; thus, just as nothing is impossible to God, nothing is impossible to faith Matt 17:20; 19:26.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The great irrepressible and unlimited power of faith motivates thousands to suffer for the Lord, risk their lives, and become overcoming sent ones and martyrs to spread the gospel of God s eternal economy unto the uttermost part of the earth Luke 18:8; Rom 16:3-4; Acts 20:24; 1 Tim 1:4, 11-12; Matt 24:14; Acts 1:8.</S>
