   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE MUTUALITY AND SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE CHURCH MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Two of the books in the New Testament which describe the Christian way of meeting are Acts and 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Acts 2:46 says, And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they took their food with exultation and simplicity of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Acts 5:42 says, And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Teaching and preaching were practiced by the believers from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Corinthians 14 describes the Christian way of meeting when the whole church comes together in one place v. 23 . In verse 26 Paul says, Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let all things be done for building up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE GOD-INVENTED, GOD-ORDAINED,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>AND GOD-CREATED WAY TO MEET</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I recently spent some time to review the New Testament concerning the believers way to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In that review, I found out that in the early days the way invented and ordained by the Spirit for the believers to meet is based upon two principles or two factors mutuality and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Mutuality and speaking are the basic principles and factors by which or with which we should meet.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A church meeting that does not involve mutuality and mutual speaking is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Acts as soon as the three thousand were added to the church they began to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the one hand, they met in a public place in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the other hand, they met in homes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually the expression used in Acts is not in homes but from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that they met in every house.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They did not select some homes which were considered good for meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They met from house to house without selection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Meeting in the temple was not the Christian way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Christian way was to meet from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This practice was altogether new.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was not there in the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Jewish religion, their practice was to have big gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Peter, on the day of Pentecost, made use of the temple as a kind of convenience to preach the gospel and to teach the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through that kind of public meeting many were brought into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once they became believers in Christ and were baptized, however, they began to meet in a way initiated, invented, and ordained of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By that time, these believers were full of the Spirit, so whatever they did was something of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should consider the way of meeting from house to house as something invented and ordained by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this way of meeting there was mutuality and speaking and even mutuality in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The one hundred twenty had no way to take care of the houses of those three thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I believe there must have been eight hundred or a thousand houses.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How could one hundred and twenty take care of so many small meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No doubt, all the newly converted and baptized people met by themselves and they spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They had only heard that one message of Peter s. Do you believe that they still spoke about the law on the day of Pentecost after being baptized? I do not think they talked in the way of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They became new persons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They may have referred to the Old Testament, but it must have been that they spoke what they heard Peter speaking on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Peter did refer in his speaking to the Old Testament, but he was not speaking the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was speaking the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The main subject of Peter s speaking was Christ incarnated, living on this earth, crucified, resurrected, and ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because of what these three thousand people heard, they became believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When they met together that evening, they surely spoke the same thing that Peter did, and they continued to speak from house to house, day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Again, these new converts became new persons.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even though they had the background of their Jewish religion and of the Jewish way to meet with a large congregation, because they were baptized I believe their concept became new.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As a result, they came together in their homes and began to speak what they had heard in the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today in America there is the prevailing background of Christianity which always affects people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some may get saved through our preaching of the gospel and we may baptize them immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If they were to come back in the evening to partake of the Lord s table, they already have the preoccupying thought that there must be a pastor or leading one to speak and that they are just coming to attend a kind of service.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This concept kills their function.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we practice in a way where there is no mutuality in speaking, instead of learning to speak, the new ones get fully settled into the way of not speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A number of us have been speaking in the recovery and our speaking has really spoiled the function of all the saints, especially the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In a good sense, our speaking helps people, but in another sense, a greater sense, our speaking really annuls the function of so many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is much speaking in the Pentecostal movement, but what kind of speaking is there?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Is it the speaking of the word of wisdom concerning the deep things of God or the speaking of the word of knowledge concerning Christ as the Apostle Paul did 1 Cor 12:8 ?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Absolutely not.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What we want in the Lord s recovery is the genuine speaking of the divine Word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This Word is always followed by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Genesis 1 first says that God created the heavens and the earth and then the Spirit of God brooded over the death waters vv.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then God spoke a word saying, Let there be light: And there was light v. 3 . In the old creation, God, the Spirit, and the Word all worked together to bring forth creation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the New Testament it is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God, the Spirit, and the Word work together to bring forth the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to preach the Word, to speak the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the Word goes out, the Spirit honors, the Spirit follows, and the Spirit works.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In our meetings the speaking of the divine Word should be mutual, not individual.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Mutuality has to be prevailing, not individuality.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have to kill individuality.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The way of individuality is a traditional way, a way of degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The way to meet in mutuality and in speaking is the way God invented, the way God ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This way is God s created way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>No one can improve what God has created.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Every year the design of cars is improved.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But who can improve the way God designed man?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Because man is God s creation, no one can improve His design.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The same is true of the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>No one can improve them because God created them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is also true of all the natural principles and natural laws which were created and ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>No one can change them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They could only be put aside or not cared for.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The way of meeting in mutuality and in speaking was ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>No one can improve it.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the best way to meet, but it has been set aside by degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Now we in the Lord s recovery must recover this at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We have to annul individuality in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We saw this matter more than fifty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Brother Nee encouraged us to practice in this way, but we somewhat neutralized this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We did not have one speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Instead, we had three or four speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The mutuality was only for those three or four.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The majority still became jobless.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Their functions were all killed by our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Now we must fully come back to the God-invented and God-ordained way to meet in order to kill the traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We have to promote this God-ordained way to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is not merely a matter of changing our meeting schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We must learn to get ourselves prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We should not think that to meet on the Lord s Day morning is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Whether it is wrong or not depends on the way we meet.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we still meet by the old way of practicing individuality in the matter of speaking, that is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We must learn to practice the Lord s Day morning meeting in the way of mutuality in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>More people could be saved in this kind of meeting with mutuality and speaking than in the so-called gospel preaching meeting with only one speaker 1 Cor 14:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The principle is that we have to shift from the traditional man-made way of meeting to the God-created and God-ordained way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>It is worthwhile to pay the price with some suffering in order to come back to the God-created way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We should not expect to have a success in this change immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I even anticipate some failure.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Nevertheless, our failures will lead to success.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We have to try this way of meeting again and again until we succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>In any scientific endeavor, nothing can be accomplished by just one experiment.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Experiment after experiment is needed to get the desired results.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We have a guide in the New Testament, especially in the book of Acts, concerning the way to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We have to believe in this guide.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Do not be disappointed that by dropping your old way, you will suffer something.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We must change our way at a cost.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>To remodel a house many things must be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>That is a kind of suffering and a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If we do not dare to sacrifice something, we cannot do any remodeling.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Because we are building, we must expect some failures, yet in this expectation there is much possibility of a success.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>It all depends upon our endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We must endure.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We must try again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>To take the way of the home meetings and the way of mutuality and speaking is a hard burden to put into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>You should not expect to have an immediate success.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>You have to expect some failures, but you should not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The Lord will help you to get through.</S>
