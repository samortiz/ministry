<p>Knowing God&rsquo;s will is a great matter in our spiritual life. No one can live a spiritual life without knowing God&rsquo;s will. Knowing God&rsquo;s will is a test to our spiritual life. The more we live a spiritual life, the more we will know God&rsquo;s will. In order to know God&rsquo;s will, we need to live a spiritual life, and in order to live a spiritual life, we need to know God&rsquo;s will. The self is the greatest hindrance to knowing God&rsquo;s will. The self represents us. Our will, ideas, insights, and views are elements of our self. Our self, including our will, ideas, insights, and views, is the greatest hindrance to knowing God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>Knowing God&rsquo;s will requires that the self be rejected, denied, and broken. This can only be accomplished through the cross. We can reject and deny the self only through the cross. In Matthew 16:24 the Lord said, &ldquo;If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.&rdquo; According to this verse, denying the self is related to taking up the cross. To deny the self is to reject the self. To take up the cross is to accept the cross, to place one&rsquo;s self under the death of the cross. This verse shows that denying the self is related to the cross. In order for a person to deny the self, he must take up the cross, and in order for him to take up the cross, he must reject the self and accept the death of the cross. Only such a person can deny himself and reject his self, which is full of opinions. Only a person who denies and rejects the self through the cross and lets the cross break his opinions and assertions can care for God&rsquo;s will and know God&rsquo;s will instead of the will of the self (v. 23). Hence, knowing God&rsquo;s will comes through the cross and depends on the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>To experience resurrection is to experience the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life, which is to experience His resurrection power. Experiencing resurrection is the deepest and highest spiritual experience, and it comes through the cross. Without the death of the cross, there can be no resurrection. Unless a grain of wheat dies, it cannot be made alive (John 12:24; 1 Cor. 15:36). If the death of Christ does not operate in us, the resurrection life, the life of Christ, will not be manifested in our body (2 Cor. 4:10). Unless the cross of Christ puts our natural life to death, we cannot experience the resurrection life of Christ. We must let the cross put us to death in order to experience the life and power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. When we accept the death of the cross and let the death of the cross operate in us, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life and power will become our experience. We can be raised in resurrection if we are conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death. This is to experience Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (Phil. 3:10-11).</p>
<p>Every item of our spiritual life is in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, every spiritual thing depends on God, and our God is in resurrection (Matt. 22:32; John 11:25). Therefore, the natural man must not touch anything related to the spiritual life with his natural life. The natural life must be broken by the cross before we can touch life and touch God in resurrection. How much we touch life, touch God, and experience resurrection depends entirely on whether we accept the breaking of the cross and experience the death of the cross. The death of the cross must do a deep work of putting everything that is natural in us to death so that the life of Christ and the power of His resurrection can bring us into spiritual matters. Then we will touch God and experience Him in resurrection.</p>
<p>Every spiritual experience depends on the cross and must be through the cross. May we learn to know the cross more, accept the cross more, and experience the cross more so that we can have rich spiritual experiences in resurrection. May God be gracious to us.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> </body></html>
