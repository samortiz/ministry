   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>By the Transformation of the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>from Our Natural Being</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are saved in the divine life of Christ from our natural being by the transformation of the life-giving Spirit Rom 12:2b .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Transformation is not merely a change in outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Transformation is an inward, metabolic change, which involves something organic.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose I am pale in my facial color.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I can put different colors on my face in order to change the color of my face.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That would be a change, not a transformation, of the color of my face.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Transformation is an entirely different thing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Transformation is a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This metabolic change includes the introduction of something organic into a living entity, thereby causing an inward change.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such a metabolic change is the addition of a new substance into our being which, on the one hand, nourishes our being with new elements, and on the other hand, discharges the old things from our being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The old things are discharged, and the new elements are mingled with our being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This causes a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul used the word transform in order to stress the need of an organic change.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This organic change is brought about by the divine element being added into our being to discharge the elements of our old nature and to supply us with new elements.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are transformed by the life-giving Spirit from our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may be a person who is very nice, mild, and kind by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everyone may like you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But you have to realize that this is your natural being, and it must be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Transformation is by the renewing of our mind Rom 12:2b .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Formerly, our mind was set on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now, we must change the position of our mind by setting it on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The mind set on the spirit is life and peace Rom 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Changing the position of our mind will transform our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are transformed by the metabolism in the element of the divine life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In any kind of organic life, there is an organic element.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is the organic element which grows within us and transforms us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By Being Built in the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>from Individualism</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are saved in the divine life of Christ from individualism by being built in the Body of Christ Rom 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today on this earth there are very few Christians who have been built into the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All of us are still on the way of being built in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are still too individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is a certain percentage of individualism which still remains in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are built in the Body of Christ and saved from individualism by presenting our bodies a living sacrifice Rom 12:1 and by not thinking more highly of ourselves than what we are v. 3 . This is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Most of the troubles in the church life mainly come from thinking more highly of ourselves than what we are.</S>
