<p>After the magi departed, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying, &ldquo;Arise, take the child and His mother and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is going to seek the child to destroy Him&rdquo; (v. 13). Joseph was led in a special way. It was not that Joseph was having morning watch and read Hosea 11:1, which says, &ldquo;Out of Egypt I called My son,&rdquo; and then Joseph understood that the Bible was instructing him to take his family down to Egypt. This was not the case. The Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and gave him the revelation to flee to Egypt with the child and His mother. Joseph received the Lord&rsquo;s word, and he took the child and His mother and went down to Egypt. Thus, the fulfillment of the prophecy concerning Christ in Hosea 11:1 was carried out by God through Joseph&rsquo;s following the leading he received in his dream.</p>
<p>Joseph went down to Egypt and stayed there. This was his service to Christ. Joseph was the first person to serve Christ. He served Christ not according to Bible knowledge or teachings but according to his fellowship with the Lord. Joseph had a humble status and did not attract people&rsquo;s attention, but he fellowshipped with the Lord. In this fellowship the Lord revealed His heart&rsquo;s desire to Joseph. By following the revelation he received, Joseph served Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was born of Mary. However, Mary was a woman; she needed someone to coordinate with her. We must realize that if there were only Mary and no Joseph, the birth of the Lord Jesus would have been a problem. Perhaps Jesus would have been born in Nazareth, not in Bethlehem, which would not have been according to the Scriptures. The Lord Jesus was conceived in Nazareth, but He was born in Bethlehem. This was the result of Joseph&rsquo;s coordination. Joseph was from Bethlehem. Hence, when it was time to be registered, he had to return to Bethlehem (Luke 2:1-5). This is the way that the Lord Jesus was born in Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Later they had to flee to Egypt because Herod was seeking to kill the Lord Jesus. In ancient times it was very difficult for a young woman, like Mary, to travel with a child. In this matter it was even more necessary for Joseph to coordinate with Mary. It was only at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s conception that an angel went to Mary and told her that the Lord would be conceived in her (1:26-38). After that, the angel of the Lord did not tell Mary what to do, where to flee, or when to return. Instead, the angel of the Lord told Joseph what to do, where to flee, and when to return (Matt. 1:20; 2:13, 19-20). All Mary did was to obey Joseph. When Joseph said that they should go to Bethlehem, Mary followed him to Bethlehem. When Joseph said that they should flee to Egypt, Mary went with him. This kind of following was not in vain. When Mary followed Joseph, the prophecies in the Bible were fulfilled, and God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire was accomplished.</p>
<p>Mary was a good sister, and she had a portion in serving Christ. Without Mary, it would have been impossible for the Lord Jesus to be born. However, after the Lord Jesus was born, without Joseph, there would have been no way for Him to flee and be preserved. This is a picture of the coordination between the brothers and sisters. In the church we need the sisters to be like Mary and the brothers to be like Joseph in their coordinating together to serve Christ. The sisters have their portion, and the brothers have theirs, but neither the sisters nor the brothers should serve in a religious way or according to knowledge. Joseph and Mary received the Lord&rsquo;s living, instant, and timely instruction. When they were instructed, Joseph obeyed and Mary followed. This is truly a beautiful picture.</p>
<p>It is not so simple to follow the Lord. Often the Lord does not take the simple way. He does not tell us everything at once. Rather, He instructs us one step at a time. He told Joseph, &ldquo;Arise, take the child and His mother and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you,&rdquo; so Joseph fled to Egypt with the child and His mother and stayed there (vv. 13-15). Joseph did not know how long they should stay in Egypt. After a period of time, the Lord&rsquo;s instruction came again: &ldquo;Arise, take the child and His mother and go into the land of Israel&rdquo; (v. 20). So Joseph returned to the land of Israel with the child and His mother. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. At this point in time the Lord&rsquo;s instruction came again, and he departed into the regions of Galilee (vv. 22-23). Although Joseph might not have understood the significance of the Lord&rsquo;s instructions, through these moves the words in the Bible were fulfilled.</p>
<p>The Bible does not say that the Lord would be born in Nazareth. It says that He would be born in Bethlehem. Since the Lord&rsquo;s conception occurred in Nazareth, how could His birth take place in Bethlehem? According to history, after the divided Grecian Empire, the Roman Empire rose up and conquered Europe, Asia, and Africa to become a great empire with a vast territory. In that vast empire no census had been taken. Then during the reign of Caesar Augustus, a decree went out for a census to be taken of all the inhabited earth, and everyone went to his own city to be registered. Joseph lived in Nazareth, but he was of the house and family of David. Hence, when the decree was made, he went up from Nazareth to Bethlehem, David&rsquo;s city. Since Mary was engaged to him, Joseph brought Mary with him to Bethlehem. This was God&rsquo;s sovereignty; it was His arrangement in the environment for the fulfillment of His heart&rsquo;s desire (Luke 2:1-5).</p>
<p>Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s birth in Bethlehem was a very mysterious thing. He was conceived in Nazareth, and He grew up in Nazareth, but He was born in Bethlehem. The prophecies in the Bible indicate that He would be born in Bethlehem but be called a Nazarene (Micah 5:2; Matt. 2:23). The fulfillment of these prophecies is related to Joseph&rsquo;s service. Joseph truly lived before God and therefore was able to receive step-by-step instructions from God. What Joseph did fulfilled the words in the Bible. It is not good enough to do everything according to the Bible merely because we know and understand the Bible. The best thing is to contact the Lord and live in the shining of His face. Then everything that we do will spontaneously correspond to the Bible.</p>
<p>Last year a very peculiar male in his early twenties came to the church in Los Angeles. He had long hair, a long beard, and wrapped himself in a large and colorful but dirty blanket. Since the church should receive all people, including &ldquo;tax collectors&rdquo; and &ldquo;prostitutes,&rdquo; this person was not excluded. We received him, but we could not tell him to give up his dirty blanket. Every time he came, he wore his blanket. That was a real test to us. Then one day, after about a month, the blanket disappeared, his hair was short, and his beard was shaved. He was a tidy and clean young man. When he walked into the meeting hall, all the saints saw that he was a different person, and they leaped for joy. The Bible does not say whether or not it is acceptable to wear a blanket, nor does the Bible say that a brother should keep his hair short and shave his beard. That young man experienced a dramatic change in his life because he lived in the shining of the Lord&rsquo;s face. He did not keep dead letters and regulations; rather, he followed the living Spirit within him.</p>
<p>According to this principle, Joseph followed Christ. He walked with Christ step by step. Wherever he went, Christ was with him. When Christ was still a child, Joseph walked with Him, stayed with Him, and served Him. Joseph did not live according to the teaching of the Bible but according to the living light he received. Joseph lived in the presence of God. Our need today is the living light.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Being Delivered from Religious Rituals and Walking according to the Spirit &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
