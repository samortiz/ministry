   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TEACHING WITH PARABLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 8:4-18 we have the Man-Savior s teaching with parables.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here the Lord gives two parables, the first in verses 4 through 15 on the growth in life and the second in verses 16 through 18 on the shining of the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In brief, these two parables are concerned with the sower and the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Parable of the Sower</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The record of the parable of the sower in 8:4-15 is somewhat different from the record in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Matthew s purpose in recording this parable is to point out how it reveals the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, Luke s purpose is to show us that as those who are living in peace, following the Lord, and ministering to Him, we should grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 8:5-8 the Lord Jesus tells the parable of the sower; in verses 9 through 15 He explains this parable to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Luke 8:5a says, The sower went out to sow his seed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The sower is the Lord Himself, and the seed is the word with the Lord in it as life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verses 5 through 8 four kinds of soil are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we shall see, these kinds of soil signify four conditions of the human heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the disciples questioned the Lord concerning this parable v. 9 , He said, To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables, in order that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand v. 10 . This verse indicates that God s economy concerning His kingdom was a hidden mystery, a mystery which has been unveiled to the Man-Savior s disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because the nature and character of the kingdom of God are wholly divine and because the elements through which it is brought forth are the divine life and divine light, the kingdom of God, especially in its reality as the genuine church in this age Rom 14:17 , is still all a mystery to the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Four Kinds of Hearts</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Luke 8:11-15 we see four kinds of hearts into which the seed is sown.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first kind of heart is likened to the soil beside the road v. 5 . Concerning this, the Lord says in verse 12, Those beside the road are those who heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The earth beside the road is the earth on the wayside.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This earth has been hardened by a great deal of traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a result, wheat cannot grow in that kind of soil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A heart that is like the wayside, like the soil beside the road, is a heart in which there is too much traffic of worldly business.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If our heart is occupied with making a living, there will be too much traffic in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The result will be that our heart will not be the proper soil for the growing of Christ, for it will be a heart hardened by worldly traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A second kind of heart is likened to rocky ground 8:6, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This kind of ground has soil on the surface, but underneath it is full of rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not possible for Christ to grow in this kind of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A person with such a heart may receive Christ and be saved; however, it will be difficult for him to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because of the rocks, it is difficult for Christ to grow in the heart signified by the rocky ground.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Matthew 13:5 describes this kind of heart as rocky places, which do not have much earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This signifies the heart that is shallow in receiving the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a heart is shallow because deep within are rocks hidden sins, personal desires, self-seeking, and self-pity which frustrate the seed from gaining root in the depths of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Luke 8:7 says.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And other seed fell in the midst of the thorns, and the thorns sprouted up with it and choked it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Concerning this, verse 14 explains: And that which fell into the thorns, these are those who heard, and they are choked by the ongoing anxieties and riches and pleasures of life, and do not bring any fruit to maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here we see clearly that the thorns signify anxieties, riches in particular, the deceitfulness of riches Matt 13:22 , and the pleasures of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These things choke the word and prevent it from growing in the heart and becoming fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The fourth kind of heart is that signified by the good earth: And other seed fell into the good earth, and having sprouted up, it produced fruit a hundredfold v. 8 . In verse 15 the Lord explains, But that in the good earth, these are those who in a noble and good heart hear the word, and hold it fast, and bear fruit with endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This good earth signifies the good heart, a heart that is not hardened by worldly traffic, that does not have hidden sins, and that is without the anxiety of the age, the deceitfulness of riches, and the pleasures of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such a heart gives all the ground to receiving the word so that the word may grow, bear fruit, and produce even a hundredfold.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A heart without worldly traffic, rocks, and thorns is a purified heart.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This kind of heart is good for growing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After we have been forgiven and have begun to live a life in peace, we should follow the Lord and minister to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then according to 8:4-15, we need to deal with our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In dealing with our hearts, we should keep our hearts away from worldly traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that our hearts should not be occupied with the business of making a living.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead, we should live a simple life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, many are slaves to earning a living.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more they increase their living expenses, the more they need to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The more they uplift their standard of living, the more they need to work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some even work two jobs in order to maintain a high standard of living.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We, on the contrary, should simplify our living.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we simplify our life, our hearts will be kept away from worldly traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We also need to deal with all the rocks, the obstacles hidden within us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These hidden things may include hidden sins or hidden desires.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As an example of a hidden desire, we may mention the desire common among young people to have a good car.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The desire for a certain kind of new car may become a rock in our hearts, a rock that makes it difficult for Christ to grow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In addition to dealing with worldly traffic and the hidden rocks, we also need to deal with the thorns of anxieties, the deceitfulness of riches, and the pleasures of life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some, after graduating from college, worry about getting married or about saving money to buy a house.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Parents may worry about taking care of their children.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These anxieties are related to the cares of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If our hearts are filled with anxieties, how can Christ grow in us?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In order for Him to grow within us, our hearts need to be free from anxiety, the deceitfulness of riches, and the pleasures of life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The sequence in 7:36 8:15 shows that after we have been forgiven, we live a life of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As we follow the Lord and minister to Him, we need to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For the growth in life we need to have a good heart for the Lord to grow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A good heart is a heart that is kept away from the worldly traffic, that has all rocks cleared away, and that does not have the thorns of anxiety, the deceitfulness of riches, and the pleasures of life.</S>
