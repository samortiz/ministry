<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Urging God to Deliver Him<br>by Instructing God according to<br>His Natural Knowledge of Good and Evil</H2><P>In verses 17-28 David urged God to deliver him by instructing God according to his natural knowledge of good and evil.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XII. IN ASKING GOD TO DEAL WITH THE WICKED</H2><P>In Psalm 35 David asked God to deal with his enemies, and in Psalm 36 he asked God to deal with the wicked.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. His Accusation of the Wicked</H2><P>Verses 1-4 are his accusation of the wicked: "Transgression speaks to the wicked/Within his heart;/There is no dread of God/Before his eyes./For he flatters himself in his own eyes,/Until his iniquity is found out and hated./The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit;/He has ceased being wise and doing good./He plans iniquity on his bed;/He sets himself on a path that is not good;/He does not reject evil." Here David did not have the heart or the intention to ask God to be merciful to the wicked. Instead, he accused them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. His Praising of God's Lovingkindness, Faithfulness, and Righteousness<br>Mixed with the Enjoyment of God in His House</H2><P>Verses 5-10 are his praising of God's lovingkindness, faithfulness, and righteousness mixed with the enjoyment of God in His house. Verses 7-9 are a top portion of the Psalms concerning the enjoyment of God in His house, but such a portion is in a psalm in which David asked God to deal with the wicked. This again shows us the mixed expressions of David's sentiment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Entreating God to Deal with the Wicked according to His Way</H2><P>Verses 11-12 say, "Do not let the foot of the arrogant come upon me,/Nor let the hand of the wicked drive me away./There those who do iniquity are fallen;/They are cast down and unable to rise." In these verses David entreated God to deal with the wicked not according to God's way but according to his way.</P>
