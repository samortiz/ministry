        <h2 class="head1">THE HUMAN EMPHASIS</h2>
<p>Orthodox Christianity focuses on the following three matters: zeal for the gospel, loving the Lord and living for Him, and pursuing spirituality in order to live a holy, overcoming life. These are the three main lines in today&rsquo;s orthodox Christianity. Those who emphasize zealously preaching the gospel feel that nothing is more important than saving souls. Those who emphasize loving the Lord and living for Him have taken a further step. They feel that since they have received the Lord&rsquo;s grace, they should love Him fervently and live for Him. Everything they have is for Him. Those in the third group have taken another step. They want to learn to live in the spirit in order to live a holy, overcoming life.</p>
<p>These three items are correct and good. However, the vision that we have seen is not merely to preach the gospel zealously, to love the Lord and live for Him, or to be spiritual and live a holy and overcoming life. The vision that the Lord has given us is for us to be built up together in His life and in the Spirit to be His Body, the church. We cannot be individualistic and just preach the gospel zealously and save sinners, or love the Lord and live for Him, or pursue spirituality and live a holy, overcoming life. We must be built up together in the life of Christ in order to be one Body as His corporate vessel, and we must be built up together in the Spirit in order to be the temple of God as His dwelling place.</p>
<p>Some people are indeed zealous for the gospel and are willing to pay the price by spending their time and effort to save souls. However, because they have not consecrated themselves to the Lord nor allowed Him to touch certain areas of their being, they feel that their service of preaching the gospel is the unique need. As a result, they can see only this point. Furthermore, although their conduct has changed such that they are moral and good persons, they do not let the Lord be their Lord, they do not allow Him to touch them, nor do they care for His intention. Believers in this category zealously preach the gospel, but they have not consecrated themselves to the Lord.</p>
<p>The second category of brothers and sisters not only preach the gospel zealously but also love the Lord and consecrate themselves willingly. They surrender their rights to the Lord and let Him touch everything in their life and living. Although they testify that they live for the Lord, they still live by the self because they do not yet know the flesh. It seems as if they do not live for themselves, but actually they live by the self because they do not live in the spirit. They do not know the meaning of walking and living according to the spirit.</p>
<p>The third category of believers not only preach the gospel zealously and consecrate themselves to live for the Lord; they also learn to live in the spirit. In everything they ask whether it is what the Lord wants or what they want, whether it is His doing or their doing, and whether their conduct is according to the self or according to the Spirit. In every situation they learn to live before the Lord and in the Lord. However, their spirituality seems to be individualistic, and their living is personal. They are in the church, but they live an isolated and individualistic life. They have contact with other brothers and sisters and may even give a message, but they are not blended and cannot coordinate with others. Such believers can be compared to a drop of oil in water. Although the oil is in water, it is not blended with the water. These believers may be very spiritual and live before the Lord, but they do not know the meaning of coordinating in the Body of Christ. Hence, they are not built up together with others in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER SITUATION</h2>
<p>Through the Lord&rsquo;s light we have seen that these three situations cannot match the standard of God&rsquo;s intention. According to His intention, the service that God desires is not merely zealous preaching of the gospel. In many places there are some believers who constantly preach the gospel. These believers are content to preach the gospel so that people can hear the name of the Lord Jesus and receive salvation, but they do not care for God&rsquo;s desire. It is right to preach the gospel zealously, but we cannot be satisfied with this, because the vision of the church has been made manifest to us.</p>
<p>It is still not adequate for us to take a further step and consecrate our lives and all that we have to the Lord. We still must learn to live in the Lord and in the spirit. Before we do anything, we must have a sense of whether or not our doing is of the Lord.</p>
<p>Even though the third situation seems to be spiritual and quite acceptable, we should not be satisfied with it; we must advance further. The light we have received and the vision we have seen are that God desires to gain a group of believers who are built up into a dwelling place and coordinated to be the Body. God does not want us to merely preach the gospel zealously and save souls, or to merely consecrate ourselves to live for Him, or to merely be spiritual and live an overcoming life. He wants to have a group of believers who are built up together to be His spiritual house and are coordinated together to be the Body.</p>
<p>We know that we should preach the gospel, but we are not satisfied with merely preaching the gospel, because God is not satisfied. We know that we need to love the Lord, live for Him, and have a thorough consecration, but we cannot be satisfied or at rest in our spirit with this, because God is neither satisfied nor at rest. We should go further and learn to be spiritual, to live in the spirit, and to have a spiritual living. However, we still cannot be satisfied or at rest with this, because God is still not satisfied and cannot rest. The vision that God has shown us is that we should be built together in the spirit and in life with all those who love Him with a pure heart to be His spiritual house so that we can be coordinated together to express the Body of Christ. When this vision is fulfilled, we will be satisfied and have rest because God will also be satisfied and have rest.</p>
<p>If we read from Genesis to Revelation with the view of God&rsquo;s intention, we can see that God desires to gain a city, not merely thousands of saved individuals. He does not want to display to the universe many beautifully carved precious stones. He wants a city that is built with many precious stones. Just as God does not want many materials but a building, so He does not want many spiritual people but a Body, a dwelling place, the new man, and a counterpart.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no place for personal zeal or personal consecration in God&rsquo;s intention, nor is there a place for personal spirituality. Instead of asking whether there are gold, silver, and precious stones, or wood, grass, and stubble, we should ask whether the gold, silver, and precious stones are separate or built together, whether they are scattered or built up, and whether they are the issue of individual spirituality or of built-up spirituality. The Lord has given us the vision of the church; hence, we have seen that having proper conduct and being spiritual are not adequate. Not only is there no place for wood, grass, and stubble, but there is also no place for gold, silver, and precious stones unless they are built up.</p>
<p>This vision should capture and control us so that instead of being individualistic in our zeal, our love for the Lord, our consecration to live for Him, or our spirituality, we would be built up together. We must be built up together.</p>
<p>We rejoice and worship the Lord when we see a brother zealously preaching the gospel, distributing gospel tracts, and exhorting people to believe in the Lord, and we are sorrowful when we see a brother arguing with other people. Nevertheless, we must be clear that zealously preaching the gospel is not up to the standard of God&rsquo;s vision concerning the church.</p>
<p>Similarly, we rejoice to see brothers and sisters serving and laboring for the Lord and letting Him control their time, energy, and money. These believers do not care only for themselves, nor do they put the Lord aside and labor for themselves. However, we cannot be satisfied with this service, because the vision that we have received does not stop with consecrating ourselves to live for the Lord.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we rejoice and give thanks to the Lord when we see a brother who not only loves the Lord fervently and willingly gives everything to Him but also has his being and living in the spirit. Nevertheless, the vision that we have received does not stop with such a living. Can such a brother be built up with others? A person may be spiritual yet individualistic; he does not blend with others, nor can he coordinate with others. Such a person has learned spiritual lessons and is careful to live in the spirit. He is not offensive, does not speak casually, and does not voice his opinions, but like a drop of oil in water, he is unable to blend with other believers. It is not a matter of being in harmony with others but of blending with them. Such a person is individualistic and cannot blend with anyone.</p>
<p>Perhaps such a person does not think that he is individualistic, because he still meets with the brothers and sisters in the church. He may meet with the saints but not be blended with them in the spirit. Instead of arguing with others or criticizing them, he may express his so-called spirituality, saying, &ldquo;I dare not say anything with regard to this matter. If you feel that this is of the Lord, go ahead and do it.&rdquo; If he is asked to intercede for a certain matter, he might pray, &ldquo;Lord, if this matter is of You, bless it. If it is not of You, please intervene.&rdquo; This brother holds the attitude of a spectator. The affairs of the saints, whether right or wrong, do not have anything to do with him. Hence, even though he may express a certain degree of spirituality with the brothers and sisters, he does not blend with them, nor is he built up with them.</p>
<p>The more spiritual such a believer is, the more individualistic he becomes. He may even think that his individualism is acceptable, because others have not achieved his spiritual height and thus neither understand nor appreciate him. He may say that all spiritual people take the lonesome path, which only the Lord knows. He may think that the brothers and sisters are his cross and that he should pray for those who cannot keep up with him and do not understand him and, hence, do not know the Lord. Such reasoning causes him to be isolated and to despise the other saints. As a result, his isolation, not the Body, is built up. This isolation becomes a stronghold that cannot be torn down, and this makes it impossible for him to be built up in the church.</p>
<p>We need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to see that such a condition is abnormal and does not match the standard of the building. Being spiritual should not result in being individualistic; it should rather result in being built up with all the saints. Being spiritual should not result in living individualistically before the Lord. Being spiritual should result in our apprehending the breadth, length, height, and depth with all the saints (Eph. 3:18). The more genuine our spirituality is, the more we will lose our individualism and enter into the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONDITION THAT BRINGS IN THE BLESSING</h2>
<p>We should ask ourselves about whether the church is being built up, and about the condition of our service. Do we merely have a zeal for the gospel? Have we consecrated ourselves to the Lord? Are we learning to be spiritual? We also need to consider before the Lord whether we are content with being spiritual and whether we are blended with others. To be blended is not merely to be in harmony in a fleshly way, like people in the world. To be blended involves being one with others in the spirit, in our service, in the church, and in the Lord&rsquo;s work. Can the elders, the co-workers, and the district responsible ones be one with one another? I am concerned that our spirituality is not blended.</p>
<p>Whether or not the church can be blessed hinges on this vision. If we, the co-workers, elders, and district responsible ones, focus on individual spirituality and do a work of individual spirituality, we will not bring in much spiritual blessing. If we are not built up to be a dwelling place, there will not be a vessel that can contain and keep the blessing that descends from heaven. We have the materials, but they are scattered. Christians who love the world and also those who are spiritual are scattered materials. Christians who love the world are not blended, and the so-called spiritual Christians are not blended. Just as the Christians who love the world are not built up, cannot bring in the blessing for the church, and cannot bear the testimony of the church, so also spiritual Christians are not built up, cannot bring in the blessing for the church, and cannot manifest the testimony of the church.</p>
<p>Ephesians is not the only book that says all spirituality should be for the coordination of the Body and the building up of the church (4:11-12). For example, Romans deals with the spiritual stages of the Christian life, but after speaking of justification (ch. 4), sanctification (6:19), and the Spirit of life (8:1-2), it also presents the Body of Christ (12:1-8). A genuinely consecrated person, who presents his body as a living sacrifice, should live in the Body of Christ and coordinate together with all the saints as members of one Body.</p>
<p>May the Lord show us our real situation and cause us to be those who are controlled by this vision so that our service and our work will be for the building up of the church.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
