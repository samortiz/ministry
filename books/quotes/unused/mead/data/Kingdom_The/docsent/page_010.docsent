   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE COMING OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One day the Lord Jesus told His disciples that some of them would not taste of death until they saw the Son of Man coming in His kingdom Matt 16:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to Mark, He said that some of those standing there would see the kingdom of God coming in power 9:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Shortly after speaking these words, He went to the mountaintop and was transfigured there Matt 17:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The transfiguration of the Lord Jesus was the realization of what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When He was confined in His flesh, people thought of Him as only a little man from Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The kingdom was in Him, but they could not see it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The kingdom was in Him just as electricity is in a building unless the switch is turned on, no one can observe the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once the switch is turned on, the lamp will shine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This shining is simply the expression of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The kingdom of God was in the Lord Jesus, but it was concealed, covered, and confined within His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He stood among the Pharisees, yet they could not observe that something wonderful was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even His own disciples could not see it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After six days, He went to the mountaintop, and there He was "switched on."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was shining.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His shining came from within, not from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Something within Him was shining.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although this reality was present within Him before His transfiguration, people could not observe it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, at His transfiguration, His disciples could observe something shining out from within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may say this was the shining of the Lord Jesus or the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus, but He Himself said it was the coming of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The shining forth of the Lord Jesus on the mountaintop was the coming of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not merely a dispensation or a sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our vocabulary is inadequate to describe it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The transfiguration, the shining of the Lord Jesus on the mountain, was the coming of the kingdom in power!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The kingdom is simply the Lord Jesus shining over you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I hope this sentence will make a deep impression on you: the kingdom is the shining of the Lord Jesus, and the kingdom is the spreading of the Lord Jesus by shining over you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He told Peter, James, and John that they would see Him coming in His kingdom that they would see the kingdom of God coming in power.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What did they see?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They saw the shining of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Peter, James, and John were all under His shining, they were in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Also, the dead saints, represented by Moses, and the living saints, represented by Elijah, appeared and were under the shining of the spreading of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let me illustrate: suppose there are five brothers living together in a brothers' house.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If these brothers are really under the shining of the Lord Jesus, the kingdom will be there in that brothers' house.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whenever you visit them, you will sense the shining, the reigning, the ruling, and the good order.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although you would find no list of regulations, everything is kept in order by the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose, however, they do not live under the shining, but rather they criticize and despise one another while pretending to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you visit them you will have the spiritual sensation that you are in a cemetery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although everything is quiet, there is the dreadful presence of death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although no one is fighting and everything is in order, death and the authority of darkness are still there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is no shining.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The kingdom is the shining of the reality of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever He is shining over you and you are under that shining, you are in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although it is not easy to describe or define the kingdom, I believe that now you have at least a little understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The kingdom is not merely a dispensation, a sphere, or a realm.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is the realization of the reality of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever He is spreading by shining over you, you are in the kingdom and the kingdom has come in power.</S>
