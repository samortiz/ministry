The Issue</H2><P>Psalm 92 shows us the issue of the deeper experience of God in the identification with Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Rejoicing in the Great Works of Jehovah</H2><P>First, the issue is that the saints rejoice in the great works of Jehovah (vv. 1-9). If we do not dwell in God, not taking God as our habitation, we may see many things, but these things will be insignificant. But when we dwell in God, taking Him as our habitation, we see His great works. For example, as I dwell in God today, I can see the spreading of His recovery to Russia and to Poland. Surely this is a great work of God. By dwelling in God we will see His great works and rejoice in them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Their Horns Being Exalted by Jehovah,<br>and They Being Mingled with Fresh Oil</H2><P>In verse 10 the psalmist says, "You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox;/I am anointed with fresh oil." The Hebrew word translated "anointed" here (the same word used in Leviticus 2:4) can also be rendered "mingled." The fresh oil is the consummated Spirit, who is fresh and present. I can testify that in the last five years I have enjoyed being mingled with fresh oil more than ever, and I have been full of joy in the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Flourishing like the Palm Tree<br>and Growing like a Cedar in Lebanon</H2><P>Psalm 92:12 through 14 says, "The righteous man will flourish like the palm tree;/He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon./Planted in the house of Jehovah,/They will flourish in the courts of our God./They will still bring forth fruit in old age;/They will be full of sap and green." The poetry here is a picture of those who experience God in a deeper way by dwelling in Him, taking Him as everything in their living in the house of God.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_266.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_268.html">Next</a> </body></html>
