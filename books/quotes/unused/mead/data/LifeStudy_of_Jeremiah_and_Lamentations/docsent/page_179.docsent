   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHAT WE ARE IN OUR FALLEN CONDITION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another aspect of the kernel of the book of Jeremiah is the exposure of what we are in our fallen condition.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this matter Jeremiah is very deep but also very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 17:9 he speaks regarding the human heart, saying, "The heart is deceitful above all things / And it is incurable; / Who can know it?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our heart is deceitful to the uttermost and incurable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Just as our heart is incurable, so our fallen nature is unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, in 13:23 Jeremiah says, "Can the Cushite change his skin, / Or the leopard his spots?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>/ Then you also may be able to do good, / Who are accustomed to do evil."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In our fallen condition we are corrupt and rotten; there is no way for us to change, correct, or improve ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The disciples of Confucius tried to use his teachings to improve themselves, but they have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As fallen human beings, we are incurable and unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>WHAT CHRIST IS TO US</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The third matter in the kernel of the book of Jeremiah is what Christ is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Shoot of David</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jeremiah 23:5 and 6 say, "Behold, days are coming, / Declares Jehovah, / When I will raise up to David a righteous Shoot...And this is His name by which He will be called, / Jehovah our righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although Christ is God, He became a Shoot, or Sprout, of David.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that He was incarnated to be a descendant of David.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a Shoot, the Sprout, of David, Christ is tender, living, and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jehovah Our Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ, the righteous Shoot of David, is called Jehovah our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our fallen condition we are corrupt, sinful, deceitful, incurable, and unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How could we ever be righteous before God?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In ourselves this is impossible, but we can become righteous in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ came to die on the cross for our sins, accomplishing redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Based upon Christ's redemption, God is able to forgive our sins, to forget our sins, and to justify us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, with the redemption of Christ as the foundation, Christ Himself has become our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only have we been justified by God, but God has given Christ to us to be our righteousness 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a wonderful fact that Christ has become one with us to be our righteousness.</S>
