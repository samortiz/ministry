<h2 class=head1>CHRIST JUDGING THE LIVING BEFORE THE MILLENNIUM</h2><p>Most of the nations will follow Antichrist in his rebellion, and most of them will be killed in the battle of Armageddon. Revelation 14:20 says that the blood from this battle will be “up to the bridles of the horses for a thousand six hundred stadia.” A thousand six hundred stadia is 182 miles, the distance from Bozrah (Isa. 63:1) to Armageddon (Rev. 16:16). One day Christ, the embodiment of God, will fight face to face with the Antichrist, the embodiment of Satan. Nearly the whole world will follow Antichrist to fight against Christ.<p>While Antichrist is seducing the world to follow him against the Jews and against the remnant of the Christians, the eternal gospel will be preached by an angel who will shout, “Fear God…and worship Him” (Rev. 14:7). Some from the nations will respond to this gospel and will take care of the Jews and the believers who are under the persecution of Antichrist. Christ will gather all of those from the nations who remain after the battle of Armageddon to His throne of glory in Jerusalem where He will judge them to divide them into sheep, the good ones, and goats, the bad ones. The sheep will be those who respond to the eternal gospel. The Lord Jesus will cast the goats, those who followed Antichrist, into the lake of fire with Antichrist, whereas the sheep will enter into His kingdom, not as His sons but as His subjects to live in the sphere of eternal life (Matt. 25:31-46).<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN THE MILLENNIUM</h2><p>Christ will be the King to rule over the earth with His overcomers (Rev. 20:4, 6) in the kingdom of one thousand years. He will be the King to the people and the Priest to God. All His overcomers who joined Him in the wedding and in the fighting will also join Him in the kingship with the priesthood for one thousand years to serve God and rule over all the nations, the sheep.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST JUDGING THE DEAD AFTER THE MILLENNIUM</h2><p>Christ will judge all the dead people (Acts 10:42) at His great white throne (Rev. 20:11-12). The Bible says that Christ has been appointed by God to judge the living and the dead (Acts 10:42; 17:31; 2 Tim. 4:1; Rom. 2:16). He will judge the living, the sheep and the goats, at His throne of glory at the beginning of the thousand-year kingdom. After the thousand-year kingdom, He will be on the white throne to judge all the dead and sentence them to the lake of fire.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2><p>In the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:1—22:5) He will be the Husband of God’s redeemed people as His wife in eternity (21:2) and the temple with God for the redeemed to live in as their eternal dwelling place to serve God (21:22). He will also be the lamp with God as the light in Him (21:23) to shine through the lamp and through the New Jerusalem. He will be the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, on the throne to rule over the new heaven and new earth (22:1). The throne is one for both God and the Lamb because God as the light is within the Lamb as the lamp. God is in the Lamb, and the Lamb is sitting on the throne. Eventually, in eternity He will be the tree of life nourishing the entire New Jerusalem (22:2).<p>We need to see the sequence of the items of Christ in these last two messages. We have seen Christ in eternity, in creation, in incarnation, in His human living, in His all-inclusive death, in His resurrection, and in His ascension. Once the church is established, He is many items to take care of the church and to transform us. After our transformation is completed, He will come back to redeem us. Then He will be in the kingdom, and after the kingdom He will be in the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem the ultimate item is the tree of life. This is the all-inclusive, unsearchable, extensive, unlimited Christ, who is our Christ. This is the Christ whom the recovery receives.<p>We must have the recovery mainly to recover Christ. Christ in His all-inclusiveness has been mostly lost in the denominational theology. All the denominations have their creed, including the Nicene Creed. None of them is as complete as these two messages on Christ. We have to spread the recovery’s creed concerning the all-inclusive Christ from eternity past to eternity future.<p>We should humble ourselves before the Lord by saying, “Lord, we have been in Your recovery for many years hearing that Christ is the centrality and universality of God’s economy, but we have never learned to know Him so much.” If we share these aspects of Christ with others, we will see a difference in our gospel preaching. This will convince people. To be vital we need to know these aspects of Christ. The Lord’s recovery is the recovery of Christ.
