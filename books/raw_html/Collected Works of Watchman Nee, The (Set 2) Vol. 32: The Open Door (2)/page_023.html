<h1 class="title">ISSUE NO. 10</h1><h2 class="head4">P. O. Box 84, Hankow, August 1938</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Watchman Nee, England</h2><p>At such an urgent and critical hour, how I long to be with all of you to bear the burden together. But the Lord is the One who is guiding my footsteps.</p><p>I have no other purpose in coming to Europe this time; I feel that God has led me to seek God's remnant here, to communicate with them, and to learn to pray together and to bring in God's kingdom. We do need a revival to see what we saw at the beginning. May our work be governed by this vision.</p><p>Watchman Nee, June 13</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Witness Lee, Chefoo</h2><p>There is much of the Lord's blessing on the work here. Since spring we have had two baptisms. About forty brothers and sisters have been baptized. Among them, a few brothers have been actively seeking the Lord. Thank the Lord! The Lord willing, I will make a trip to Peking and Tientsin. There are urgent needs in the work waiting for me there. I cannot say definitely how long I will stay there and where I will go from there.</p><p>Witness, June 10</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chai Tse-chung, Pu-Tien</h2><p>The meeting hall in Kulangsu is housing one hundred fifty refugees. Two stories of the building at the back are reserved for our brothers and sisters who are taking refuge in this place. The gospel meetings at the meeting hall have been forced to be temporarily suspended. Brother James Chen has returned to Kulangsu from Swatow, and he is conducting a Bible study at the believers' houses daily. On June 6 Brother Chen Ke-san went to work in Feng-Ting. Later Sister Bau Hsu-min joined him. Brother Chen Jai-seng and I had twelve days of meetings in Fu-Ching. Brother Jung Chun-geng and Sister Wang Yien-tse are helping us.</p><p>Brother Chai Tse-chung, June 28</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Sister Miao and Sister Tso,<br />Shanghai</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Beginning July 1 the gospel work with the women has been taken up entirely by the local sisters. We finished studying the Gospel of John the Wednesday before last. In the future we will still have a sisters' meeting on Wednesday. May the Lord lead them on.</p><p>Two weeks ago I was quite tired. My heart was somewhat sick, and I was weak. After resting for a week, I am improving, but I cannot leave Shanghai yet. Brother Hsu Dah-wei has been in Shanghai for three weeks. Beginning July 11, at the invitation of the local church here, he will conduct a perfecting meeting for the young brothers and sisters. It will be four times a week, starting at four o'clock. Beginning this Lord's Day, we will start a bread-breaking meeting in the house of Wu Shen-lai. We hope that a few more places will open up eventually. When the number of people in a meeting becomes too large, the worship becomes a little too stifling. Because of the increase in business affairs, a few brothers and sisters have been added to the list of deacons and deaconesses. Neither God's love nor His grace will touch some, and we can only ask for God's discipline. The Lord has truly heard our prayers recently, and a few brothers and sisters have turned back.</p><p>Miao Yun-chun, July 13</p>
