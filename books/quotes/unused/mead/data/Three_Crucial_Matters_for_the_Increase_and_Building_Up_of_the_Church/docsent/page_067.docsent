   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE THE SPREAD OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE GOAL OF THE NEW WAY THE GOSPELIZATION OF TAIWAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are full of joy and thanksgiving to the Lord that in an age in which everyone loves himself and desires a prosperous future, one hundred thirty saints are willing to disregard their future for the sake of the Lord s interest and go to the towns and villages for the spread of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first group that went out consisted of one hundred saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Recently, thirty more saints joined them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This brings the total to one hundred thirty saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By being willing to take this narrow way to witness for the Lord, these young saints have shown that they are absolute and consecrated to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In addition, their testimonies show that their work in the spread of the gospel has been effective.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They did not go out to speak empty words or abstract ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, their speaking enabled the Holy Spirit to work in people, and this operation of the Spirit caused people to change.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The testimonies of these young saints also show that they are gospel propagators and that the Lord is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When they went out to preach the gospel and lead sinners to salvation, they were distributing, dispensing, Christ into people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Christ who is in these young saints is the real Fruit-bearer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is the enlarging One, the multiplying One.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the One establishing the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE PRESENT SITUATION OF</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE WORK OF SPREADING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first wave of saints raised up fifteen churches in sixty days.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On average, they baptized fifty people in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to their records, the full-timers baptized seven hundred fifty to eight hundred people in two months.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A little less than one-fourth of the people they baptized are remaining fruit; that is, they are in the Lord s Day meeting and have entered the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that there are about one hundred fifty new ones in fifteen new churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In addition to the new ones, there are some brothers and sisters who formerly were scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These brothers and sisters were like orphans without a home or without a proper dwelling place, because there was no church in their town.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the one hundred full-timers went to the towns and villages and established fifteen churches in two months.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Consequently, the scattered saints have found a dwelling place in the new churches; they have returned home.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, in every new locality there are local saints in addition to new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In some places there are only a few local saints, but in other places there are more than twenty local saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These fifteen places now bear the testimony of the golden lampstand; that is, there is a church in these localities.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We believe that by the end of this year, there will be a twofold increase in these new localities.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the present situation of the spread.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>HOW TO IMPROVE THE PRESENT SPREADING</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In considering the practical situation, we feel that there is much room for improvement; we need to endeavor to do better.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We will first reduce the number of persons on each team from twenty to six.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In addition, every team will have a base.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The saints responsible for making arrangements are renting and furnishing places that will be suitable to use as a base.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By the time the second wave of saints is ready to set out, there will be twelve towns or villages ready for them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The second wave will have twelve teams with six members on each team.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a total of seventy-two people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first wave consisted of one hundred full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We estimated that they could establish fifteen churches in two months.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After a locality was raised up, two full-timers remained in the new locality to continue laboring.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that thirty saints remained in fifteen new localities.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After the new localities were raised up, an additional thirty full-timers joined the labor.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, there are a total of one hundred thirty saints laboring on the island of Taiwan for the propagation of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These saints are about the same age and are balanced in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should all rejoice and give thanks to the Lord for these saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We dare not say that such a spread of the gospel is an unprecedented move for Christianity in the Far East, but we can say that at least in Taiwan, such a move has never occurred before.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One hundred thirty young saints are willing to hand themselves over for the propagation of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These are college graduates who have gone through substantial spiritual training and are willing to come forth for the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is truly marvelous that in this day and age so many full-time serving ones can be produced from among college graduates.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is one of the main reasons I returned to Taiwan in 1984.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>America is a large country with numerous colleges and universities, but because the universities are scattered, it was difficult for us to concentrate our work in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, the Lord has particularly blessed the situation in Taiwan, in that the island is small, and the people are educated.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As a result, it is easy to concentrate our effort on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For this reason, we have been able to gain hundreds of college students in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If it were not for the hundreds of college students who are joining Calvary s hosts, the Lord s spreading work would not be able to proceed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In August 1986 we began the first term of the full-time training.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There were two terms in 1987 and also in 1988.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have finished five terms, and we are presently in the sixth term.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Several hundred brothers and sisters were gained through the first five terms.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Prior to the current move for the spread of the gospel, some saints returned to their jobs after the training.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even though it will not be easy to locate these saints now, we can use them as reserves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the need arises, they can be enlisted.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>From this we can see the Lord s sovereign preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our heart rejoices to see one hundred thirty college graduates who are trained and can be sent to labor in various places.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the past decades we labored much on the campuses, but we never saw such a sight.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is different from our scattered labor of the past, in which everyone did his own work.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Now we are trained, and we go out in teams.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Moreover, before the saints go to specific destinations, there is detailed planning, much prayer, and sufficient preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then the saints are sent out at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Within two months we saw the effectiveness of this work.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We are full of thanksgiving, but we feel that there is still the need for improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, we are reducing the size of the teams from twenty people to six.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even though we have one hundred thirty young people laboring in the spread of the gospel, and they have already spread to fifteen places, giving us fifteen bases, we have insufficient manpower to guard what has been established.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is our present problem.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Therefore, the additional thirty brothers and sisters will be used to strengthen the fifteen bases.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This will give us four full-timers in every locality to care for the new church.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Initially, some places had only two young sisters overseeing the new church but no brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This situation made it difficult to care for the new saints, and it caused concern for the security of the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Now two more saints are being added in each place, and this doubles the manpower to labor together in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Furthermore, from now on the four people in each base will not be moved to another place; they will labor in one place for four months.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is rather precarious for newborn babies to have their nannies changed frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Hence, we are adding two more nannies to each team.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The original two nannies already have two months of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Four saints will now labor continuously for four months, and they will not take a leave of absence without a legitimate reason so that the ones who are under their care can grow normally.</S>
