   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PETER BEING A PATTERN FOR US</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Peter is also our pattern for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Peter is the first one to whom the Father revealed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is also the first one to whom Christ revealed the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Throughout the Old Testament, no one was clear about Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Matthew chapter 16, Peter saw the revelation of Christ and the church at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was very blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is a blessing to see Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Have you seen Christ and the church?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you have seen this vision, you are also very blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was faithful to the Lord's vision, though not in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He failed in himself, yet he succeeded in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After Christ breathed the Holy Spirit into him in John 20:22, and poured the Spirit upon the Body in Acts 2:4, Peter took the lead to preach the gospel to save the Jewish sinners and establish the church in Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was the use of the first key of the kingdom of heavens to unlock the kingdom for the Jewish believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He continued to preach Christ to save sinners for their regeneration in Acts 3 and 4 even though he was threatened by the Jewish rulers and charged not to teach in the name of Jesus Acts 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Peter and John were bold and said to them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to hear you rather than God, you judge; for we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard'' Acts 4:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He also used the second key of the kingdom to open the kingdom to the gentile believers in Cornelius' house Acts 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He continued to preach Christ to build up the church despite the fact that he was threatened, beaten, and put in jail.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When he was older, he wrote in 1 Peter 2:5 that we are living stones being built up into a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not forget the vision he saw in Matthew chapter 16.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Praise the Lord for our brother, Peter, who was faithful to the end, preaching and laboring for Christ and the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He certainly is our pattern for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>PAUL BEING A PATTERN FOR US</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul is a very good pattern for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Acts 26:19 Paul told King Agrippa that he "was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.''</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If he said that he was not disobedient, that means that one can be disobedient.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He did not disobey what he saw.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Will you obey or disobey what you see?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What did he see in the heavenly vision?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He saw Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that time his name was Saul, and he was persecuting the church Acts 9:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the day of his conversion, he was on his way to Damascus to bind all who call upon the name of the Lord Acts 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"And as he went, it came about that he drew near to Damascus; and suddenly a light from heaven shone around him; and he fell on the ground and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And he said, Who are You, Lord: And He said, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting'' Acts 9:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Saul did not have this revelation, thinking that he was persecuting Stephen and other Jesus-followers in the way he considered heresy 24:14 , not knowing that when he persecuted these he persecuted Jesus, for they were one with Him by being united to Him through their faith in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He considered that he was persecuting people on earth, never thinking that he touched anyone in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To his great surprise a voice from heaven told him that He was the One whom he was persecuting, and His name was Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To him this was a unique revelation in the entire universe!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By this he began to see that the Lord Jesus and His believers are one great person the wonderful "Me.''</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This must have impressed and affected him for his future ministry concerning Christ and the church as the great mystery of God Eph 5:32 , and laid a solid foundation for his unique ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The wonderful "Me'' that he saw was the universal new man, the Body of Christ, with the Head in the heavens and the Body on the earth.</S>
