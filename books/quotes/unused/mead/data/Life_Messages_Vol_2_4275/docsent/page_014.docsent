   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE A LIVING PERSON, NOT ANY SUBSTITUTE Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4, 14; 6:63; 14:23; 15:7; 2 Cor 3:17-18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ is the Head, and the church is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Together they are one person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible, from its first page to its last, reveals this person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The head and the body are not two separate entities.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the Lord said, "I am the vine, you are the branches" John 15:5 , He was saying that He and we are one living item.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The stem and the branches are included in each other.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The meaning of this oneness of the vine and the branches is the focus of the entire divine revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE LESSON OF HISTORY</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Human history has already passed through six thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All of history testifies to one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That one thing is the need of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why, for example, was religion invented?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was because man lacked Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was short of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Genesis 4 makes this quite plain.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Cain was driven out of the presence of God and thus lost God, he and his descendants began to invent things vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>16, 20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jubal, for example, was "the father of all such as handle the harp and organ."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The invention of music includes entertainment, like dancing, singing, and sports.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why is it that people are so attracted to nightclubs, concerts, and such?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is because they lack Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For us God is our entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is our joy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord is our song.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moses said, "The Lord is my strength and song" Exo 15:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Another invention arising out of mankind's loss of God was cattle-raising Gen 4:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jabal was a nomad, dwelling in tents.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because the land would not yield its strength to him, he was forced to be a wanderer and to keep cattle in order to make a living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The making of weaponry was yet another invention to fill the loss of God 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Modern weapons may be more highly developed, but their beginning was soon after Cain "went out from the presence of the Lord" v. 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Genesis 11 another invention was brought in, that of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At Babel idol worship was introduced.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All idols are a replacement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you have God, you do not need idols.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God wants man to have only Himself, a living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Another replacement for God is ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even one thousand years before Christ was born, the Chinese people had the ethical teachings of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ethics may be desirable from society's point of view, but such teachings are simply one more invention to fill the shortage in mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The jars of humanity are empty because God has been lost.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All these inventions are attempts to fill that void.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Are you an empty jar?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am no longer empty because I am filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have no need of religion; I have a living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have no need of ethics; I have the living Christ.</S>
