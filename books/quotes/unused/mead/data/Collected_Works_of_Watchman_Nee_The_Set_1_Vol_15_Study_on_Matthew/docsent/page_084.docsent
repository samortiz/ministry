   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MATTHEW CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to understand Matthew 24 and 25, we must first understand the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After we have understood the rapture, we still need a considerable foundation before we can understand Matthew 24 and 25.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two chapters are prophecies concerning 1 the Jews, 2 the church, and 3 the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Besides Revelation, these two chapters are the most important prophecies in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Revelation covers the details, whereas Matthew covers the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These two chapters are most difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Until a hundred years ago, no one paid much attention to them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was not until 1828 that people began to study them in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because of differences in background, the expositions were different.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Generally speaking, there are three schools: 1 Newton maintains that both these chapters refer to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2 Darby and Scofield maintain that both these chapters refer to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3 Our attitude is that some parts refer to the Jews and some parts to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The reasons put forth by the three schools respectively are: 1 the disciples represent the church, 2 the disciples represent the Jews, and 3 the disciples are Jews representing the remnant of the Jews and also at the same time are pillars of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is most important to see the difference in the division of these two chapters; otherwise, we will be misled by the first two schools.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must read carefully, and we must read it ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is like bringing our own scales to buy our groceries; it is the only way to assure that we will not be cheated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us look at the background of chapters twenty-two and twenty-three first.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Matthew 21:43 the Lord prophesied about the taking of the kingdom of God from the Jews, and in 22:21 the Lord commanded the Jews to submit to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In chapter twenty-three the Lord rebuked the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 23:38 the word "house" has the same root word as the word "buildings" in 24:1.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It should have been the Father's house, but at that time it had become "your house."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here the Lord was clearly rejecting the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the background.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before the Lord there are two groups of people: 1 the rejected Jews, and 2 a nation producing its fruit 21:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The disciples represented both the remnant of the Jews and the called ones, that is, both the Jews and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, we should first find out which section refers to the Jews and which section to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Matthew 24:1-31 refers to the Jews; whereas 24:32 25:46 refers to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reason for this division is based on the internal evidence and the external evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The internal evidence is the text itself; the external evidence is the proof from the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>1 Matthew 24:1-31 refers to the Jews because these verses are all interpreted literally, whereas 24:32 25:46 must be interpreted spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, in Matthew 24:20 the "winter" refers to the wintertime, to the hardship in escaping.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Sabbath day also should be interpreted literally.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the other hand, the "summer" in 24:32 is interpreted spiritually; it refers to the coming of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The fig tree refers to some Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Also, the reference to the "inner rooms" in 24:26 is interpreted literally, while the "house" in 24:43 is interpreted spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All those verses that refer to the Jews should be interpreted literally, and all those that refer to the church should be interpreted spiritually see Matt 13:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>2 Before Matthew 24:31, all the verses have a Jewish background; for example, "holy place" v. 15 , "in Judea" v. 16 , and "Sabbath" v. 20 . After verse 31, everything is in the open, and there is no restriction according to location.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>3 Before Matthew 24:31 everything is material; after verse 31 everything is moral.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, when it mentions "nations," "those who are pregnant," and "babies," all these are literal.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the other hand, the "virgins," the "slaves," the "master of those slaves," the "goats," and the "sheep" in chapter twenty-five all have moral meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, there is a difference in meaning of the words "go forth" in Matthew 24:26 and "went forth" in 25:1; one is literal and the other spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>4 Before 24:31 there is no moral requirement; there is only the need to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After verse 31 all the requirements are moral being watchful and being prepared are all the responsibility of the saints in the end time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>5 False Christs The Jews believe that another Christ will come.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>So before verse 31 there is the difference between the Jews and the Gentiles "kingdom against kingdom" means the Gentiles against the Gentiles .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After verse 31 there is no such distinction because the reference is to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Panton also said that verse 31 is a great dividing line.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In summary, Matthew 24:4-31 refers only to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Matthew 24:32 25:30 refers to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Matthew 25:31-46 speaks to the church concerning the things of the Gentiles see chart .</S>
