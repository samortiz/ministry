   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE EIGHT THE UNIT OF GOD'S SALVATION Scripture Reading: Luke 19:5, 9; Acts 16:31; 1 Cor 1:16a</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In considering the exercise and practice of the God-ordained way to preach the gospel, we must include the unit of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Most people, whether Christians or non-Christians, think about God's salvation as involving individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The natural mind thinks of one person as the unit of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This kind of thinking is contrary to God's economy, God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's ordained way is to gain households, not just individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God revealed His unit of salvation even in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God did not save simply Noah and his wife from the flood He also saved their sons and daughters-in-law Gen 7:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eight persons were included as a part of Noah's household 1 Pet 3:20; Heb 11:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That was the first complete type of God's salvation exercised over people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Exodus 12, the Passover lamb was eaten according to households.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a household was too small for the lamb, they were to share their lamb with a neighboring house vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, the blood of the Passover lamb was put on the doorposts and the lintel of the house in which they were instead of upon any individual.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To take the Passover as an individual is contrary to God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jesus Christ, as the Passover lamb, is not only for individuals; He is for a whole house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not take care of the household as the unit of God's salvation, we are violating the principle of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we invite people to come to a meeting of the church, many will come by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we go to visit people in their homes, we will reach their whole household.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From this we can realize that "door-knocking" reaches the household not only one person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we knock on people's doors, we are observing the principle of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is a shame if we despise the God-ordained way of reaching people with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must take this God-ordained way of preaching the gospel, which is according to the biblical revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>AVOIDING THE WINDS OF DIFFERENT TEACHINGS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are really for the Lord's recovery, we must stand against any teaching that is contrary to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The unit of God's salvation being a household is according to the truth; therefore, we must stand for this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must realize that we are being sent out by the Lord to reach households, the entire unit of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we pay attention only to individuals rather than households in preaching the gospel, our God may be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our going out to reach people should include their whole family.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many of us are still under the influence of erroneous teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Apostle Paul describes such teachings as "every wind of teaching" Eph 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a wind of teaching is wrong in an obvious way, no Christian will listen to it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If someone tells us to worship idols, for example, we will not pay attention to him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, some may say to us, "Well, of course, we should not worship idols, but God is too abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need a picture of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A picture of Jesus is not an idol."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is strange that all the "pictures of Jesus" depict such a handsome person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to history, such pictures have their origin in artwork produced during the Middle Ages.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This artwork is totally opposite to Isaiah's portrayal of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Isaiah 53:2 says, "He hath no comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was not handsome according to the natural way of thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This proves that the pictures on the walls of some Christian homes are not pictures of Jesus, yet some would even worship these pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such pictures are deceitful, perverted, and even demonic.</S>
