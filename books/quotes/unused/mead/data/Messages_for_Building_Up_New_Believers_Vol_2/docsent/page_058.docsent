   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Scattering Money</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now read Proverbs 11:24: There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; / and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many people have not scattered, and they are left with nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many people have scattered, and they become prosperous.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is what God s Word shows us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the Christian principle of managing finances.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>D. Giving All for God</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Consider another wonderful portion of the Word Elijah s prayer for rain on Mount Carmel 1 Kings 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There was a drought, and it was so dry that even the king and his chamberlains had to go out to search for water.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Elijah was repairing the altar on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He wanted to offer a sacrifice, and he asked men to pour water on the altar and the sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How precious was water at that time!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even the king had to go out to look for water.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But Elijah told the men to pour out the water.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He told them to pour it three times until the water ran round about the altar like a river.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Was it not a waste to pour out so much water before any rain came?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Would it not have been a pity if no rain came after they poured out so much water?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But Elijah told them to bring jars of water and pour them out.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Next he knelt down and asked God to send fire to burn the sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God heard his prayer, received the sacrifice by fire, and sent the rain.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must first pour the water out before rain will come.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The rain will not come if we are reluctant to pour out the water.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The problem of many people is that they hold on tightly to what they have and yet expect God to answer their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although God wanted to dispel the drought, man had to pour out the water first.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The human thought is always to have some backup.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If no rain came, at least there would be some jars of water.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But those who count the jars of water on hand will never see rain.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To see the rain, one must be like Elijah, willing to part with the water that is on hand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everything has to go.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If new believers are not delivered from the power and grip of money, the church will never be able to run a straight course.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I hope that you will be a consecrated person and will offer up everything you have for God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>E. The Promise of Supply</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Philippians 4:19 is a very special verse.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Corinthians were parsimonious in giving, while the Philippians were very generous.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul received from the Philippians time and again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He told the Philippians, My God will fill your every need according to His riches, in glory, in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you see something special in Philippians 4?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul emphasized, My God will fill your every need.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The God who receives the money and the gifts will supply the needs of the givers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Philippians had been caring for Paul again and again, and Paul s God supplied their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God will never supply those who do not give.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today many people hold on to Philippians 4:19, but they do not really understand it, because God does not supply those who ask, but those who give.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only those who give can claim Philippians 4:19.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who do not give cannot claim this promise.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You must give before you can say, O God, today supply all my needs according to Your riches in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God supplied all the needs for only the Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God will only supply the needs of those who are practicing the principle of giving.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When your vessel is empty of flour and when your bottle is empty of oil, please remember that you must first make bread for Elijah with what little you have left.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You must first feed God s servant.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Take the little oil and flour and make bread for the prophet first.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After a while, this little flour and oil will feed you for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Who has ever heard of a bottle of oil feeding a person for three and a half years?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But let me tell you, if you take your little flour and oil and make bread for the prophet, you will find the bottle of oil feeding you for three and a half years cf.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Luke 4:25-26; 1 Kings 17:8-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What one has may not be enough to feed him even once.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But when it is given away, it becomes the means of one s livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the Christian way of financial management.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>LETTING GO OF OUR MONEY</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Both the New Testament and the Old Testament teach us the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Christian way should not be the way of poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God does not want us to be poor.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If there is poverty or want among us, it is because some people are holding back their money.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The more you love yourself, the more you will go hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The more importance you attach to money, the poorer you will become.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I may not be able to testify of other things, but I can surely testify of this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The more one holds back his money, the more miserable and depleted he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is a sure principle.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>During the past twenty years, I have seen many such cases.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I only wish that we could release our money and allow it to circulate around the earth, to work, and to become part of God s miracles and answers to prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then when we have needs, God will supply us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Not only are we in God s hands, but Satan is also in His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The cattle on a thousand hills and the sheep on ten thousand hills are His.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Only foolish ones think that they have earned their own money.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A new believer must see that tithing is our duty.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should give what we earn to take care of the poor saints.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Do not be so foolish as to always receive.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Do not try to save up your money or hide it away.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Christian way is the way of giving.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Always give what you have, and you will find money becoming something living in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When you have any need, the birds in the air will work for you, and God will perform miracles for you.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Cast yourself upon the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Otherwise, God cannot carry out His word in you.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>First give yourself to God, and then give your money again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If you do this, God will have the opportunity to give to you.</S>
