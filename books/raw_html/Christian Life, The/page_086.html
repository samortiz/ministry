<P>Now we need to consider when humanity was brought into divinity. Union requires two parties, so there must be a two-way traffic of divinity being brought into humanity and of humanity being brought into divinity. God united Himself with us; then He caused us to be united with Him. God's uniting Himself with us in His incarnation is a one-way traffic. Then in His resurrection, He brought us, the flesh, into divinity. This is the completion of a traffic of two ways.</P><P>The identification, the union, between God and man took a long time to accomplish. God made man about six thousand years ago. In Genesis 3:15 God promised fallen man that He would come as the seed of the woman, indicating His incarnation, but He did not come right away. After two thousand years, He repeated nearly the same promise to Abraham. He told Abraham that in his seed (singular) all the nations would be blessed (Gen. 22:18; Gal. 3:16). The seed of the woman in Genesis 3:15 would be the seed of Abraham, a descendant of Abraham. God waited for still another two thousand years to fulfill this promise. From Adam to Abraham, there were two thousand years; and from Abraham to Christ, there were another two thousand years. There were altogether four thousand years from the creation of Adam to the incarnation of Christ as the seed of the woman and the seed of Abraham.</P><P>God came to join Himself to the flesh, to us, to humanity. He lived on the earth in humanity for thirty-three and a half years. The "divine factory" did not produce the mingling of God and man in a quick way. For God to fully accomplish His union with man, He had to pass through human living, pass through death, and enter into resurrection. He did this to bring humanity, to which He had united Himself, into divinity.</P><P>The New Testament tells us that when He died on the cross, He died with us (Gal. 2:20a), because He died on the cross in the flesh, and we are the flesh. He was in union with us. The Lord Jesus was crucified in His flesh (1 Pet. 3:18; Col. 1:22). Christ's divinity was not crucified; divinity cannot be crucified. His divinity includes the eternal life, the resurrection life; nothing can kill it. Christ died in His flesh. In His flesh, in the condition of His flesh, He was killed. The flesh not only includes us but also refers to us. Christ died in the flesh, and this flesh refers to the entire human race. This means that He died on the cross with us.</P><P>In the book Born Crucified there are a number of good expressions. The author said that Christ not only died for us but also died with us. He died for us to redeem us, and He died and resurrected with us (Eph. 2:6) to identify us with Him. When He became incarnated, He identified God with man. When He died and resurrected with us, He identified us with God. This is a two-way traffic.</P>
