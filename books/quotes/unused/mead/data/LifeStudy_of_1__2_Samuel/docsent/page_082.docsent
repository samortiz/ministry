   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE HISTORY CONCERNING DAVID 6 PREPARED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE A MAN ACCORDING TO THE HEART OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 SAMUEL 16 2 SAMUEL 1 6 PERSECUTED AND TRIED BY SAUL 5 Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 31:1 2 Sam 1:27</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will consider the ending of Saul 1 Sam 31 and David's reaction to it 2 Sam 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>XXIII.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE ENDING OF SAUL</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first point concerning Saul's ending was that he lost God's presence 1 Sam 16:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today we treasure and enjoy God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's presence is just the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Spirit is the resurrection of Christ; the resurrection of Christ is Christ Himself John 11:25 ; and Christ is the embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit is the reality of God and of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we have the Spirit, we are in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we have the resurrection, we have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we have Christ, we have the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is a tragedy that many of today's Christians miss the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They have the Spirit in their theology, but they do not treasure the Spirit as the consummated God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At this point I would like to say a word about the steps of God's process.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God in eternity past was merely God, divine and triune the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to His desire God made an economy, and according to His economy He created the heavens and the earth with man as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet He still remained purely divine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, God intended to join Himself to man in order to make Himself one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus He became a man through incarnation, putting on man's blood and flesh Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In eternity past He was merely divine, but by being incarnated He became a God-man named Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through the process of incarnation He entered into humanity, making Himself, the divine One, one with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this way He became the God-man, the One who is both divine and human, the complete God and the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the almighty, eternal, and complete God, He lived in humanity for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then, as the eternal One who is the eternal life, He entered into death and toured Hades for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rising from Hades, He walked out of death and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through incarnation He brought God into man, and in resurrection He brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through incarnation He brought divinity into humanity, and in resurrection He brought humanity into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After His resurrection He entered into heaven, and today He is in the heavens as a man sitting on the throne Acts 7:56; Heb 1:3b; Eph 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As such a One, He is now the consummated God, having passed through the steps of incarnation, human living, the all-inclusive death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In ascension as the consummated Triune God He remains the complete God mingled with the perfect man the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This realization is the conclusion of our study of the Bible over the last seven decades.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today as the consummated God He is the Spirit, our life, our Redeemer, our Savior, our Master, our Lord, our Father, and our God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He became a man that we as men may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He has made Himself one with us, and He has made us one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He went through human living, and we traveled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He went to the cross, and we were crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He resurrected, and we resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is in the heavens, and we are there with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now the consummated Triune God as the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b indwells our spirit 6:17; Rom 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, the realization of God's presence is altogether a matter of these two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Saul lost God's presence, and eventually death came in every way, in every aspect, and in every sense.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Saul and his sons died a corporate death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let us now consider the account of the ending of Saul in 1 Samuel 31.</S>
