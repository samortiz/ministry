   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FEEDING AND SHEPHERDING THE LORD'S SHEEP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 21 the Lord asked Simon Peter three times if he loved Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Peter answered that he did, the Lord charged him, "Feed My lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Shepherd My sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Feed My sheep" John 21:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people confuse these three charges of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first time the Lord said to feed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The lambs here refer to the young, newborn sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They do not need the shepherding yet.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They need only the feeding, which is to put the grass by their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the lambs are grown up, they can be in the flock, and there is the need of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, in 1 Peter 5:2 Peter said, "Shepherd the flock of God."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The third time the Lord mentioned feeding again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This shows us that the sheep in the flock have not graduated from feeding; they still need the feeding and the supply of the grass.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our home meetings and small group meetings are related to the feeding and the shepherding of the Lord's sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not too difficult for you to be revived every morning and to be overcoming every day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as you have the heart and are willing to sacrifice a little of your time, you can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the other three things the home meetings, the group meetings, and the preparation for prophesying are not that easy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They require much practice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>FEEDING PEOPLE IN THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is quite inappropriate in the home meetings for us to try to help the newly baptized ones to live a revived and overcoming life immediately after salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is like teaching kindergarten children with university material.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The new ones are newborn babes and know nothing about revival and overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we have to exercise our spirit to speak something suitable to them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is much to learn here.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are not proper in our speaking, we will cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, we have to pay close attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Both the home meetings and the group meetings have their difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But one principle is the same: it is impossible to set down rigid rules.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, you cannot come without any preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is like a cable car.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There may be no track, but the cable car cannot go where it pleases; above it there is still the cable to which it is joined.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You cannot speak whatever you want to a newly baptized one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This will only stir up his curiosity, and it will not help him much in his Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Basically, what a newborn baby needs the most is feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From experience we know that after a person is baptized, he may, experientially speaking, be only half saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to help him to be fully saved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, after we preach to a person with the booklet The Mystery of Human Life and the person has prayed and received the Lord, we may perceive that he is ready for baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Subsequently we baptize him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But it is possible that the person has not touched the Lord within yet.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is like having the lamps, the electric wires, and the bulbs all installed; but the electricity is not yet connected.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For this reason, the key point in our bringing people to salvation is to help them to make the "connection" with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They have to be quickened by the Lord within.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some of us have had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A person has heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is baptized and can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He comes to the meetings and even reads the Bible, yet you still feel that such a one might not have been quickened yet.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He does not yet seem to have touched the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, outwardly speaking, his salvation is clear; but inwardly speaking, his salvation is vague.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The reason for this is that he is not yet clearly enlivened within.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I speak all these things from my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When I was in Shanghai, I knew a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>During the years that I was acquainted with him, I never touched his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One time I asked Brother Nee why this was so.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He answered jokingly, "This person might have been saved without being regenerated!"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As far as the truth is concerned, he who believes and is baptized is saved Mark 16:16 ; but for all the time that I was with him, I never touched his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is why Brother Nee joked that he "might have been saved without being regenerated."</S>
