[1]  Lesson 37: The Way to Enjoy God s Salvation Including the First Stage of Sanctification
[2]  Then the last two volumes cover the full salvation which God has prepared in Christ for us who have believed into Him, the riches which we have obtained in Christ, the experience which we should have in Christ, the things which we should accomplish in Christ, and the goal which we should attain in Christ.
[3]  In the previous three volumes we covered thirty topics concerning the matters between God and us, and between us and God.
[4]  On the positive side, when we believe, we believe into Christ and receive God into us, that we may obtain Him and His eternal life.
[5]  When we believe in the Lord, we believe into the Lord that we may be joined to Him in God s eternal life to enjoy the full salvation which is prepared by God in Him.
[6]  In Christ is the beginning of our union with Him, which affords us the position and sphere to enjoy God s full salvation; Christ in us is the progress of this union, which further gives us the experience and the elements of the enjoyment of God s full salvation.
[7]  If we allow our experience of these two our being in Christ and Christ s being in us to continue without hindrance or distraction, we will richly and unceasingly enjoy God s full salvation in Christ.
[8]  When we hear and believe in the gospel, the Holy Spirit who sanctifies us and causes us to repent brings Christ into us, on the one hand, to be our inheritance from God and, on the other hand, to be the faith through which we are allotted and receive God s inheritance.
[9]  Furthermore, the Holy Spirit, who brings Christ into us, is the ultimate expression of the Triune God reaching us and entering into us to bring Christ into us as our eternal portion from God.
[10]  In God s full salvation, there are the items of propitiation and reconciliation; that is, God propitiates for us who once had a problem with Him, and God reconciles to Himself us who were His enemies.
[11]  For this reason, the Lord Jesus not only offered Himself as our sin offering on the cross Isa 53:10 to redeem us from our sins before God, but He also became our propitiation to appease the problem which we had with God.
[12]  For the second step of our reconciliation to God, Christ was made sin and crucified for us on the cross 2 Cor 5:21 , that we may be delivered from the flesh and that God might make us His righteousness in Christ.
[13]  Dispositional sanctification is the sanctification lived out from within us as a result of the growth of the life that we received by believing into Christ.
[14]  God in Christ dispenses His divine life and nature into us that we may be the partakers of His divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 , thus living out a sanctified life by His divine life with His holy nature in us.
[15]  After obtaining the forgiveness of sins and the cleansing away of sins, and after being sanctified, we have no further problems before God.
[16]  However, because on the cross the Lord Jesus shed His precious blood, paid the price, and satisfied all the requirements of God s righteousness upon us Rom 5:9 , God is able to justify us by His grace according to His righteousness.
[17]  By His grace, and through the redemption of Christ Jesus, God would justify us and can justify us; yet for us to be justified by God, there is still the need of our faith in Jesus Christ.
[18]  We have obtained the objective and positional justification by God s grace, through the redemption of Christ Jesus, and through our faith.
[19]  Therefore, we obtain subjective justification in life by God s life, through the resurrected Christ, in His person, and in the Spirit of God.
[20]  In God s full salvation, when we believe into Christ and thereby experience the forgiveness of sins and the cleansing away of sins, propitiation and reconciliation, and sanctification and justification, we immediately receive God s regeneration.
[21]  The six steps of experience spoken of previously belong to the redemptive aspect of God s full salvation.
[22]  It is therefore a most crucial matter pertaining to our enjoyment of God s full salvation, having to do with our living and work in the present age after we believe into Christ and are saved, as well as with our destiny in the coming age and in eternity.
[23]  To be regenerated is not to be born of blood the fleshly life of man , nor of the will of the flesh the will of the fallen, fleshly man , nor of the will of man the will of the God-created man , but of God, that man may obtain the spiritual life of God.
[24]  1 Unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God John 3:3 .
[25]  When we are born the second time, of God, that is, when we are regenerated, we are born from above, from heaven, and the spiritual life of God which we receive is from heaven and of heaven.
[26]  In the life aspect of God s full salvation, after we experience regeneration, the experience that follows immediately is renewing.
[27]  In the life aspect of the full salvation prepared by God for us, the transformation in life which we experience spontaneously causes us to grow in the spiritual life unto maturity.
[28]  1 Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us be brought on to maturity Heb 6:1 .
[29]  The word of the beginning of the Christ refers to the word in the gospel concerning Christ s saving us and regenerating us, that is, the word in God s salvation which initiates us in the spiritual life.
[30]  2 Not that I...am already perfected full-grown in life , but I pursue, if also I may lay hold of that for which I also have been laid hold of by Christ Jesus for me to gain Him ...I do not yet reckon myself to have laid hold of Christ , but one thing forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal Christ for the prize Christ of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
[31]  In God s full salvation, after we have enjoyed the growth and maturity in the life of Christ, the next step is conformation.
[32]  This conformation is not accomplished by our outward following of some model; rather, it is worked out by the growth of Christ s life from within us.
[33]  These verses show us that not only Christ, who became man and took the form of man, was born to be God s firstborn Son in His resurrection, but also we, His believers through the centuries, have been born together with Him as God s many sons in His resurrection, that He may be the Firstborn among many brothers, and that we the believers may be like Him.
[34]  In God s full salvation, we begin with regeneration and continue to experience and enjoy the rich life of Christ through renewing, sanctification, transformation, maturity, and conformation, and ultimately, unto glorification.
[35]  To be glorified is to enter into God s glory, to experience and enjoy, without measure and without limit, the infinite and eternal life of God in Christ.
[36]  1 ...the God of all grace, who called you into His eternal glory in Christ 1 Pet 5:10 .
[37]  Here we are told that God s purpose in calling us in Christ Jesus and in giving us all grace is that we may enjoy His eternal glory.
