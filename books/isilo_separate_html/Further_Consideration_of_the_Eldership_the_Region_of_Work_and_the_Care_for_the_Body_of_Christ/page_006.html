I know the problems with the elderly brothers. The problem with those in their old age is opinions. An old brother feels that he has the experience. He has passed through the problems of the young and middle-aged brothers. Now he has learned a lot. If some want to act, he will say not to because of his experience. His opinions hinder the work. The older ones can hinder the going on of a church because of their opinions.</P><P>Pride, the thought of being a hero, and opinions have been used by the enemy among us in the past seventy years. I am sorry that Brother Nee is not here. If he were here, he would nod his head again and again to my word. He would tell you that I am altogether right.</P><P>To illustrate what I have been saying, I would like to relate something of our history. I was sent by the work to Taiwan in 1949. In the spring of 1950, Brother Nee came out of mainland China to Hong Kong, and he brought in a revival there. He contacted me and asked me to come to Hong Kong from Taiwan to help. The next morning he brought me to the service meeting, which included the elders, deacons, and co-workers. He brought me in and said, "Brother Witness, according to the authority the Lord has given you, make full arrangements for all the service concerning the co-workers, the elders, and the deacons." Later, a small group was formed to take care of the purchase of some land for the building of a hall. Brother Nee found out that this group, mostly of older brothers, was full of opinions. One day, Brother Nee took the opportunity in his wisdom to tell this group, "Concerning the purchase of land and the building up of the hall, you have to listen to whatever Brother Lee says." They all agreed to this.</P><P>Soon after this, I was invited by this group to an older brother's home for a love feast. This older brother was full of experiences. These experiences had become his opinions. After we had started to eat, they said that they were begging me for permission to buy only one acre of land. I had told them previously to buy two acres of land, but they thought this might be too much.</P><P>I told them that since the church in Hong Kong was their church, this was their business. But I also told them that if they were going to buy a piece of land in a big city like Hong Kong, they should buy it in a sufficient way. I warned them that after buying the land, it would be very difficult for them to go back to get additional land. They still decided to purchase only one acre. After they made the plans for the hall, they found out that one acre was insufficient. Then they tried their best to go back and get more land. They did everything they could, but they were only able to get a little bit more property. This illustrates how the Lord's work can suffer because of opinion.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
