<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p> This book includes the first four of a series of messages on the church services. They were given by Brother Witness Lee in Anaheim, California in September and October of 1989.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY<br />
REVEALED IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<p>The so-called new way the Lord has shown us in the past four and a half years is a way that is fully revealed in the New Testament. It is not really new. But to us it is a new way. For this reason, I prefer to term it the God-ordained way. It is something ordained by God, and is neither invented nor produced by human thought.</p>
<p>At the end of the first century after the Apostle John passed away, the church lost its direction. From the second century the lovers of the Lord Jesus and His Word studied the New Testament and as a result saw something but not in full. In every century there have been these lovers of the Lord and lovers of the Word groping to find the right way to serve God. This kind of groping was needed because the New Testament was written in the way of life, not in the way of religious regulation.</p>
<p>The Old Testament was likewise not written in the way of religious regulation but was rather written by God&rsquo;s revelation in different ages through different channels. The entire Old Testament from the first five books written through Moses to the last book of Malachi was written for revelation, not for regulation. Nevertheless, in the five books of Moses God gave a clear record indicating how the priests in the Old Testament should serve. From the priesthood and the priests in the priesthood one could learn how to serve God. Not one point was left for anyone&rsquo;s decision. For any detail you had to refer to Moses&rsquo; writing, the law. You had to find out what was regulated by the law.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, however, it is difficult to find such a thing. For example, for close to sixty years I have tried to find verses concerning the matter of Christian meetings. You may not find one right away; then you may find a verse in Matthew 18. Verse 20 says, &ldquo;For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there I am in their midst.&rdquo; You may consider that this is part of the way to have a Christian meeting, or from another angle you may not. You can thus see it is difficult to find the way to meet in the New Testament.</p>
<p>Similarly, consider the matter of preaching the gospel. Preaching the gospel is there in the New Testament, but it is difficult to say what the right way is. The New Testament tells us in full, but you need to spend much time to find the way. Then you will find some part in Matthew, some part in Luke, and so forth.</p>
<p>Therefore, through the centuries there have been some new discoveries. However, in each century something of human invention, human concept, and human ideas was added to what was discovered in the Bible. For example the Presbyterians discovered the presbytery but added something to it, and the Baptists discovered baptism by immersion but added something to it. As a result, what has come to us through today&rsquo;s Christianity is a kind of a mixture.</p>
<p>Through the centuries there have also been some lovers of the Lord who knew the Bible better than others. They therefore dropped many things which were added or brought in through human concept. For instance, the Brethren dropped a lot and came out of the mixture. Yet even they did not get into the full understanding of the biblical way ordained by God. As I have often mentioned, we followed them. At the beginning under Brother Nee&rsquo;s teaching, at least eighty percent of our practice was a copy of the British Brethren. This was the reason some of the missionaries called us &ldquo;the Chinese edition&rdquo; of the Brethren.</p>
<p>Ten years later Brother Nee began to see more from the Bible which did not justify some of the things of the Brethren practice. He therefore published a short four chapter book in 1934 entitled <em>The Assembly Life.</em> Three years later, in 1937, he spoke the messages contained in <em>The Normal Christian Church Life,</em> published the subsequent year in Chinese and later in English. Brother Nee received further visions from the Lord. For example, in <em>The Normal Christian Church Life</em> he wrote concerning the meeting of mutuality in 1 Corinthians 14. This chapter, which is particularly on the church meeting, indicates that when the whole church comes together, each should share something, one by one, in the way of mutuality. This matter is still not properly practiced among us. Ten years later, in 1948, Brother Nee again stressed these things in his training and in the book <em>Church Affairs.</em> Brother Nee saw something, but it was difficult to find a way to carry it out.</p><h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
AS PRIESTS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT GOSPEL</h2>
<p>What we have we first received from the Brethren and then from Brother Nee, but we have not yet practiced some of the things which he saw. In <em>Church Affairs,</em> Brother Nee pointed out that the Lord&rsquo;s Day message meeting is following &ldquo;the custom of the Nations&rdquo; (2 Kings 17:8, NASB). He therefore proposed stopping the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning message meetings to send out all the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel (see pp. 67-82, <em>Church Affairs</em>). Surely the way for the saints to go out to preach the gospel was to visit people in their homes.</p>
<p>I have often mentioned that by 1984 I fully realized that the recovery among us had come to a dead end. There was no way to merely continue practicing the way we had been taking. We could not continue it any longer. Furthermore, times and ages have unveiled to us that the way of gospel preaching we were practicing was not fully according to what is properly revealed in the New Testament. I had the realization that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to us through Brother Nee and was now with us. This was a heavy burden upon me, considering that at that time at least one hundred twenty thousand people around the globe were waiting for my teaching. Therefore, I felt burdened to go back to Taiwan, temporarily stopping my work in the United States to have a big beginning for the study of the God-ordained way. I concentrated my time, my energy, and nearly every cent which the Lord gave us. As you may know, we spent a lot of money to take care of the expenses associated with six to eight hundred trainees for those many months of training.</p>
<p>I relate these things because of the opposition. Today I have the full confidence that the way which we are speaking tonight is the right way, the God-ordained way. This first step is to preach the gospel as the priests of the New Testament gospel by visiting people in their homes not only to save them but also to bring them to the Lord and His Body. You may say this is the step of gospel preaching; however, it includes another point&mdash;the priesthood of the New Testament gospel. We did not see this point before and, based upon it, the way is new to us. We did not see this in 1987 nor even just a year ago. While the opposition was arising, we did not see this. We began to see this in March of this year, after the rising up of the opposition. It is not just gospel preaching; it is the practice of the New Testament priesthood.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this kind of preaching is not by gathering people in a meeting, but by visiting people. You have to go to them. Acts 8 shows the way. Thousands of believers in Jerusalem were scattered by a great persecution and went out preaching the gospel (v. 4). Their way was surely not one of gathering people but of visiting people where they were. This is, briefly speaking, &ldquo;door-knocking.&rdquo; How can you visit people without knocking on their doors? You may say this is something old practiced by the Mormons and the Jehovah Witnesses; however, as far as we are concerned, it is new. This is according to the Bible. This kind of gospel preaching is scriptural, ordained by God, and clearly and properly revealed in His Word. Why would people oppose this?</p>
<p>The real purpose of the opposition is to put the ministry down. Dear saints, if the ministry and the new way are put aside, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will have nothing. This is the real subtlety of the enemy. We, the opposed ones, have learned the lessons of the Lord and would prefer not to say anything. The goal of the opposition is not the door-knocking gospel preaching but the putting aside of the so-called new way and the putting down of the ministry. The putting down of the ministry is the ultimate goal.</p><h2 class="head1">AS NURSING MOTHERS SETTING UP HOME MEETINGS<br />
TO NOURISH THE NEW ONES</h2>
<p>The first step is to preach the gospel as the priests of the New Testament gospel by visiting people in their homes. This kind of preaching is according to the Bible. The second step is to have home meetings in the new believers&rsquo; homes, to nourish them as nourishing mothers, to feed them as Peter was charged by the Lord. The Lord said to Peter, &ldquo;Feed My lambs&rdquo; (John 21:15). We need to do this. Some have accused my training of being Hagar, the concubine Abraham married, and all the people baptized through door-knocking as Ishmaels. But how about the hundreds we baptized before 1984 and where are they now? It is not fair to accuse the new way in such a manner as mentioned above. After baptizing people, we need to go back to their homes like nursing mothers to nourish these new ones. What babe could live if mothers delivered the children but did not continue to nourish them? Hence, home meetings in the newly baptized ones&rsquo; homes are desperately needed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PERFECTING THE SAINTS AND<br />
PROPHESYING TO BUILD UP THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The third step is to help the saints be perfected. This is surely a new way, as we have never practiced what is revealed in Ephesians 4:11-12. The fourth step is to pursue to prophesy that the church may be built up by the saints as revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. This prophesying is not by giant speakers but by all of the saints. All of these steps are more than scriptural.</p>
<p>Please believe that this God-ordained way is fully scriptural. Recently the Baptist Church has practiced door-knocking. Other denominations are reconsidering their way because a number of their leading ones realize they do not have a way to go on. If we do not take this God-ordained way, we have no way to go on. I am more than clear this is the way.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I realize there is the need of training. Nearly all of the saints who are happy with this God-ordained way are not clear how to practice it. Therefore, this is where my burden is.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH AND THE CHURCHES</h2>
<p>The training will be conducted in a way to not bother or disturb the church life. The classes will be conducted during times in which there are no church meetings and some of the trainees will be sent to several localities to strengthen the church life there and learn something of the church life while they are being trained.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:28 says, &ldquo;And God has placed some in the church: firstly apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.&rdquo; &ldquo;Administrations&rdquo; is related to the managing of the elders; &ldquo;help&rdquo; is related to the service of the deacons. God has placed the gifted persons in the church: firstly the apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers; then the elders who administrate and the deacons who help. All of these people are in the church. The &ldquo;church&rdquo; does not just refer to the local churches but also to the universal church. We should behave, act, and move as one church. Paul does not say &ldquo;in the churches&rdquo; in the way of autonomy, but he says God placed &ldquo;in the church&rdquo; as a whole. The churches are separate, but all of the local churches are still one church. There are many local churches, but we all have to consider that we are just one church. Regardless of who you are, whether you are an elder, or a deacon, or a prophet, or a teacher, or an apostle, you have to consider you are just part of this unique church. God placed the apostles, the prophets, the teachers, the helping deacons and the administrating elders in the church. We all are one church. We consider all the local churches with all the serving ones as one church. This is not a federation. This is an organism. As Paul used the word &ldquo;church&rdquo; not &ldquo;churches&rdquo; in this verse, we should consider all the churches as one church. Locally, there are many; universally, they are just one.</p>
<p>We should go on together in one accord. Consider how much blessing is lost due to discord. The enemy is subtle. Where discord comes in, it destroys the one accord and causes indescribable loss. The recovery came to this country starting from Los Angeles and spread and produced many churches. All of the churches were in one accord. At that time we saw the blessing. This is why I am reading you this verse. We must realize we are local churches, yet we are still one church as the unique organic Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:22-23).</p>
<p>(A message given by Witness Lee in Anaheim, California on September 4, 1989)</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE SERVICE AND RESPONSIBILITY<br />
OF THE ELDERSHIP</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 20:17-20, 27, 31</h1>
<p>In this message we would like to fellowship concerning the eldership. No one among the saints is qualified in himself for the eldership. According to 2 Corinthians 3:5, the Apostle Paul said that we are not sufficient of ourselves but that our sufficiency is in the Lord. So, all the brothers who bear the responsibility of the eldership should put their trust in the Lord. In order to be faithful to their responsibility, they should spend more time for the church and pay more attention to the saints by visiting them individually.</p>
<p>Acts 20 is the record of a word by Paul addressed to the elders from Ephesus. It was given in Miletus while Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem for the last time. From Miletus Paul sent some to ask the elders in Ephesus to come to him.</p>
<p>Verses 17 through 19 say, &ldquo;And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church. And when they came to him, he said to them, You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time, serving the Lord as a slave with all humility and tears and trials which came upon me by the plots of the Jews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time Paul and these believers were people absolutely for God. At the same time there was another group of people, the Jews, who claimed to be for God also. These two were in rivalry. The Jews even hated Paul and his followers to such an extent that they plotted and conspired to damage Paul and his ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAUL BEING A PATTERN TO THE ELDERS</h2>
<p>Paul is a real pattern to all of the elders. He is a real pattern. Although he himself had never been an elder, yet he set up a model, a pattern, an example for the elders whom he had trained. So, whatever he spoke about himself, his expectation was that all the elders would follow his steps and imitate what he had been doing. First Paul said that he was serving the Lord as a slave. The elders all have to serve the Lord as a slave. They are not put into a position of dignity or rank. In the church there is no rank and no position. There is only humility and slavery. Following humility there are tears, not joy and happiness. Then third are the trials which come upon us from other people who claim to be for God, and even conspire to undermine the work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVING AS SLAVES</h2>
<p>Elders should serve the Lord not just as servants, but slaves, losing their right and all kinds of liberty. Actually, to be put into the eldership is to be brought into slavery. We all are slaves to serve the Lord. To serve the Lord here is not to serve the Lord directly, but indirectly by serving His people. The elders must pick up the burden of a slave to serve the big family of their Master. We must behave, do things, and even have our being as slaves with all humility.</p>
<p>We should brand ourselves with the word <em>humility.</em> We have no right to be proud of anything. Everything that is glorious should go to our Master. He is the only One who is qualified to be proud of anything. We are destined to be humble. To be humble is not an easy thing; to be proud is easy. To be humble and even to be humbled is not a happy thing, but a thing of tears.</p>
<p>For the elders never to drop tears for the saints under their care might not be so good. Tears should go along with our humility. We should be humbled by the situation and ready to accept the trials from others.</p>
<p>This portion of the Word spoken by Paul is not only an admonishing word, but also a kind of prediction or foretelling. It is not only a charge but also a foretelling. What is pictured in these few verses is exactly the situation in which we are today. Paul was serving the Lord as a slave with all humility and tears because at his time there were others competing with him. They even plotted to undermine his work, his ministry, and himself. So, trials followed.</p>
<p>The elders should not anticipate much comfort but be prepared to face sufferings and trials. On the one hand, we all must pick up the burden of the eldership. Yet, on the other hand, we must be ready to face any kind of trials that come upon us from others. At Paul&rsquo;s time the trials came from the Jews who were not atheists, but those who worshipped God, and, in their view, served God.</p><h2 class="head1">SHEPHERDING AND TEACHING PUBLICLY<br />
AND FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE</h2>
<p>Then Acts 20:20 says, &ldquo;How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable.&rdquo; Paul did not shrink from his duty. He did not withdraw from declaring to the saints anything that was profitable to them. To declare something is more crucial and more important than to merely tell. Paul did a faithful job to declare every bit of God&rsquo;s interests that He had toward His people.</p>
<p>Paul did not withdraw from his responsibility. Rather, he taught the believers publicly in the meetings and privately from house to house.</p>
<p>From now on the elders should do more home visitation. By visiting the homes of the saints, the elders can teach and shepherd the saints. Teaching in this verse really means shepherding. In the New Testament, teaching goes along with the matter of shepherding. Shepherding needs the proper teaching.</p>
<p>Among us in the past our concept was that the elders only manage the church affairs, make decisions, and give announcements. But we have to realize that to manage the business affairs of a local church is secondary.</p>
<p>A local church in its administration does need some management in its business affairs. But the main responsibility of the elders is firstly to shepherd, as Peter tells us in his first Epistle, chapter five verse 2. As we have indicated, shepherding requires teaching, so the elders should also teach (1 Tim. 3:2; 5:17). For the elders to teach others, they first of all must be taught. They must learn first.</p>
<p>Just to visit the homes of the saints and tell them to trust in the Lord and believe in Him is not adequate. The elders must read to them some profitable verses, give them some definitions, and teach them with the Holy Word. Then they will be edified, established, strengthened, and built up.</p>
<p>To shepherd is not just to give a message. This is neither adequate nor primary. The primary responsibility is to go to the saints and shepherd them in their homes. So Paul set up a pattern for the elders by teaching the saints publicly and from house to house. In Greek, &ldquo;from house to house&rdquo; means according to houses. If there is a house, the elders should go. If there are ten houses, they should go to each one to visit each of the saints.</p>
<p>When I was in the Lord&rsquo;s work on mainland China close to fifty years ago, I spent much time visiting people for the gospel to get them saved and going to the saints&rsquo; homes. By visiting a home the real situation of that person&rsquo;s environment could be seen. Then the elders could render them the proper shepherding.</p>
<p>Although we need to mow the lawn, keep our house clean and neat, clean the windows, and vacuum the carpet, do not spend that much time on these things. Rather, we should save some of the time to shepherd the saints. If we go to the homes of the saints to shepherd them, there will be a record of this in the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DECLARING GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL ECONOMY</h2>
<p>In Acts 20:27 Paul continues to say, &ldquo;For I did not shrink from declaring to you all the counsel of God.&rdquo; Not only did Paul teach them, care for their interests, and care for the things that were profitable to them, but he declared also God&rsquo;s counsel, God&rsquo;s plan, and God&rsquo;s economy. No doubt, Paul taught the Ephesians a great deal concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Similarly all the elders must learn what God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is and point this out to the saints. By knowing God&rsquo;s eternal economy, most of the saints would then be solidly grounded and deeply rooted. Most Christians today only receive shallow teachings, instructing them to be good, humble, loving, and kind. This is the land of teaching that you can hear in today&rsquo;s Christianity. The things of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, God&rsquo;s eternal plan, and God&rsquo;s plan for the church are absolutely lacking among them. Hence, what is needed among us is the proper biblical, divine revelation concerning God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</p>
<p>The elders must learn all the things of God&rsquo;s economy and dive into them. By so doing they will pick up a real burden. They will be able to comfort the disappointed saints by telling them God&rsquo;s economy. To hear God&rsquo;s economy and receive such a high calling will become a strong comfort and encouragement to the disappointed ones. The problems that we are facing today in the recovery are mainly due to the lack of a deep understanding and realization of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</p>
<p>Human beings need a goal. In order to have a goal, we need a high vision. Those people who love their country have such a vision. This vision strengthens them, comforts them, and encourages them to pass through all kinds of opposition and attack. We in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are God&rsquo;s overcomers today, fighting for His kingdom and doing something for His interests. Yet many among us are short of a high view of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</p>
<p>Once we see the vision, we will become another person because we have such a high calling. This will change our concept concerning our human life and daily life. Because we are short of such a high view, we just care for our family life and daily life. There is not much consideration for God&rsquo;s eternal interests. To impart such a vision merely by general teaching in the meetings is not adequate. It is like a professor speaking to a large class of students. We need some tutors to tutor the saints in details.</p>
<p>If the burden and responsibility of the eldership grows to such an extent that it does not allow you enough time to do your secular job, that might be the time for you to give up your occupation, and trust the Lord for your living. I do believe that the Lord will supply you.</p><h2 class="head1">OVERSEEING AND SHEPHERDING</h2>
<p>In verse 28 Paul admonishes the elders to &ldquo;take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently it was Paul that appointed them as elders. Actually, it was the Holy Spirit that placed them as overseers. Here Paul used the term <em>overseers</em> instead of <em>elders.</em> These two synonyms are used interchangeably. The term <em>elder</em> refers to the person, but <em>overseer</em> speaks of their responsibility. An overseer should not be sloppy or sleepy but all the time watchful. He must be aware of the situation of the church and oversee each member of the flock. If so, he will know what the need is and what they should do.</p>
<p>Paul charged the elders not only to teach but to shepherd the church of God which God obtained through His own blood. <em>To obtain</em> in Greek also denotes to acquire, or purchase. His own blood is a dear term. God considers the church as a treasure which is very dear and precious in His eyes. He loves the church to such an extent that He purchased it with His own blood.</p>
<p>Similarly, the elders should also love the church as God does. Even the parents always save the best things for their dear children. God used His own blood. So we must love the church with this kind of fine feeling and affection.</p>
<p>Verse 29 says, &ldquo;I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.&rdquo; To spare the flock means that we love the flock with tender care by cherishing and nourishing. However, the wolves would not care for the church in this way. On the contrary, they would sacrifice the church for their own interests and satisfaction. They are wolves hunting for prey.</p>
<p>Verse 30 follows, &ldquo;And from among you yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.&rdquo; Not only will wolves come in from without, but men will rise up from within the church, speaking perverted things.</p>
<p>Throughout the centuries there have been these two classes of negative people. Paul likened one class to wolves and the other class to perverted persons who would rise up from within the church to speak perverted things with the purpose of drawing away disciples after themselves. These two classes of people were there at Paul&rsquo;s time and they are still here today.</p>
<p>Throughout our own history of the past sixty-seven years in mainland China, Taiwan, and the United States, there have been these two classes of people. Romans 16:17 tells us to keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling.</p>
<p>This word by Paul was not just an admonishing word but a prediction, telling us what would happen. Within a short time, this word transpired at Ephesus (2 Tim. 1:15).</p>
<h2 class="head1">ADMONISHING WITH TEARS NIGHT AND DAY</h2>
<p>Finally, verse 31 says, &ldquo;Wherefore watch, remembering that for three years, night and day, I did not cease admonishing each one with tears.&rdquo; Paul did not only go to their house, but he also admonished each one of them with tears day and night. The elders among us must pick up a burden to do this day and night. They should go to the homes of the saints and admonish each one with tears.</p>
<p>To admonish with tears is not so easy. At first the saints may not listen to you. Some may listen yet they would not take your word. Then your word would not be very effective. Quite often one drop of tears may work much better than a thousand words. This is especially true with the sisters. At times rebuking and advising may not do as much good as dropping your tears.</p>
<p>Paul was a very emotional person. Acts 20 mentions tears twice. In verse 19 Paul served the Lord with humility, tears, and trials. Again in verse 31 he spent three years, night and day, admonishing each one with tears. This kind of admonishing is the necessary responsibility of the elders.</p>
<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee to the church in Anaheim, California on October 1, 1989)</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">NEW TESTAMENT SERVICE AS PRIESTS,<br />
 SERVING ONES, AND SLAVES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1, 7, 11; 1 Cor. 12:28</h1>
<p>In this message we want to fellowship concerning the church service. In the New Testament the word <em>deacon</em> is an anglicized Greek word meaning a serving one. A deacon is just a serving one. The basic thought of this word in Greek is to serve. In the English language the word <em>service</em> has a very common usage and denotes something very general. For example, in Romans 12 there are three verses that mention the word <em>service</em> or <em>serve.</em> Verse 1 says that if you present your body as a living sacrifice to God, this is your most reasonable service.</p>
<p>Then, verse 7 says that if you are in the service, just occupy yourself in service. This Greek word for service is not the same word as in verse 1. Another word for service is found in verse 11 which says, &ldquo;Not slothful in zeal, burning in spirit, serving the Lord as a slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because all three words in English are the same, it is difficult for English readers to gain a proper understanding of these three kinds of service. The service in verse 1 is not a common, ordinary thing but a kind of priestly service, a kind of service in the worship of God, the service of a priest (Rom. 1:9; Matt. 4:10; 2 Tim. 1:3; Phil. 3:3; Luke 2:37).</p>
<p>For example, in Matthew 4:10 the Lord told the devil, &ldquo;You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.&rdquo; The word <em>serve</em> here is the duty of a priest, rendering service to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE KINDS OF SERVICES</h2>
<p>According to the teaching of the New Testament, there are three kinds of services from different persons. The first service is from a priest of God. To present our bodies a living sacrifice is surely the work, the service, of the priest. So Romans 12 firstly considers us all as New Testament priests. The Apostle Paul was writing and talking with a group of persons who were priests of God.</p>
<p>The second time the word <em>service</em> appears in Romans 12 is in verse 7. Here the word <em>service</em> in Greek is based upon the word <em>deacon.</em> This is the deacon&rsquo;s service. Whether you are a teacher, teaching people for God or a prophet speaking God, speaking forth God, and speaking God into people, you are a serving one. Furthermore, the word <em>ministry</em> in Greek is exactly the same as <em>service.</em></p>
<p>This word <em>serve</em> or <em>service</em> in the New Testament has often been translated as minister, ministering, or ministry. So first we are all priests and then serving ones, serving both God and man.</p>
<p>Finally, in verse 11 the word <em>service</em> is used in a verbal form and is based upon the word <em>slave.</em> So it says, &ldquo;Serving the Lord as a slave.&rdquo; We carry out the Lord&rsquo;s service as three kinds of persons, a priest, a deacon (that is, a serving one), and a slave. We should serve as a priest first. If we do mean business to serve as a priest, we have to serve as a deacon. If we really intend to serve as a deacon, we must consider ourselves as slaves. We have to realize that all of us are slaves, not merely the servants, or serving ones.</p>
<p>In the American government the elected officials are considered public servants, but I do not believe that any of them, even the President, would consider that they are slaves. Today we have three statuses. First, we are priests. Second, we are the serving ones, the deacons and deaconesses. Third, we are slaves. To be priests may be something quite honorable. But we must humble ourselves to be serving ones, even slaves.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEM OF AMBITION</h2>
<p>According to my experiences over the past fifty years in the church life, all the problems came out of one source&mdash; ambition. In the church life and church service ambition is a real gopher. Not only in the secular government are there power struggles, but even in the church the problem is ambition. This is a shame.</p>
<p>We would all like to be on the same level as Peter, Paul, or Apollos and not as Timothy whom we consider a learner and not a leader. Yet in the New Testament they are all apostles. (1 Tim. 1:1-3; Matt. 10:2; 1 Cor. 4:6, 9, 17). Acts 14:14 records that both Barnabas and Paul were apostles. Today none of us would consider Barnabas as anything. Everyone desires to be on the same level as the Apostle Paul.</p>
<p>So this matter of ambition has been the real source of all the problems over the years. From the time the Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to the United States and was established in 1962, there was never any talk about who the apostles were until 1982. This matter has been debated even more during the past three years.</p>
<p>This has also been a problem in the Far East. On the island of Taiwan within five years (1949-1954) we grew from a few hundred to fifty thousand. The people crowded in because we preached the gospel over the whole island and in a prevailing way. So many people were brought into the church life that we had to do something. By themselves the elders, deacons, and deaconesses were not adequate to handle the number. So we added group leaders. Those groups worked well to take care of the people, but ambition was there in the group leaders. As more group leaders were added, some were crouching, waiting to get the position of group leader.</p>
<p>One very good sister, who was seeking the Lord and serving diligently, did expect to be one of the group leaders. At that time, almost every six months we added new group leaders. When the names of the new group leaders were announced, and she did not hear her name, she was greatly disappointed. Her problem continued even for a few years and troubled the church. Later, from 1957 to 1965 in Taipei there was a kind of rebellion due to this matter of ambition.</p>
<p>Although Romans 12 shows us that we are honorable priests, eventually if we mean business to partake of the service in the church, we must humble ourselves to be slaves. To be a slave was a part of Paul&rsquo;s preaching. In 2 Corinthians chapter four, Paul says, &ldquo;For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus sake&rdquo; (v. 5). We preach firstly Christ as Lord, and then we preach ourselves as slaves.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we do love the Lord, but there is a real problem within all of us&mdash;our natural ambition. We must not say that because of His mercy and grace, we do not have this problem. We dare not say this. Even in the church meetings when some saints pray and receive more &ldquo;amens&rdquo; than you, you do not feel happy.</p>
<p>Although in mainland China I was in the center of the Lord&rsquo;s work, I was not the umbrella. The big umbrella was Brother Watchman Nee, so all the arrows came to him. He was the target. Then, the political situation in China changed and the country fell into the hands of the Communists. The work sent me out of mainland China in the spring of 1949. Only three to five hundred of us, a very small number, came to Taiwan. At that time, there were only a few churches on the whole island. Besides Taiwan there were a number of churches, in the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia. In those five places outside of mainland China forty years ago, there were about eighty to ninety churches. When I came out, I did not have the thought or idea to be the leader. The only thought I had was a burden for that primitive island of Taiwan.</p>
<p>I had come from the large modern city of Shanghai, which was the center of the British concession, to a primitive place. So, my burden was only to labor. In my pocket was not more than three hundred dollars with which to care for my family. Therefore, I had no thought about what I would be or what I should be. Eventually I became the target because I became the umbrella. The sufferings, problems, and troubles always came from one source&mdash;ambition.</p>
<p>When I came to chapters twenty and twenty-three of Matthew during the 1977 Winter Training on that book, I did speak a strong word to the sisters who are wives of the elders that they should consider themselves as wives of slaves. In Matthew 23:8 the Lord said, &ldquo;But you, do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.&rdquo; Either we do not serve at all or as one who serves, we think that the church surely owes us something. If so, this causes trouble.</p><h2 class="head1">SERVICE THAT ISSUES<br />
IN SACRIFICES OFFERED TO GOD</h2>
<p>Paul wrote Romans 12 in a marvelous way. First, he considered us as priests, then servants, and then slaves. If we could not be a slave, we could never be a good servant. And if we could not be a good servant, we could never be a proper priest. As a slave we know nothing concerning rank or position. We only know to labor. We labor not as a priest or a servant, but as a slave having no freedom and no rights.</p>
<p>It is easy for us to think that a deacon or deaconess just serves people like the sisters who prepare the Lord&rsquo;s table. To make the bread and prepare the wine is wonderful and necessary, but that is not something that we could offer to God as a sacrifice.</p>
<p>Our service must result in a sacrifice offered to God. To clean the hall, vacuum the carpet, and arrange the chairs are all needed. But these things are not qualified in themselves to be a sacrifice we offer to God. Our kind of chair arranging and vacuuming should be something that issues in some sacrifices for us to offer to God. If we come to arrange the chairs in a pure and humble spirit and others observe, they will sense Christ being ministered to them. Although there are different ways to arrange the chairs, this kind of chair arranging results in a sacrifice offered to God. If we are such a person who arranges the chairs, we would pray for the Lord to bless this chair and whoever sits there that this one may contact Him.</p>
<p>Not only so, the deacons&rsquo; service is spoken of as helps by Paul. In 1 Corinthians 12:28 Paul says that God placed some in the church, including the universal church and all the local churches. In the church God placed apostles, prophets, teachers, and so forth. Then Paul mentions helps and administrations. Helps refer to the deacons&rsquo; and deaconesses&rsquo; service. When we serve, we render help to others. Administrations refer to the elders&rsquo; management of the church. We must realize that Paul purposely mentioned helps before administrations because there is no thought of rank here. Such a thought of who is higher or lower, first or second, is devilish. This is a secular thought in the world. In the church, however, there is no rank, no first and no second.</p>
<p>This word <em>helps</em> implies a great deal. We may help the saints in a hundred ways. To go and make a meal for the saints when they are sick is a help. To do something for the saints to fill up their lack is also a help. For example, when we go to make a meal for a family, and our spirit is right, pure, high, and living, the entire family will sense that we are ministering Christ to them. They receive more than just a meal. This is a spiritual life supply because we ministered Christ through our cooking. This kind of help surely results in a sacrifice because through cooking, Christ was ministered to this family. Then we would surely begin to pray, &ldquo;Lord, gain the whole family. Gain each one and gain more ground in the children. Lord, make each one a young person loving You that their life would be for You during this entire age.&rdquo; We must realize that while we are praying this way, we are presenting the whole family as a sacrifice to God.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the priest&rsquo;s main function is to offer sacrifices from the flock or from the herd. But according to the New Testament, Christ must be the first sacrifice offered, then the members of Christ, the corporate Christ. We minister Christ to others so that they may become living members of the Body of Christ. Then we may present these members to God as sacrifices. Eventually in this way whatever we present to the Lord is a kind of New Testament sacrifice which is either Christ Himself or the members of His Body as a corporate Christ. As a result, all kinds of helps will issue in the building up of the members of the Body of Christ. This should be the fruit of our service.</p>
<p>A number of years ago a dear brother offered to repair my car. How much Christ was ministered to me by that repair work! He worked on that car, but I received Christ. He was there not only for Christ but with Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">SERVING IN CHRIST, NOT IN THE NATURAL LIFE</h2>
<p>Whatever we do in the church life as a service rendered to anyone must be done with a proper spirit. We must pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am serving You. I want to minister You to these dear ones.&rdquo; Apparently we are serving the saints. Actually, we are serving Christ to the saints. If so, we will not offer our own service, but the issue of our service, the parts of the corporate Christ, that is, the members of the Body of Christ. In the past we may have done a great deal of service in helping others, but the result was not so much the building of His Body because our service was by the natural life. We may have rendered much help, yet it was from the natural source of human affection and friendship.</p>
<p>When serving in the church we must try our best to avoid friendship. We only have brothers and sisters; we do not have friends. Building up a kind of friendship is typified by honey in the meal offering. Honey was prohibited in the meal offering because it is considered the same as leaven (Lev. 2:11). Our natural love in nature and result is the same as hatred. Hatred is typified by leaven while love from the natural life is typified by honey, which ferments into leaven. Apparently, it is sweet and good. Actually, this honey will ferment and become a kind of leaven. We help a brother just because he is a brother and we render help to a sister just because she is a sister. This kind of help is pure, not out of our natural affection which ferments. Even when we give material things to the needy ones, we may do it with a mixture or purely with Christ. May all of our services be so pure that they issue in the supply of Christ to others for the building up of the organic Body of Christ.</p>
<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee to the church in Anaheim, California on October 5, 1989)</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">SERVING UNTO THE MYSTERY<br />
OF THE FAITH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 16:1-2; 1 Tim. 3:9</h1>
<p>In our last fellowship concerning church service we saw clearly that our need is to serve firstly as a priest, then as a servant, and finally as a slave. All of our service must minister Christ to others and build up the organic Body of Christ. In this message we want to fellowship concerning serving unto the mystery of the faith. As the subject of this message indicates, our service must have a result. No one would serve without a goal, and our service does have a goal. Yet we, including the elders, may be so busy serving that we forget the goal.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXAMPLE OF PHOEBE</h2>
<p>In Romans 16:1 Paul mentioned the name of a particular sister, Phoebe, who was a deaconess of the church at Cenchrea. Because Cenchrea was not a large city, the church there must have been small. Yet in such a small church there was a sister, a deaconess, who served that church. The first two verses of Romans 16 show us that Paul highly recommended her, because he used the word <em>patroness.</em> This word has bothered almost all of the translators because it is difficult to find an English equivalent.</p>
<p>According to Roman custom, a patron in the Roman Empire was one who served others and took care of all of their needs. At that time even an attorney was called a patron. This word was also used to indicate either a female nurse or a male nurse. The Greek lexicon tells us that this title is a title of dignity.</p>
<p>A patroness denotes one who helps, sustains, and supplies. First, she helps in an all-inclusive way. When you are sick, she serves you and takes care of your meals. If you are weak and cannot walk, she walks with you. She also sustains and supplies you like today&rsquo;s nurses. It is not so easy to be a nurse because it is so bothersome. From head to toe, everything must be done for the patient.</p>
<p>In the United States the young girls do not like to study nursing because the job is too bothersome and time-consuming. Whether it is convenient or not, nurses serve day and night.</p>
<p>Today the immigration service is open to foreign nurses to come to this country because the United States is short of nurses. Few are willing to serve as nurses because it is so bothersome.</p>
<p>The most flourishing church is a church full of serving ones. Today, since we are taking care of the increase of the Body of Christ so much, we are promoting the gospel visitation and home meetings in order to gain the remaining fruit. But the most effective item in our church life is to serve people. By serving we will keep the people and preserve the people. Every human being loves to be served by others. To serve just means to love. We must love others.</p>
<p>Especially in the United States today, everybody is in need. So the best way to visit people to preach the gospel is to serve them. In Seoul, Korea, there is a large church with a membership in the thousands. One of the ways that they gain their increase is to charge the sisters who do not work to serve at the entrance of the elevators when a number of housewives are returning home from grocery shopping with bags of groceries and one or two children. These church sisters would immediately render some help to take care of their children and carry their grocery bags. By that little service, they touch the hearts of the ladies and are able to obtain their names and telephone numbers. They also use this time to preach the gospel to them. In this way the doors of their homes will be opened.</p>
<p>Another way to reach people for the gospel is to take care of our neighbors. Among the neighbors some may be sick and even crippled. We can take care of at least some of their needs. This is the best time to gain people. Even among the saints in the church, a number do need help. If we serve them with love, we will surely edify them. We can take the opportunity to speak a word to them from the Bible. By serving them, we can easily deposit something into them. If we only speak a word and do not serve them, it is rather difficult to impart and infuse them with something. We must touch people&rsquo;s heart by serving in many ways. Sister Phoebe in Cenchrea was such a person. Otherwise, Paul would not have recommended her so highly.</p><h2 class="head1">REACHING THE GOAL OF MINISTERING CHRIST<br />
FOR THE BUILDING OF HIS BODY</h2>
<p>All of our service must have a definite goal. First Timothy 3:9 says that all of the deacons must hold the mystery of the faith. First, the faith here is objective. It does not refer to our believing, but to the things we believe in, which constitute the full gospel of the New Testament. This is the objective faith which is the very object of our believing. Our faith is the unique Christian faith.</p>
<p>Hence, the mystery of the faith is just the contents of our Christian faith. As to the contents, the New Testament tells us that God does have a New Testament ministry. Within this New Testament ministry there is a mystery which is the entire economy of God. The first part of this mystery is Christ and the second part is the church. Christ is a mystery, the mystery of God, and the church is also a mystery, the mystery of Christ. If we want to understand God, we must understand Christ, and if we want to understand Christ, we must understand the church because God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is embodied in the church. As Christ is the embodiment of God, so is the church the embodiment of Christ. So, the mystery of the faith is just the mystery of Christ as the embodiment of God and the mystery of the church as the embodiment of Christ. All of the serving ones must understand this mystery and hold it.</p>
<p>Our service is not merely to take care of others but has a goal to lead people to reach the mystery of the faith. The goal is the mystery of the faith. This is to minister Christ to others for the building up of the Body which is the church. Our service must result in Christ with the church. While we serve, we must take the opportunity to minister Christ to others.</p>
<p>We ourselves must understand what is the mystery of Christ. Many dear saints know this mystery to some extent but not that much in depth. Even fewer can speak or teach something concerning the mystery of Christ. But all of the serving ones should be a kind of teacher to minister the things concerning this mystery. While we are serving in material things, we should minister the spiritual riches of Christ into the ones whom we serve.</p>
<p>For example, one saint we are taking care of may be sick with a back problem. This kind of sickness may keep him in bed for nine months. On the other hand, he is not altogether sick. Such a person mainly needs our care just because he is not able to move around. We can help by mowing the lawn and assisting him to do other things. His illness is not serious enough to prevent him from listening to our speaking of Christ. So this is a good opportunity. When we go to visit people, our time is very precious. As long as we have the time to serve such a one, we should use that time to minister all of the things concerning the mystery of Christ into him. We can minister all the things concerning the church as the Body of Christ in an organic way.</p>
<p>Although in this matter there is a big lack in all of the Christian churches, we must promote this kind of service in the Body. We must encourage every member to have a share in this service. It is not just a matter of coming to the meetings, but we must take part in the service rendered to all the needy ones, that they may be ministered to with Christ as their intrinsic supply. This will issue in only one goal which is to minister Christ for the building up of His Body. This concerns the mystery of our Christian faith.</p>
<p>So, we must go and serve people whether in their homes, in the hall, or at the very entrance of the meeting hall. Just by arriving fifteen minutes early and standing at the entrance of the meeting hall, we can find someone and speak Christ to them. This will afford us an opportunity to minister Christ and render service to others.</p>
<p>Although other Christian congregations may be quite good in taking care of others in love and serving others by caring for their children and their grocery bags in order to preach the gospel, this is only a small part of the mystery of the faith. To preach the gospel is a part of the mystery of the faith, but it is not the ultimate goal and does not accomplish much for the purpose of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>However, according to 1 Timothy 3 we must serve for the mystery of the faith. All of the serving ones should know the mystery of the faith in a very substantial, yet concise way. If we know all of the crucial points of the mystery of the faith, then we will have something to serve and minister to others. The mystery of the faith is just Christ for the building up of His Body. According to Ephesians 5:32, Christ and the church are the great mystery.</p>
<p>Among us over twenty years ago at Elden Hall in Los Angeles there were a number of strong serving ones who carried out many services. One of these services was a moving service group. Every Saturday the moving crew would move the furniture and household goods of those who had just arrived in Los Angeles. Today we do not have such a moving crew. Among us we pay too much attention to the care that we render on the spiritual side, and not enough attention to material needs with a view to minister Christ to people. The church in Anaheim has been here for a number of years and the saints have known each other for a long time. Most of them are used to inviting the brothers and sisters whom they have known for years for fellowship and dinner rather than the new ones.</p>
<p>It is better to spend time with the young ones and the new ones. We have a way to do this. Whenever the new ones come, we should go and speak to them either before the meeting or after the meeting. Forget about our old companions. Do not neglect the new ones, but take care of them.</p>
<p>This is a big lack among us. All of the sisters and brothers should not always be with their old acquaintances but should go to some new ones more. We do not need to invite our old companions that much. Rather, invite the new ones into our home and eat a simple lunch with them. This will really help. In this way we will care for the new ones and serve them with Christ as their life supply that as members of Christ they may grow for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
