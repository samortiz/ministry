   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE LOCALLY AND UNIVERSALLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the Body is one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Does this mean that the church in Cleveland is one Body, that the church in New York is another, and that the church in Anaheim is still another?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If this were so, then there would be many local bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the local churches are one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church is not only locally one, but also universally one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the local churches are one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have seen that as long as we are in a division or outside the oneness, we are not in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we must see that the Body is one both locally and universally.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the city of Cleveland there is just one Body, and in the entire universe there is still just one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we truly intend to practice the Body life, we need to see that locally we are the Body and that universally we also are the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>ALL LOCAL CHURCHES BEING THE SAME</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today there is an erroneous teaching that every local church is independent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I was young, I was greatly influenced by this concept, and I even taught it myself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I told others that every local church was independent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if we go back to the Bible, we shall not find such a thing in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ephesians 4:4 speaks of one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Does this one Body refer simply to the local church at Ephesus?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the best manuscripts, the Epistle to the Ephesians was not expressly addressed to the Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, it was a universal Epistle addressed to all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No matter how many local churches there are, there cannot be more than one Body on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How could Christ, the Head, have more than one Body?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A head with two bodies is a monstrosity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Universally, there is just one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since the Body is one, how can one shoulder say to the other that it is independent?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>None of the members of the Body can claim to be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It would be foolish to ask whether the ears are dependent or independent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nevertheless, today Christians are talking about this kind of thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As Paul told the Corinthians, Christ is not divided.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since Christ is not divided, the Body must be one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the New Testament the apostles considered all the local churches the same.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 1 Corinthians 4:17 Paul spoke of the way he taught "every where in every church."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is not a verse that indicates that the Apostle Paul taught differently in the various churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 1 Corinthians 7:17 he said, "And so ordain I in all churches," and in 11:16 he said, "We have no such custom, neither the churches of God."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Colossians 4:16 Paul said, "And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In these verses we see that the teaching of the apostles was the same in all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, Paul encouraged the churches to follow each other 1 Thes 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we all know, in Revelation 2 and 3 there are the seven epistles to the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although various differences are seen in these seven churches, these differences are all on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the positive side, the churches are all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the reason that the seven epistles were not sent to each church separately and respectively; rather, all seven were sent to each of the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moreover, at the end of each of the seven epistles there is the following word: "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches" Rev 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whatever was written to the church in Ephesus, for example, was a word that the Spirit was speaking to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a strong proof that all the local churches must be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Revelation 1:20 we see that the seven churches are seven golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If all seven lampstands were standing in front of you, you could not discern one from another.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All of the seven would lose their separate identity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, at the end of Revelation we have the New Jerusalem with the wall on the four sides Rev 21:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Each side of the wall is built with the same material jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, the four sides have the same appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we consider all these things, we shall be convinced that all the local churches must be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But this does not mean that we should be organized.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the contrary, we must oppose organization.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Nevertheless, all the churches, as part of the unique Body on earth, must be one in spirit, in life, and in testimony.</S>
