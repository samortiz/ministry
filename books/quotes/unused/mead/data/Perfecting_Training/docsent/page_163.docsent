   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING FOR LIVING NOT FOR DOING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for Your sovereign mercy that we can still meet in this hall tonight!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lord, how we thank You for the good government that took care of the disaster.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And we thank You for the effective work of all the fire stations.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We thank You even for the kind care for all the suffering ones by the society.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, we do pray for all the suffering ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, take care of their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Comfort them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even turn their heart to You that they may believe in You and trust in You.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, use this disaster to bless the entire city.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, help us to learn the lessons of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, thank You for tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thank You for such a time that we could be here in peace, enjoying the safety to seek after You and to get into Your leading.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, help us, and inspire every word into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Your precious name, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>POSITIVE ITEMS VERSUS NEGATIVE ITEMS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this message we need to consider once again those items in Romans 8:1-14.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to see how the items on the positive side are versus the items on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of course, the law of the Spirit of life is versus the law of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One is a negative law, and the other is a positive law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One is in darkness; the other is in light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One is full of death; the other is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One is of sin; the other is of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So these two are altogether contrary.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Next we have the Spirit versus sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have seen that sin is just Satan dwelling in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And, of course, the Spirit is a Person dwelling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The next items which are versus one another are life and death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit issues in life, and sin issues in death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually death will go to the lake of fire, and life will be embodied for eternity in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The next items are the mingled spirit, our spirit mingled with the Spirit of God, and our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our spirit is quite wonderful because the processed Triune God indwells our spirit and mingles with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our flesh, however, is very negative.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually the Bible tells us that our whole fallen being is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No flesh can be justified before God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That means all fallen men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The flesh firstly denotes a part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually it denotes our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our entire fallen being is called the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our spirit is our regenerated human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not our fallen, deadened spirit, but our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The things of the flesh and the things of the Spirit are also versus one another.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Recently I illustrated by showing that some things are of God: Christ, the church, the saints, our experiences of Christ, the Word, the Life-study messages, the meetings, and the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Of course these things are representative; they are illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Actually the things of the Spirit are many.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The mind set on the spirit is versus the mind set on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These are not two minds, but one mind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But it may be on the flesh, or it may be on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When it is on the flesh, it is the mind on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When it is on the spirit, it is the mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The matter of peace in verse 6 is versus the enmity in verse 7.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Peace here is peace with God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In like manner, enmity here refers to enmity with God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The indwelling Spirit in verse 11 is versus the body which is dead because of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The issue of the Spirit of God indwelling us is life, and the issue of sin being in our body is death.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>So the Spirit of God is versus the body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Spirit of Christ is versus the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 9 says that if we have the Spirit of Christ, we are of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verse 11 speaks of the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from among the dead dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means that He who raised Christ from among the dead will also give life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By reading verses 9 and 10 carefully, we can see that there is an implication that the Spirit of Christ is versus the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Spirit of the One is versus the practices of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you cooperate with the practices of the body, you are against the Spirit of the One.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But if you are one with the Spirit of the One, surely you will put the practices of the body to death.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The last pair of items which are versus one another are the debtors and the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Both of these items are persons.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you are the sons of God, you are heirs to inherit all the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you are debtors, you owe something to God and to man.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you live in the negative line, the result is that you will be a debtor.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If you live in the positive line, the result is that you will be a son of God, inheriting the riches of God.</S>
