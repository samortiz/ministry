   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>G. Antichrist Being the Little Horn in Daniel 8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Antichrist will not only be the fourth beast in Daniel 7 but also the little horn revealed in Daniel 8:8-12 and 21-25.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This little horn denotes Antiochus Epiphanes, the king of Syria, who invaded Jerusalem and plundered the temple between 171 and 165 B.C. Antiochus Epiphanes typifies the coming Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 8 says, The male goat became very great.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But once he became strong, the great horn was broken, and in its place four conspicuous ones came up toward the four winds of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The goat in this verse refers to Alexander the Great of the Grecian Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Alexander the Great had four generals.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After his death these generals occupied certain territories and were divided into four kingdoms.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These four kingdoms are the four conspicuous horns.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew very great toward the south, toward the east, and toward that which is beautiful v. 9 . South refers to Egypt, east refers to Syria, and that which is beautiful refers to the Holy Land.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, Antichrist as the little horn will arise probably either from Greece or Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, this little horn grew great, as high as the host of heaven; and it caused some of the host and some of the stars to fall to the earth, and it trampled them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Indeed, he grew in greatness to that of the Prince of the host vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 25 says that he will stand up against the Prince of princes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that the little horn will exalt himself against God and take away the daily sacrifice v. 11 , stopping the worship of God by the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even though the Jews have returned to the land of their fathers, they are presently in a very poor situation, being full of sins and transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, God will be disgusted with their offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because of their transgression, He will allow Antichrist to cause the sacrifice to cease.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Antichrist, the little horn, will also throw down the place of the sanctuary of the Prince of the host v. 11 . This indicates that he will destroy the rebuilt temple.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He will cast truth down to the ground v. 12 , abolishing and tearing down every truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He will take action and prosper vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>12, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His power will be mighty, but not by his own power v. 24 . Antichrist s power will be the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Revelation 13:2 says that the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since Antichrist will be the embodiment of Satan, he will destroy in an extraordinary manner Dan 8:24 the mighty men and the holy people.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, after three and a half years Antichrist will cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, bring in both abominations and idols, and destroy both the holy city and the temple.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>28, 30 and removed the daily sacrifice v. 31 . Furthermore, he set up in the temple the abomination that desolates v. 31 . In the last three and a half years, Antichrist will do the same.</S>
