   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRAYER AND FORBEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Just as verse 5 is the continuation of verse 4, so verse 6 is the continuation of verse 5.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we see the continuation here, we shall realize that forbearance requires prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 6 Paul says, In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There does not seem to be a relation between the words Let your forbearance be known and Let your requests be made known.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually, they are closely related.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we exercise forbearance, we shall realize how much we need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may be anxious and fearful about many things concerning our family or concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, we may realize that if we talk about our concerns, we may cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What then should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After charging us not to be anxious, Paul urges us to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we pray, the Lord will give us the understanding, consideration, and wisdom we need.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a sister prays before sharing a particular matter with her husband, she will know what to say to him and when is the proper time to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, if she is faithful to pray, she will also have a rich supply to minister to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then her forbearance with its rich supply will accomplish God s purpose in that situation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If all the saints in the Lord s recovery exercise forbearance in their married life and also in training their children, we shall have the best family life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then we shall be able to sing about the wonderful, glorious church life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We shall be able to testify not only of a wonderful church life, but also of a wonderful married life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>MARRIED LIFE, FAMILY LIFE, AND THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First we need to build up the proper married life and family life, and then we shall be able to build up the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a brother does not know how to build up a pleasant married life at home and an excellent family life with his children, it will be very difficult for him to share in building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he comes together with others for the church service, he may exercise politeness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, he may not be polite to his wife or children.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may be polite to the brothers and sisters in the church, but be very impolite to our husband or wife or to our children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our home life is where we are exposed the most.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not think that simply because a certain brother is nice, kind, and polite with the saints in the church he is necessarily that way at home.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you want to know him, you need to see how he lives with his wife and children.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Oh, how much we need forbearance in our married life and family life that we may build up the proper church life!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more we realize the need of forbearance, the more we shall see how difficult it is to be a proper human being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not easy to be a wife or husband, a parent, or a member of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Most Christians today know nothing of the genuine church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At most, many gather together for a worship service for an hour on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, in our society married life has been severely damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many even live together without being married because they do not want to accept the limitations of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is to utterly forsake the practice of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to be fully committed to our married life, family life, and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The ties that bind us together are permanent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the genuine family life and church life, no one is hired or fired.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Can we hire someone to be our child, or can we fire one of our children?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of course not.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Neither can members of the church be hired or fired.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Likewise, if a servant of the Lord can fire one of his co-workers, then they are not truly working together in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Lord s work there is no such thing as hiring or firing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, in the family life, in the church life, and in working together for the Lord s interests, we need forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Forbearance is necessary because we are bound together permanently.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once again I would remind you that forbearance is an all-inclusive virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This virtue includes understanding, wisdom, patience, consideration, and the ability to help and render the adequate supply.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we all exercise forbearance, we shall have a pleasant married life, an excellent family life, and a wonderful church life.</S>
