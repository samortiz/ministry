   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE UNVEILING AND COMMUNICATING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapter two indicates that this dispensing takes place by the unveiling and communicating Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2:9 and 10 Paul speaks of the unveiling Spirit: But even as it is written, Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, and which have not come up in man s heart, how much God has prepared for those who love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But God has revealed them to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How do we know that God has called us?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How do we know that God has put us into Christ and that God is making Christ our power and wisdom?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot know these things by our mental ability.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can know them through the unveiling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, God put His Spirit into us, and this Spirit is the unveiling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Spirit functions as the unveiling Spirit, the Spirit removes the veils, the covers, that keep us from seeing Christ as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we have a sincere heart to seek the experience of Christ, the Spirit will continually reveal Christ to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In our spirit the Spirit shows us the secrets of Christ as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In chapter two of 1 Corinthians, the Spirit is not only the unveiling Spirit but also the communicating Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is implied by Paul s word in verse 13: Which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, communicating spiritual things by spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The thought here is to speak spiritual things by spiritual words.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The emphasis is not on the person to whom the speaking is addressed, but rather on the means by which the spiritual things are spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul speaks the spiritual things, which are the deep things of God concerning Christ, by the spiritual things, which are the spiritual words taught by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This implies that the Spirit is the communicating Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The communicating of the Spirit involves transmitting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>While the indwelling Spirit is unveiling the riches of Christ, He transmits these riches into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus far, we have the extract of 1 Corinthians 1 and 2.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This extract includes God s calling us into the enjoyment of Christ, God s putting us into Christ, God s making Christ wisdom and power to us, and the Spirit s revealing and communicating to us the things concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In chapter three we see the matter of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 3:6 and 7 Paul says, I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow; so that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One who makes to grow, God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is by the divine dispensing that God causes us to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He gives life and the growth in life through His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually, through the growth in life we shall be transformed into precious materials for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Concerning this, in 3:9 Paul tells us that we are God s farm, God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then in verse 12 he goes on to speak of precious materials, of gold, silver, precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In these verses we have the essence of chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The unveiling and communicating Spirit within us is actually Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First Corinthians 15:45 tells us that the last Adam, Christ in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We who have been put into Christ by God have actually been joined to this wonderful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 6:17 Paul says, He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are joined to the Spirit, who is the resurrected Christ with the reality of His resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now that we have been joined to Him to be one spirit with Him, we are one in essence with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We not only enjoy Him and not only have God s dispensing of Him into us as our power and wisdom so that we may have righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; we have actually been joined to the very Christ who is the life-giving Spirit with all the riches of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What does it mean in a practical way to be one spirit with the Lord in our daily life?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all need much more experience of this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In recent years I have been endeavoring to practice to be one spirit with the Lord day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, I must confess that I still do not have that much experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Doctrinally, it may be rather easy to understand the meaning of being one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But it is another matter to experience this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all need more practical experience of being one spirit with the Lord.</S>
