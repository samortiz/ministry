In the next twelve lessons, we will see the building up of the church and our participation in her building up. We not only want to show you a heavenly vision of the church, we also want you to know how this vision can be accomplished. This lesson is concerning the first subject—the building up of the universal church, the Body of Christ, not the local churches. [The local churches are local—they are in the different localities and are plural in number. Today, on the whole earth, over the six continents, there are about eleven hundred churches in the Lord’s recovery. But the Body of Christ is unique in the whole universe. There is only one Body. All the local churches in all times and places are part of this unique Body of Christ.]
