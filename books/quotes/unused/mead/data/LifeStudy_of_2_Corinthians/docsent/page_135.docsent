   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIFTY PAUL S VINDICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY 1 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 10:1-6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we read the book of 2 Corinthians, we may think that by the end of chapter nine Paul has covered all the necessary points and that there is no need for him to write further.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, in the last four chapters of this Epistle Paul covers another crucial matter which is in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the matter of his apostolic authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He said a little about this in 1 Corinthians, but because the time was not right, he did not cover it adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When 1 Corinthians was written, the situation was not ready for Paul to come to the matter of his apostolic authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But by the time of 2 Corinthians 10, the storms have ceased, and everything is calm.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, with everyone quiet and at peace, there is a tranquil atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In such an atmosphere and condition, Paul comes to the question of his apostolic authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In chapters ten, eleven, twelve, and part of thirteen, Paul places this matter before the Corinthians and deals with it from different angles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because he is an excellent writer, Paul always deals with any matter thoroughly, not leaving ground for any argument.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we shall see, this principle is true of Paul s vindication of his apostolic authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Corinthian believers needed to be clear about this, and we also need to be clear about it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A CONTRAST</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 10:1 Paul says, But I myself, Paul, entreat you through the meekness and forbearance of Christ, who as to appearance am indeed lowly among you, but absent am of good courage toward you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Notice that this verse begins with the word but.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But here indicates a contrast.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In chapters eight and nine the apostle spoke pleasantly with the dear saints in Corinth, encouraging them to have fellowship in the ministry to the needy saints in Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Immediately after that, he desires to make himself more clear to them by vindicating, with a severe and unpleasant word, his apostleship, even his apostolic authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was due to the vague and clouded situation caused by the false, Judaistic apostles 11:11-15 , whose teaching and assertion of what they were had distracted the Corinthian believers from the fundamental teachings of the authentic apostles, especially from the proper realization of Paul s standing as an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to be impressed with the fact that this section of 2 Corinthians stands in sharp contrast to the preceding section.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul s word in chapters six through nine is pleasant, but at times his word in chapters ten through thirteen is severe and even unpleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we read the last four chapters of this book, we may wonder if Paul has lost his tender, intimate concern.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some may even criticize him for his severity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, it was because Paul was so spiritual that he could write these chapters in the way he did.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>PAUL S WAY OF ENTREATING</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 10:1 Paul tells us that he entreated the Corinthians through the meekness and forbearance of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But he does not tell us the purpose of his entreaty.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He tells us how he entreated, but he does not say why he entreated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you read through the rest of this chapter, trying to find the purpose of Paul s entreaty, you will not be able to find it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul simply does not state the purpose of his entreaty.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Did he, then, make a mistake in writing?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No, Paul s concern is with how he entreats the saints rather than for what purpose he entreats them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that Paul s way of entreating is more important than the purpose of his entreaty.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For this reason, Paul points out that he entreated the believers through the meekness and forbearance of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Suppose a brother who is giving a message cares only for his purpose in giving that message and not for the way he gives it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That would be a serious mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should learn of Paul to pay even more attention to the way we do something than for our purpose in doing that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually God cares more for the way we do things than for our purpose, our goal, in doing them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, many Christians today care hardly at all for the way of doing things; they care primarily for the purpose, the goal, the result.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is a saying that the end justifies the means.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those who heed this saying do not care about the way of doing things; they care only for their purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This concept is deplorable and needs to be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christians may think that as long as their intention is to do a work for the Lord, they need not care about the means used to accomplish it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, in preaching the gospel they may use worldly methods or entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, I want to emphasize that in the Bible God shows that He cares more for our way than He cares for our purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As a heavenly ambassador, Paul also cared more for the way of doing things than he cared for the purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the reason he describes the way he entreated the Corinthians, but does not mention the purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May we all learn of him in this matter.</S>
