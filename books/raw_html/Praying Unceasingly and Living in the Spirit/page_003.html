        <h2 class="head1">HAVING REALITY BY RECEIVING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Even though the disciples followed the Lord for three and a half years, they still had only a picture. One day the Lord said to them, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality;...but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you...Because I live, you also shall live. In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (John 14:16-17, 19-20). The Lord was going to accomplish something that would benefit the disciples. He was going to die, resurrect, and come in another form so that He would not be merely in the midst of the disciples; He would be able to enter into them. In that day the disciples would know that the Lord was in them and they were in the Lord, that the Lord lived and hence they lived, and that the Lord lived in them and they lived in the Lord. Then they would no longer have a picture; they would have reality.</p>
<p>On the night of His resurrection the Lord Jesus came into the midst of the disciples. This was a unique appearing. On the one hand, the disciples could see and even touch the Lord (20:20). On the other hand, His coming was the coming of the Spirit. The disciples were in a room with shut doors; nevertheless, the Lord was able to enter (v. 19). Previously, if the doors of the room had been shut, no one but the invisible Spirit could have entered, but the Lord was not limited by the doors, even though He could be seen and touched by the disciples. Science cannot explain this. The doors were shut, but the Lord could enter freely with a physical body for His disciples to see His hands and His side. This is wonderful.</p>
<p>After His resurrection the Lord came as the life-giving Spirit, breathed into the disciples, and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 22). This word is much greater than Genesis 1:1, which says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; The Jews regard this opening word of the Scriptures as the greatest word in the universe. However, to the believers, the greatest word is John 20:22: &ldquo;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This word is great because the Lord of creation entered into the man whom He had created. The creation of man is a great thing, but God&rsquo;s breathing Himself into man is even greater.</p>
<p>In creation God formed man from the dust of the ground (Gen. 2:7). Had God not breathed the breath of life into that lump of dust, the lump of dust would not have had much meaning. Therefore, the important thing in God&rsquo;s creation of man was His breathing into man&rsquo;s nostrils the breath of life in order to bring man to life. However, the creation of man is just a picture. The reality of this picture is with the Lord Jesus on the night of His resurrection when He entered into the disciples, the many lumps of dust. All the disciples were dust, but the Lord Jesus breathed into them and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This word is great because it concerns reality.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the ultimate manifestation of the Triune God. The Triune God has passed through incarnation, earthly living for thirty-three and a half years, death, resurrection, ascension, and descension to be ultimately manifested as the Spirit. This ultimate manifestation is for God to enter into man. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you&rdquo; (John 16:7). Now that the Spirit has come, the Lord can enter into man. The coming of the Spirit is God mingling with man&mdash;the picture becoming reality. Thus, the coming of the Spirit enables man to have everything required by the Ten Commandments: love, light, holiness, and righteousness. The reality portrayed in every item in the Old Testament is in this Spirit.</p>
<p>The Triune God has passed through many processes. He created, He was incarnated as the man Jesus Christ, and He went through thirty-three and a half years of human living. He ministered for three and a half years and then went to the cross in order to enter into death. He stayed in death for three days to taste death, subdue death, and overcome death. Then He came out of death in resurrection. Every experience was a process that the Triune God has gone through to become the Spirit. For example, a watermelon in the kitchen passes through the processes of being cut, juiced, and poured into cups as delicious watermelon juice. The watermelon juice is the processed watermelon. Without being processed, a watermelon cannot be available or easily received. The Triune God has passed through many processes to become the Spirit. Therefore, on the night of His resurrection the Lord came to breathe into His disciples, saying, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In this step God and man were joined as one.</p>

            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
