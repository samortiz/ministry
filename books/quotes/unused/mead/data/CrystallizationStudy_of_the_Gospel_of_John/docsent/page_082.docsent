   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Son of Man is typified by the heavenly ladder seen by Jacob in his dream.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 1:51 the Lord Jesus said, "You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Such a story is recorded in Genesis 28 in Jacob's dream.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jacob saw a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reached to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it v. 12 . The Lord Jesus said that as the Son of Man, He is this ladder.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is the only begotten Son of God who became the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In His humanity, He becomes a joining ladder, to join heaven and earth into one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Heaven refers to God, and earth refers to man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the ladder, Christ as the Son of Man joins God and man into one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In eternity past He was the Word, but in eternity future He will be the ladder.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The ladder is not flat.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is set up on the earth to reach the heavens as a stairway.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every ladder is a stairway for going up and coming down.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This traffic is the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ladder indicates traffic, fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The love of the Father, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit are the reality of this ladder for going up and coming down.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Triune God is not flat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Triune God is standing up to be a ladder.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without a ladder, there is no way to climb up higher.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ as the ladder is the way in John 14:6.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is "the ladder way."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How can we as earthly men be one with the heavenly Father?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is the way as the ladder.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is the stairway for us to be one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Jerusalem is the totality of God joined with man and man mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The number that represents the New Jerusalem is twelve, signifying that God in His eternal administration is mingled with His creature, man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Triune God is signified by the number three, and man is signified by the number four.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Three times four is twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the New Jerusalem, there are the twelve foundations, inscribed with the names of the twelve apostles Rev 21:14 ; the twelve gates which are twelve pearls, inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes v. 12 ; and the twelve fruits of the tree of life 22:2 . This shows that the New Jerusalem is the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This mingling is through the Son of Man who was and still is the only begotten Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is all in John's writings, which include Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, the Triune God becomes the living water, which the Lord Jesus presented to the Samaritan woman in John 4.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jacob's well in John 4 is physical, but Jacob's dream is divine and mystical.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this divine, mystical realm there is a real fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This fountain is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When this fountain emerges, or springs up, that is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the spring flows into a river, that is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is into, or for, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first four chapters of John present the Triune God as the flowing water.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In chapters six and seven there are two feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These two feasts are the issue of the flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We fallen men become hungry and thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At the feast we have something to eat to satisfy our hunger and something to drink to quench our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The food is Christ and the water is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to see that the Triune God is flowing through the Father, the Son, and the Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we drink of this water, it becomes a fountain in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all should say, "The fountain is in me!"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This fountain emerges as a spring, and the spring flows out as a river for the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the key to open up the entire Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the divine speaking, divine spreading, divine dispensing, of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Father as the fountain, the Son as the spring, and the Spirit as the river flow into us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When He flows into us, He flows with us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He will flow us into the New Jerusalem to be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The preposition into also means "to become."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Into the New Jerusalem means "to become the New Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we are not becoming the New Jerusalem, we can never be in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have to be the New Jerusalem; then we can be in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the intrinsic significance of the Gospel of John and Revelation.</S>
