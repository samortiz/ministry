   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FASTEST WAY TO HELL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A person who loved to joke once asked his Christian chauffeur, "What is the fastest way to hell?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The chauffeur said, "If you open the door and jump out, hell will be right there.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But you should remember that if you do not believe in God, you will not be there, because there is no one in hell who does not believe in God!"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everyone in hell believes in God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>James 2:19 says, "You believe that God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You do well; the demons also believe and shudder."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE BOOK OF THE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A near-illiterate person once read the "Holy Bible" as the "Heart Bible."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible becomes the Book of the Heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is probably what the ancient psalmist meant when he said in Psalm 119:111, "Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE HEART OF THE PREACHERS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One Monday morning, two preachers met each other on the road.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One said, "Last night I spoke on The coming of the Judgment Day.'"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The other said, "I wish you would say this with tears."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Indeed this is true.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Acts 20:19 says, "Serving the Lord as a slave with all humility and tears."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Issue No. 11 WHERE ONE CANNOT FIND CHRISTIANS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One young man could not stand the zeal of his parents toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He could not bear the spiritual atmosphere at home, and he thought that there were too many Christians in his own town.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was tired of their presence and tired of their heavenly talk, and he set about to escape to a lake by train.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the train, he saw two old people opposite his seat with their Bibles open, discussing spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was angry at seeing so many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the next station, he left the train to give vent to his anger.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There he saw a few old women talking to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When he approached them, he realized that they were also talking about the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There was a lake in that place, and many people went on the lake.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He took a steamboat to travel to the other side of the lake.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the boat, again he heard many people talking about heavenly things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were all Christians!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He found out later that they all belonged to a tour group from a Christian school.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This made him very agitated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Later he went on deck and asked the captain of the boat angrily, "Where can I go to avoid these accursed Christians?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The captain was not a good man either.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He answered sharply, "The only place is hell."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This word pierced the young man's heart deeply.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Soon after this, he became a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE FINAL PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The bishop of England was a faithful worker of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He labored day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On his deathbed he prayed, "Lord, forgive me for my sin of negligence!"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>IMMEDIATE EFFECT</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Keswick Convention in England is the top among all spiritual conferences in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It has been preaching sanctification, consecration, and victory for over half a century.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Dr. Meyer, who has been to China before, was conducting one of these convention meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the beginning of the meetings, he told the congregation, "If you have any overdue debts at home, you cannot expect to have God's blessings this time."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The next day, the money orders at the post office were all sold out.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE LOCK BEING ON THIS SIDE</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once a man met a preacher on the streets of London.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He said to the preacher, "When I was in Paris, I heard your preaching, and I can still remember it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At that time, I heard the message and repented and believed in God."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The preacher asked what he had heard.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The man said, "You said that the lock is on our side.'</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I had always thought that God was cruel and that I had to do good before I could please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When I heard your word, I had a fresh realization, and I knew that the Lord Jesus was waiting for me to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the Lord Jesus is not in my heart, the fault is with me."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>John 5:40 says, "Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life."</S>
