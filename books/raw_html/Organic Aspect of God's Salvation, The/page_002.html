<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE COMPLETE SALVATION OF GOD HAVING TWO ASPECTS—THE JUDICIAL ASPECT AND THE ORGANIC ASPECT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 1:17a; 3:21-26; 9:30-31; Luke 24:47; Heb. 1:3; Rom. 5:10a; 1 Cor. 1:2; Heb. 13:12; Rom. 1:17b; Acts 11:18; Rom. 5:10b, 17b, 18b, 21b</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The judicial aspect of God’s salvation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>According to the righteousness of God—Rom. 1:17a; 3:21-26; 9:30-31.</li>	<li>The procedure of God’s salvation.</li>	<li>God’s fulfilling of all the requirements of His righteous law for sinners according to His righteousness.</li>	<li>For sinners to be forgiven before God (Luke 24:47), washed (Heb. 1:3), justified (Rom. 3:24-25), reconciled to God (Rom. 5:10a), and sanctified unto God positionally (1 Cor. 1:2; Heb. 13:12), thereby entering into the grace of God for the accomplishment of the purpose of God’s salvation.</li>	</ol></li><li>The organic aspect of God’s salvation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Through the life of God—Rom. 1:17b; Acts 11:18; Rom. 5:10b, 17b, 18b, 21b.</li>	<li>The purpose of God’s salvation.</li>	<li>To accomplish all the purpose that God wants to achieve in the believers in His economy through His divine life.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You that You are the speaking God. We thank You from our depths that in Your recovery You have never stopped speaking to us; You have been speaking to us again and again. Lord, we believe that this time You will still speak to us a word concerning Your salvation from another angle. Your word is light and revelation; Your word is also spirit and life. May You be one spirit with us here to speak with us, to speak in our speaking, and even to make our speaking Your speaking. Lord, cause us to forget the past by taking away our old veils layer by layer that we may listen in quietness to Your fresh words, words which You have never spoken in our midst before. Lord, bestow Your grace upon us. We trust in Your precious blood, in Your mercy, in Your grace, and even more in Your presence. We ask You to anoint this meeting, anoint every person, anoint every action, and anoint all our words, whether testimonies, sharings, or prophesyings. Amen.<p>In this conference we want to see the complete salvation of God, especially its organic aspect. The central burden of the messages may be expressed by the following statements:<p>1)The complete salvation of God has two aspects—the judicial aspect and the organic aspect.<p>2)The judicial aspect is the procedure of God’s salvation through the redemption of Christ for God’s salvation to fully meet the righteous requirement of His law.<p>3)The organic aspect is the fulfillment of God’s salvation through the life of Christ for the believers to be transformed and to grow and mature in the life of God.<p>4)The salvation of God is with Christ as the center, the Body of Christ as the line, and the New Jerusalem as the goal, and is fully accomplished through the life-giving Spirit.<p>We have also used the main points of the messages to compose a new hymn (to the tune of Hymns, #837) [The following is a literal translation from Chinese.]:	<ol class="decimal">	<li>God, the saving carried out by Your life<br>	Fully meets the requirement of Your righteousness;<br>	Your salvation is perfect, faultless,<br>	Not only right judicially but also rich organically.<br><br></li>	<li>Redemption is accomplished judicially,<br>	Salvation is carried out organically;<br>	Judicially, Your righteousness is satisfied,<br>	Organically, Your heart’s desire is fulfilled.<br><br></li>	<li>Judicially, I have been justified by You,<br>	Organically, I am being made one with You:<br>	Regenerating me to be a God-man,<br>	Sanctifying me dispositionally, and renewing my whole being.<br><br></li>	<li>Transforming and conforming me to the Lord’s glorious image,<br>	Manifesting the metabolism in life;<br>	Maturing in life to become a full-grown man,<br>	Coordinating with others to be built up as one Body.<br><br></li>	<li>My body will be redeemed and enter into glory,<br>	I will attain sonship to its highest portion;<br>	Mingled with You to be a mutual dwelling,<br>	The holy city New Jerusalem becomes my song.</li>	</ol>
