   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Regions of the Work</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not Dividing the Churches</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The regions of the work should not divide the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There were regions in Paul's time, the Jewish and the Gentile, but they never divided the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Churches in the Gentile World</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Having Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>with Those in the Jewish World</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The churches in the Gentile world had fellowship with those in the Jewish world in solving the problems in teaching Acts 15:1-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some taught circumcision as a term for eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul, however, did not have the attitude of merely solving this problem in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, he, Barnabas, and some others went to Jerusalem to get the problem solved by all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That decision eventually became an epistle written by the apostles and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This epistle was not designated as being written by the Gentile and Jewish apostles and by the Gentile and Jewish elders.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Acts 15 says that it was written simply by the apostles and the elders v. 23 , including the apostles and elders of both the Jewish and Gentile churches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They were considered as one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The churches in the Gentile world also had fellowship with those in the Jewish world in supplying the physical need Rom 15:25-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The apostle Paul was endeavoring to raise up financial help, physical help, from the Gentile saints for the Jewish saints.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this fellowship they were considered as one, but I do not think our attitude today is like this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes we help other churches, but there is the consideration that we have to take care of the need of the local churches in our area first.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have some surplus, then we will consider giving something to other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But Paul's practice was not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul knew that the saints in Macedonia were in poverty, yet he still encouraged them to give.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Their giving was their fellowship of concern to help the churches in the Jewish world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul, Who Worked in the Gentile World,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Being Concerned for the Church in Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, Paul, who worked in the Gentile world, was concerned for the church in Jerusalem Rom 16:1-4; Acts 19:21; 20:16; 21:12-13, 17-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He had a heavy burden to help the church in Jerusalem to enter into God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although the Spirit inspired the saints to warn him not to go to Jerusalem, he said that he did not care for his life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He had purposed in his spirit to go there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No doubt, he went there with a burden to help the saints get out of the law in the Old Testament economy and enter into the New Testament economy of God to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This shows us again that the regions of the work should not divide the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I called a number of urgent elders' meetings beginning in 1984 because I realized that there was the tendency of division among us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we know the Body of Christ, however, we cannot be divided.</S>
