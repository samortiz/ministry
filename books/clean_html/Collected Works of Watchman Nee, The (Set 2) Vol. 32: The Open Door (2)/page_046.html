May He give you peace in the midst of danger, and may the Father manifest His care to His children. By the Father's special grace, the brothers in Ning-Hai are able to meet and preach the gospel as before. We must be thankful for this. Recently, we had a special conference for ten days (August 4 to 14). We saw many new believers coming from various places, praising the Father and the Savior with tears. How our hearts rejoiced at seeing this. Unfortunately, my spiritual life is not deep enough to render them deeper edification. By the Lord's grace, Brother Lou Chuan-en is now rendering some help to the brothers in Ning-Hai. The Lord willing, I will go to Shiang-Shan, Feng-Hwa, or Wu-Yi to do some work there. How we need the prayer of the lovers of the Lord. Enclosed please find X dollars from the offering box in the meeting in Ning-Hai. Please direct it according to the Spirit's leading to the brothers engaged in pioneering work in inland provinces. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Hwa Shi-bin, August 15</p>
