   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE GIFTS FOR THE BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 68:18 says, "You have ascended on high; You have led captive those taken captive;/You have taken gifts among men,/Even the rebellious ones,/That Jehovah God may dwell among them."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>J. N. Darby rendered the second half of this verse as, "Thou hast received gifts in Man, and even for the rebellious, for the dwelling there of Jah Elohim." In Ephesians 4:8 Paul quotes this verse by saying, "Therefore the Scripture says, Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.'" Those taken captive refers to the redeemed saints, who were taken captive by Satan before being saved by Christ's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan's captivity and took them to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In His ascension He made these rescued sinners gifts for the building up of His Body vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to understand Paul's thought in Ephesians 4:8, it will be helpful to know a little bit about the construction of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verses 1 through 6 deal with the keeping of the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The apostle first exhorted us to be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then he pointed out seven things that form the base of our oneness: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Based on these seven "ones" we have the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then in verse 7 Paul said that "to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have received grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Just look at our own body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Each member of our physical body has a certain measure.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The measure of the nose is of one size, and the measure of the arm is of another.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because the arm is considerably bigger than the nose, it receives more supply of blood than the nose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The apostle Paul was a big member like an arm.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, no doubt, a lot of grace was measured to him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are small members like little fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the grace measured to us is not as great as what was measured to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The measure of the gift of Christ is the size of a member of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Just as our blood supplies the members of our body according to their size, grace also is given to each member according to its size.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Body of Christ there are different members and different gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some are big members and some are small.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every member is a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The grace we receive is according to what we are as a member.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One who is an apostle like Paul receives more grace than one who is a little member in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we go to verse 8, which says, "Therefore the Scripture says, Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.'"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These "gifts" are not the abilities or capacities for various services, but the gifted persons mentioned in verse 11.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since verses 9 and 10 are parenthetical, verse 11 is a direct continuation of verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 11 says, "And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is clear that after His ascension Christ gave as gifts different gifted persons to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verses 12 through 16 tell us that these gifted persons are for the perfecting of the saints unto the building up of the Body, that is, the church.</S>
