During the past several weeks in the training you have received many different courses. Now I will offer you yet another course, which is different from all that you received before. Therefore, you must endeavor to enter into it. In this term of the training I hope to speak specifically on &#8220;The Revelation and Vision of God.&#8221; The messages, each of which is a spiritual weapon, can be used not only for this term of the training. After being compiled into a textbook, they can also be used in future trainings either in the form of videotapes or through the presentation of the co-workers. Moreover, they can be used not only in Taipei today but also abroad in the future.<h2 class=head1>THE MEANING OF REVELATION AND VISION</h2><p>You are familiar with these two words: revelation and vision. However, the recently saved ones who have come into the church life for only a short time may not fully understand what revelation and vision mean. Generally, in their concept, people consider these two words synonyms, thinking that a revelation is a vision and a vision is a revelation. Actually, they are two different things.<p>This is what revelation means: A scene that includes all kinds of persons, things, and matters is covered, concealed, by a veil so that the mysteries contained therein cannot be known; then one day the veil is opened and the scene behind it is shown. This is revelation. The Chinese expression ch&#8217;i shih means &#8220;to open&#8221; and &#8220;to show.&#8221; In Greek, the word for revelation means &#8220;the opening of the veil.&#8221;<p>In the Bible many spiritual, divine, heavenly persons, things, and matters were hidden in God, who created all things (Eph. 3:9), and became therefore hidden mysteries. Then one day God opened the veil to us so that we were able to see the mysteries behind it. This is revelation. In the Bible there is a book called Revelation, indicating that it opens the mysteries and shows them to us. Hence, revelation is God&#8217;s opening of the veil and disclosing of everything to us.<p>What is vision? Literally, the Chinese expression i-hsiang means an &#8220;uncommon, special scene.&#8221; Hence, vision denotes an extraordinary scene. For example, someone may have a house with exquisite decorations. Once you enter in and take a look, you immediately sense something uncommon. To you that is an uncommon scene; that is a vision. In the Bible vision refers to the scenery we see from God. Through His Word God has opened the veil, but we must see the scenes contained in the Word. Whatever we see through God&#8217;s revelation is a vision.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
