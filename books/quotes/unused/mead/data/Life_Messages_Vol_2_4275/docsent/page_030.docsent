   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BELIEVING BECAUSE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If, however, we preach the biblical gospel, as found in John, we are surely constrained to put our trust in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Lord, if You do not open people's eyes, if You as the life-giving Spirit do not work deep within their hearts, no one will follow; even I will not understand."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The result will be that many will understand and believe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The truth is that we do not believe because we understand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we hear the gospel, we have no choice but to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was foolish to believe, but we could not help it!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When unbelievers hear about the Word which was in the beginning, the Word that was with God and that was God, they will believe and find themselves praising God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They will praise Him for this One called the Word; they do not know who He is, but they believe He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>PREACHING JOHN'S GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Try preaching what you know others cannot understand!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Will you be foolish enough to do this?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Will you practice on your parents?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not preach about nuclear science!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Preach from the Gospel of John!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Tell your relatives, "So-and-so, I would like to tell you that the Lord Jesus is a vine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am one of the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You are not one yet, but I hope that after we talk together, you will be."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Believe me, you will find a response.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That one will say, "Oh, I'd like to be a branch like you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How does it happen?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then what will you say?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How will you proceed?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I hope you will not start telling him he is a sinner and needs to confess the things he has stolen, and then that he needs to pray for the Lord Jesus to come into his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of course, if the Holy Spirit so leads you, that is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But many times that is simply your routine way of handling people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You need to answer according to the instant leading you have for each time, not according to the method you have devised.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Holy Spirit may lead you to answer like this: "Look at John 1:16.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It says, For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.'</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So-and-so, you have to receive something of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the way for you to become a branch."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not think he will not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you follow the Spirit and the Spirit works with you, he will understand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Your preaching of the gospel must no longer be natural, superficial, shallow, and low.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>RECEIVING</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Have you yourself received of the fullness of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Surely you will answer yes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But how much have you received?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is universally wide.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>An ocean is too small a measure to use in describing His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His dimensions are those of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Who can measure their breadth, length, height, and depth?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Have you received only a drop, or a cup, or a pitcherful of His fullness?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Your receiving must continue daily, hourly, and minute by minute.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The fullness of Christ is so vast that your receiving can not be once for all; it must be grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>ABIDING</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Are you abiding in Christ right now?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>While you are in the meeting, it is easy to abide, but were you abiding this morning at the breakfast table?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When you return home after the meeting, are you still abiding?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I would like to help you abide by preaching the gospel of abiding to you!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord says, "Abide in Me and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then in John 15:7 He says, "If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Is the Lord abiding in you?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do you have His words abiding in you?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am preaching the gospel to you!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ, the infinite God, is the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You and I are His branches.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are branches of the infinite God!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can abide in Him, and He can abide in us, making us one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hallelujah for the gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are the branches of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even among us in the Lord's recovery, very few have entered into this gospel.</S>
