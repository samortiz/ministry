   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Believer Loving the Son,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Keeping His Commandments,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being Loved by the Father and the Son,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and Having the Son s Manifestation</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we love the Lord, we will keep His commandments 14:15, 21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 14:21 the Lord said, He who has My commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves Me; and he who loves Me shall be loved by My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we keep the Lord s commandments, we shall be loved by the Father and the Son, and the Son will manifest Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Tell me, according to your experience, when the Lord spoke the word no to you and you obeyed Him, what was the result?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You found yourself immediately in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if we do not care for that little word no, we shall lose His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever we listen to His speaking and keep His commandments, His presence is immediately intensified and becomes so sweet, precious, watering, strengthening, enlightening, and nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the manifestation of the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Does it sound illogical to say that the indwelling Christ will be manifested?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You may ask, Since He indwells me, He is already here.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why do you say that He will manifest Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because the indwelling Christ quite often disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although He indwells you, whether or not He appears or disappears from your inner sense depends on whether or not you listen to His words.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All of the brothers and sisters, whether they are young or old, have some experience of this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once when I was feeling a little lonely, I said to myself, I would like to go to see Brother John and talk to him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the indwelling Christ said no. Then I said, How about if I go to see Brother Francis? When the indwelling One again said no, I asked, What shall I do? The Lord said, Stay with Me. Who is this Me ? He is the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If at such a time I say, Amen, Lord, the presence of the indwelling Lord will shine and be so sweet and strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He will bring in a great deal of light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But, if when I heard Him say no, I did not care for His word and I still went to see the brothers, His presence would disappear, the darkness within me would be prevailing, I would lose my direction, and there would be no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all must learn one thing, that obeying the Lord s commandments depends upon our love toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you love the Lord, you will say amen when He says no. If you mean business in saying amen, you will have His manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord will manifest Himself to whoever loves Him and keeps His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This does not mean that before the Lord manifests Himself to us He is in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No, He is within us, but because of our disobedience His presence disappears, light becomes darkness, strength becomes weakness, and life becomes death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the whole Gospel of John there are only two requirements: the first is to believe in Him, and the second is to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To believe in Him is to receive Him, and to love Him is to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all have believed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that we all have received Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the problem today is whether or not we love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although you have received the Lord Jesus and He is now within you, you may not love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to be a lover of the Lord Jesus all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why the most significant aspect of the miniature of the church life in chapter twelve is the love that poured the ointment upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all must love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His presence is always related to our love toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more we love Him, the more we enjoy His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What is His presence?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is simply the enjoyment of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As long as we have His presence, we enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we love Him, the more we shall have His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more we are in His presence, the more we shall enjoy all that He is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need only to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Knowing means nothing; only loving counts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How we all need to love Him!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have been loving Him for fifty years, and today I feel that He is more lovable than ever.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No one is as lovely as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Song of Songs says that He is altogether lovely 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord s recovery is a recovery of loving the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we do not love Him, we are finished with His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>E. The Father and the Son as the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Coming to the Believer</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Father and the Son as the Spirit come to the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You may ask, Are They not here already?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yes, They are here but They are not appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Their coming is Their appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the Lord says that the Father and Son will come to the believer, this does not mean that They are far away from the lover of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They are here with the lover of Jesus, but They have not appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Their coming is Their appearing.</S>
