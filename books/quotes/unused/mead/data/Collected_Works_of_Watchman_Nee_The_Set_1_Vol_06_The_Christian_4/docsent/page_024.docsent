   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Confessing the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The robber not only rebuked the other robber and confessed that he himself was a sinner, but he also confessed that the Lord Jesus had no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Please read the last part of verse 41.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"But this Man meaning the Lord Jesus has done nothing amiss."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He seemed to be saying, "The three of us are being punished together.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Two of us are robbers, and this manner of execution is indeed just; but this Man, Jesus Christ, did not commit sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>None of the things He did was bad; everything was proper and most holy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But He is being punished together with us sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Robbers should be nailed to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But should this One who is not a robber also be nailed to the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are condemned because of our evil conduct, but should this One, whose conduct is the best, be condemned also?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We sinners deserve death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no argument about that.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But this Man, the most holy and most perfect One, why does He deserve death?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The guilty ones should die.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But what is the reason for this guiltless One to die?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sinners should perish.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is most justifiable.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But what does it mean for the sinless One to suffer the pain of perdition?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We robbers have nothing to say about our dying; but why does He, the Christ of God, have to go through the same fate as we?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This really is an amazing question!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Truly, no one in the world could answer it!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must see what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"For while we were yet weak, in due time Christ died for the ungodly" Rom 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us" v. 8 . "Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree" 1 Pet 2:24 . "For Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous" 1 Pet 3:18 . These verses in the Bible tell us why Christ died.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He died on behalf of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He died in substitution for your sins and my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Substitution!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Substitution!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Please take note of this word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no other word more important than this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without substitution, there would be no gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without the substitution, there would be no salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without the substitution, there would be no need for preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If Christ had not died in substitution for sinners, I would not believe in Christ, and I would also urge you not to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If He had not died on our behalf, we would still have to bear our own sins, and we would still have to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What use would it be for us to believe in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But thanks and praise be to God!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although His Son has no sin, God gladly gave Him up for us sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On our behalf Christ bore all the punishment of our sins and died upon the cross so that whenever we believe in Him, we will have eternal life and not perish.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is very meaningful to see this robber speaking about the Lord Jesus' guiltless punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He saw the Lord's death; he also acknowledged that the Lord is sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But why must a sinless person die?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He implicitly acknowledged that Christ's death was on his behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He believed in the salvation of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He believed in the Lord Jesus' substitutionary death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For this reason he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>My dear sinners, there is only one way to be saved: believe in the crucified Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you believe that He has died for you on the cross, you will immediately have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You have sinned; you should perish.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sin and the consequence of sin are two things that cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once you sin, there is a consequence of sin, a punishment: hell and perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you have not sinned, there is nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you are altogether righteous and holy, who can punish you?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you have sinned, the punishment of sin will surely fall upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do you want to perish?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you want to perish, then I have nothing to say; but if you do not want to perish, then salvation is here.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The sinless Lord Jesus Christ has died in your place upon the cross, bearing all the consequences that you should have received for your sin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Are you willing to believe in Him right now?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"He who believes has eternal life" John 6:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>D. Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The robber not only believed the substitutionary death of the Lord Jesus, but he also prayed out from his faith a most sincere prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He prayed, "Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom" Luke 23:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Let us look at another verse from the Bible, Romans 10:13.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>"For whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He called on the Lord; therefore, he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Let us look at the next verse, verse 14.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>"How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After seeing this, we know that faith comes before calling.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Without faith, there would be no prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Prayer issues from faith.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Prayer is the ultimate expression of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Faith is the cause; prayer is the effect.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We need to pay attention to one thing: although the robber rebuked his companion, he was not saved because of his rebuking.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Although this robber confessed that he was a sinner, he was not saved because of such a confession.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although this robber prayed and asked the Lord Jesus to save him, his salvation was not due to his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You must remember that repentance cannot save a sinner; confession cannot save a sinner; praying cannot save a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>A sinner is saved because of one thing only: believing in the Lord Jesus Christ's substitutionary death, that is, believing that the Lord Jesus has died for him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Before this robber prayed, he had the faith; he had accepted the Lord Jesus as his Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>His prayer was just a spontaneous calling that issued from his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>One who believes in the Lord's substitutionary death spontaneously cries out to the Lord for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>His salvation is not due to calling but due to his believing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Dear sinners, do not trust in your works.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Your works cannot save you.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Even good works such as repentance, confession, and prayer will not save you.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If you want to be saved, please accept with faith the Lord Jesus as your personal Savior, believing that He has borne all of your sins' punishment on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Once you believe, you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Once you believe, you have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Will you believe?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The robber thought that being saved is something in the future; therefore, he begged Jesus to remember him when He came into His kingdom Luke 23:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is the salvation of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He realized that he had nothing good to be proud of, nor any righteousness to brag about; he could not ask the Lord to save him according to his own merit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He said to the Lord, "Remember me."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He meant that he considered himself unworthy and unqualified, seemingly with not much hope for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If the Lord Jesus would remember him, there was no need of anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Just to remember him once would be good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He knew all those who were remembered by God would receive exceedingly great grace.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>So he begged in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Although what he asked for was not perfect, the Lord Jesus Christ did listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The Lord promised him something that he had not asked for, something beyond his expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Oh sinners, the Lord is very willing to treat you this way.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Do you want Him to treat you this way?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>There is not much time left!</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Eternal life or eternal death will soon be decided!</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Are you willing to take advantage of this crucial five minutes to believe in this Savior who has died for you?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>At this moment are you willing to call on His name with a believing heart and ask Him to save you?</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Alas!</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>How great are our sins!</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>How deep is our agony!</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>How long is the final judgment!</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>How terrible it will be!</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>How dangerous is our present position!</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>What confusion!</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If you do not call on Him now, when will you do so?</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If you do not come before God with tears and sorrow now and seek His salvation now, how long are you going to wait?</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>I hope that you will quickly turn and be awakened right now.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Please take a few minutes in silence now, bow your head, and pray to God.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Ask Him to save you for the sake of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
