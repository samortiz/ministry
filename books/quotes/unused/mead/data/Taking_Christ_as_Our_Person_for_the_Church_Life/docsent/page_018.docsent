   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE SHORTEST ROUTE TO GROW IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The shortest route to the growth in life is simply to take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning the experience of the growth in life, we have spent decades trying to find a short route but with only limited success.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now, however, we know that the shortest route is to take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we had known of this way twenty years ago, we would have been able to help countless brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In those days many sisters came to me to ask how they should deal with their difficult husbands, and I would spend much time and effort to instruct and help them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes I would advise them, saying, Sister, you should realize that God has arranged your circumstances very well.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You need your husband very much.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is the best husband for you, and even his temperament is the most suitable for you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You should be patient and accept the environment that the Lord arranged for you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At other times I would say, This situation is a sweet cross that the Lord has given you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Your dear husband may seem like a difficult cross to bear, but if you receive this situation from the Lord, you will receive life from it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I learned this response from Madame Guyon, and sometimes it was effective, but often it was not.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today if a sister comes to me about her husband, I say, Sister, simply take your husband as your person!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even if he is odd, just take his person as your person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is no need to try to be patient or to take up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Simply take him as your person by taking the Lord as your person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have followed the Lord in different ways for many years, and there has always been some benefit from my practices.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, today I simply take Christ as my person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I never bother to ask the Lord, May I go to this place?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I only ask, Lord, are You going to this place?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a sister goes to the department store to buy a dress, she should not ask, Lord, may I buy this dress?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When she picks up a dress, she should ask, Lord, do You like this dress?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The purchase of a dress should not be related merely to the Lord s permission but to the Lord s preference.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I really do not want to speak too much concerning matters between husbands and wives, but sometimes it is unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Consider the matter of clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A sister who desires to be a good wife will ask her husband about a dress and say, If you do not like it, I will not wear it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sometimes, however, a husband and wife will argue over what she should wear, because the wife likes a particular dress, but the husband does not.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After arguing for a while, the wife may agree to not wear it, but in her heart she still wants to wear it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This situation exposes our real situation with the Lord, because the Bible often compares the relationship between a husband and wife to our relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although the sisters acknowledge that their husband is the head, sometimes an inner bitterness remains.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Similarly, we also do not have a sweet taste when we submit to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>May the Lord have mercy on us so that we can take the shortest way by taking Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not a matter of receiving the Lord s permission but a matter of knowing His preferences as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are crucified with Christ, and it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, to us, to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we really take Christ as our person, we will mature very quickly, and it will hasten the Lord s return.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In addition, our meetings will be full of the riches because our living is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since taking Christ as our person is the reality by which we live and for which we work, we will also worship God according to this reality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I absolutely believe that the Lord will work in us to this extent.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are not willing to take this short route, the Lord may look for someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nevertheless, I believe that the Lord s grace is still with us and that He will take us on in a direct and quick way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In these days we do not need old religion, old doctrines, old ways, or old ordinances; we only need Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As long as we learn to live in the spirit, taking Christ as our person, we will reach the stage of living Christ.</S>
