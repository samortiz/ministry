We have to learn to take care of their education. Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. This is the reason God could reveal to him "the pattern on the mountain" (Acts 7:20-22; Exo. 25:8-9). However, had he not been taught by his mother from his youth, he would not have known that he was one of God's people, a people of promise (Exo. 2:1-10). We have assigned six deacons to specifically take care of this matter, and we have asked two sisters to head up this work.</p><p>If possible, try not to study in a Catholic school. The Lord's commandment is to come out of her and to be separated from her. We should not think that we can be broad in this matter. Even if it means delaying a school term, we have to help such ones to change schools.</p><p>No brother or sister should study in a school alone. There should at least be two. It is better to have more than five or six. Putting a person in a school is like putting his head in the mouth of a lion; it is hard to tell a lion not to close its mouth. We should not presume that every brother and sister is a Daniel. If we do not want to fall into a well, it is best to stay away and not loiter around it.</p><p>The deacons must also care for the young people and perfect them in every way. They have to be like Miss Groves, checking with them about their gospel work on the campus and their persistence in the study of the Bible. We have to train them to do things properly and nurture them in their consecration. In this way they will gospelize their school. What does it matter if they delay their graduation for half a year for the sake of the gospel? We are going to school for the sake of preaching the gospel. What difference does it make if they graduate half a year sooner or later? We have to put this goal before them.</p><p>The young ones have to go to school faithfully. If they do not study well, their parents will be critical. They should do everything for the gospel's sake. This is true not only with their schools but with their friends as well. They should make friends for the sake of the gospel, putting down the names of their friends and classmates in a prayer list and praying for them every day. They have to work on a few at a time. For example, they may concentrate on two persons for two months, praying for them every day. Whenever the opportunity arises, they should bring them to a gospel meeting. If they are faithful, I believe they will gain school after school in a short time. They have to spend time to pray and to seek the Lord, not being loose in any of these matters.</p><p>The brothers who serve as the elders have to supervise the deacons. The church is full of activities, but we must not neglect the care and perfection of men just because of busy activities. We have to pray and consider everything carefully before the Lord. I hope that from now on the church in Hong Kong will preach the gospel in one accord.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS<br />WHO ARE IN BUSINESS</h2><p>Many brothers and sisters have handed over everything. In the future when they have needs, we have to remember them. The items that they have handed over are very useful to the migration. It costs a great deal of money to move a group of people to Yi-Yang. Some items are worth little here because there is no demand for them. But in Yi-Yang they cost a great deal of money. We should not "kill the chicken to get the egg." The brothers and sisters should still manage their business properly, but they have to be touched to such an extent that "the money disappears while the person remains." This means that the person is captured by the Lord while the money is released. Statistics all over the world prove that the amount of money spent on the gospel determines the number of souls saved. I hope that the brothers and sisters will manage their business well so that they can offer up the money they earn to gain more people.</p><p>Presently, we have eleven brothers who are quite successful in their business. I hope that they will continue to manage their business. What they earn above their needs should be offered up as much as possible. In the future when we have more migrations, the money will be useful to help the migrating ones. Some from Tsingtao are ready to migrate, but there is not enough money to support their move. I sincerely hope that their lack can be made up from here. We have to make proper arrangements for all the brothers who are in business and who have handed themselves over. Our occupation is for the gospel.</p><p>The goal of a business is to make money. Once we have money we can send it out for the gospel. The brothers who have incomes and who are holding jobs should no longer seek to earn money for themselves; they should be for the gospel, and they should seek to open up more opportunities for spreading the gospel. In the same way, the students should go to school for the gospel's sake. The purpose of our job is to sustain our living; but it is also to propagate the gospel. Whatever kind of business we do, we need to pray much and look to the Lord to make provisions beyond our plans. The motive of our taking up an occupation should be for the gospel.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_093.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_095.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 61: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (1) &nbsp; pg 94</div><br></body></html>
