The title Savior speaks of His redemption of sinners, and the title Friend speaks of His communication with sinners
If it were us, we would have thought that since our mission was to die, all we would have to do is go through our ordained death
If you have never experienced a certain suffering, you cannot share the feelings of those who experience such suffering
Oh, the reason He was willing to submit to all kinds of limitation and suffer every affliction was that He wanted to sympathize with us
He endured all these sufferings in order to experience the bitter taste of human life and sympathize with man's weaknesses
Not only does He have the grace to save you, but He has a heart that sympathizes with you and feels your feelings
They have tasted the bitterness of their illness, but they still cannot sympathize with the sick patients in the world
The Lord was able to sympathize with everyone while He was on the earth because He not only had the experience, but He also had the love
Once when the Lord came down from a mountain, a leper worshipped Him and said, 'If You are willing, You can cleanse me'
Every time He sympathized with others, His heart was like a piece of clean paper on which any letter or drawing could be inscribed
Hebrews 4:16 says, 'Come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help'
Many times we feel that others do not consider our problems to be important and that no one can sympathize with us, comfort us, or help us
At times, friends on earth may lighten our burden, but this Friend in heaven is always ready to bear our burden
