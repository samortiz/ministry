        <h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE OF THE BRANCHES OF THE VINE<br />
BEARING FRUIT</h2>
<p>We are the branches, and the Lord is the vine; hence, we should bear fruit (John 15:5). A branch that does not bear fruit should be cut off. Verse 2 says, &ldquo;Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit.&rdquo; The phrase <em>takes it away</em> does not refer to perishing in the lake of fire but to losing one&rsquo;s fellowship with the Lord and with the saints. If the branches of the vine remain on the vine, the sap of the vine will flow into the branches, and the branches will have fellowship with the vine and with the other branches. However, once a branch is cut off, the fellowship is interrupted. If we do not preach the gospel properly and do not bring anyone to salvation in eight or ten years, we are like a branch that does not bear fruit, and we will lose our fellowship with the Lord. On the contrary, if we preach the gospel zealously and bring people to salvation every year, we will spontaneously have much fellowship with the Lord and with the saints.</p>
<p>There are a few things we must practice in order to preach the gospel and bear fruit. First, we need to pray, confessing our sins and asking the Lord to forgive our barrenness. Second, we need to make a list of our relatives, classmates, colleagues, neighbors, and acquaintances, and we should fellowship with the saints for the Lord&rsquo;s leading to either visit the ones on our list, write to them, or invite them for a meal so that they can hear the testimonies of the saints. If we would do this, our number would double quickly. The success of a task depends on how much effort we put into it. If there is no effort, there will be no results. If we do not preach the gospel, God will have no way to do anything. If we preach the gospel, He will work. Third, we need to consecrate ourselves to the Lord again for this matter. After we make a list of names, we will have the burden to contact the ones on our list. If we cannot contact them every day, we can at least contact them once a month. This is the most effective way to preach the gospel. Then it will be easy to invite our relatives and friends to come to a gospel meeting of the church. Fourth, we need to rely on the church. Without the church, we cannot preach the gospel. Therefore, we must have the church life; we must love one another and coordinate in service with the saints. This is our testimony.</p>
<p>Acts 2:44-47 says, &ldquo;All those who believed were together and had all things common; and they sold their properties and possessions and divided them to all, as anyone had need. And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart, praising God and having grace with all the people. And the Lord added together day by day those who were being saved.&rdquo; This indicates that in the early church life the saints lived and coordinated together and loved one another. This is the genuine ground of oneness that allowed the Lord to add new believers. The church life is not attending Sunday service and listening to a message every week and then living a separate life at home. Our church life should be the same as the situation in Acts. Although we cannot repeat what happened in Acts, we should love one another and coordinate with one another. You care for me, and I care for you. You support me, and I support you. The gospel that is most worthy of being spread in today&rsquo;s society is to care for one another and love one another in the Lord. When our relatives and friends see how we care for the saints and how the saints care for us, their hearts will be easily touched.</p>
<p>John 15:12 says, &ldquo;This is My commandment, that you love one another even as I have loved you&rdquo;; 13:35 says, &ldquo;By this shall all men know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another&rdquo;; and 17:21 and 23 say, &ldquo;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me...That they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me.&rdquo; In the genuine church life the saints bear one another&rsquo;s burdens, help with one another&rsquo;s problems, and consider one another, thus manifesting a certain kind of testimony. This is a very moving gospel. Our preaching of the gospel is not merely to give a message and then ask people to become members. No, we have the word of the gospel, and we also have a living that testifies to the ground of oneness. If we lack such a church life, it will be hard for our preaching of the gospel to be effective.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL BY THE CHURCH<br />
BEGINNING WITH THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>In order to preach the gospel, the church must have the one accord and strive together with one mind. The one accord and the striving together with one mind are our church life. I believe that if we can each live the church life, the gospel will spread very quickly. We must continue to preach the gospel. There should not be only old faces in the church; there must be new faces added all the time. We are fishers of men (Matt. 4:19; Mark 1:17), so we need to go fishing. We are also laboring farmers (2 Tim. 2:6), so we need to till the land, sow seeds, and gather the produce. The church will be poor if we do not go fishing or labor on the land. In order for the church to be rich in saints, spiritual gifts, and even material riches, we must preach the gospel. The church will be rich if we bring all kinds of people to salvation by preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>There must be children in a household. Without children, without offspring, a household is doomed no matter how rich or poor it may be. A person with many children may be poor now, but if one child later becomes successful, the household will flourish. Our children are our future and our hope. The more children there are, the more hope there is. If we have only the current brothers and sisters without new ones, we will eventually be like a lonely old man. In order to grow, new ones must be brought in. A growing society must have new blood. A society has no future if there are only old people. Likewise, we must preach the gospel and bring new ones into the church life. As long as new ones are coming in, the church will not become old. If we have both new ones and old ones, the church will be prosperous and full of hope.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
