<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S GOAL BEING TO ENTER INTO MAN<br />
AND MINGLE HIMSELF WITH MAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 33:14-16; John 5:19; 14:10</h1>
<p>Some saints wonder why we experience God more through failure than through victory and why God&rsquo;s leading often involves experiences of failure. According to our concept, God&rsquo;s graciousness should lead us into victory. Consequently, when God allows us to fail, we assume that He is displeased with us. Our experience, however, reveals that this concept is not accurate. On the contrary, God allows us to fail because He wants to give us grace. In order to understand this matter clearly, we need to speak of God&rsquo;s goal.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S GOAL BEING TO ENTER INTO MAN<br />
AND MINGLE HIMSELF WITH MAN</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s goal for man is not related to avoiding failure or to achieving victory. God&rsquo;s unique goal for His chosen ones is to enter into them and to mingle Himself with them. In eternity past and in His creation of man, God&rsquo;s considerations were related to His intention to enter into man and to mingle Himself with man. This is a plain and simple statement, but it conveys the desire within God&rsquo;s heart. God&rsquo;s consideration of man&rsquo;s significance is related to His desire and ability to mingle Himself with man. Man&rsquo;s usefulness and function in relation to God are connected to his capacity to be mingled with God.</p>
<p>Man is mentioned first in the Bible in the context of God&rsquo;s intention related to His creation of man. At the time of man&rsquo;s creation, the Triune God held a council and decided to create man, saying, &ldquo;Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness&rdquo; (Gen. 1:26). God created man in His image and according to His likeness in order to give man the capacity to be mingled with Him.</p>
<p>A Christian has a dual nature, including both divinity and humanity. A Christian has more than just the human nature; the Christian life is a hybrid life. Those who grow fruit trees know that the significance of grafting is the mingling of two lives to produce a hybrid nature. Christians have a hybrid nature, a dual nature, that is the product of the mingling of divinity with humanity. When we were unbelievers, God was God and man was man; we lived independently of the divine nature. However, in God&rsquo;s chosen ones, God and man and man and God have been mingled as one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD DESIRING TO ENTER INTO MAN<br />
TO BE GOD IN MAN,<br />
AND ALSO DESIRING THAT MAN ENTER<br />
INTO HIM TO BE MAN IN GOD</h2>
<p>God did not want to be alone in the universe. Consequently, He created man to be a counterpart for Himself (cf. 2:18). God does not want to be God merely in Himself; He wants to enter into man to be God in man. He is God, but He desires to be mingled with man. In the same principle, God created man because He wants man to be mingled with Him. Although He wants man to be man, He wants man to be man in Him. Just as He does not want to be alone in the universe, He does not want man to be man merely in himself. He wants man to be man in God.</p>
<p>Although the thought of man being man in God may seem difficult to understand, it can be simply illustrated with sugar and water. In order to fully enjoy the taste of sugar, we often mix it with water. If we try to eat sugar by itself, it is dry and sticks to our mouth. However, when we mix sugar with water, it dissolves, and we can easily receive and enjoy it by drinking the sugar water. We are like a dry cube of sugar, but when we are put into God, the full flavor of man, who is in God&rsquo;s image and likeness, is manifested. Similarly, God is like the water. A glass of water can quench our thirst, but without sugar, its flavor is not fully realized. When God is put into man, the full flavor of God is expressed. God does not like to be alone; He wants to be mingled with man. Furthermore, God does not want man to be alone; He wants man to be mingled with Him.</p>
<p>Our concept of what God wants is limited primarily to matters related to good and ethical behavior; it does not occur to us that God wants us to be mingled with Him. Nevertheless, God&rsquo;s thoughts are higher than our thoughts (Isa. 55:9). God&rsquo;s goal for us is not confined to good and ethical behavior. He wants us to receive all that He is, and He further wants us to be mingled with Him. A moral person at the most is like a white sugar cube, clean and square. However, a moral person who is not in God will not be able to express the full flavor of God.</p>
<p>Every kind of food tastes better when it is seasoned. A person who is not in God is like unseasoned food. We may claim that we have been &ldquo;seasoned,&rdquo; but our &ldquo;seasonings&rdquo; only include things related to wickedness, lust, and the world. None of these &ldquo;seasonings&rdquo; produce a sweet odor in our being. In God&rsquo;s salvation, however, the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood washes us of the things related to wickedness, lusts, and a love for the world and &ldquo;seasons&rdquo; us with the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit, who is God Himself, is mingled with our spirit, we have a fresh and new &ldquo;scent&rdquo; in us. This is what God wants to do in us.</p>
<p>God has a desire to come into man to be God in man as well as a desire for man to enter into God to be man in God. I hope that we will see this matter and also learn to speak such a word. This is God&rsquo;s goal in the universe. It is not good for God to be alone. He desires to enter into man to be God in man; this occurred when the Lord Jesus was born in Bethlehem (Matt. 2:1). The thirty-three and a half years of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; life as a Nazarene is a record of God entering into man to manifest Himself as God in man. God not only came from heaven to the earth, but He also entered into man to be God in man. All the life and living of the Lord Jesus on earth are a record of God being God in man.</p>
<p>Through the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection, the believers have been saved and regenerated and have been brought into God so that man could be man in God. God is in every Christian, but every Christian is also in God. The proper living of a Christian manifests the mingling of two natures, that is, the mingling of divinity in humanity and humanity in divinity. When we see a believer with a proper living according to the mingling of God and man, we sense both a human flavor and a divine flavor. Although we sense that he is fully human, we also sense that he bears the flavor of God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>God's Need and God's Goal &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
