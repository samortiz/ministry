   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN CHRIST AS LIFE IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that by including us in Christ, God accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This identification with Christ is purely the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The present question is: How can Christ be worked into us?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In other words, how can He be related to us personally and subjectively?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Having Christ worked into us and having a vital life relationship between Him and us is the essence of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Gospel of John, Christ repeated over and over again the phrase, "You in Me, and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Being mutually within one another is the reality and essence of union.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only in this union can God accomplish what He has purposed for us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE FULLER UNION</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God has already included us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we have to see how Christ can be wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only when Christ is in us can our union be real and complete, and only then will everything He has be worked into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This relationship with Christ is union in its ultimate and fullest sense.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day I was watching a blacksmith at work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As he threw a big piece of iron into the fire, he kindled the flame and began to hammer on the red hot metal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>An apprentice standing next to him was trying to get some fire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He rolled up a piece of paper, and instead of thrusting it into the fire, he touched the red hot iron with the end of the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In an instant, it caught on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was exceedingly surprised at seeing the fire coming out from the iron.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This piece of iron was now different from all other iron.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You could say that it was iron, yet you could also consider it as a ball of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fire was within the iron and the iron within the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It had the nature of iron and the appearance of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you put a piece of paper on it, the paper burned up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God intends that our union with Christ be as intimate as that of the iron and fire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has forgiven our sins and terminated our old man in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But He did not stop there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He wants us to be completely one with Christ in the way that the iron was one with the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every molecule of iron was mingled with the fire, and every trait of the fire was manifested in the iron.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the degree that God wants to work Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We still have to look at God's side of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For the moment, we will not say what we have to do on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We want to see how God has wrought us and Christ into one piece.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What we saw hitherto was God's work of putting us in Christ and His work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order for Christ to be wrought into us in a union that resembles that between the iron and fire, God had to take one very important step in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This step is what we are about to explain in this chapter.</S>
