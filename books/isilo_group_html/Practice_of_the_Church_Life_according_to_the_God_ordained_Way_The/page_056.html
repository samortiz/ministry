When asked whether the Lord paid the temple tax, Peter said yes. After pointing out to Peter that, as the Son of God, He did not need to pay the temple tax, the Lord charged Peter to go to the sea and cast a hook and take the first fish that came up. When he opened the fish's mouth, Peter would find a stater, equal to one shekel. He was to take that stater and give it to the temple tax gatherer, half for Peter and half for the Lord. Eventually, Peter did as the Lord told him. If we do not go to the seashore and throw out our hook, we will not catch any fish. I have been watching over the situation in the churches, and I have observed that many of the saints do not go out to the "water" to catch "fish." In the prayer meeting there is much prayer for the gospel preaching and the fruit-bearing, but the saints do not go out. If we mean business to practice the God-ordained way by taking definite steps, at least one-third of the church should go out weekly to contact people for the gospel.</P><P>On the Lord's Day the church in Taipei has over one hundred district meetings, with more than five thousand attendants. They heard my messages for years, but they did not take action. Until about two or three years ago they did not take the definite step to go out for the practice of the New Testament gospel priesthood. One brother was touched by the Lord, and he considered that the situation in Taipei was not right. He became burdened for this matter, and he told the church in Taipei that one-third of the present Lord's Day morning attendants should practice the priesthood of the gospel of the New Testament. As a result of his speaking, one-third, or more than seventeen hundred saints, were stirred up to practice the going out. This is an example of taking a definite step to go out to contact people for the gospel.</P><P>When he was young, D. L. Moody, the founder of Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, made a decision before the Lord that he would contact at least one person daily for the gospel. One day he forgot to do this. Late in the night he remembered that he had not contacted anyone that day. Then he made the decision that he had to fulfill his duty. So he went out in the night to contact one person. Of course, it was not proper for him to knock on others' doors at midnight. The only person he saw was a policeman. He went to him and told him that he needed to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. The policeman scolded him and told him to go away. But the next day the policeman began to wonder why a man would come to him at midnight. Later, the policeman found Moody, and eventually he was saved. This is another example of the practice of the New Testament gospel priesthood.</P><P>The second step in the practice of the God-ordained way is to feed, to nourish, the spiritual children (John 21:15). In Song of Songs 1:7 the seeking one asked the Lord where He fed His flock. The Lord's answer was that if she did not know, she should follow the footsteps of the flock and feed her kids beside the shepherds' tents (v. 8). Here the shepherds' tents signify the church. We should not simply seek the Lord by ourselves; as we pursue the Lord, we should bring our "kids," our spiritual children, with us. We should be spiritual nursing mothers with two or three spiritual infants (1 Thes. 2:7).</P><P>As a seeker of the Lord, we must have some spiritual kids who need our feeding. When we come to the Lord's table meeting, we should have one kid on our right and another on our left. How wonderful it would be if we would bring at least two kids to the meeting to feed them. Such feeding is the nourishing and the cherishing (Eph. 5:29). This kind of feeding can best be carried out through the word (1 Pet. 2:2) in meetings held in the new believers' homes.</P><P>After baptizing a new one, you can tell him that two days later, in the evening, you will come to his home to have a home meeting with just him and his family. It is better to take such a step not by yourself alone. The Lord's way is to send His disciples two by two (Luke 10:1; Acts 13:1-3). Thus, it is better for you to go to that home meeting with a companion. You should not wait to begin the meeting after you enter through the door. Even while you are knocking on the door, you can sing. Those inside may hear your singing and open the door. That will be the beginning of the home meeting. Although I have been speaking on this matter for quite some time, not many of the saints have practiced this. This is why I say that we must take a definite step in practicing the God-ordained way. We cannot practice all the steps at one time. It is better to take just one definite step.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Practice of the Church Life according to the God-ordained Way &nbsp; pg 56</div><br></body></html>
