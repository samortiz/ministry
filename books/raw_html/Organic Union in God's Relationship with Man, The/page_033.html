<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FULFILLMENT OF<br>THE ETERNAL ECONOMY OF GOD</H2><P>The building up of the Body of Christ will usher in the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God. God's eternal economy is referred to by the apostle Paul in Ephesians 1 and 3. In Ephesians 3:9-10 Paul said, "And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is...in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church." In Ephesians 1:10 Paul said that the church carries out the economy of God that all things can be headed up in Christ. Today the whole universe is in a state of collapse. But, since the church will be headed up in Christ, the church will be used by Christ to head up all things in the universe in Christ. This is to fulfill God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>By Carrying Out<br>the New Testament Ministry</H2><P>In the building up of the Body of Christ, the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God is accomplished by carrying out the New Testament ministry (Eph. 4:12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Complete the Building Up of the Church<br>for the Consummation of the New Jerusalem</H2><P>By the carrying out of the New Testament ministry, the building up of the church will be completed for the consummation of the New Jerusalem. The built-up church will usher in the New Testament consummation, the New Jerusalem, to fulfill God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ORGANIC CONSTITUTION<br>OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>We all have to realize that the church as the Body of Christ is an organism, an organic constitution constituted with divinity plus humanity. Ephesians 4:4-6 says, "One Body and one Spirit...one Lord...one God and Father of all." The church is the Body; this is the human frame, on the human side. In this frame there is the Divine Trinity as the divine constituent for the Body's constitution. The Spirit is the essence of the Body, the Lord is the element, and God the Father is the source. From the source the element comes, and within the element is the essence. This essence is the Spirit. The church as an organism is constituted on the human side as a frame and on the divine side as the contents. The divine essence, element, and source are mingled with the human frame. The church is such an organism. This is what God is after today, and this is according to God's desire. God is expecting to have this, but there is not such a thing on this earth today. Yet, we must believe that if we are faithful to all that is revealed in this book, such a thing will take place on this earth as a testimony of God Himself and as a declaration against God's enemy, Satan. May the Lord have mercy on us and grant us the grace we need, so that such a wonderful building can be seen on the earth today.</P>
