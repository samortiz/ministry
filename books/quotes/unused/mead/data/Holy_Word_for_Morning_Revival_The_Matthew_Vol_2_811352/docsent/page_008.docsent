   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 6 PROPHECY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Outline The King's ministry 4:12 11:30 The continuation of the ministry 8:1 9:34 Signs with dispensational significance 8:1-17 The way to follow the King 8:18-22 The authority of the King 8:23 9:8 Over the winds and the sea 8:23-27 Over the demons 8:28-34 To forgive sins 9:1-8 Rejoicing with the sinners 9:9-13 Being incompatible with religion 9:14-17 Crucial Points</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After decreeing the new law of the kingdom, the first things the new King did were to cleanse the unclean, heal the sick, and cast out the demons Matt 8:2-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These miracles are grouped together to present a meaningful doctrine; that is, they have a dispensational significance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first class of people saved by the kingly Savior is represented by a leper.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The leper here represents the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Leprosy in the Scriptures signifies rebellion and disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Jewish leper was healed by the King's direct touch.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In contrast, the Gentile centurion's servant was healed by the King's word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the end of this age salvation will come back from the Gentiles to the Jews, not the scattered ones, but to the Jews in the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time the Jews will be sick of a fever fervent in science, in finance, in education, and in all manner of worldly pursuits.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the eyes of God all this is a fever.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In their fervency they neither trust in God nor care for morality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just as the Lord healed Peter's mother-in-law vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>14-15 , so will He come back again at the end of this age to heal the Jews not through their faith, but through His direct touch.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verses 18 through 22 we see the way to follow the heavenly King.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The way is revealed through the cases of two who came to the King.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First, as we follow Him, we should not expect to have any material enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Second, in order to follow Him, we must ignore the requirements of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, the spiritually dead will fulfill the duty of burying the physically dead Eph 2:1, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Matthew 8:23 9:8 we see the authority of the King which is of three aspects: over the winds and the sea, over the demons, and the authority to forgive sins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Together these cases reveal a clear picture of who this heavenly King is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is the Savior of the Jews and also of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As God, He not only has authority over the natural environment and over the demons; He also has the full authority to forgive people of their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After He manifested His authority as the King, in many situations, in 9:9-13 we see Him feasting with sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Pharisees criticized and condemned Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They assumed that God deals with man only according to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the Lord was feasting with all those sick ones, He revealed Himself as the Physician to heal them, not as a Judge to condemn them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Matthew presents us another case in 9:14-17: the case of fasting without the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The disciples of John the Baptist were fasting without Christ, without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, they formed another religion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Religion is doing things to please God apart from Christ and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now in this case the Lord Jesus likens Himself to a bridegroom at a wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord asked if the sons of the bridechamber can mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is a joyful time with the Bridegroom, but when the Bridegroom is taken away, they may fast.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Finally, we see that Christ is not only our new garment as our outward qualification and new wine as our inward energizing life, but being increased He is also our new wineskin, the church, the Body 1 Cor 12:12 , capable of holding the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</S>
