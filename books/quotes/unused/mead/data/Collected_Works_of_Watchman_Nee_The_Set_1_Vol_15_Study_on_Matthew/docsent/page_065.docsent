   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 18:"And Jesus rebuked it, and the demon came out from him; and the boy was healed from that hour."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Rebuked."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is to say that the demon ought not to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Following the rebuke, there must be a command.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In casting out demons, prayer alone is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There must be the rebuking and the commanding.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We dare only to pray, but we dare not rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Prayer is the receiving of authority and power from God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After receiving these, you still need to apply them by rebuking the demon in order to cast it out, because the demon knows the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the man sought for healing, he only said, "He has epilepsy," but when the Lord cured him, He "rebuked" the demon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows that whenever we pray for healing, we should have such spiritual insight that we can distinguish whether the source of the sickness is natural or supernatural.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The man said that it was sickness, but the Lord said that it was a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the demon was cast out, the sickness was cured.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It may be said that the demon was the source of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When you pray for man's sickness and have faith that God will surely heal him, but such faith does not bring any result, you must immediately discern whether or not the sickness results from a supernatural cause.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All those who believe Romans 6:10, yet still lose their temper and fall, must be bound by an evil spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not they themselves who have sinned, but the evil spirit that has compelled them to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 6:10 deals only with sin, not with the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 19:"Then the disciples, coming to Jesus privately, said, Why were we not able to cast it out?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verses 19-21 are a textbook on casting out demons.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Privately" because they were afraid to lose face.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 20:"And He said to them, Because of your little faith; for truly I say to you, If you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Little faith" should be translated "unbelief."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This unbelief refers to the unbelief of the believers, not to disbelieving in Jesus as the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Mountain" and "mustard seed" are both figures of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A mountain is most stable and firm.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But by faith one can remove many mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many difficulties are not like meteors but are as firm and stable as mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, there may be sons and daughters in your family who are unbelieving or jobless.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Faith not only can remove mountains but also can deal with anything; it can deal with all kinds of difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why did they first ask others for help?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 21:"But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Faith is different from praying and fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here the Lord shows us the prayer that backs up one's faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We always say that once we have faith, we do not need to pray but only to give thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we continue to pray, our faith will be shaken, especially when we are asking God for something.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, in dealing with the demons, this is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once we have faith, we still need to pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once we have the faith to cast out demons, we need to ask for the execution.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Luke 18 we see the widow's continual petition for the avenging of her adversary, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to deal with Satan, we need to attack him every day by the way of praying until the time of death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even when we have faith, we still need to pray and fast.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These two are works indeed, and they also are an attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On that specific day, the Lord Himself had not prayed and fasted.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since the Lord could cast out the demon, we know that He must have prayed and fasted previously.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord had the attitude of praying and fasting, which is the attitude of relying on God and overcoming oneself, controlling oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, besides the works, we also need such an attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For this, every believer needs to be on the alert all the time for this kind of demon, which is the most fierce of all the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are small demons, and there are big demons; the small demons can be overcome by the singing of hymns or the reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since we are Christians, we should not consider any demon to be too great, but neither should we consider it as too small.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis once said, "Underestimating the evil spirits is the cause of suffering loss, while uplifting the evil spirits is the cause of losing one's dignity." We need to keep 1 John 4:4 firmly in mind and acknowledge that we cannot do anything in ourselves and that, therefore, we need to pray and fast.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The necessary conditions for casting out demons are: 1 Faith believing that the name of the Lord has been exalted by God to be "above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth" Phil 2:9-10; Eph 1:20-22; Heb 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every demon knows Philippians 2:9.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Let us believe firmly in Philippians 2:9.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sometimes it is sufficient to know only Jesus because Jesus is the sign of victory, power, and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may say, "Jesus is Lord" or "Jesus is the Victor."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>2 Boldness if you are afraid, you have no faith; at least your faith is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since the name of the Lord is exalted, we must demonstrate our courage and power.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Keep 1 John 4:4 in mind; either you will have to lose, or the demon will have to be cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>3 Endurance the demon can at best delay even ten times, to and fro .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Never suppose that the name of the Lord is ineffective; instead, hold fast this determination.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If the demon stays for one hundred days, I must not leave for one hundred one days.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Beelzebul is the lord of flies.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The demons are indeed like flies; they leave and then come back again.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The demons can endure well.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verse 22: "And while they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The second time the Lord declared that He would be killed was different from the first time Matt 16:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The first time indicates that the Jews the elders, chief priests, and scribes rejected the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The second time indicates that the Gentiles rejected the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>"Be delivered into the hands of men" this is to be delivered by the Jews to the Gentiles Pilate .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Verse 23: "And they will kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>And they were greatly grieved."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"Greatly grieved" because they could not see that the cross is the sign of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After humiliation, the glory comes; after suffering, the throne comes.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>With us also it is the same; we often worry about the narrow path of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The origin of the temple tax: the temple tax is the propitiation silver offered in ancient times Exo 30:13-15; 2 Chron 24:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Formerly, the half-shekel was paid during roll call; later, it was used for the expenses of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>During the time of Nehemiah, it was changed to one-third of a shekel Neh 10:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>By the time of the Lord Jesus, it had been changed again to a half-shekel.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Everyone, whether rich or poor, had to pay the same temple tax.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The temple tax gatherers thought that the Lord was a strange person; therefore, they asked Peter first.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Verses 24-27:"And when they came to Capernaum, those who take up the temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He said, Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said to him, So then the sons are free.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But that we do not stumble them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>And when you open its mouth, you will find a stater; take that and give it to them for Me and you."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Peter had said "Yes"; his old temperament came out again.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Lord is the Son of God; therefore, He does not need to pay the tax.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Peter also did not need to pay because the Lord had set him free John 8:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Not only is the Lord Himself free, but He has also made others free.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>"But that we do not stumble them" means not to offend them.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If a principle touches God's person, holiness, and work, we should not yield and should not be afraid of offending men.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Nevertheless, concerning the other minor matters that are not related to God, we should follow the example of the Lord and should not offend others.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Here the Lord was indeed wise.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He was meek but not weak; He was humble but did not shrink back.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In many matters we should leave some leeway for people.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>There is another lesson: believers today should not misuse the name of the Son of God, whether in the present life or in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We should not persecute others; rather, we should be persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If the government today gives every Christian a certain privilege, we would rather not accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Today is the time for paying taxes.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>"Go to the sea and cast a hook."</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>On the one hand, the Lord showed meekness and grace; on the other hand, He showed power and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>"Me and you."</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Why did He not say "us"?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>It is because the Lord can never stand in the same position as us.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>He is the firstborn Son, the only begotten Son; we are the many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>On account of His glory, the Lord paid the tax.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>On account of His grace, the Lord paid for Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The Lord can supply all our needs.</S>
