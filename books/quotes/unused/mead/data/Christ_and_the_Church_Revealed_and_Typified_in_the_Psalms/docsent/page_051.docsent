   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PSALM 73 SUFFERINGS OF THE SEEKING SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we turn to Psalm 73, we must recall again Psalm 1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I know that by now you are very well acquainted with our case concerning Psalm 1, but allow me to expose it again in the light of Psalm 73.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psalm 1:1 says, "Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And verse 3: "And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to Psalm 1, it is not the wicked and the ungodly who will prosper, but the godly saints, those who keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now turn to Psalm 73, verse 3: "For I was envious at the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Psalm 1 says that the godly will prosper and the wicked will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But Psalm 73 tells us that the Psalmist saw the prosperity of the wicked.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 12 he says, "Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, Psalm 73 proves conclusively that there is a problem with Psalm 1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He says, "Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency" v. 13 . In other words, he is saying, "I have kept the law all the time; I have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in vain, because I did not prosper." Verse 14 reveals the experience of this godly saint: "For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning." What can we say? Here is a godly saint who is plagued all the day and chastened every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must be exceedingly clear now concerning the position of Psalm 1.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then he continues by saying, "If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children" v. 15 . The Psalmist was really perplexed when he considered the situation from the standpoint of material blessing and profit, good and evil; he had a real problem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If he would utter publicly, "I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency," he would not be faithful to God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What should he do, and what should he say?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Psalmist replies, "When I thought how I might know this, it was a painful labor in mine eyes" v. 16 . The whole dilemma was entirely too difficult for him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How could you reconcile Psalm 1 and Psalm 73?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the traditional teachings of Christianity today, there is absolutely no way to reconcile these two Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a strong case set forth to expose the present pitiful situation of Christianity's teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is only one way to reconcile Psalms 1 and 73, and it is presented to us in Psalm 73:17, "Until I went into the sanctuary of God, then understood I their end."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The sanctuary of God is the place where we may obtain the revelation we need.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The sanctuary here undoubtedly signifies the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our spirit today is God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And, even more, the local churches are God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, we must turn to our spirit, and we must turn to the local church; then we will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our spirit and the local church are the places where we receive divine revelation, where we obtain the explanation to all our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When "I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I. "</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What did he understand?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 25: "Whom have I in heaven but thee?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He realized that God was working to deprive him of all material things that he might enjoy God in such an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why do the wicked prosper and their riches continually increase?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is because God has given them up; He simply lets them go on their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They have nothing whatever to do with the enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But God's intention with the seeking saints is to remove all material blessings and all physical enjoyments that they may find everything in God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nothing in heaven nor on earth can be their enjoyment but God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was by the Psalmist's experience, as recorded in the first part of Psalm 73, that he could eventually assert, "Whom have I in heaven but thee?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He received revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He learned why God would not allow the seeking saints to prosper as the worldlings do.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God intends that nothing should distract us from the absolute enjoyment of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, it is not a matter of merely keeping the law, but of seeking God absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not a matter of doing good or evil, right or wrong if you are concerned about that, you are still occupied with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is a matter of seeking God, obtaining God, possessing God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is a matter of experiencing God to the extent that you also can say, "Whom have I in heaven but thee?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In other words, "I do not care for anything but the tree of life; I do not care for anything other than God Himself."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is Psalm 73.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the Psalmist went into the sanctuary of God, he received this revelation and took God Himself as his all.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How may we too have the experience of the Psalmist in these verses?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must be in the spirit and in the local church, the sanctuary of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Just by this one Psalm we may see the difference between Book III and Book I. There is a great improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is not a matter of keeping the law or of being right or wrong, but of having God and of keeping God as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Let us look briefly at Psalm 24 in the light of Psalm 73.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Psalm 24:1 says, "The earth is the Lord's," and verse 3 asks, "Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 4 answers: "He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some may think that this verse refers to those who keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if we read Psalm 73, we have these very matters mentioned: "I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency" v. 13 . Vanity is anything beside God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Idols are vanity; worldly prosperity is vanity; anything but God is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A pure heart is one that is set on nothing but God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only one who has a pure heart can say, "Whom have I in heaven but thee?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>And there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you are still seeking anything other than God, your heart is set upon vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God Himself is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do not imagine that Psalm 24:4 signifies the keeping of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Not at all.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It refers to one whose heart is set upon nothing but God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The one in Psalm 24:4 is the one in Psalm 73.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the one who has washed his hands and cleansed his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He has a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Psalm 73:1 says, "Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a pure heart."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Psalm 24:4 refers not to the law-keepers, but to the God-seekers.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>"Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The God-seekers!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The way to see all these things is to enter into the sanctuary of God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>So many of us can testify that before we came into the local churches, we were ignorant of many things.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It was not until we came into the sanctuary of God that we understood.</S>
