   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE THE MOVE OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR S</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOSPEL SERVICE 5 Scripture Reading: Mark 7:1-23</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that in chapter seven the opposition of the Pharisees and scribes gave the Lord Jesus an excellent opportunity to expose man s inward condition, the condition of man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 7:15 the Lord said to the crowd, There is nothing outside of a man which entering into him can defile him, but the things coming out of a man are the things which defile a man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When He had entered into a house, His disciples questioned Him concerning this saying.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then the Lord went on to say, Are you also in the same manner without understanding?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do you not perceive that everything from outside entering into a man cannot defile him, because it does not enter into his heart, but into the stomach, and goes out into the drain, making all foods clean? vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 19 the Lord refers to the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 20 He continues, That which goes out of a man, that defiles a man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Following this, the Lord gives a list of some of the evil things that proceed out of man s heart vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A CONSTITUTION OF EVILS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 7:21 and 22 the Lord says, For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil reasonings, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, a wicked eye, blasphemy, arrogance, foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here the Lord designates that part of man from which evil things proceed the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man s heart is rotten, corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The heart of fallen man is corrupt to such an extent that it is incurable Jer 17:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, we should not think that we are good in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps you are good outwardly, but there is nothing good in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason, Paul could confess that nothing good dwelt within him Rom 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this chapter the depth of man s condition is exposed by the Slave-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In our preaching of the gospel we also should touch the condition of man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, much of today s gospel preaching fails to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to see from the Lord s word in chapter seven of the Gospel of Mark what our inward condition really is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The actual condition of our heart is that it is a constitution of evils.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because our heart is corrupt, we should never think that it is good.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To believe that our heart is good is to be deceived and to believe a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Anyone who thinks that he has a good heart is deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our heart is corrupt, and we should not have any trust in it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verse 21 the Lord Jesus uses the word proceed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to this verse, evil reasonings, fornications, thefts, and murders proceed out of the heart of men.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The word proceed implies continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only do evil things come out of man s heart; they continually proceed out from his heart, coming forth one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Evil Reasonings</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first item listed by the Slave-Savior as proceeding out of man s heart is evil reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Reasonings, of course, come from the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The New Testament tells us that the mind of fallen man is reprobate, disapproved Rom 1:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because man s mind is reprobate, nothing that comes out of it can be accepted by God or justified by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, the reasonings of the fallen mind of man are condemned and rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because our fallen mind is reprobate, our reasonings are evil, no matter how good they may seem to be.</S>
