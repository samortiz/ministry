<h2 class="head2">Having a Definite Consecration<br />
for the Practice of the New Way</h2>
<p>If we love the Lord, we should respond to this fellowship. First, we should consecrate ourselves to the Lord and set aside a definite time, two to three hours a week, to go out door-knocking. This time should be used either to lead people to be baptized or to meet in the home of a new believer. After our initial contact with a new believer, we should meet with him ten times in the first month and once per week thereafter. We should do this every week for one year. After twelve months the new one will be established. Then he will beget and teach others in the same way that he was begotten and taught. This will make him remaining fruit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SKILLFULLY NOURISHING FOR FRUIT TO REMAIN</h2>
<p>When my grandson was born, he weighed less than six pounds. When my wife and I went to the hospital to visit him, we did not believe that he could grow up properly. However, because of his condition, he received special care and has grown up quite well. Today he plays football at school and excels in academics. Therefore, it does not matter whether a baby is weak at birth. If he receives proper care, he will grow up healthy and strong. Likewise, a person may not seem clear at the time of his baptism. However, after he comes out of the water, we should edify him. We need to teach him that the Lord Jesus is the life-giving Spirit and that he has a spirit with which he can call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. We should also help him to practice. After three days we can visit him again and teach him a new lesson. If we give him ten lessons in this way, I believe that he will live and grow strong even if he was weak in the beginning. However, regardless of how good a person&rsquo;s situation is, if we abandon him immediately after his baptism, he will die within a couple of months.</p>
<p>We need to correct our previous mistake. Instead of inviting people to come and listen to the gospel, we should deliver the gospel to their homes. Instead of dragging people to the church meetings, we should set up a meeting in their home, delivering the church meeting to their home. Most of the new believers are not used to the way that we meet. Some of them might have family restrictions or other situations that prevent them from coming to the church meetings. If we compel such ones to come to the church meeting, we may damage them. However, meeting in a new believer&rsquo;s home would be very convenient. If he is very busy, we can accommodate his situation and spend fifteen to twenty minutes to fellowship with him. For example, two sisters may go to the home of a new one, who is a housewife, when she is in the middle of cooking a meal. One of the sisters can help the new one in the kitchen, and the other can fellowship with her. In such a situation it would be hard for the new one to make excuses. This can be compared to putting food into someone&rsquo;s mouth. In most situations the new one will accept it. If we nourish and take care of the new ones in this way, at least eighty percent of them will remain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN ESTIMATION</h2>
<p>I hope that the elders and the saints in all the churches will be stirred up by the Lord to live a revived and overcoming life and also to build up three matters: preaching the gospel by knocking on doors and visiting people, setting up meetings in the homes of the new believers in order to nourish and help them weekly, and teaching the new ones to call on the name of the Lord, to read the Bible, to pray, to sing hymns, to speak for the Lord, to testify, and to function in the home meetings. We must not follow the custom in Catholicism and Protestantism of having one person speaking and everyone else listening. Instead, we should lead the new ones to build up the habit of speaking for the Lord in the home meetings, the group meetings, and in the larger meetings of the church. If we would practice this, the new ones will be established.</p>
<p>If there are one hundred saints meeting in a church, only twenty of them need to go out and knock on doors. However, this does not mean that only twenty people should devote themselves to door-knocking. Some may be able to go out only once every three weeks, and others may be able to go out twice a week. The elderly ones may not be able to go out at all because of their health, and some elderly ones may be strong enough to go door-knocking. This would be very helpful. If twenty people can go out every week, they can be formed into seven teams. They should be able to knock on at least twenty doors in one and a half hours and find a son of peace. If they find a son of peace, they will have to spend an hour to edify him. Therefore, they would spend a total of two to three hours.</p>
<p>If every team is able to gain a new one per week, that would be fifty-two new ones in a year. If we reduce the number by twenty percent, every team would have forty new ones, and there would be a combined total of two hundred eighty new ones, which nearly equals three times the number of saints in the locality. If we reduce the number further to half by subtracting the undependable ones, there would still be one hundred forty new ones, which still exceeds a twofold increase. Such a rate of increase would be wonderful. After gaining the new ones, we need to make them remaining fruit. The way to preserve them is for sixty out of the remaining eighty saints in the church to rise up and care for the new ones. These sixty may be divided into twenty teams to nourish and teach the new ones.</p>
<p>Thus, in a church with one hundred people, eighty would be active, and the remaining twenty might be inactive because of sickness, weaknesses, or other legitimate reasons. It would be easy for eighty people to take care of a hundred and forty new ones. After a year, at least one hundred people would remain. This is to have a twofold increase yearly. This is the easiest and the most profitable way. I am confident that we will succeed. If we would take this way, we would need a little over twenty-five years to save and baptize all the people in the world. This is an extremely great matter. It would not be a repetition of our last ten years of barrenness. If we are willing to put our effort into practicing the new way, after twenty-six years the whole world would be evangelized, and everyone would be saved and baptized. This would deal a fatal blow to Satan.</p>
