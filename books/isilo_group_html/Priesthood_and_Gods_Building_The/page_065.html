<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING ENTIRELY IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The building up of the church is absolutely a matter in our spirit. Whether we are an elder, a co-worker, or a responsible brother or sister in a district, if we do not live in our spirit and do not bring the saints into their spirit, there will be no building. Genuine spiritual building does not mean that we have the same goal or even that we are in agreement in our opinions or views. Genuine spiritual building is the result of receiving the Lord&rsquo;s grace and exercising our spirit to the extent that we are persons who live in spirit. Being in the spirit, living in our spirit, is the only thing that matters; everything else is secondary. Being in the spirit satisfies the Lord&rsquo;s heart, and it delivers us from the old creation and dead doctrine. When we truly live in our spirit, we will experience Christ and live by Him.</p>
<p>Being in spirit is the practical reality of being in Christ. Our experience of Christ is absolutely a matter in the spirit. If we do not touch the spirit and are not in the spirit, all our talk about Christ is just doctrine. We can touch Christ practically only when we are in the spirit. God&rsquo;s essence is Spirit; everything of God is in the Spirit. If we are not in our spirit, we will never touch God. We can live in God, experience Christ, and be in the building only when we touch the Spirit in our spirit.</p>
<p>The oneness of the church is the genuine building, and this oneness is the oneness of the Spirit (Eph. 4:3). The oneness of the Spirit is in our spirit. Many times our &ldquo;oneness&rdquo; only reflects our agreement related to certain items of the truth; it does not manifest the genuine oneness in our spirit, much less the oneness of the Spirit. In order to have the oneness of the Spirit, we must be led by God to the extent that we live in our mingled spirit. Being in spirit is the genuine oneness, and it produces the genuine building. If we have not received the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to this extent, we are still short in the matter of building.</p>
<p>If we cannot bring the saints into the spirit, we cannot lead them to be built up. The most important matter is to bring them into the spirit. We may lead the saints to attend meetings and read the Bible, we may fellowship with them, and we may invite them to our home for a meal, but these are only means and procedures to bring them into the spirit. Even when we lead the saints to consecrate themselves to the Lord, to pursue spiritual knowledge, and to deal with sins, these matters are procedures; they are not the ultimate goal. If we lead the saints to consecrate themselves without bringing them into their spirit, we have not reached the goal. If we lead the saints to read and study the Bible without bringing them to their spirit to contact the Lord, we have not reached the goal. Similarly, if we lead the saints to deal with their sins to remove the barriers and hindrances to their fellowship with the Lord, we must lead them further to enter into the spirit to fellowship with the Lord. Our only goal should be to bring the saints into the spirit.</p>
<p>In the past we did not pay adequate attention to this matter. Although we led the saints to deal with their sins, we did not emphasize that the purpose of dealing with sins is to enter into the spirit to have fellowship with the Lord. Similarly, we led the saints to attend meetings, but we did not emphasize that the meetings are for entering into the spirit to serve God as priests. We led the saints to consecrate themselves, but we did not show them that the purpose of consecration is to let God occupy their whole being so that they may have more fellowship with Him in spirit. In short, we led the saints in numerous spiritual matters, but our goal was not clear and definite; that is, we did not emphasize the need to contact the Lord in our spirit.</p>
<p>The work that we have done is not without value and benefit; however, our work has not reached the goal. We lead people to salvation, but we do not bring them into the spirit to contact the Lord. We lead the saints to attend meetings, but we do not lead them to serve in spirit. We lead them to read the Bible, but we do not lead them to contact the Lord through the words of the Bible or to use their spirit to turn the words of the Bible into prayer. We lead them to consecrate themselves, but we do not tell them that consecration separates them from everything of themselves so that they can turn to the spirit to contact the Lord and to let the Lord gain them more. We lead them to love the Lord fervently and to receive the Lord&rsquo;s dealings, but we do not show them that loving the Lord and receiving His dealings enable them to be more intimate with Him in spirit and to live more deeply in the spirit. Since we do not have a strong focus on the saints being in spirit, the saints have not gained something solid or seen this matter clearly.</p>
<p>All the elders, co-workers, and responsible ones in the districts must see that our labor, whether in preaching the gospel, helping the brothers and sisters, edifying the saints, or administrating in the church, has only one goal&mdash;to bring people into God, that is, to bring them into the spirit to live in spirit. When we reach this stage, the church will be manifested. The reality of the church is manifested and the church is built up only to the extent that we are in the spirit. If we have deep and extensive experiences of being in the spirit, the building up of the church will be deep and extensive. However, if we have only shallow and limited experiences, the building up among us will be shallow and limited.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 65</div><br></body></html>
