<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST FOR THE BUILDING</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 111 to 125</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 111:1, 10b; 112:1a; 113:1-3; 115:18b; 116:13, 17-19; 117:1-2; 118:22-24, 26-27; 119:14, 24, 36, 59, 62, 103, 105, 111, 164, 167; 122:1-9; 125:1-2</h1><p>In the preceding chapter we have covered Psalms 107, 108, 109, and 110. In this group of four Psalms, Psalm 110 is the climax. No other Psalm is higher regarding Christ than this Psalm. It is very short, and it has only a few main points, but these points are exceedingly significant.<p>Now we come to Psalms 111 through 119, which are full of the saints’ praise to God. We may call these Psalms the “Hallelujah Psalms.” Because we have just touched the peak concerning Christ in Psalm 110, we must shout Hallelujah. Hence, the first verse of Psalm 111 begins with Hallelujah, and we have Hallelujahs throughout all these Psalms. These praises are “in the assembly…and in the congregation” (Psa. 111:1); “in the courts of the Lord’s house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah” (Psa. 116:19).<h2 class=head1>PSALM 118—CHRIST THE CORNERSTONE</h2><p>Now we come to Psalm 118, which all Bible teachers recognize as the last Psalm regarding Christ. Do not forget the five points concerning Christ in Psalm 110: He is the enthroned King, the Victor, the Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, the Warrior, and the Coming One. This is indeed wonderful, but there is one item missing in Psalm 110: there is no mention of Christ for the building. Now, in Psalm 118 we have Christ for the building presented to us in a marvelous way. Verse 22: “The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.” This is just a short verse, but we cannot express how much this verse means to us and to God. It has been used and quoted many times in the New Testament. This is Christ for the building. Christ today is not only the enthroned King, the ordained Priest, the Victor, the Warrior, and the Coming One; He is also the stone that was rejected by the builders. The Jewish nation, the Jewish people, were the builders of God. God used them to build up something upon this earth for Himself, but they rejected the best stone of all. Even the Lord Jesus, when He was on this earth, quoted this verse. He was quite frank. He asked the Jews whether they had read the Scripture in Psalm 118: “Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?” (Matt. 21:42).<p>Today Christ is the stone for God’s building: “And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth into an holy temple in the Lord” (Eph. 2:20-21). “To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious.…Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious.…Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner” (1 Pet. 2:4, 6-7). “This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner” (Acts 4:11). Even Peter before the chief priests said that Christ is made the cornerstone.<p>Included within Christ as the cornerstone are His resurrection, His ascension, His enthronement, and His ordination. He is not only the King and the Priest, but also the stone for God’s building. In another sense, He is also the Builder; but the point upon which we must now focus is that He Himself is the material for the building. He is the cornerstone, and we are all the other stones produced out of Him. He is the living stone, and we have all been made living stones by Him (1 Pet. 2:4-5). He is the resurrected stone, and in His resurrection we have been made the living stones. Thus, He is not only the building stone, but also the stone for producing many more stones. He is the leading living stone, which produces so many others. Praise the Lord!
