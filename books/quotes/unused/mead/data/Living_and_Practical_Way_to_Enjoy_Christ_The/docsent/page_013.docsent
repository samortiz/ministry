   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BEING THE END OF THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The verses from Romans 10 in the Scripture reading at the beginning of this chapter show us the way to take in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 4 says that Christ is the end of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you desire to take in Christ, you surely have to realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nearly all of us are under a certain law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Jewish people are under the law given through Moses, but I am afraid that you are still under a certain law made by Christianity or made by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are the Moses-made law, the Christianity-made law, and the self-made law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I believe that we all have some self-made law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may wonder what I mean by a self-made law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then I would ask you, "Don't you have the intention to work more for the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Surely this is very good, but this is a self-made law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A husband may pray, "O Lord, help me to love my wife."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A wife may pray, "O Lord, help me to submit myself to my husband."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These are self-made laws.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even you may have made up your mind that from now on you will call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even this is a law made by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then you would say, "What shall we do?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even this desire to do something is a self-made law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you make up your mind that from today you will pray-read the Bible, this is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I assure you that all who have ever made such a law have had a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Trying to do anything is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not try to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Just forget about doing something.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But how can you forget about doing?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if you try to forget about doing, that is still a law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to see that when Christ comes to us, this is the end of our self-made laws.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I cannot help you, but if Christ comes to you, you will be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is the end of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Saul of Tarsus is a good example for us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was a man under the law made by Moses and by the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was also under the law made by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was trying to keep all the laws made by Moses, all the rules made by Judaism, and all the desires and intentions set up by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>While he was trying his best to keep all the laws, the light and the voice came from the heavens, and he fell to the ground Acts 9:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That day on the way to Damascus the one who was trying his best to keep the law and persecute Jesus fell on the ground and called, "Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He said, "Who are You, Lord?" v. 5 . Even before he came to know the Lord, he called on the Lord cf.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rom 10:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At that time the Lord Jesus came into Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We know this because his whole activity was stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was stopped from the Moses-made law; he was stopped from the Judaism-made law; and he was stopped from his self-made law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ is the end of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Saul was so intelligent, clear, and strong, yet he was stopped and became blind.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He lost his sight.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He could not do anything, and he did not know where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Before that time, he was a leading one, one whom others followed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But after Jesus came into him, his sight was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He did not know what to do or where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He needed somebody else to lead him v. 8 . He was fully stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is because Christ is the end of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the same way, if Jesus would grant you a gracious visitation, your whole activity would be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may pray, "From now on, Lord, help me to love my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From now on, Lord, help me to submit myself to my husband.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From now on, Lord, help me to pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From now on help me to do this or that."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But as long as you have so many doings, this proves that you are short of the gracious visitation of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His visitation will stop all your activities because He is the end of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am afraid that many of you still have certain desires, certain intentions, and even certain schedules.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All of these are your self-made laws.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I cannot tell you to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If I did, this would also be a law.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not promise me that from tonight you will stop your activity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is another law.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When Jesus came to Saul of Tarsus, he was fully puzzled.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He said, "Who are You, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He lost his direction.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Before that time he was so clear and bold in taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But after meeting Christ, he did not know where to go or what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I do not want this fellowship in this chapter to open your eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Instead, I hope that it will blind you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Have you lost your sight?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Or are you still clear?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do you still know what to do?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is a real blessing to lose your sight.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Saul of Tarsus lost his sight and his direction because Christ as the end of the law came into him.</S>
