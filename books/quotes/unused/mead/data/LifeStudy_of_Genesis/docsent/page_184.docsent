   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Most Christians think that grace is merely something given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If I give you a Bible as a present, that is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although this understanding is correct, in the Bible grace means much more than that.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Grace is not only something given by God, but it is God Himself doing things for us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Grace is not merely something objective that is given to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Grace is God Himself coming to us and doing things for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Are you weak?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God will come to be your strength, and that coming of God is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Are you unable to face your situation?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That need not be a problem, because God will come to stand with you and face that situation for and in you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you read Genesis 6 carefully, you will see that grace here does not mean that God gave Noah many things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It means that God came to Noah and was with Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's presence was Noah's strength and power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Noah not only enjoyed something given to him by God objectively, but he enjoyed God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the midst of a crooked, perverse, and adulterous generation, a generation whose temptations no one could withstand, Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God came to strengthen Noah that He might stand with him and uphold him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That was the grace that Noah found, and that is the grace that we need today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Consider the situation in modern society.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I do not even dare to look at a newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It contains too many temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>While I am walking along the street, I do not dare to look into the show windows.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the reason that I do not like to go into the department store.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Department stores are more than devilish, and all the exhibitions and displays in them come from hell.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The talk you hear on the radio, at work, and at school is evil, corrupt, and devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is hard for anyone as a fallen person to stand in such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This age is truly crooked, perverse, and adulterous; it is full of fornication and immorality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>People talk about immorality without one bit of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Who can stand in such a generation?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not one of us is able to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all have a fallen nature within us, the same evil nature that all men have.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must come to the throne of grace boldly and say, "Lord, I am here.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I need Your grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am not coming to ask You to give me good things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am coming to find grace to meet my need.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lord, I cannot go to work or to school without Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Lord, I cannot go to a department store without Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Lord, I need You to stand with me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Come to be my strength.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Lord, uphold me and sustain me."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The matter of divorce is a great temptation to the young people today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The temptations are without and the lusts are within.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Who can stand in such an age?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is such great temptation!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because none of us is able to stand, we need the grace to be today's Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only grace can enable you to be one with your wife or husband.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only grace can help us to love our husbands or wives without change.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>None of us can do it without grace, for there is too much temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The tide, current, and trend of the age are too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>People seem to think that if you are not divorced, you are not modern.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They say that in order to be up-to-date you must be divorced.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How we need grace!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need God to come to us to be our strength and everything we need.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is what Noah needed and what we also need today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Noah found it, and we also must find it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because Noah found grace, it was easy for him to walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Parents are concerned about their children in school.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The biggest temptation that the children face in the schools today is the matter of drugs.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even in the elementary schools there are heroin addicts.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is pitiful!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The young children cannot stand against this kind of temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They need grace.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is no addiction that you can overcome by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You need to come to the throne of grace and find grace.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Noah found grace and he walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Grace helped him to walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>2 By Faith</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Noah walked with God by faith Heb 11:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As we pointed out in the Life-Study messages on Romans, faith is not something produced out from ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Faith is something of God that is transfused into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The more we touch the throne of God and the more we look to the Lord, the more we are transfused and infused with all that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When He is transfused and infused into our being, His very divine element infused within us becomes our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When you touch the throne of grace and are transfused with God, you will believe in God spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is no need for you to strive to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Once God's element has been infused into you, something within you springs up to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>That is God Himself who has been transfused into you believing for you.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We do not know how to believe and we cannot believe.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>However, if you simply come to the throne of grace, looking unto Him, touching Him, and finding grace, you will be infused with the believing God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He will believe in and for you.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He will be your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Faith comes from this source.</S>
