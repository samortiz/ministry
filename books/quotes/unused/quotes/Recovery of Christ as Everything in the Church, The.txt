In 114 Paul said I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race being more abundantly a zealot for the traditions of my fathers
Even after being saved for years, many Christians do not have a definite realization that a person has come into them
In order to adequately know the New Testament and see a new vision of Christ, we need to put these three books together
Verse 18 reveals that Christ is the Head of the Body, the church, and the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead
As the Head, the beginning, and the first item in the new creation, Christ has the first place, the preeminence, in all things
These verses reveal that Christ is the reality of every positive thing in the universe, such as life, light, air, water, and food
The new man mentioned in verse 10 is not an individual man, for verse 11 indicates that there are many persons in the new man
Because the church is purely Christ, the recovery of the church is simply the recovery of Christ as all in the church
Various practices, such as foot-washing, leg-lengthening, and different forms of baptism, have come in to replace Christ
Besides doctrines, practices, and opinions, there are various kinds of activities and movements that have also come in to replace Christ
Because many things have replaced Christ, the Lord's recovery is to recover Christ in a full way, to recover Christ as everything to us
In the Lord's recovery we should not care for doctrines, practices, opinions, activities, movements, or organizations but only for Christ
The proper way for the branches to bear fruit is simply to live the vine, to grow the vine, and to produce the vine
When one of them becomes sick, loses his job, or experiences some other difficult situation, he may remember us and ask us to visit him
Our relatives and acquaintances may outwardly criticize and even despise us, but their conscience will inwardly testify on our behalf
In order for Christ to be our life, He first needed to solve the problem of our sin, which separates us from God
As the Lamb of God, He shed His blood for the forgiveness of our sins; He accomplished redemption on the cross
John 12:24 says, 'Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
We need to see that Christ took two steps, indicated by two occurrences of the word became in the New Testament
Whether or not we understand this, the Bible reveals that the last Adam, Christ in the flesh, became the life-giving Spirit
Darby's New Translation places verses 7 through 16 within parentheses, indicating that verse 17 is a direct continuation of verse 6
The Spirit of God existed before Christ's resurrection, but the Spirit that includes Christ's humanity was not yet
We will be satisfied by Christ as the life-giving Spirit and will not be tempted to seek after worldly entertainment
Of forbidding our young people from participating in worldly activities, we should minister Christ as the life-giving Spirit to them
When we are fully enjoying the all-inclusive Christ in the church life, we will not be distracted by the world
The content of the Lord's recovery is not any outward practices; rather, the content is Christ, who is our unique joy and entertainment
The authority and impact of our Christian life and work are based on the fact that we are one spirit with the Lord
Because this item has been missed in today's Christianity, it needs to be recovered in our knowledge and experience
Our spirit may be likened to the living room in a home, and our mind, emotion, and will may be likened to the inner chambers
When Christ spreads into every part of our inner being to make His home in our heart, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God
Because we have been baptized into the corporate Christ in one Spirit, we are now positioned to drink of the Spirit
We have been put into Christ by being baptized into Him, and now we are taking Christ into us by drinking Him as the Spirit
The church life in the Lords recovery is not a matter of movements activities opinions concepts or gimmicks instead Christ is our all in all
If a businessman has the capital he has the financial power to start a corporation but without the necessary wisdom he will lose everything
Whereas cleverness is superficial and comes mainly from the human mind, wisdom comes from God and is higher than human cleverness
Verse 30 says, 'Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
Christ, into whom we have been baptized, became wisdom to us from God as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
Before we were saved, we were unrighteous, but when we received the Lord, we received the power and the wisdom to live righteously
We did not need anyone to teach us, because we had Christ in us as the power and the wisdom to behave properly
Others, especially our parents, may wonder what causes this great change in our living since we are not outwardly taught or regulated
Our living may be righteous but not yet sanctified, for we may be right with God and with man but still not separated unto God
After a period of time, when she goes to the department store, the Lord may inwardly bother her when she considers buying a certain item
Several good Bible teachers have pointed out that righteousness, sanctification, and redemption refer to three stages of the Christian life
Day by day Christ is the power and the wisdom for us to have such a proper Christian living that is righteous, sanctified, and redeemed
It is easy to see what unbelievers have, because it is superficial, but what we have is mysterious because it is deep
Corinthians 3:11 says, 'Another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ'
In this feast there was nothing leavened, signifying that there was nothing sinful, dirty, or condemned by God
If we do not sense that we are enjoying a feast, it is because we have not purged out the leaven, the sin of our old nature
If we hate this leaven and purge it out, our Christian life will spontaneously become a feast, a sweet enjoyment
Now we are in a feast enjoying Christ, but we must hate sin and deal with it to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread
Corinthians 15 reveals four more aspects of Christ-the firstfruits , the second man , the last Adam , and the life-giving Spirit
Because He is now the life-giving Spirit and we are one spirit with Him, everything He is can be real to us and is ours
Of caring for our thoughts, our love, our hatred, or our decisions, we need to constantly turn to our spirit, where Christ is
When we turn to our spirit, we meet Christ and give Him the way to spread from our spirit to our mind, emotion, and will
Christ will be able to settle Himself in our inner being to make His home in our heart, thereby becoming our all in all
He is our way to contact and serve God, fellowship with other believers, live the church life, preach the gospel, and shepherd the saints
In the previous chapter we saw that Christ becomes the reality of all things to us by being the power and the wisdom of God
The proper way to preach the gospel and minister life to people is the crucified way-the way that puts us to death
They feel that they are able to submit to the Lord and to the church, but it is very difficult for them to submit to their husbands
When the Lord Jesus came out to minister at thirty years of age, He first went to John the Baptist to be buried through baptism
Even the Lord Jesus, who was holy, pure, sinless, and perfect, had to die and be buried before touching God's ministry
When the Lord came out to touch the ministry of God, the first thing He did was to hand Himself over to die and be buried in baptism
Immediately after He went up from the water, the heavens were opened to Him, the Spirit descended upon Him, and the Father spoke
Eventually, at the end of the three and a half years of His ministry, He walked to the cross to die physically
Now the Spirit of God has been compounded, as typified by the compounding of the holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30:22-33
These spices signify, respectively, Christ's death, the sweetness of His death, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection
In resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit, and His death and resurrection were compounded into the Spirit
When we take in such a drink, we receive not only the water but also all the other ingredients along with their benefits
When we drink the Spirit today, we receive not only the Spirit but also the death and the resurrection of Christ
These elements have been mingled into the compound Spirit, who is the life-giving Spirit, the resurrected Christ
Today the Spirit who indwells our spirit is a killing One because He has been compounded with the death of Christ and its effectiveness
Immediately after calling on the Lord, we may sense that we have been wrong in our conduct or attitude toward our husband or wife
When we are wrong, rather than hearing an admonishing or rebuking word from someone, we simply need to call, 'O Lord Jesus'
A medical doctor who knows that his patient is sick from certain germs will be at peace once he has given his patient the right antibiotic
There is not much recorded of the Lord's first thirty years on the earth, but we have the full record of His last three and a half years
In order to shepherd the saints or be a good elder, brother, sister, husband, wife, father, or mother, we do not need to learn certain steps
For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh
The Christ who said that He is the way constantly lived under death throughout the three and a half years of His earthly ministry
God met with His people from above the Ark, and the sinners came to the incense altar facing the Ark to hear God speak
In the Holy Place on the north side was the table of the bread of the Presence, and on the south side was the lampstand
Outside the Holy Place in the outer court was the laver , and before the laver was the altar of burnt offering , which signifies the cross
When we, as unbelievers, were in the world, we were outside the realm of God's grace, outside the realm of the cross
From there we went to the table of the bread of the Presence to receive nourishment and to the lampstand to receive light
According to the arrangement of the tabernacle as soon as we enter into the realm of the Christian life we are being conformed to the cross
Christ carried out God's eternal purpose not as the Son of God but as the Son of Man, because God's purpose concerns humanity
God also needed a man to defeat Satan, who was created by God to be the archangel but who rebelled and became God's enemy
When Christ came, the devil knew that Christ was the Son of God coming as the Son of Man in order to bruise the head of the serpent
Because Christ carried out God's eternal purpose and defeated God's enemy as a man, He is fully qualified to be Head over all things
If we do not realize that Christ is our Head and practice the headship of Christ, it is difficult to take Him as our life
The headship of Christ is a crucial matter that affects our personal life, family life, daily life, and church life
In most cases, when a saint comes to a brother asking for fellowship, the brother will immediately begin to give his opinion
Brothers in such a situation need to realize that neither one of them is the head but that Christ is the unique Head
The brother initiating the fellowship should say, 'Brother, we need to consider this matter under the headship of Christ'
On the other hand, if the sister answers before checking with her husband, she disregards his headship, for it is as if she has no head
When a brother comes to us for fellowship, we insult the headship of Christ if we propose anything to the brother
If we realize that the Lord is the unique Head of the brother, we will only help the brother to realize the headship of Christ
When we regard Christ as our Head, we give Him the position as the Head, and we are rightly positioned to learn His will
We are short of the experience of Christ simply because our position is not proper as a result of our not regarding Christ as our Head
To change our position, we need to see our shortcoming and declare to the Lord that we recognize and take Him as our Head
If we make a decision without checking with the Lord, we assume the headship and insult the headship of Christ
If we are clear that Christ is our Head, we will see that we do not have the right to make any decision, even to buy a pair of shoes
1 Peter 5:3, a word to the elders, says, 'Nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock'
The eldership in the church is absolutely another kind of leadership, one which worldly people cannot understand
The elders are not the leaders but simply the leading ones, those who take the lead to be an example in everything
In the Old Testament God ordained that there be one king at a time among His people, such as David and then Solomon
Acts 21:18 also proves that eventually James, not Peter, was the leading one among the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem
The plurality of the apostles and of the elders indicates that in the New Testament God preserves the headship absolutely for Christ
According to God's economy, there is no official, permanent, definite, or organizational leadership among His people
In Paul's list of the functions in the church in 1 Corinthians 12:28, he mentions helps and then administrations
The eldership in the church is not a kind of leadership; it is simply to take the lead among the saints to set up an example
There being no official permanent or unique leading one among the apostles or elders in the New Testament means that there was no hierarchy
Just as we should not consider any church to be the head church, neither should we consider any man to be the leader of the Lord's recovery
If all the saints know and practice the truth, no one will have the freedom to claim to be a leader in the Lord's recovery
Difficult, trying situations arise among the churches mainly due to our attention deviating from Christ, the center of God's economy
The enemy instead uses things that are apparently good and even seemingly for God's interests yet are not Christ Himself
We may begin to talk much about this matter and at some point make a decision concerning how we will carry something out
The churches in the Lord's recovery will be in peace and harmony as long as we stay on the central lane of Christ as life
Colossians 1:12 says, 'Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light'
The father told the servants, 'Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet'
By putting these three things on his son, the father qualified him to enter into the house to partake of the feast
The way to close the gate to different opinions is to drop our concepts and come back to Christ to enjoy Him as our unique portion from God
To cohere in Christ means to subsist together in Him, much like the spokes of a wheel are held together by a hub
In order for the harmony to be kept among the churches, the saints must never neglect Christ as the holding center
When we do not pay sufficient attention to Christ, the door is open for many problems to come into the church life
We must not be distracted by seemingly good things such as trying to find a way to gain a great increase or have fully released meetings
He is the image of the invisible God the Firstborn of all creation and the One in whom all things were created and in whom all things cohere
We should reject any kind of organization, which leads to hierarchy and therefore insults the headship of Christ
According to the New Testament, there is no permanent, official, or organizational leader among the elders or apostles
As branches in the vine, if we simply live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ, fruit will spontaneously come forth from the life within
If we argue with our spouse just before attending a meeting, anything we do to function in the meeting will be a performance
In Christ are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and He is the reality of every positive thing in the universe
As the unique constituent of the church, Christ should saturate our entire being as our life, nature, and person
Through wires electricity is transmitted from the power plant into buildings that may be hundreds of miles away
The Bible is not an ordinary book, for the word in the Bible is the embodiment of God, Christ, the Spirit, and life
Because the word in the Bible embodies God, Christ, the Spirit, and life, we Christians need to come to the Bible daily and even hourly
We all find time to eat every day, no matter how sloppy, lazy, or loose we may be, because we realize that eating is a life necessity
Without legalities, it is impossible to have a strong family, school, corporation, government, nation, or military force
In addition to praying over a few verses each morning to be nourished, later in the day we should try to read a few chapters
Receiving Christ is not merely a doctrinal matter; it becomes practical when we receive the word in the Bible and touch the Spirit
We need to receive Christ several times each day by the unique way of receiving the word and touching the Spirit
After entering into our body our food is processed through metabolism which includes catabolism a breaking down and anabolism a building up
These same three elements may be used to prepare many different dishes, such as Chinese dumplings and Italian spaghetti
Whether we read histories, parables, prophecies, exhortations, psalms, or proverbs, we receive Christ, His death, and His resurrection
In every portion in the Bible the basic elements are Christ, the killing of His death, and the power of His resurrection
The killing of Christ's death and the building up of His resurrection received through the word produce in us a healthy spiritual metabolism
Eating, drinking, breathing, and sleeping are not special activities but legalities, or necessities, of our daily living
To bear fruit in this way is possible for every believer, and this way is more effective than large gospel meetings
If an ordinary believer simply lives Christ, many of the ones he or she knows will eventually turn to the Lord
When gimmicks come into our gospel preaching, the result is different opinions, concepts, and eventually disputation
After a church grows normally for a few years, a small group of saints may spontaneously move to a nearby city and raise up a church there
Those who know the truth and have the necessary measure of life will spontaneously take the lead in the new church
To organizationally transfer saints to different localities is altogether against the truth and against the principle of the Body
What is important in a family, as in a local church, is not outward qualifications or gifts but love, life, and harmony
Transferring members between two different families to try to balance the situation will only damage both families
In the Lord's recovery there is no unification, competition, or rivalry, but only harmony, love, and fellowship
Living Christ in a peaceful way in our daily life is our living testimony of the Lord Jesus and is the proper church life
As we share with those whom the Lord brings to us, some will turn to the Lord and be brought into the church life
We need to drop our concepts, activities, aggressiveness, and passivity and simply live Christ, pray, and fellowship together
What we need today is not forms, activities, movements, organization, vain doctrines, or empty knowledge but only life and truth
In the church life we need to pay our full attention to life and truth, or reality, which are both Christ Himself
It is clear from these cases that truth in New Testament usage means not doctrines or principles but reality, actual fact
In John 1:29, when John the Baptist saw Jesus, he said, 'Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world'!
The fulfillment of the type of the tabernacle is revealed in John 1:14, which says, 'The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us'
In His incarnation Christ took one step to become a man, and in His resurrection He took another step to become the Spirit
Among Christians, different practices related to baptism come from different understandings of the doctrine of baptism
Regardless of the outward forms of baptism, the reality of baptism is being put into the death and resurrection of Christ
Even after much biblical and historical study, it is impossible to reach a definite conclusion on some of these issues
The separation of the body and the blood, signified by the separation of the bread and the cup, displays the death of Christ
Resurrection is seen in the loaf for a loaf is not one grain of wheat but many grains produced in resurrection and blended together into one
At the Lord's table we are participating in the Body under Christ as the Head, and we are realizing His death and resurrection
Everyone in the church, including the sisters, the young ones, and the new ones, should know and bear the truth
We all need to know the truth of matters such as reconciliation, justification, sanctification, renewing, transformation, and conformation
The young saints may sing and release their spirit in the meetings, but if no truth is taught in the meetings, the release is vain
A Norwegian missionary named Marie Monsen came to his city preaching not doctrine but the reality of regeneration
After giving a message, she asked this pastor in front of several members of his congregation if he had been regenerated
When he returned the next day and gave his testimony, a genuine revival began and hundreds more experienced regeneration
We should know the doctrines and also experience the reality by the enjoyment of Christ as the life-giving Spirit
We need to spend much time reading the Word, first to receive nourishment, and second to gain knowledge of the doctrines
The light needed to see the truth may come to us days, months, or even years after we read a portion of the Word
When we read the Bible, we may find several key verses concerning a certain matter, such as holiness and sanctification
We will not only know the doctrine of holiness and sanctification, but we will also see the reality of these matters
If we are open, the life-giving Spirit will have the opportunity to work something of what the Lord has shown us into our being
To see the reality, we first need to spend time in the Word to be nourished and to become familiar with the doctrines of the Bible
May the Lord have mercy upon us all and grant us the sufficient grace to have the proper practice to be filled with life and truth
