   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Out of Many Folds into One Flock</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 16 the Lord Jesus said, "And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Outside the Jewish religion God has other sheep the Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God has His chosen people among the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They, as well as those in Judaism, are His sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord brings these two groups of sheep not into one fold but into one flock.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Judaism is a fold, and today nearly all of the denominations also are folds.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today the Lord Jesus is the door, not for us to go into the heavens but for us to get out of the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus is the door out of the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church, however, is not a fold.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church is not a place; the church is a living Body, a living collection of the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, the church is the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The flock needs the fold at nighttime, in the wintertime, or during a storm.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At such times the flock needs a shelter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That is the function of the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in the daytime, in the springtime, or in a peaceful time, the flock does not stay in the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During such times the flock goes out of the fold and into the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The pasture is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is both the door and the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is the door for us to leave the fold to enjoy the pasture, which is also Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Are you in the night, in the wintertime, or in a stormy time?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today I can testify that I am not in the night; I am in the day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am not in the wintertime; I am in the springtime.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, I do not need any fold.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jesus was my door, and I have come out of the fold by Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now I am in the pasture feeding on Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a picture of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church is not a fold; the church is a flock.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This flock is in the pasture feeding on and masticating the tender grass.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every meeting of a local church is a feeding on the green and tender grass.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are in the pasture, not in a classroom or in a fold.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we remain in the folds, how can we be one?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In John 10:16 the Lord Jesus said that He had other sheep which were not of that fold.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that in addition to the fold of Judaism there were other folds.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are many folds, but the flock is one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today I am not in the fold; I am in the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Where are you?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you are in the fold, you are divided from me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some may turn this charge to me and say, "No, you are divided from me."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I may be divided from you, but it is because I am in the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be separate from others by being in the pasture is right, but to be divided from others by being in the folds is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are in one of the folds, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are in the pasture, we are right.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Oneness By Life</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How can we be one?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>John 10:10 says, "I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord Jesus did not say that He came that they might have knowledge, teachings, speaking in tongues, the gift of healing, or all the other gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He said, "I have come that they may have life."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the oldness of Judaism, there were many things, including the law, letters, doctrines, knowledge, and the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But in John 10, Jesus is so simple; with Him there is only life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can be one only by the life of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we try to be one by the law, you may be for the first commandment, and I may be for the second commandment; another brother may be for the third commandment, and still another brother may be for the fourth commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If there are ten brothers, we may all be divided into ten individual groups because we all have different opinions about the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Jesus, however, how many lives are there?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is only one life in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is impossible to be one by the Ten Commandments, doctrines, or teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The more we get into the law, the teachings, or the commandments, the more we are divided.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The more we are in the life of Jesus, however, the more we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the life of Jesus, there are no opinions, but if we care for anything other than life, we will be divided and divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>According to the context of John 10, the way to be one flock is by Christ being life to us.</S>
