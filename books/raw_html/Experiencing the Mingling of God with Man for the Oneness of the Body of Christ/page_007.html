 <h2 class="head1">BECOMING ONE BY BEING BROKEN</h2>
<p>In the Gospel of John there is not only the matter of life but also the matter of oneness. After doing so many things on the earth, the Lord prayed to the Father that all the believers would be one in Him. In John 17 He prayed, &ldquo;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me&rdquo; (vv. 21-23). The many grains in chapter 12 and the branches in chapter 15 are equal to the bride as the increase of Christ in chapter 3 (vv. 29-30). However, the increase of Christ, though it consists of all the believers as the many grains and the many branches, is one, not many (Rom. 12:5). There is only one Body for the Head and only one bride for the Bridegroom. Christ has only one increase, but this one increase consists of all the believers, signified by the many grains and the many branches. Thus, we as individuals are not the increase of Christ but only parts of the increase of Christ.</p>
<p>We as the many grains must become a loaf (1 Cor. 10:17), and the only way we can become a loaf is by being ground and crushed. Otherwise, we cannot be one with others. To produce a loaf of bread, you must grind and crush the grain into flour, mix the flour with water, and bake it. In a similar way, for us as the many grains to be one, we must be broken. Without being broken, there can be no oneness, because in ourselves we are too whole, too perfect. We may be so perfect that we are independent and are unable to be joined with others. Thus, we must be broken. The lesson of brokenness, which is the lesson of the cross, is a serious lesson that we must learn. As perfect, independent saints, we cannot be built up and knit with others. We must be broken so that we would never be perfect in an individual way again. Once a grain is ground and crushed, it can never be perfect again. If we determine to keep our perfection, we will always be independent, and we will never be built up with others as part of the loaf. Thus, we must be broken. This should not be a mere doctrine to us; this should be our practice. We should test ourselves and prove whether we are part of the loaf or still one grain among many grains.</p>
<p>In John 17 the Lord offered a prayer for oneness. The Lord prayed that the Father would do something so that all the grains might be one. He did not pray merely for unity, for the grains to be united, but for oneness, for the grains to be one. In a loaf the grains are not merely united; they become one loaf. This oneness is the Body, the bride, the holy city, and the dwelling place of God. Until this oneness comes into being, there is no way for God to do anything. Today many Christians are praying that they would know the will of God so that they would know what to do in certain situations. However, the will of God cannot be accomplished unless there is this oneness among the saints as the dwelling place of God. We must realize the need for life and oneness. We must stop all our doing and working and instead abide in Christ, keep ourselves in contact with Christ, and learn the lesson of the cross in order to be one with the saints. Then we will have the oneness as the dwelling place of God, and God will be able to accomplish His will.</p>
<p>We must consider these two matters of life and oneness. God&rsquo;s intention is not that we would do anything, because we could never do anything that would be pleasing to God. His intention is that we would take Christ as our life in a practical way. Thus, on the one hand, we need to stop ourselves from trying to do good and always keep ourselves in contact with Christ. On the other hand, we need to learn the lesson of brokenness in order to be one with all the other saints and to be the real expression of Christ as the Body of Christ. Then the Lord will have the ground and the opportunity to do whatever He desires. This is what the Lord is seeking after today.</p>
