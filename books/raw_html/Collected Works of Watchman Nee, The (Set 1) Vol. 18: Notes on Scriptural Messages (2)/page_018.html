<P>Mephibosheth's heart was a widow's heart. Since the king was not there, he lost his heart for everything. A very deep believer once said, "Wherever Jesus is, there is heaven. If Jesus is in hell, then hell is heaven too. If Jesus is not in heaven, then it is not heaven." At that time I thought that there could not be such a thing. But today I want to say that this is true. In the beginning all we thought about was the problem of sins, but now all we think about is the Lord Jesus. Formerly our thoughts were on being delivered from the punishment of hell, but now we think about the Lord Himself. Therefore, if the Lord is in heaven, heaven is lovely, but if the Lord is in hell, even hell will be lovely.</P><P>This world is nothing but a wilderness. What is a wilderness? It is desolation. This does not mean that the beauty, art, and natural scenery of the world are not good. But all these mean nothing to us anymore because He is not here. How can we love the world when it looks down on the Lord Jesus? I have said before that wherever our lover is, there is the land of joy. The house, clothes, food, and drink may be the same, but if our beloved is not there, all of these things will seem different. My hometown is Foochow. I have often thought about going back to it. However, it is not Foochow that I miss, but the brothers and sisters who are of the same mind there. They suffered difficulties and poverty together with me, and they also were opposed by other people. I could forget Foochow easily if they were not there. The same is true with the world. We cannot find rest and happiness in this world. The only attitude we should have toward the world is that of a widow.</P><P>When Mephibosheth came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, "Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth? And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame. And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes. For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?" (vv. 25-28). Here we see that he did not mention anything about the bread and wine. He only mentioned that he was deceived. His heart felt that it was sufficient that the king had returned peacefully; it really did not matter that much about being slandered.</P><P>If a person wants to express his heart, he does not necessarily have to use words. If someone has become a slave of the Lord's love, he will not be able to express his heart with words. The deeper the love, the more secretive it becomes. If you really love the Lord, you will still keep yourself pure when others are opposing Him. On the day we meet the Lord, we will not tell Him, "Lord, such have I given up for You on earth." On that day you will not say anything about yourself. You will say, "I regret that while living on earth, I did not love You more deeply and did not serve You more faithfully." At that time you will feel that even if you have a million words to offer to the Lord, it would still not be enough.</P><P>Mephibosheth did not say anything else, other than of his being deceived by his servant. There was only one thing in his heart: it is good enough that David my king has returned; being slandered does not mean that much. As long as I can sit at David's table, that is good enough. I do not need to say anything more about being slandered, nor do I need to vindicate myself. As long as the king has returned, that is enough.</P><P>"And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land. And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house" (vv. 29-30). Every time when I read this word of Mephibosheth, I say, Amen! If the King can come back in peace, what does it matter if I gain or lose? If my Lord has gained something, even if I lose something, what does it matter? All that matters is whether He is safe or not; it does not matter if the things He gives still exist.</P><P>Job said, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him" (Job 13:15). One martyred saint said on the night before he was going to be executed, "God, if You do not come in and interfere, tomorrow I will go blindly just as I am, come heaven or hell." This was a hero of faith. The Lord will not wrong us. But even if He ill-treats us, we should delight in His ill-treatment. As long as He is pleased, and as long as it is according to His heart's desire, we will feel sweet even when we are ill-treated.</P><P>Of course, the way David handled Mephibosheth was wrong, but our Lord will not do so to us. By being wronged, Mephibosheth's heart was clearly revealed. "Let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house." The Lord wants to save us to the extent that we care only for the Lord's gain or loss and not for our gain or loss. God's gain or loss is what matters. Our own gain or loss matters nothing. Once I needed to obey the Lord, yet I could not do it. Finally, I had to tell the Lord, "Do not give in, please allow me to give in." We ought to give in, not God. The One who once captured my heart has captured it forever. Since my heart had been captured by Him, all that I have is His. Brothers and sisters, what is our hope and expectation before the Lord? Are we still making plans for ourselves, or are we for Him? From now on may we regard all that we have as His and only care about His gain or loss. As long as He gains something, that is good enough.</P>
