   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>For the Heading Up of All Things in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>through the Church as the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s New Testament economy is for the heading up of all things in Christ through the church as the Body of Christ Eph 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we meet we are taking step after step to lead all the created things toward one direction, that is, to be headed up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do we have such a consideration when we come into a Christian meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our meeting today directs us toward the goal of all things being headed up in our Head, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>While we are singing, praising, and testifying, we declare that we are taking the lead as the firstfruit of His creatures James 1:18 to lead all the creatures to the point of everything being headed up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today the whole universe is in disorder and chaos, with no heading up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But one day the church will bring all the created things to one direction, that is, to the heading up of all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we repeat the following sentence five times, we will be different persons: the Christian meeting takes the lead to bring everything to the direction of all things being headed up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is very difficult for a young lady, after being married, to submit herself to her husband, taking the male as her head.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Quite often the wives may argue with their husbands and say, Why do you have to be over me?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They may not know the answer, but we know the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God created us this way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul tells us that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God 1 Cor 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Between the wife and the husband, one must be the first.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No one can change God s invention.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the sisters should say amen to their subjection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But today in the whole universe there is no such amen in God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is waiting to lead all His creatures into such a subjection through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our meeting have we been led into such a subjection to have all of us headed up in our Head, Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By His mercy and grace, we all have to say, Yes!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Are you dear saints who are the members of the church in your locality headed up in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you say yes, how do you express your being headed up?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We express this by our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Look at our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our Christian meeting is a meeting altogether headed up into our Head, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every time we meet, we must have a clear understanding that our meeting today is linked to the heading up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The day will come when the entire universe is the same as our meeting today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our meeting is a model, a miniature, of that day when all the created things in this universe are headed up in Christ for the believers universal meeting in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our Christian meeting is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It testifies and declares that we are taking the lead in all of God s creation to reach the goal of the heading up of all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE WAY TO HAVE THE CHURCH MEETINGS The Church Being Redeemed</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>by the Death of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to have the church meetings, we must first see that the church has been redeemed by the death of Christ Eph 5:25b; Acts 20:28b .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church is a group of extraordinary, peculiar people Titus 2:14 , a people privately possessed by God as His peculiar treasure Exo 19:5 , His own possession 1 Pet 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have been redeemed but the worldly people have not.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be redeemed is a particular characteristic of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are the redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Church Being Produced</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>in the Resurrection of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As descendants of Adam, we were born in our natural birth into Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But as the church, we all have been produced in the resurrection of Christ 1 Pet 1:3; Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are now a group of people in resurrection, not in our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have been redeemed and produced.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the resurrection of Christ, we are no longer merely the descendants, the sons, of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Christ s resurrection, we believers have been made the sons of God Rom 8:29; Heb 2:10a .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This changes our nature, our being, our status, and our position.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are not merely the sons of man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today we are the sons of God, not according to our natural birth but in the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are a group of resurrected people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are the descendants of God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Body of Christ is not composed of different races such as American or Chinese, but it is an aggregate of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every time we meet, we need to remember that we are coming to meet as sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then we will begin our meeting with the sonship in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In some so-called Christian meetings, people were fighting with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I heard of one meeting where a person threw his Bible at someone.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They were fighting because they were meeting there not only as the sons of Adam but also as the sons of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need a vision that we are meeting as the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today we have God as our Father with His life and nature, just as Christ has John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When Christ was walking on this earth, He was walking as one who had God the Father in Him, with His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thus, whatever He did was a manifestation of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Whenever He spoke, He spoke out God the Father John 14:10, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must come to the meeting with such an understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are coming to the meeting as sons of God, having God the Father with His life and with His nature; therefore, whatever we do in the meeting should express our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some brothers may have quarreled with one another in some meetings because they forgot that they were meeting as sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They forgot their status.</S>
