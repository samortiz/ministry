 <h2 class="head1">CARING FOR THE NEW BELIEVERS<br />
WITH DISCERNMENT AND WISDOM</h2>
<p>According to our experience in Taipei, the newly baptized believers were of different kinds. Some did not like to read much, while others were very good readers who would receive any kind of book. What you do with them must be based upon your discernment and realization. To visit the home meetings you must exercise with much wisdom. In Colossians 1:28 Paul says, &ldquo;Whom we announce, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ.&rdquo; We need the wisdom. The longer you stay with a new one, the better, but you need to exercise your discernment as to whether that person is one who likes people to stay with him. If you realize that a certain one is this kind of person and he invites you to stay after his baptism to eat with him, do not reject his offer but stay there in faith for dinner. However, in your discernment you may realize that another person would not like to have a guest stay longer than one hour. In that case, do your best to finish within one hour. Do not spoil their taste. Your activity and action should be based upon their disposition and how much they can receive. Do not forget that this may be the first time for them to contact Christians. They do not know much about Christian things, so do not give them a negative, disappointing impression. Rather, in everything you do in your contact with them, give them a very positive impression that would not bother them or spoil them.</p>
<p>This requires our practice. In the use of medicine, doctors take care of the health and condition of their patients. Do not be negligent or careless. You must learn how to discern your patient. We should consider all the new ones as our patients and ourselves as the doctors going to care for them. We must exercise our wisdom to discover the real situation.</p>
<p>What books or other publications you give to the new ones also depends upon their condition, your knowledge, and whether or not you have that book. For this reason you must know the <em>Life Lessons,</em> the <em>Truth Lessons,</em> the Life-study Messages, and our other books. It is better to go to the new ones with these publications; then when you discover what their need is, perhaps after five minutes of contact, you will have all the right &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; with you. You can dispense the right medicine for the right sickness with the proper dosage according to their health.</p>
<p>We also need to be like a teacher in a school who presents things to the students according to their level. A first grade teacher presents mathematics to a certain degree and extent. A second grade teacher gives the pupils something further. When one teaches higher grades, he still teaches mathematics, but his teaching has come up to a higher level. The teaching will be according to the pupils&rsquo; grade. This way of teaching is needed with the new ones.</p>
<p>Do not say that since you are not &ldquo;professionals&rdquo; you cannot do this. We all like to be healthy, so we are learning what to eat. There is much learning to do even in the matter of eating. My wife is learning about healthy food and how to cook, and I am learning of her how to eat. She may cook properly, but if I eat improperly, this will spoil her cooking. Therefore the two of us must match in our learning. This is an illustration of how we must learn to care for others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE NEW WAY FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>We should mean business for the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there is a need. Christianity has proven that their old way is not workable. The Southern Baptist denomination, which has had annual increases in membership since 1926, recorded a gain of only seven-tenths of a percent from 1986 to 1987. We could not survive if we only had this much increase; we would die out. We need at least thirty percent increase in order to survive to do something for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Without new people, what can we do? We have the best teachings and the healthy food, and everything is so excellent, but without new people, we are finished. Look at our situation. It is not dying, but the low rate of increase is bothersome. The old way will not work. How could we trust in the old way? We must change to a new way. We must come back to find the God-ordained way revealed in the holy Word, and we have found this way in the past three and a half years. What we have been speaking in this period of time is altogether biblical and according to God&rsquo;s heart and will.</p>
<p>The first step in this way is to visit people for gospel preaching. Many verses in the Bible tell us that we have to go to people. &ldquo;How beautiful are the feet of those who announce glad tidings of good things!&rdquo; (Rom. 10:15). It is a shame that we have been here for years yet have not knocked on so many doors. Many people are living around us. The &ldquo;fish pond&rdquo; is right before us, but we have not fished. Rather, we invite the fish to come to us; this is ridiculous. We must drop the old way.</p>
<p>All the home meetings should be considered as church meetings. We must meet in the homes regularly. We must reconsecrate ourselves for this. In this consecration we should promise the Lord that every week we will separate and sanctify at least one evening, preferably two, for the Lord&rsquo;s move. Every week we should spend two evenings, two and a half hours each, for the Lord&rsquo;s move. First, we go out to knock on doors to gain the people; then we continue to visit them for their home meetings. I have the assurance that this way is workable. We will gain people and we will have remaining fruit. We may have a onefold increase yearly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DISPENSING THE LORD JESUS THROUGH THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>We must do the gospel work without analyzing, like a farmer sowing seed. For a farmer to try to determine what will grow and what will not grow means nothing. He must simply till the ground, water the plants, and let them grow. Some will grow very well, while others will not grow well. In the parable of the sower in Matthew 13, the first sowing was in vain, the second group of seeds did not have deep root, and the third group of seeds was choked by the thorns. Only the last seeds, one-fourth of those sown, grew well. We do not know which will grow. Experts tell us that before wheat and tares blossom, no one can tell them apart. The two look very much alike in stature, color, and shape until they blossom, the wheat with golden yellow fruit and the tares with black fruit.</p>
<p>Today we cannot say what will happen. We must simply do what we should according to the Lord&rsquo;s word. He says, &ldquo;Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all the creation&rdquo; (Mark 16:15), and we go. He says, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19), and we do it. He says, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved&rdquo; (Mark 16:16), and we do our duty to help people to believe and be baptized. We do not care who is who. Our goal is simply to dispense the Lord Jesus through the gospel to all people. What will come out is not in our hands. It is in His hand. We simply do it.</p>
<p>The earth is full of &ldquo;fish.&rdquo; Whether you use your time to take care of a hesitating one depends on how much time you have. If one is hesitating, why do you have to spend your time on him? Go to other fish. Some fish are jumping into the boat. Why would you not rather take care of this kind of fish? Do not analyze how to work with the hesitating ones. Let them stay where they are. Farmers do not sow seed into soil when they know that it does not grow anything. There are many people on this earth today. Go to others who are not hesitating.</p>
