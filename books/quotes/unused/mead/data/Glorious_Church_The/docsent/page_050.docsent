   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let us further illustrate by relating a certain event.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There were two sisters who were engaged in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One day they came to a certain village and stayed for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A woman who was possessed of a demon was there, and a member of her family invited the two sisters to go to her home to cast out the demon.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After praying, they felt that they should go.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When they arrived, they saw that the woman was properly dressed and that everything was in good order.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They wondered if the woman was really demon-possessed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then they preached to her, and she seemed to be quite clear.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually demons cannot be clear, but they pretend to be.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The two sisters felt very strange about the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They asked the woman, "Do you believe in the Lord Jesus?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>She answered, "I have believed for many years."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Upon this reply, the two sisters were really confused; they did not know what to make of the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then they asked her, "Do you know who Jesus is?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She said, "If you want to know who Jesus is, come and see."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then she led them from the front room to a room at the rear of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Pointing to an idol, she said, "This is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have believed in him for many years."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then one of the sisters felt that she must give a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please note that what she said is the kind of testimony that we are talking about here.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The sister grasped the woman's hand and said not to the woman, but to the demon , "Do you remember that more than nineteen hundred years ago the Son of God came from heaven to become a man for thirty-three and a half years?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He cast out demons like you many times.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do you remember that you desired to attack and harm Him?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You and all of yours rose up to kill Him and nail Him to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You were very happy at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You did not know that He would rise from the dead after three days and break all your power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You are but a wicked spirit under the hand of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you remember that when the Son of God came out from Hades, God announced from heaven to all living creatures and to all spirits, 'The name of Jesus henceforth is above every name.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever His name is mentioned, every tongue must confess and every knee must bow.'</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So I command you in the name of Jesus to come out from her!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the sister made this proclamation, the demon cast the woman to the floor and left.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The sister's question, "Do you remember?" is of utmost significance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Her repeated urging of that question was her testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we preach to Satan, he also can preach, and he can do quite a bit of it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we reason with him, he has all kinds of reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if we speak the facts, especially the spiritual facts, Satan will be helpless.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must know the facts in the Scriptures and believe them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must be covered by the blood so that God may protect us from all the attacks of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we may speak to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Satan fears when we speak the word of testimony to him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In our Christian experience, we sometimes feel so weak that we cannot even pray to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At such a time we must remember the spiritual facts, the victorious facts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must proclaim to Satan and his demons that the Lord Jesus is victorious and that Jesus is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such a proclamation is the testimony, and the testimony is the proclamation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What do we proclaim?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We proclaim that Jesus is Lord, that the Lord is victorious, that Satan has been trodden under His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We further proclaim that the Lord has given us authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the word of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The word of testimony causes Satan to lose his ground.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we give the word of testimony, we give Satan a blow.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The work of the Lord has not only given us the blood to protect us, but also the word of testimony by which we can defeat Satan.</S>
