   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Coordination of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The brothers and sisters must be led to know that they themselves are the members and that they are fellow members with other saints in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is different from their being in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the house of God, you yourself are a single unit, because you are a brother or a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in the Body of Christ, you cannot be isolated; you cannot become a unit, for you are just a member.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A child in a family may go away for three months.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He may not be able to live properly, but he can survive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But can your eyes go away for three months?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suppose your eyes say that they do not like to be in the body, in the same way that children say that they do not like to stay at home.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is impossible for your eyes to go away for three seconds, much less three months.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once a member goes away from the body, it is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to show the brothers and sisters that we are members, and that we cannot be isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, we have to learn to coordinate with others and to be members one of another.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Feeling of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The feeling of the Body is a very fine feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is a feeling that comes from the operation of the Holy Spirit in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In our physical body there are the nerve fibers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the feelings in the body are derived from the nerve fibers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once the nerve fibers are cut off, the feelings will be stopped and gone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Holy Spirit is the nerve fiber in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more we give the Holy Spirit the ground, the more sensitive will the feeling of the Body become.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>e. The Living in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The living in the Body means to bring the brothers and sisters to live in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A person should not be individualistic in his work and his service.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But even more, he should not be individualistic in his living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has to keep the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not only do we work and serve with the brothers and sisters in coordination, but we live in coordination as well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you can do a good job in both aspects, the knowledge of the church and the knowledge of the Body, the church where you are will be a built-up habitation to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To Christ, it will be a coordinated Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, you will have made the brothers and sisters the habitation of God and the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of course, this requires much time for such a management.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let me repeat.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not so simple a thing to manage a church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You have to learn everything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, if you want to manage a home, not only do you have to learn to wash your clothes and cook your meals; strictly speaking, you even have to learn the way to put flowers in a vase.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes we spend a considerable amount of money to buy some flowers, only to arrange them in a disorderly way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moreover, we do not know how to keep them alive, and in two days they all wilt.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But a person who has learned to arrange flowers will need to spend only a little money for flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They may not even need to spend any money, but cut some flowers from their yard and arrange them in a vase, and the flowers will look quite nice and will stay alive for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Never think that anybody can arrange some flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Never think that anybody can manage a church either.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No, there is a difference between one kind of managing and another kind of managing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are too many things to learn here.</S>
