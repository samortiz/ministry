   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Taking Control of the Spirit That Is upon Us</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit that is poured out upon us is not personified.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, 1 Corinthians 12:13 mentions being baptized into one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This Spirit is compared to water and therefore is not personified.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This Spirit is subject to us 1 Cor 14:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the Spirit that dwells within us is personified, and we have to come under His subjection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit that is upon us submits to us, and we can direct Him to stay or go away.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We also determine whether we want much or a little of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, the Spirit that dwells within us is personified, and we have to submit ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the eyes of God, the Spirit that is upon us is like an element.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are not careful, Satan can come in and counterfeit it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Pentecostal people err in that they are taken over by the spirit that is upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why there is confusion among them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot follow their way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to obey the Spirit who is within us, but we have to take control of the Spirit that is upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whether at home or in the meetings, we have to learn to take control of the Spirit that is upon us in seeking for the outpouring.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE APPLICATION OF THE OUTPOURING</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are two things we should know about the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, if we have never passed the gate of victory, such an outpouring will not be of much help in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a man has received the outpouring of the Spirit but has never passed the gate of victory, his experience of the Spirit will diminish after a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He will be like a punctured bicycle tire, and he will not be able to go very far.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He will have to seek for the Spirit once again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whenever he becomes cold, he has to seek the outpouring once more.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the initial condition of outpouring in a man who has never passed the gate of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After one has received the outpouring of the Spirit, he should immediately apply the power that accompanies the outpouring to help other Christians or to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Prior to this, he might have been powerless to preach the gospel or to help other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But after he has received the outpouring, he should immediately apply this power to the preaching of the gospel and the edification of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If he does not apply this power, he will, in essence, be burying his one talent in the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As soon as a person has received the power of the Spirit, he has to preach the gospel and be an overcomer in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The failure of some of the Pentecostal people lies in the fact that they have made the outpouring of the Spirit into a kind of entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After some receive the outpouring, they speak in tongues or laugh ecstatically.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, they then go home and do not apply any of the power they have received.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is like a man with a healthy body doing nothing but playing ball for eight hours a day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such a life is not normal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The outpouring of the Spirit is not for our entertainment, but for us to live and work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Moreover, as soon as one receives the outpouring of the Spirit, he should immediately pray for the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Suppose a person has never had the experience of the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When it happens, he should immediately ask God for the gifts also.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He should ask God for whatever grace he desires to have.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After a man has received the outpouring, he can even be a little greedy in what he asks from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course, one cannot make the outpouring a matter of boast, and he should not brag to others about it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rather, he should allow God's grace and power to be manifested through him and His glory to shine through him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>TESTIFYING OF THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You should pay attention to a few things when testifying about the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First, if you have the experience of the outpouring and someone asks about it, you should not tell him the details of your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In testifying to others of your experience of the outpouring, you have to follow a few principles:</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First, you should not discuss the details of your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the New Testament, the book of Acts records many manifestations of the outpouring of the Spirit, such as speaking in tongues and being empowered for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But we are not told the details of these experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those who received the outpouring only testified in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They never said anything about the details.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Pentecostals often go into great length about the details of their experience of the outpouring, and this often leads to confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Second, you should not overemphasize the experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many of those seeking for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit are inquisitive.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Someone else's experience of the outpouring will not help them at all.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In telling others about your experience, it is easy for them to take your experience as the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In actuality, however, the manifestations of the outpouring are different in different people.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is why you must not overemphasize your own experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is another point worth noting: Pentecostal people receive the outpouring of the Spirit by "seeking," whereas we receive it by "believing."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We believe that Jesus of Nazareth has been exalted by God to be both Lord and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He has sat down on the throne, and He has poured out His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We believe and accept these facts.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The outpouring of the Spirit is for the purpose of bearing witness to the exaltation of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is not for the purpose of proving that God has heard our prayers or that He has accepted our plea.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The outpouring of the Spirit is strictly linked to the exaltation of the Lord Jesus; it is not linked to our prayers or our good works.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have to uplift the Lord rather than ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to give glory to Him rather than to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have to boast in the Lord, rather than in ourselves.</S>
