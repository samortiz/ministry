   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR LEADERSHIP NOT LEADERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The most difficult aspect of the group meeting is the matter of leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We do not need any leader in the group meeting, but there is the need for leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all must learn to take care of the meeting yet not have the thought that we are leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the home the mother does not consider herself as a leader, yet she realizes that she needs to take care of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the mother is gone, the older children spontaneously pick up the responsibility to take care of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When one of us goes to a group meeting, he should not consider himself as a leader; he should not consider himself as being better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, he must feel that he has the responsibility to take care of that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Someone may ask, "Suppose fifteen come together, and each one has the feeling that he has to take care of that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Wouldn't there be too many leaders?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not at all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I would like to see fifteen come together and there be fifteen leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This would be marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that every saint is bearing the responsibility for that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are not only functioning in the meeting but also bearing the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How much someone can do in bearing a meeting depends upon the capacity that the Lord has measured to him, but as long as he has such a burden, he will surely do his best to serve the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whatever he has and whatever he can do according to his capacity will be poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then the meeting will be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not say to yourself, "I am not the one responsible for this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not up to me to make this a good meeting, and if it is a bad meeting, it is not my fault."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This kind of attitude is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When you come to any Christian meeting, you must have the feeling, the realization, that you must take care of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the best aspect of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The new way stirs up the believers to care for God's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the new way, every saint has the feeling, the realization, that he is responsible for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many things can be done when there is a "gap," or silence, in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What you can do depends upon your capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whether your capacity is large or small does not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A new one may ask, "I have heard you talk about God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What do you mean by this?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is actually a very deep question, yet a young one can also give a very good answer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He may say, "God's economy is just to make sinners His children."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a good teaching out of the mouth of one that has been saved about four weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was a sinner, and He became one of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to his knowledge, God's economy is simply to make sinners His children.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is such a simple answer, yet many may learn from it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Regardless of my spiritual maturity, as long as I do not hold back what God has given me to speak, I have fulfilled my responsibility, and the meeting will be enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If every saint has this realization, all the riches within them will be ministered to the other members of the Lord's Body according to each saint's capacity.</S>
