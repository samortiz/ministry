in the Way to Enter into the Church Life</H2>

<P>In her fellowship with Christ, she is also instructed by Him in the way to enter into the church life (vv. 6b-8).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Persecuted by Her Denominational Brothers</H2>

<P>She was persecuted by her denominational brothers (her mother's sons&#151;v. 6b), and she was turned away from the church by the flocks of His companions (v. 7b). She was persecuted by her denominational brothers, though they also were born by grace&#151;the same mother (v. 6b)&#151;and she was turned away from the church. This is the situation today.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. He Telling Her to Follow Him<br>
on the Footsteps of the Church</H2>

<P>The Beloved tells her to follow Him on the footsteps of the church (flock) and pasture her spiritual children (young goats) at the local churches (the shepherds' tents), where He pastures His church (vv. 7-8). She prayed, "Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock?" Then Christ answered, "If you yourself do not know,/You fairest among women,/Go forth on the footsteps of the flock." To follow on the footsteps of the flock is to follow the church. We can testify that many times we did not know where Christ was, but as we followed the church, we found Him. When we find the church, we bring all the younger ones, indicated by the young goats, to the church as well.</P>
