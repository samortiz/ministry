<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p> This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in January 1989 in San Diego, California (chapters one through four) and in December 1988 in Irving, Texas (chapters five and six).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE PROGRESSION<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:11-16; 1 Cor. 14:23a, 26</h1>
<p>Beginning in August of 1988, the Lord has been speaking to us concerning His organic Body and the organic building up of His Body. In this book we want to see the Lord&rsquo;s advanced recovery according to His present speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BEGINNING OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY&mdash;<br />
FROM THE SECOND CENTURY</h2>
<p>The divine revelation of the New Testament was fully completed with Paul&rsquo;s ministry and John&rsquo;s mending ministry. The New Testament tells us that at the end of Paul&rsquo;s ministry, the church began to degrade and become deformed from the divine revelation (2 Tim. 1:15; 2:16&mdash;3:13; 4:10, 14-16). Later, the Apostle John wrote to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3, telling them to repent. The Lord charged the churches to repent of the degradation into which they had fallen. Within the first century were the completing of the divine revelation and the degradation of the church life. The Lord came in to point out the degradation of the church and to sound out a call for some overcomers who would come back to the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life (2:7), the hidden manna (2:17), and the feast (3:20). According to church history, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery with His overcomers began in the second century. Even within such a short time after the completion of the divine revelation, the church fell into degradation, so there was the need of a recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROGRESS OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY<br />
THROUGH THE CENTURIES</h2>
<p>Brother E. H. Broadbent in his book <em>The PilgrimChurch</em> pointed out that the line of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery started in the second century and has continued throughout the centuries. Eventually, at the time of the Reformation with Martin Luther, the recovery of the Lord came into a definite form. The Lord used Martin Luther to recover the basic truth of justification by faith. In the seventeenth century, some within the Catholic Church reacted to the deadness of the reformed churches. These were the mystics, whom the Lord used to recover the experiences of the inner life. The Lord went on in the eighteenth century with Zinzendorf to recover the initial stage of the church life in the unity of the Holy Spirit. In the early part of the nineteenth century, the Lord raised up the Brethren in England under the leadership of John Nelson Darby to recover the church life in a fuller way. This recovered church life might be considered as the fulfillment of the epistle to Philadelphia in Revelation 3. The Brethren began in 1828, but within ninety years they were divided into about one hundred divisions.</p>
<p>In the early part of the twentieth century, the Lord caught a young man in China named Watchman Nee, and the Lord used him to continue His recovery. This advance in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery struck God&rsquo;s enemy, so His enemy rose up against it. Mainland China was lost into the hands of the communists, who were absolutely against the Lord&rsquo;s interests on this earth. Brother Nee was put into prison in 1952 and died there in 1972. When mainland China was about to be lost, I was sent to Taiwan in 1949, and the Lord began His testimony on that island. From that time to 1958 on the island of Taiwan, we basically kept what we had seen and received of the Lord through Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry. In those years, we did not have much advance in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>From 1958 to 1989, at least ten big divine items have been recovered as a continuation of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the years before. The first item is eating Christ, enjoying Christ, and experiencing Christ. Eating Christ is for enjoying Christ, and enjoying Christ is for experiencing Christ. The second item is that Christ in His resurrection became a life-giving Spirit. The Lord showed us this particular point in the divine revelation in 1 Corinthians 15:45b. The third item is calling on the name of the Lord&mdash;&ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; This practice is fully recorded in many verses in both the Old and New Testaments, but we saw this and practiced it only within the past thirty years. We taste the inward sweetness of the Lord when we call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; The fourth item is that the Triune God has been processed and consummated. The fifth item is the all-inclusive, compounded, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold, and consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God. The sixth item is the dispensing of the processed Triune God. The processed Triune God is dispensing Himself into His people. The seventh item is that the processed Triune God has been dispensed into the transformed, tripartite man. We saw this truth in Romans 8. The eighth item is that the riches of Christ after being enjoyed by the saints become the fullness of Christ for His expression. The fullness of Christ is the church, the Body of Christ as the expression of Christ. The ninth item is the mingling of the processed Triune God with the sanctified man. The tenth item is God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT ADVANCE OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>We have seen that the divine revelation was completed within the first century, but the truths of the divine revelation were soon lost as the church degraded throughout its history. Whatever we are seeing today is not something new but ancient. It was with the saints nearly two thousand years ago, but it got lost throughout the centuries. We call the scriptural way to practice the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery the new way because it is new to us, but in fact it is the ancient way to which we must return. Through century after century the Lord has been recovering item after item, and He is still going on among us today. In August of 1988 the Lord passed on the words <em>organic</em> and <em>organism</em> to us in order to advance His recovery even further. In September in Cleveland, Ohio a series of messages were released entitled <em>The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity.</em> Our eyes need to be opened to see what the Lord is recovering in the present advance of His recovery. We need to be impressed with three major items.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Recovering the Organic Building Up<br />
of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>Today the Lord is moving to recover the organic building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12, 16). This organic building can be seen in the New Testament. Paul tells us that the church is built up with precious materials, and among these precious materials are the precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12). Physical stones are lifeless, inorganic, and a building made of these stones is inorganic. But in 1 Peter 2:5, Peter tells us that we are living stones, stones that are full of life. God&rsquo;s building is organic because all the stones are living. Peter says that as living stones, we are being built up into a spiritual house. Since God&rsquo;s building is a living building, Paul tells us in Ephesians 2:21 that it is growing. We can illustrate the difference between an inorganic item and something organic by comparing a piece of wood to a person&rsquo;s finger. If a piece of wood is cut in half, and the pieces are put together without any glue, they will remain separate. But if a person&rsquo;s finger is cut in half, and a doctor puts the two pieces together, they will grow together because they are organic. Their coming together is organic. Because we are organic members of the Body of Christ, our building together is totally organic. We have not seen much of the organic building among us because we have not taken the organic way. The old, traditional, and unscriptural way is good for organization but not for the organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ. It is good for the organizational building but not for the organic building.</p>
<p>Some who are opposing the Lord&rsquo;s present advance in His recovery have said that I have deviated from the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I have not deviated from the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, but I have surely deviated from the old way. My deviation from the old way has brought me more into the recovery. Today I am in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery more than ever before. Sixty-one years ago in 1927, I officially left my denomination. That was the initiation of my deviation from Christianity. According to my feeling, my deviation from Christianity was fully completed in August of 1988. Now that the old way is being annulled, some older co-workers have to consider where they shall be. Should they remain in the old way or go forth into the new way? To go forth into the new way, we have to pay a price. Some older co-workers were a success in the recovery according to the old way, but now the old way is being annulled. This is the root of all the troubles among us today. All the other things are on the surface. I must testify that instead of deviating from the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, I have entered into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery more deeply.</p>
<p>Much of what we carried out in the past according to the old way was organizational. Some of it was organic, but the main situation of our practice was not organic. Today the Lord wants us to be absolutely organic in everything. He wants to recover the organic building up of the Body of Christ. The Lord does not want to build up a congregation but an organic Body. I would like to check with the elders in the local churches whether the local church in your locality is just a congregation or a part of the Body of Christ? The difference between an organization and an organism can be illustrated by comparing a robot to our physical body. A robot is an organization of inorganic parts, but our human body, which typifies the Body of Christ, is altogether organic. The church in our locality may be mostly congregational instead of organic. We have to deviate from the organizational and congregational way into something organic. We all need such a deviation.</p>
<p>The organic building up of the Body of Christ is not only by the gifted persons but also by every member of the Body. We must admit that in many of the local churches, the building up has been mostly by the elders and the co-workers, the leading ones. We may say that we do not agree with the clergy-laity system and that among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we do not have the class of the clergy. Actually, though, we have to admit that there has been a strong clerical class in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Some among us have been the clergy and many have been the laity. In his epistle to the church in Ephesus in the book of Revelation, the Lord revealed that He hates the clergy-laity system (2:6 and note 1&mdash;Recovery Version). When I went back to Taipei in 1984, there were about three thousand saints attending the meetings. Of these, only about one hundred were serving. There were about five serving ones in each of the twenty-one halls. Unconsciously there was a strong clergy among us. We may say that we do not have a clergy, but in fact we have had it.</p>
<p>When I returned to Taipei in 1984, I took note of many of the saints who were brought into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery when we began the Lord&rsquo;s work there thirty-five years ago in 1949. I checked with them whether or not they could speak a word for the Lord on certain truths such as reconciliation. None of them said they could do this. Actually, a small number of the saints were in the clerical class and the rest had become the laity. The clergy-laity system is what the Lord hates, and yet we have practiced it. Should we not deviate from such a situation? We all have to rise up and say, &ldquo;Lord, we want to deviate from this system that You hate. We want to build up Your Body, not only by a few gifted ones but also by every member of Your Body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The building up of the Body of Christ is not in the organizational way but in the organic way. The organic building up of the Body of Christ must be the first item that the Lord desires to recover. I believe that the Lord is earnestly after this one thing. He desires to see His Body being built up organically on this earth. This must be absolutely recovered. If we mean business with the Lord that we love Him, we have to rise up for this organic building. We need to tell the Lord: &ldquo;Lord, You hate the clergy-laity system and so do I. I do not want to remain in this system anymore. I want to get out of this system.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">Recovering the Perfecting of the<br />
Common Members of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>In the present advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, He also desires to recover the perfecting of the common members of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-16). If only a small percentage of the saints in a local church are able to speak a word for the Lord and serve Him organically, this is a strong sign that this local church is short of the perfecting of the saints. In the past we almost always held big meetings with one man speaking to give people help in a general way, but there was very little particular perfecting. It is so good that there are many schools in America where people can receive training in a particular trade. If we only had people who were college graduates and we did not have plumbers, electricians, and secretaries, what would our economy be like? People who receive particular training in trades and skills render a great benefit and profit to society. Their training is the perfecting. We need this kind of particular perfecting of the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We need particular teaching that we may be perfected in a particular field.</p>
<p>To some extent we need the general edification of the big meetings. This is why high schools give young people a general education in subjects such as mathematics, geography, and history. In addition to this general education, though, some particular instruction is needed. All that we had in the churches in the past was the general education of the saints week after week and year after year with hardly any particular instruction. Many saints have been in the church life for many years, but today they know very little because they were only edified in a general way.</p>
<p>The Lord desires to recover the perfecting of the common members of the Body of Christ, and this perfecting can take place in the homes. In Acts 20 Paul reminded the elders in Ephesus that he taught the saints in the church publicly and from house to house (v. 20), admonishing each one with tears night and day for three years (v. 31). The practical and actual perfecting takes place from house to house. We should not just give general messages and teachings but we need some particular instruction. Week after week and month after month, we need to instruct some saints face to face in a particular way. After half a year of this perfecting, many of the saints will learn how to serve.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-12 says that the Head of the Body gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers for the perfecting of the saints so that the saints can do the work of the ministry. This means that all the perfected saints are able to do what the gifted ones do. There is a great shortage of such particular perfecting among us. We have the general teaching, but we have very little of the particular perfecting. There is the need of a recovery of this matter. The Lord is recovering the organic building up of His Body, and He is also desirous to see all the saints particularly perfected in order to participate in the building up of the Body of Christ as the gifted persons do. I have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for fifty-six years, and I have seen, done, passed through, and experienced many things, yet I must admit that we are short of the organic building of the Body of Christ and short of the perfecting of the saints that they all may share the work of the ministry. This is the revelation that I have received of the Lord within the past six months.</p>
<p>The perfecting of the saints is by the gifted persons as the joints of the rich supply (vv. 11, 16). Our physical body is full of joints. We would be terribly disabled without the joints in our physical body. Years ago I thought that the gifted persons were only the big members. The joints in our fingers, however, are not big joints, and they are very useful. When the joints in our body work, our body enjoys the supply for its support. Many saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are the gifted persons, the joints, but they do not exercise as joints. They need to be released to function for the building up of the Body of Christ. We all need to be revolutionized since we have been distracted and somewhat paralyzed in a certain direction. We have to change our direction to the present advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>The Lord wants to recover the perfecting of the saints so that each one part of the Body of Christ may do the work of the New Testament ministry by operating in its measure for the purpose of building up the organic Body of Christ (vv. 12, 16). To have every part of the Body exercised is to build up the organic Body by the organic way. This is recorded in Ephesians 4:11-16 but we have not entered into this experience. Now that this vision has been presented to us, we can see our need and the Lord&rsquo;s need today.</p><h2 class="head2">Recovering the Church Meeting in Mutuality</h2>
<p>In the present advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, He is also moving to recover the church meeting in mutuality (1 Cor. 14:23a, 26). In a big meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening, there is no mutuality. We have to meet as the church in the way that is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26&mdash; &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has....&rdquo; We may wonder how we can have a big meeting in which everyone functions since the meeting would last too long. If two hundred saints each share for only one minute, that meeting would last three hours and twenty minutes. &ldquo;Each one has,&rdquo; however, does not mean that each one functions. Whether we function or not in the meeting, we still have something. Even if we may not have the time to function, we will still be exercised and prepared to function. If we know that a certain brother is going to give a message, there is no need for us to get prepared to speak. But when the saints gather together according to 1 Corinthians 14:26, we do not know who will speak, and we all have to bear the responsibility to speak. For every meeting we should get ourselves exercised to have something ready to share in the meeting. Then day after day, week after week, month after month, and year after year, we all will be exercised for the building up of the Body of Christ organically. Even though we may not share, we still were exercised.</p>
<p>In the church meeting in mutuality, each attendant has a portion of the riches of Christ to share with others mutually. If we are idle and do not exercise ourselves, how can we have a portion of the riches of Christ? We have to pray, get into the Word, have our mind and spirit exercised, and have our voice exercised to share in the meetings. For the sake of the meetings, we have to exercise all the time. Our exercise will make us healthy Christians. This is for the building up organically of the church as the organic Body of Christ. I must stress again that this is our shortage. We must ask the Lord to have mercy upon us and grant us the recovery of the church meeting in mutuality. We should hate to go to a meeting as &ldquo;pew members&rdquo; without any exercise, to merely listen, watch, and enjoy others&rsquo; sharing. This is wrong.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fulfilling the Words in Matthew 16:18,<br />
Ephesians 4:11-16, and 1 Corinthians 14:26<br />
concerning the Building Up, in Three Levels,<br />
of the Church as the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>The recovery of the organic building up of the Body of Christ, of the perfecting of the common members of the Body of Christ, and of the church meeting in mutuality fulfills the words in Matthew 16:18, Ephesians 4:11-16, and 1 Corinthians 14:26 concerning the building up, in three levels, of the church as the Body of Christ. The three levels of building up are as follows: the Head builds up His Body by giving the gifted persons as the joints to His Body (Eph. 4:11); the gifted persons perfect each one part of the Body of Christ (v. 12); and each one part operates in its measure to build up the Body directly (v. 16). Without the fulfillment of Matthew 16:18, Ephesians 4:11-16, and 1 Corinthians 14:26, the Lord cannot come back. Regardless of the attacks, opposition, and criticism, the Lord will move to recover the building up of the organic Body of Christ, the perfecting of the saints so that all can do the work of the ministry, and the church meeting in mutuality. I have the faith, the assurance, and the certainty that the Lord today is going to recover these three items among us. I feel that we are the right persons today and that we are in the right time. I expect to see this within my lifetime. I believe that within five years a great number of the local churches will be practicing these items. We need a strong deviation from the old way into the present advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE LIFE NEEDED<br />
FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S PRESENT RECOVERY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 5:14-15; 1 John 1:2-3, 6-7, 9; Lam. 3:22-23; Prov. 4:18; Rev. 2:7; Rom. 10:12b; 2 Tim. 4:2a</h1>
<p>In chapter one we saw the progression of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and the present advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Today the Lord desires to recover the organic building up of the Body of Christ, the perfecting of the common members of the Body of Christ, and the church meeting in mutuality. Now that we have seen a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery, we want to see the life needed for the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery.</p>
<p>When we touch the holy things, we have to take care of what we are, our own person. The Lord&rsquo;s present recovery has the highest requirement. The highest requirement in the Bible is the requirement of the kingdom of the heavens. In the Old Testament, the highest requirement was the law, but in the New Testament the requirement of the kingdom is much higher. The Lord compares these two kinds of requirements in Matthew 5 (vv. 21-22, 27-28, 33-34, 38-39, 43-44) to show that the demand of the kingdom is deeper and higher than the requirement of the law. If we are going to meet the need of the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery, the requirement must be the requirement of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Matthew 5&mdash;7 may be considered as the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens. Just as the constitution of the United States is the highest authority in our country, so the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is the highest authority in our Christian life and church life. The present recovery of the Lord is the recovery of the kingdom life, a life that matches the requirements of the kingdom. The requirements in Matthew 5&mdash;7 are very detailed and fine. There are many great points and small points. We need to take care of these detailed and fine requirements for the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery. If we are careless, we will be out of His present recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEVOTING OURSELVES TO THE LORD IN HIS LOVE</h2>
<p>We need to devote ourselves to the Lord in His love (2 Cor. 5:14-15). We may have avoided the word <em>devote</em> in the past because it has been spoiled by being used in a light and loose way. Christians generally use this word when referring to their devotional time. The word <em>devote</em> is properly used and defined by Moses in Leviticus 27. Moses says that we need to devote our possessions and our person, our being, to God. We may say that we need to give, to offer, to present, and to consecrate ourselves to God, but to devote ourselves to Him is deeper and more serious. We may give, offer, present, or consecrate ourselves to God in a light way, but we cannot devote ourselves to God in a light way. To devote ourselves is more serious because we devote ourselves to God by making a vow to Him. Leviticus 27 tells us about this matter in a practical and detailed way. To devote ourselves to God is to present ourselves to God as a gift in a serious way by a vow. A vow cannot be retracted or annulled. It remains until it is completely fulfilled. If we make a vow to God and do not fulfill it, we will suffer spiritual death. Many Christians today may be very active, but actually they are suffering spiritual death. The overall situation of Christianity is a situation of deadness because many of God&rsquo;s people do not take the things concerning God in a serious way. When we are light with God, the result is deadness. We are deadened by being too light in dealing with God.</p>
<p>Suppose that we were going to see the president of the United States tomorrow. Our attitude would be very serious and solemn. We would realize that it is not a small thing for us to see the president of the United States. Have we ever held such an attitude in contacting God? We mostly do not hold such an attitude. We take our contact with God for granted. We may believe only that God is merciful and kind and that our Lord Jesus Christ is the redeeming One who died for us, giving us the right to come into His presence. This is true, but we should not forget that the One into whose presence we come is the very God. The president of the United States may be merciful, kind, loving, humble, and approachable, yet he is not a low or common person. He is the very leader of this country. We should not contact him in a careless way. Quite often, however, in our contacting God, we were careless. In dealing with His people in the Old Testament, God set up a pattern that we must deal with Him in a serious way by a vow. To deal with God by a vow is to devote ourselves.</p>
<p>When a man and woman are engaged to be married, this is a serious matter. Our relationship with God as revealed in the Bible is like that of a marriage relationship. God wants us to be engaged to Him (Hosea 2:19-20). God is not satisfied that we would just be friends with Him. We must go further from friendship with God into a marriage relationship with Him. The Apostle Paul said, &ldquo;I betrothed you to one Husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ&rdquo; (2 Cor. 11:2). Paul was doing something to get the saints engaged to the Lord. To be engaged to the Lord is a vow to Him. Divorce can never be approved by God. Once we make a vow to God, it cannot be retracted. I like to see that we are excited about the Lord and His present move, but we have to consider our responsibility to make a vow. We have to take God in a serious way.</p>
<p>We need to devote ourselves to the Lord in His love. Second Corinthians 5:14 says, &ldquo;The love of Christ constrains us.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;constrains&rdquo; may also be translated &ldquo;compels.&rdquo; The love of Christ compels us and forcibly limits us. The Greek word for &ldquo;constrains&rdquo; literally means to shut up to one line and purpose as in a narrow, walled road. The more we go on with the Lord, the narrower the path becomes. This narrow path confines and limits us. I once stayed in a house with a very small place to take a shower. I was so confined by the four walls of that shower that I could not turn in it. The love of Christ constrains us in this way. His love takes away our choice, our preference. We cannot turn to the right or to the left, nor can we turn to go back. With the love of Christ constraining us, the only way is to go ahead. There is no turn and no exit. We surely have to love the Lord, but 2 Corinthians 5:14 means that we have been caught by His love. The love of Christ constrains us to live a life to Him (v. 15). We need to devote ourselves to God in His constraining love. Although Paul did not use the word <em>devote</em> in 2 Corinthians 5:14-15, this is exactly what he means. The Lord&rsquo;s constraining love forcibly limits us to do what He desires and to take His way.</p>
<p>On the one hand, God compels us in His love. On the other hand, He always keeps His principle of giving man the freedom of choice. After man&rsquo;s creation, God put him not before one tree but before two trees, indicating that God respects man&rsquo;s freedom of choice. Man had a choice between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Deep in God&rsquo;s heart, He desires man to choose the proper tree, but whether or not man chooses this tree depends upon his choice. The gospel is being preached to thousands of people today, but that does not mean that everyone will believe. Whether or not someone believes is up to his choice, his preference. After we are saved, the two trees are still here for us to choose from. Once we choose the tree of life, we get &ldquo;imprisoned&rdquo; by His love. When we fall in love with a person, that love is a prison. When we begin to love the Lord, we have fallen in love with Him. This means that we have been captured by Him. We have become God&rsquo;s beloved (S. S. 2:16; Rom. 1:7a; 2 Thes. 2:13a) because we have been caught by the love of God. We are imprisoned by His love. We have no choice; we must go His way.</p>
<p>To devote ourselves to the Lord by a vow means that we would no longer live to ourselves but to Him (2 Cor. 5:15). To live to the Lord is more serious than living for Him. We who love the Lord mostly do not live to Him. We live for Him and mostly we live to ourselves. A husband may love his wife, but instead of living to her, he lives to himself. Whenever we are invited to someone&rsquo;s house to eat, we eat what is set before us even though we may not like it because we are eating to the host. To eat exactly what we want is to eat to ourselves. We have to admit that most of the time we live a life for the Lord while unconsciously living a life to ourselves. We need to make a vow to the Lord: &ldquo;Lord, I do not want to live to myself any longer. I want to make a vow to You. I do not want to have my freedom. I desire to live to You, taking You as my goal. I have no other goals. You are my only goal.&rdquo; Because we have been constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love, we have no freedom, no choice, so we have to devote ourselves to Him.</p>
<p>We devote ourselves to Him by making a thorough confession of all our sins and trespasses (1 John 1:9). One day over fifty years ago, I went to the Lord and spent between two to three hours to make a thorough confession to Him of all my sins and trespasses. The more I confessed, the more I had to confess. If we do not confess, we do not realize how dirty we are. When we begin to clean our room with the intention of cleaning it thoroughly, we will find a lot of dirt. Similarly, when we begin to confess our sins thoroughly, we realize how dirty our inward being is. We must make a thorough confession to get ourselves fully cleared up and cleansed.</p>
<p>In the recent winter training on Leviticus, we saw in Leviticus 11&mdash;15 how unclean we are. We saw that our contact with others can be unclean and that we are lepers. Our natural birth is also something in uncleanness, and whatever comes out of our natural being is dirty and contagious. Before that training, many of us had not seen our real situation. God inspired Moses to write this portion of the Word, showing us that our contacts, our condition, our source, and our discharge are nothing but uncleanness and leprosy. This is why we must make a thorough confession if we are going to devote ourselves to God. After we thoroughly confess our sins to the Lord, we may say, &ldquo;Lord, I cannot finish my confession because I am totally uncleanness.&rdquo; The extent of our confession will be the extent of the cleansing that we receive by the blood of Christ. Our forgiveness comes from God, but His forgiveness has a condition. This condition is that we have to confess our sins.</p>
<p>We also devote ourselves to the Lord in His love by &ldquo;praying through.&rdquo; It is hard to explain what it means to pray through. When we pray, we know whether we have gotten through or not. In our prayer we realize quite often that we did not get the job done. We stopped our prayer too soon, and we did not get through in our prayer. Many times while we are praying, a thought will come to us that we need to do a certain thing or call a certain person, so we stop praying without getting through in our prayer. To devote ourselves to the Lord, we have to make a thorough confession of all our sins and trespasses, and we have to &ldquo;pray through.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">DEVOTING OURSELVES TO THE LORD<br />
FOR THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>In order to preach the gospel by visiting people in their homes, we have to devote ourselves to the Lord. Knocking on people&rsquo;s doors is difficult. We do not know what kind of people we are going to meet when we go out to knock on doors. We need the wisdom to deal with all kinds of people. Furthermore, the more we talk, the more mistakes we make. To go out to preach the gospel by knocking on people&rsquo;s doors requires a life on the highest plane. Whether or not someone allows us to come in to speak to them depends on what we say to them at the door. We need the wisdom to speak the right words. We need to learn a great deal.</p>
<p>Paul said in Colossians 1:28 that he announced Christ, &ldquo;warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ.&rdquo; The phrase &ldquo;in all wisdom&rdquo; means a lot. It shows that Paul did not preach the gospel concerning Christ in a simple way. He preached the gospel in all wisdom. Paul had a way to convince all kinds of people to receive the Lord Jesus. Brother Nee told us that whether someone is saved or not depends upon what we say to them. When we are speaking the gospel to someone, our speaking should stop at a certain point and we should guide them into prayer. A long prayer is not necessary. With a short prayer, a person can be saved. Good salesmen are trained not to speak to people with their own words but with the words that their company trained them to speak. They are trained to stop talking with their clients at a certain point; otherwise, they will lose the deal. On the other hand, they do not close the deal too quickly. We need to preach the gospel in the same way, doing it in all wisdom.</p>
<p>Since Paul preached the gospel in all wisdom, as an apostle he surely perfected the saints to do the same thing. In 1953 and 1954, I carried out a training in Taipei with four main sections: the gospel, life, truth, and the church. In the section on the gospel, I shared with the saints concerning the discernment of people. We have to discern if the person to whom we are speaking is religious, atheistic, or immoral. Based upon the kind of person he is, we can speak a particular word to him to bring him to salvation. We need this kind of perfecting. The training we had with the saints in Taiwan in 1953 and 1954 had some success. That was the reason that we had so much increase in the beginning of the work in Taiwan. Within five or six years our number increased from about four hundred to forty thousand. We may not have brought anyone to the Lord for years because we were not perfected to preach the gospel. We need to be willing and ready to be perfected for the preaching of the gospel. I do not know how to operate a camera properly because I do not have the heart to learn. Likewise, we may not know how to preach the gospel because we do not want to learn.</p>
<p>The Lord told us in John 15 that Christ is the true vine and we are His branches. The branches of the vine tree have to bear fruit; otherwise, they will be cut off (vv. 2a, 6). For a branch to be cut off from the vine tree is a serious matter. For us to be cut off from Christ as the vine tree does not mean that we will be lost but that we will lose the genuine enjoyment of Christ. As a branch of the vine tree, you cannot enjoy the vine tree if you are cut off from it. We may claim that we are enjoying Christ, yet we may not have borne fruit for many years. I doubt that such &ldquo;enjoyment&rdquo; is the genuine enjoyment of Christ. If the branches are abiding in the vine tree, they will surely bear fruit. If they are not bearing fruit, something must be wrong.</p>
<p>Because God&rsquo;s salvation has room for more people, the Lord Jesus told us, &ldquo;Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled&rdquo; (Luke 14:23). Some have criticized our preaching the gospel by knocking on people&rsquo;s doors by saying that we mostly gain the lower-class people. This is according to the Lord&rsquo;s word in Luke 14. The Lord Jesus told us to go to the hedges. The lower-class people are at the hedges, not the upper-class ones. The Lord Jesus also told us to compel them to come in. Throughout my Christian life I have seen many people get saved by being compelled. If we preach the gospel to people by asking them to receive the Lord and giving them a choice, they will not choose Christ but the Devil. However, if we compel people to believe by directing them to receive the Lord without giving them a choice, many will receive the Lord. We need to learn to do this compelling work so that many can get saved. The angels were not charged to preach the gospel of grace. Only we human beings have this right. We have the right to compel people to receive the Lord.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have the right in this fellowship to compel you to devote yourself to the Lord. We all have to devote ourselves to the Lord by a vow. The more we compel others, the more results we get. The more gentle and &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; we are, the less results we have. The brothers who are &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; in the gospel and compel people to receive the Lord are the ones that get the results. Brother Nee told us that we could not get people saved if the skin on our face is thin. If we are going to get people saved, the skin on our face must be very thick. Then if someone rejects us, we are not bothered. The more we are rejected, the more we will compel others to believe in the Lord Jesus. We have to devote ourselves to the Lord in His love to compel people to receive Him as their salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING REVIVED EVERY MORNING</h2>
<p>First, we need to devote ourselves to the Lord. Then we need to be revived every morning. After coming into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we appreciated and treasured the church life. That was our church life &ldquo;honeymoon.&rdquo; Later we became contented and self-satisfied. Today for the new way, we need to be revived. We need to have a new start. We need to start our Christian life anew and forget about the past. We should not linger in the past, always talking about how wonderful it was when we came into the recovery many years ago. We must take care of today. We may have been living in the past, but what about today? We may be deadened, dormant, sleeping, and even sleepy. We need a revival. The past does not help us today. We need something today. Today we have to be alive, living, fresh, and new. A co-worker once told me that a good point with me is that I am always fresh and new. If I do not feel that I am new and fresh, I become very fearful. Something must be wrong with me if I am not so fresh and new. Regardless of how old we are in our physical age, we can still be fresh and new. Second Corinthians 4:16 indicates that our inward man should be renewed day by day. This is a daily revival. The way for us to be revived is to go to the Lord to confess our sins and to pray through. If we do these two things, we will be revived.</p>
<p>To be revived every morning is not only scriptural but also according to the natural law. According to the law of nature, the sun rises once every twenty-four hours. We need to rise up with the sun every morning. It is good for our health to go to sleep early and rise up early. The earlier we go to bed, the healthier we will be. I do not like to go to bed after 10:30 p.m. or rise up later than 6:30 a.m. If we go to bed late and rise up late, our health will be spoiled. We also need to practice going to bed early and rising early for our spiritual health.</p>
<p>Every twenty-four hours there is a new day for us to have a new start. Lamentations 3:22-23 says that the Lord&rsquo;s lovingkindnesses and compassions are new every morning. We may be in a situation full of lamentations, yet we can be happy by having ourselves revived every morning. Proverbs 4:18 says that the path of the righteous is as the rising sun. We need to follow the sun. After the sun sets, we should go to sleep. When the sun rises, we should rise. Every morning we need a new revival.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING AN OVERCOMING LIFE DAILY</h2>
<p>For the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery, we need to live an overcoming life daily. Some have said that the new way to preach the gospel by knocking on doors is just a method, but I am not teaching the saints a set of methods. To take the new way, we need another life. The new way is a matter of life, not a matter of method. If we practice the fellowship in this chapter, we will be different persons. If we devote ourselves to the Lord, get revived every morning, and live an overcoming life daily, we will be in full agreement with the present advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>We can live an overcoming life daily by enjoying Christ as the tree of life (Rev. 2:7). When the churches became degraded, the Lord not only rebuked them but also called for the overcomers to come back to eating Him as the tree of life. Eating Christ as the tree of life is the first item of the Lord&rsquo;s sevenfold promise to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3. The first item of His promise is to feed us with Himself as the tree of life. If we answer His call to be an overcomer, we will really enjoy Him as the tree of life.</p>
<p>We also live an overcoming life daily by calling on the Lord continuously, without ceasing (Rom. 10:12b). We can call on the Lord all the time. Our calling on Him is like our physical breathing. We breathe at all times and in any kind of situation. If we stop breathing for a short time, we will die. In like manner, we must breathe in the Lord by calling on Him continuously. He is calling us to be the overcomers, so we must answer His call by calling on Him. By this simple practice, we can live an overcoming life day by day.</p><h2 class="head1">ABIDING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>When we are living an overcoming life, we abide, remain, stay, in the fellowship with the Lord (1 John 1:6). As long as an appliance stays in the electricity, it works. Once it is cut off from the electricity, its function stops. We need to remain in the divine electricity, the fellowship with the Lord. When we rise up early in the morning to have a new revival, that brings us again into the fellowship with the Lord. During the whole day, we need to keep ourselves in this fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING CHRIST AND FUNCTIONING<br />
IN ALL KINDS OF MEETINGS</h2>
<p>When we are abiding in fellowship with the Lord, we will speak Christ and function in all kinds of meetings. We will speak Christ to all people at all times&mdash;in season and out of season (2 Tim. 4:2a). To the sinners we will preach Christ as the Savior, as the gospel, and to the saved ones we will minister Christ as the life supply. All day long we have to practice speaking Christ to people. Our speaking Christ is a strong sign that we are persons in the present advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We also need to function in all kinds of meetings by praying and speaking. In any kind of meeting we have to learn to pray and learn to speak.</p>
<p>What we have fellowshipped in this chapter is the life that is needed for us to take the way of the present recovery of the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s present recovery needs persons living such a life. If we practice the points in this chapter, we will be saved from ourselves, our flesh, and our natural life. This kind of life will not allow us to be slothful with the Lord, to be idle in spiritual things. Such a life will save us from many abnormal things, and we will be altogether normal in every way and in every aspect.</p>
<p>If we are not revived persons, it is difficult to go out to save sinners by contacting them where they are. We should not touch the saints first concerning preaching the gospel. We have to touch them first concerning having a revived life. We need to help the saints to be revived. We do not need to preach or promote door-knocking in our locality. That is the wrong way. We have to do something to minister Christ to the saints that they may be revived. Then they will begin to live an overcoming life to such an extent that we may not need to tell them to go to visit people in their homes with the gospel. They will do it spontaneously because they will have a desire to preach Christ to others. Their motive for preaching the gospel will not be our teaching but it will be Christ abiding in them. Christ abiding in them will be the motive for them to get sinners saved, to have home meetings, and to have group meetings. We need such a revived life for the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO PRACTICE<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S PRESENT RECOVERY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19; Luke 10:3, 5-6; John 15:5, 16a; Acts 5:42; Eph. 6:18a; Rom. 10:12b; Heb. 10:25; Acts 2:46; 12:12; Eph. 4:12; 1 Cor. 14:3-5, 24, 26</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for all Your divine provisions. We thank You for Your holy Word. We thank You for Your Holy Spirit. We also thank You for Your precious blood. Without the Word, we would be in darkness. Without You as the life-giving Spirit, we would be dead. Without Your precious blood, we would be under condemnation. Thank You, Lord, that day by day we have these three great items of Your divine provision for our enjoyment. We are enjoying Your cleansing with Your precious blood to free us from our sins, we are enjoying Your Spirit to make us living, and we are enjoying the Bible as a lamp to our feet and a light to our path to direct us. Thank You that we are in the light and not in darkness. Give us a clear sky with an open heaven. Lord, we desire to open ourselves to You as You open Yourself to us. We pray that Your presence would be with us. Give us the feeling that You are here so that we may enjoy You and share Your riches. Amen.</p>
<p>The last two chapters were a preparation for the fellowship in this chapter and the next chapter. They contain the most crucial fellowship in this book. Now that we have seen the life needed for the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery, we need to see the way to practice the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery.</p>
<p>We saw in chapter one that the present advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is first to recover the organic building up of the Body of Christ. Second, the Lord desires to recover the perfecting of the saints that they may do the same work of the New Testament ministry that the gifted persons do to build up the Body of Christ organically. Third, the Lord is recovering the church meeting in mutuality. In some places we can see these three items being carried out. We have seen the Lord recovering the organic building up of His Body, and we have seen the perfecting of the saints by the gifted persons that all the saints may do the same kind of work that the gifted persons do. What the Apostle Paul did, we can be perfected to do today. We have also seen the recovery of the church meetings in mutuality in some places. When fifty to one hundred saints come together, all of them can prophesy. To prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14 is not to predict but to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to speak the Lord into others, which is to dispense the rich Christ into all those attending the meeting. We have seen this in some places, but it has not become a widespread practice in the churches, so we have to endeavor to go on. In order to have the above three items adequately recovered among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have to do four things, which are the four steps of the way to practice the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SAVING SINNERS BY<br />
CONTACTING THEM WHERE THEY ARE</h2>
<p>The first step of the way to practice the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery is to save sinners by contacting them where they are. Many people are home in the evenings and on the weekends. That is the right place for us to contact them. In Matthew 28:19a the Lord Jesus charged us to go and disciple the nations. Then in Luke 10 we see that we need to go to visit the homes to find the sons of peace (vv. 3, 5-6).</p>
<p>We should not ask people to come to us more than we go to them. We need to go to impart Christ into the repenting and believing sinners (Gal. 1:16). Much of the preaching today is that people need to repent and believe in the Lord Jesus; otherwise, they will suffer eternal perdition. But the main aspect of our preaching of the gospel is for imparting Christ into others. We need to impart the living Christ with all of His riches into the poor sinners. After imparting Christ into the repenting and believing sinners, we need to baptize them into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19b). This is a wonderful, divine traffic to bring the Triune God into someone and to bring him into the Triune God. By this traffic a sinner will be mingled with the Triune God. We need to go to impart Christ into people and then baptize them into the Triune God. To save sinners by contacting them where they are is to bear fruit as an issue of the genuine enjoyment of Christ (John 15:5, 16a). The evidence of our abiding in Christ and enjoying Christ genuinely is that we are bearing fruit.</p><h2 class="head1">CHERISHING AND NOURISHING<br />
THE NEW BELIEVERS IN THEIR HOMES</h2>
<p>A mother who has just delivered a child needs to cherish and nourish this child. Likewise, we have to cherish and nourish the new believers in their homes. Immediately after baptizing the believing ones into the Triune God, we need to stay with them for at least an hour, if possible, to cherish and nourish them. After we baptize a believing sinner into the Triune God, we can call him &ldquo;brother.&rdquo; Just a short time ago we did not even know him nor did he know us, but now we have imparted Christ into him and he has become a new man, our brother. We have also baptized this brother into the Triune God. When we call him &ldquo;brother,&rdquo; this cherishes him.</p>
<p>Then you need to nourish him. In order to nourish him, you can tell him: &ldquo;Brother, now the Lord Jesus is within you. He was crucified on the cross years ago, but after He was buried, He resurrected, and in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit. You have to realize that the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit is now within you because I have presented Him to you, and you have called upon Him. When you called on Him, He came into you like the divine air. Jesus as the Spirit is within you. Furthermore, you also have a spirit. The Lord Jesus is the Spirit in your spirit. He is the Spirit, you have a spirit, and these two spirits are now one. You have a mingled spirit. You can realize this mingled spirit by calling on Him.&rdquo; Then you can ask him to call on the Lord with you again. He can call on the Lord with you five times, ten times, or fifteen times. The more he calls, the better. We have the assurance that the more one calls on the Lord, the more sensation he will have within. After he calls in this way, ask him how he feels within. He may say that he feels something very sweet within him. Then you can encourage him to call on the name of the Lord Jesus every morning and throughout the day. Tell him he should learn to call on the name of the Lord continuously. Also, you can share with him that when he encounters any hardship or has any trouble, he can tell the Lord&mdash;&ldquo;O Lord Jesus, I don&rsquo;t feel so good. O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Tell him that he can talk to the Lord and that this is what it means to pray. All of this can be his first lesson immediately after his baptism. In such a meeting right after his baptism, he will be cherished and nourished.</p>
<p>The new believers are cherished and nourished by our having home meetings with them (Acts 5:42). Every home will become sweet by having meetings. Whenever we have meetings with others, we have the Bible with us, we have the Spirit within us, and at the same time the precious blood is ready and available for us to apply. We have these three great provisions: the Bible, the Spirit, and the blood. The Holy Spirit is God Himself, the Holy Bible is God&rsquo;s Word, and the precious blood is for God&rsquo;s redemption. Before people receive the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, their home may be like hell, but when we come to them, bringing them God, God&rsquo;s Word, and God&rsquo;s redemption, that home will become like heaven. Their home will become a sweet home.</p>
<p>We have seen how we need to nourish the new believers with their first lesson immediately after they are baptized. We need to help them to realize that our Savior, Jesus, is today the Spirit indwelling their spirit. Following this, we have to teach them, not in a legal way, but in a very flexible, living, and organic way. We can cherish and nourish the new believers in their homes by bringing them into the practice of exercising their spirit and calling on the Lord (Eph. 6:18a; Rom. 10:12b) and by teaching them the basic truths of God&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<p>Suppose that after you give a new brother the first lesson concerning Christ as the life-giving Spirit indwelling his spirit, he asks you how he can have a happy life. You need to exercise your wisdom to answer such a question. This person just got saved, and he is in the first stage of his Christian life. He knows very little, but he wants to have a happy life. You can tell him, &ldquo;Brother, the reason that we are unhappy is because we have sins, and we are sinful. If you want to be happy, you have to confess your sins.&rdquo; This is a very basic word that he needs. He repented, prayed, and was baptized by you, but he did not have the time to confess all of his sins. He did not even have the knowledge that he needed to do this. This is why you need to take the opportunity to give him this basic lesson of the confessing of sins. You can also give him some instructions concerning how to confess his sins. You can tell him that it is best for him to have a time to confess his sins to the Lord privately. Perhaps you can suggest to him that he can have some time with the Lord after you leave. He can tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, thank You that You are my Savior and that You died for my sins. I want to confess all my sins to You.&rdquo; Then instruct him to confess whatever he feels is sinful or not good. If he feels that he has offended his wife, he can say, &ldquo;Lord, I have offended my wife quite often.&rdquo; If he feels that he owes something to his parents, he can say, &ldquo;Lord, I owe my parents so much.&rdquo; Whatever he feels is sinful or wrong, he can confess to the Lord to receive the cleansing of the blood and the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness.</p>
<p>We should talk to the new believers in such an organic and flexible way. He may interrupt you and say, &ldquo;Suppose that I don&rsquo;t have any feeling of sins or mistakes when I pray to the Lord. What should I do?&rdquo; Then you can say that he needs to ask the Lord to enlighten him by praying, &ldquo;Lord, show me all my sins. Expose me in Your light.&rdquo; You can also read and sing with him a proper hymn related to the confessing of sins. This is the way to cherish and nourish the new believers in their homes.</p>
<p>Through our experiences in the past three or four years, we have learned much. When we first began to visit people with the gospel by knocking on their doors, we did it with much speed to baptize as many people as we could. The more baptisms we had, the happier we were. We saw then that preaching the gospel by knocking on people&rsquo;s doors really works. Later, we discovered that baptizing too many causes much suffering. We may be happy that we baptized so many, but who is going to nourish them? This is why we need to baptize people in a controlled way. In our old way of preaching the gospel, we did not need any control because not many were baptized. In the new way of preaching the gospel by knocking on doors, many are baptized. In Taipei, thirty-eight thousand were baptized within a little over one year. We were only able to adequately take care of about eight thousand of these. This experience taught us a lesson that we should not beget more new ones than we are able to take care of. If a team of three saints baptizes ten, they should stop their preaching and divide these ten new ones into three portions to care for them. They may need to stop door-knocking for two or three months just to take care of the ones under their care.</p>
<p>If your team of three has baptized ten, two saints can each be responsible for three new ones and the other saint for four new ones. When you go back to have home meetings with them, you need a companion. Two saints are sufficient to take care of a home meeting. Since your team is only three saints, what shall you do? There is the need of cooperation in the church life. Besides your team of three, there should be other teams in the church life, so you can share your new ones with them. Two teams for door-knocking can be formed into three teams for home meetings. Two saints can take care of six new ones in the home meetings. It is best at the beginning to visit the newly baptized ones twice a week for the first four to six weeks. If three of your new ones are not promising and will not be remaining fruit, you should go out to baptize some more. Always keep two or three new ones under your care. When you are short of this number, go out to knock on doors and gain more.</p>
<p>The new way to gain people is not difficult, but we have to practice it. In the old way, the saints did not labor much in the gospel. Instead, the church would make a decision at certain times to have a love feast for the preaching of the gospel, and all the saints would endeavor to invite new ones to this time. The new way, however, is a daily way. This is why we need the life before the way. We need to be &ldquo;lifed,&rdquo; and we need to live a daily overcoming life. If we get revived early in the morning and live an overcoming life during the day, this life will urge us to gain people for the Lord. We need to labor in this way to have two or three new ones under our care all the time. They can be established within half a year by our visiting to cherish and to nourish them. I believe that within one year we can have two or three remaining fruit. This needs to be our daily work. If we get six baptized within one year, generally, two out of these six will be remaining fruit if we labor on them.</p>
<p>We should not expect that everyone in the church will do this gospel work, but we do expect that at least one-third would do it. If the elders manage the church well, I believe that sixty percent of the saints may be involved. If thirty-five out of one hundred go out, and they each have two remaining fruit, the church will have a seventy percent increase. I believe, however, that if the church is under the proper leading and the saints are faithful to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the church will double in one year. We should not trust in our past experiences. If we can be trained adequately to practice the new way, the new ones will be more prevailing than we are. After a year they will be able to do what we are doing.</p>
<p>In human society the improvements in education and technology are always picked up by the younger generation. In principle the young people gain more up-to-date knowledge than their parents or grandparents. The improvement in society always continues with the younger generation. It is easy for the younger ones to learn something because they are not occupied with old concepts. This does not mean that the older people in society should be put aside. There is the need of fathers and mothers and grandfathers and grandmothers. We need families with the functions of three generations. It is the same in the church life.</p>
<p>As an older saint, I do not have enough strength to go out and knock on doors. The way to preach the gospel by visiting people and knocking on their doors is mainly for the young and middle-aged saints. The older saints can pray for the ones who are laboring in the gospel. While Joshua was fighting Amalek, Moses held up the rod of God in his hand on the top of a hill, which typifies prayer (Exo. 17:8-13). When Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed, but when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. When the praying stops, the battle is lost. The fighters who knock on doors need the prayers. The older saints should not feel that they are useless. The functions of both Moses and Joshua are needed for the church life. We need the ones who pray and the ones who fight.</p>
<p>I would like to say again that if the leaders manage the church life in a proper way, I believe the church can be doubled yearly. A local church of one hundred saints could increase to one hundred thousand in ten years. This means that this church will increase one thousand times in ten years. Statistics like this expose our real situation and how much time we have wasted. We must admit that to some extent we have delayed the Lord. May the Lord be merciful to us and cause us all to rise up. We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, this is Your way. I want to be revived. I want to live an overcoming life to take Your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To practice this way, a certain number of saints in the church have to pick up the burden to preach the gospel and save sinners by contacting them where they are. We have tried, studied, and experienced many ways to preach the gospel, and there is no other way so prevailing as visiting people by knocking on their doors. This does not mean that visiting people by knocking on their doors is the only way, but it is the best way. Sometimes, according to the situation or circumstances, we may need to have a gospel preaching meeting, but generally speaking, the best way to get sinners saved for the Lord is to visit them.</p>
<p>To preach the gospel in this way, we have to learn the proper techniques. We should not think that we do not need techniques. We need techniques in everything we do. For writing, playing the piano, and speaking there is the need of proper techniques. The work of saving sinners for the Lord is a high and great work, so we need the highest techniques to carry it out. Because we need to learn how to preach the gospel in the highest way, all of the saints need the perfecting.</p>
<p>The church needs to carry out this perfecting work year round. It would be good if the church could have a certain kind of training every month for the perfecting of the saints. Sometimes you may need a training to perfect the sisters for one month, perhaps meeting with them three times a week for four weeks. It is in this way that many of the saints in the recovery will be trained and perfected. To perfect the saints means to equip them and to furnish them. If a young man joins the army, he will be perfected to fight with the proper techniques, and he will be equipped and furnished with weapons, ammunition, and supplies. We have to train the saints in the same way. We did not do much of this kind of perfecting work in the past. All the elders and the co-workers need to reconsider the way that they have managed the church. We have to change our way.</p>
<p>Two hundred years ago, it may have taken one hundred days to travel by mule wagon from New York to California. Today we can fly on a 747 from New York to California in the same day. The way of transportation has been greatly improved. We have been in the old, traditional, and unscriptural way of meeting and serving for years, and we have not seen much result. Shall we remain there? Shall we take the mule wagon or the 747? We have to pick up the improved way, the new way, the scriptural way of meeting and serving. As long as I live and have breath, I will not stop speaking about this until we rise up to take the new way. Sooner or later this new way will be prevailing on the earth. I believe that within five years, most of the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will be practicing this. We must learn to preach the gospel in the best way, the &ldquo;747&rdquo; way.</p>
<p>Some of the saints are very talented in preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes, but they may not be so good at having home meetings. On the other hand, some saints are very good at taking care of home meetings, but they may not have the taste for or the interest in knocking on people&rsquo;s doors. This is a good situation because these two kinds of saints can be matched in the gospel work. The saints who are the experts in knocking on doors to get people baptized can carry out their work, and then they can pass on their fruit, their newly baptized ones, to the saints who are the experts in home meetings. The newly baptized ones that are remaining fruit can be shared as &ldquo;profit&rdquo; between the door-knocking experts and the home meeting experts. The ones who are experts in preaching the gospel by knocking on doors share their fruit with the home meeting experts, and the home meeting experts share the result with the door-knocking experts. The church life is a divine corporation in which all the shareholders share the profits. The elders, however, should not control or organize this matter, taking the excuse that without the elders&rsquo; control, the church would be a mess and full of confusion. It is better to let the church be free to move in the Spirit. Too much control kills, and too much arrangement becomes organizational. This is not organic.</p>
<p>In some places the elders may wonder why the saints have set up so many meetings without their permission. It is absolutely wrong for the elders to do this. The elders should let the saints have the freedom to set up home meetings everywhere. The saints surely have to regard the elders and respect authority, yet for their spiritual activities, they need to follow the Holy Spirit indwelling their human spirit. The saints, on the other hand, should not take this as an excuse for doing things lawlessly. This is wrong. On the one hand, the believers should be orderly, doing everything under the leading, the guidance, and the control of the Holy Spirit and following the indwelling Spirit organically, without being under any organization or arrangement by the human hand. On the other hand, the elders should have much time to pray for the saints. They should manage the situation but not control. They should lead and guide but not rule. To take the lead and to guide is much better and much sweeter than ruling. We need to take care of these two sides. Then we will see a living church that is serving, meeting, and going on all the time with much profit.</p>
<p>There is the need of cooperation among us when we knock on doors to save sinners and when we have home meetings to nourish the newly baptized ones. We need to cooperate with one another according to the situation in our locality. We should learn to be very flexible and have no flesh, no motive, and no opinion. If we do not learn these lessons, the church will suffer. This is why the New Testament teaches us to bear the cross in order to crucify our self and our flesh with all its lusts (Matt. 16:24-25; Gal. 5:24). We have to learn the lessons of the cross by the Spirit. If we do this, we will be brought into a proper serving condition. Then all of us will be serving, and not one among us will be idle. We will see the glorious result, the increase, for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>With the small number of us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today, it is impossible to have the adequate building up of the Body of Christ. We need a bigger number, so we all have to endeavor. This is the burden of us all. All the saints of all ages should bear the same burden to gain people for the building up of the Body of Christ. This is the first step. Without materials, who can build a building? We have to gain the material first. This is why in Haggai the Lord charged His people to go up to the mountain to get material for the building up of His house (1:7-8). We have to go to the mountain&mdash;go to the homes, the villages, and the towns&mdash;to gain materials for the Lord&rsquo;s house.</p><h2 class="head1">HAVING GROUP MEETINGS<br />
WITH THE NOURISHED BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>To save sinners by contacting them where they are and to cherish and nourish the new believers in their homes are the initiation, the beginning, of the way to practice the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery. After these steps, we need to go on to have group meetings with the nourished believers (Heb. 10:25). I consider the group meetings as schools. When parents have a newborn child, they nourish them until they are ready to attend kindergarten at the age of five. Before that time, we consider them as being of preschool age. To have home meetings is to take care of the preschool children. After a certain period of nourishing, they grow up and are ready to receive a spiritual education. This spiritual education takes place in the small groups. Small groups may be composed of a few new families. The number of the small groups may be about ten or twelve, but they should not be over twenty. When our small group is over twenty, it is best to divide that group into two groups. More than eighty percent of the practical church life should be carried out in these group meetings.</p>
<p>We need to have group meetings with the nourished believers according to what is revealed in Hebrews 10:25. I believe that Hebrews 10:25 refers to the group meetings based upon one point: &ldquo;not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together...but exhorting one another.&rdquo; With a bigger meeting, it is almost impossible to exhort one another. Exhorting one another takes place in a smaller meeting. It is easy for a group of less than twenty saints to exhort one another. Hebrews 10:25 must be applied to the group meetings.</p>
<p>The group meetings have three main functions. First, they are for fellowship and prayer (Acts 2:46). In the home of Mark&rsquo;s mother, Mary, a group of saints was praying for Peter, who was in prison at that time (Acts 12:12). After Peter was released, he went to the house of Mary. Acts 12 indicates that there must have been many groups in Jerusalem praying for Peter (v. 5). Second, the group meetings are for teaching, edifying, and gospel preaching (Acts 5:42). Edifying is different from building up. Edifying is mainly to educate for the purpose of building character, not for building up a building. In the small group meetings, there is much edifying work. We also may preach the gospel in the group meetings. Third, the group meetings are for perfecting the young saints to do the work of the ministry, which is the work that the gifted persons do to carry out the New Testament ministry to build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12). In the group meetings we have to edify the new believers to build them up in all the characteristics of the Christian life. We have to educate them, train them, perfect them, equip them, furnish them, to do all kinds of Christian services, helping them to reach the standard of each one of them prophesying, speaking for the Lord. The result of the small group meetings should be that all the attendants will be able to preach the gospel, to have home meetings and group meetings, and to prophesy, to speak for the Lord. This kind of situation can only be produced by the small groups, not by the big meetings or the home meetings.</p>
<p>Because we do not like to have any organization, we do not want to appoint leaders for the group meetings. We need to leave such matters open to the Holy Spirit. We should charge the saints to behave spiritually and to do their duty in bearing their responsibility. The leader of a small group will be manifested according to the Spirit, according to who is bearing the real burden and responsibility. For the church to go on in a prevailing way, there is the need of many group meetings. The more groups there are, the more spreading, increase, and improvement the church will have. Then the church service, the church burden, the church responsibility, will not be limited to the hands of a few elders, but will spread into the hands of many saints.</p>
<p>If we do well in practicing a group meeting, our group may need to be divided two or even four times in a year. If we are meeting with twenty in our group, we may increase to thirty-four. Then we can divide this group into two groups of seventeen. This kind of increase depends upon the gospel preaching. New children need to be begotten in order for the small groups, the schools, to have students. Gospel preaching is for begetting and home meetings are for cherishing and nourishing. Then children are produced for the schools, the group meetings. We need the middle-aged and younger saints who are still full of strength to go out to knock on people&rsquo;s doors for the preaching of the gospel. Then we need to cherish and nourish the new children in the home meetings and place them in the elementary schools, the group meetings. Actually, our small group meetings include students from the &ldquo;elementary&rdquo; stage all the way to the &ldquo;master&rsquo;s degree&rdquo; stage.</p>
<p>The fellowship in this chapter is concerning the details of the practice of the Lord&rsquo;s advanced recovery. I am looking to the Lord desperately to see these three things worked out in the churches: saving sinners, home meetings, and group meetings. The groups are the units to carry out the church life.</p><h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS<br />
OF MUTUALITY</h2>
<p>With these three items&mdash;saving sinners, home meetings, and group meetings&mdash;there is a building up, yet we still need something more. We need all the perfected saints to come together on a larger scale to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, in the church meetings of mutuality (1 Cor. 14:26). According to our study and experience, it is best to have no more than fifty coming together for the church meeting of mutuality. If we have more than fifty, it is hard to practice the universal prophesying. By the universal prophesying, I mean a situation in which every attendant in the meeting is ready to speak.</p>
<p>We have to take advantage of the Lord&rsquo;s Day to have these larger church meetings. If a local church has one hundred saints that meet on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, the wisest way for encouraging all the saints to prophesy is to divide these one hundred into two groups of fifty. These two groups could even meet in the same hall, one upstairs and the other downstairs. This will afford more time and opportunity for all the saints to speak. This speaking will build up the Body of Christ directly. In the New Testament there is a unique chapter that talks about a definite gift that builds up the Body of Christ. This chapter is 1 Corinthians 14, and this gift is the excelling gift of prophesying. Preaching the gospel is for gaining materials for the building up of the Body of Christ. Eventually, these materials will be perfected, equipped, and furnished to speak for Christ. This kind of speaking will minister Christ mutually. We will minister Christ to one another when all are prophesying mutually (1 Cor. 14:24). By our prophesying mutually to minister Christ to one another, we will be nourished, edified, joined closely together, and knit closely together. Furthermore, we will be causing the growth of the Body that the Body might build itself up in love. When all prophesy in the church meetings of mutuality, Ephesians 4:16 will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The New Testament shows us that the early Christians met on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. In Acts 20 Paul arrived at Troas and stayed there for seven days. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day, the saints gathered together to break bread in remembrance of the Lord (v. 7). This indicates that at that time the Christians met on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. In 1 Corinthians 16, Paul directed the saints to separate a certain amount of their income and offer it to God as a gift on the Lord&rsquo;s Day (v. 2). Paul charged the saints to do this on the first day of the week, not on other days. This indicates again that in the early days of the church, the Christians considered the first day of the week to be a special day. It was special because it was separated for them to worship God, to remember the Lord, and to serve Him in many other ways.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on this earth, He went to the synagogues on the Sabbath day because that was the day that the Jews gathered together. The Lord took advantage of their gatherings in the synagogues on the Sabbath day to preach the word of God. He was not for the synagogues, but He used them as an opportunity to speak to the people. We also have to take advantage of the first day of the week, the Lord&rsquo;s Day, to meet with one another. Most of the nations stop their work on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, so we should follow the Lord&rsquo;s pattern to utilize this day. Most people are free on this day, so it is a convenient day for the saints to come together as a bigger group. No other day is as fitting as the Lord&rsquo;s Day for us to worship God, to remember the Lord, and to have a building up meeting.</p>
<p>In the church in Taipei, the saints call the larger meetings of the church &ldquo;district meetings.&rdquo; The saints meet according to the district in which they live geographically. For the sake of convenience, most of these district meetings are in the halls. Some of the districts meet in a small rented place. The saints have home meetings and group meetings during the week, but on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, they come together to do two things: to remember the Lord, to have the Lord&rsquo;s table, for at most one hour and to have a prophesying meeting. After the Lord&rsquo;s table, the saints prophesy one by one. They all function to minister Christ to each other and they receive one another&rsquo;s ministry on Christ as their supply. In this way, they all get nourished and built up. Their speakings for the Lord are not merely testimonies but short messages of about three minutes. Within three minutes we can say much.</p>
<p>All prophesy mutually in the church meetings of mutuality to speak building up, encouragement, and consolation (1 Cor. 14:3). These three items are strong evidences that prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14 is not predicting but speaking forth Christ. Such speaking convicts and judges people (v. 24). Then their real situation is manifested, causing them to worship God and say that God is really among us (v. 25). Prophesying, speaking for God, is for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ (vv. 4-5).</p>
<p>When we fully enter into the scriptural way to practice the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery, the entire church with all the believers will be engaged in the preaching of the gospel to save sinners, the home meetings to nourish the young ones, the small group meetings to carry out the practical church life, and the church meetings of mutuality for the worship of God, the remembrance of the Lord, and the organic prophesying. Eventually, the church will be built up organically as the organic Body of Christ. I believe that within five years this vision will be carried out in many places. It is worthwhile for us to devote ourselves to the Lord to carry out this scriptural way. We need to be both the hearers and the doers of God&rsquo;s word. Our ears are surely blessed to hear these things. Now that we have heard the Lord&rsquo;s speaking concerning His present recovery, we must rise up to bear our responsibility. This scriptural way is totally based upon the Word of God, and it is the God-ordained way. This is also the ancient way, the biblical way, which was practiced by the first group of apostles. This way will keep us out of the unscriptural tradition, and then we will have a complete deviation from Christianity. In other words, we will have a complete exodus from Egypt, and we will be brought fully into the enjoyment of Christ as the good land.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">DESIRING AND LEARNING TO PROPHESY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:31, 24, 1, 39,12, 32; Isa. 12:2-5; Lam. 3:22-26; Luke 1:46-55, 67-79</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw the way to practice the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery. The first step in practicing the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery is to get sinners saved for the Lord. Following this we need to have home meetings with the newly baptized ones, and then we need to group them together to teach them, to perfect them, to equip them, to furnish them, so that they can do the same work that the gifted persons do to build up the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>According to the traditional way of thinking, preaching the gospel is only for certain ones who have the profession of being a preacher, but in the New Testament it is altogether different. The New Testament reveals that each member of the Body of Christ should bear the burden to gain sinners for the Lord. In John 15 the Lord Jesus told us that He is the vine and we are the branches. Bearing fruit is not a particular job for only some branches. All the branches of the vine must bear fruit. In order to bear remaining fruit, we have to go back to the newly baptized ones to meet with them in their homes. These home meetings are for cherishing and nourishing them. Through the home meetings, the new ones will be raised up and established.</p>
<p>The new ones also have to be grouped together so that they can have a life in which they live together with other Christians. In these group meetings, we have to teach them and perfect them in certain things. They may love the Lord and seek after the Lord, but they do not know how to bring people to salvation. We have to train them and perfect them, instructing them how to go out to preach the gospel by knocking on people&rsquo;s doors. This is a kind of particular perfecting, not a general teaching. In Christianity people listen to general sermons and teachings for years, and they still do not know how to serve the Lord. We may give the saints much knowledge in a general way without any particular training or perfecting. In a big congregation, it is hard to train people in a conversational way. If I teach a group of ten or fifteen, we can all converse with one another. The particular perfecting can take place in the small groups. We have to instruct the new ones in a particular way in many things. This carries out eighty percent of the church life. We have to promote their preaching of the gospel, their going to have home meetings with others, and their learning to speak for the Lord.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, three thousand were baptized in the same day. At that time, only the one hundred twenty, who had received the outpoured Spirit, were capable of taking care of these new ones. I believe that these three thousand new ones all met in their homes on the same day because Acts tells us that they met according to houses (2:46). This means that there was a meeting in all the homes of the saints. Among those three thousand, there were at least six hundred homes. Each home may have averaged five persons. I believe that the one hundred twenty took care of these approximately six hundred homes two by two, which means that they would have been divided into sixty teams. That would mean that each team would have had to take care of ten homes in one day. Peter&rsquo;s preaching on the day of Pentecost took place early in the morning (Acts 2:15), so this could have given the one hundred twenty the time to take care of all these homes in one day.</p>
<p>The first example of the church life in Acts 2 shows that every member participated in the church life. Whenever we baptize some new ones, we need to go to their homes immediately to meet with them so that the Lord can have a way to cherish and nourish them. We should not think that only certain ones can function to take care of others. We all have to say, &ldquo;Amen! Hallelujah! We all can do it!&rdquo; When I speak or walk, every part of my body participates in my speaking or walking. The Body of Christ is the same. When the Body acts, all the members participate. This is the church life. Christianity has disabled the members of the Body of Christ, and we all have been subjected to this disabling. Actually, the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery is to recover <em>us.</em> He wants to recover us both corporately and individually. The Lord desires that we be living, able, active, and moving members of His Body. To carry out the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery, there is the need of endeavoring and desperation.</p><h2 class="head1">DEVOTING SIX HOURS A WEEK TO THE LORD</h2>
<p>For the sake of the Lord&rsquo;s present move, we all need to make a budget of our time. We have to separate certain hours and devote these hours to the Lord. Out of seven days, many of us should be able to devote two three-hour time periods of two days to the Lord. Many of us have free time on the weekends, so this may be the proper time that we can devote to the Lord for the present advance of His recovery. We should budget six hours a week and devote them by vowing to the Lord. We can tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, out of all my time during the week, I will return six hours to You for Your interest.&rdquo; We need to budget our time in the same way that we should budget our money. If we do not have a proper budget for our expenses, we will spend our money loosely, and eventually we will be in debt. But if we budget our money, we will spend our money according to our budget, and we will not be in debt. Likewise, if we do not budget our time, it will be wasted.</p>
<p>I told the saints in the past that if we budget our time faithfully, this will cut off much unnecessary telephone talk. When we do not budget our time, we will be so loose and free in the way that we spend our time. To many of the sisters, the telephone is &ldquo;sticky.&rdquo; Once they get on the phone, it is hard for them to get off. We may waste much time on the telephone because we do not have a budget for our time. We should vow to the Lord to spend three hours, two times a week, to go to visit others&rsquo; homes, either for preaching the gospel by knocking on doors, for home meetings, or for grouping the new ones together and having small group meetings. If all the saints in the local churches do this, the issue will be marvelous.</p>
<p>Of the ones we baptized in the past, many may not have remained because we did not go back to care for them faithfully and consistently. If a newborn child does not have a nursing mother to constantly care for him, he will not be able to survive. We must have a change in our practice. We need a present recovery in practicality. If we can devote six hours a week to the Lord, three hours of two days, we will see the results.</p>
<p>Some may decide to devote every Lord&rsquo;s Day afternoon from three o&rsquo;clock to six o&rsquo;clock for knocking on people&rsquo;s doors to preach the gospel. When we go out to preach the gospel, we should not go by ourselves. We must have a team of three. We have to pray, &ldquo;Lord, give me two companions.&rdquo; Of these two companions, at least one should be a sister. On the first afternoon that we go out to preach the gospel, we may not gain anyone, but we should not be disappointed. We must continue to labor. Perhaps when we go out again the next Lord&rsquo;s Day, we still will not gain anyone. What should our attitude be? We have to be strong in our spirit and in our will, and we have to pray much. If we labor patiently, we will reap some fruit for the Lord. Eventually, on the fourth Lord&rsquo;s Day that we go out, we may baptize five new ones into the Triune God. If we labor in the Lord patiently, He will lead us to the ones whom He has chosen. Sometimes the Lord will test us to such an extent that we will not gain anyone after going out to preach the gospel five times. We went out to fish for men, and it seems as if the Lord bade all the fish to stay away from us. In John 21 the disciples fished all night and they caught nothing, but at the Lord&rsquo;s word to cast their net, they caught an abundance of fish. If we labor with the Lord faithfully during the hours that we have devoted to Him, we can have the assurance that we will bear two remaining fruit yearly.</p>
<p>We must make a budget of our time, we must be desperate, and we must endeavor. Paul says in Colossians 1:28-29 that he announced Christ by laboring, struggling, and striving. The Greek word for &ldquo;struggling&rdquo; implies the thought of fighting and battling. Paul struggled according to the operation of Christ, which operated in him in power. This shows that it was not so easy for the Apostle Paul to gain people. His announcing Christ was a battle. In this universe, God desires sinners to be saved, and the Devil is doing everything he can to frustrate this. Because of this fighting between God and His enemy, we have to endeavor. The enemy will do whatever he can to frustrate us from devoting time to the Lord for His gospel service. He may make us feel tired or sick. Sometimes our feeling that we have a cold may be a falsehood from Satan. We need to say, &ldquo;Satan, get away from me. I will not listen to your falsehood. I trust in my God to whom I have vowed these three hours.&rdquo; If we go out in this way by faith, the Lord will take care of us. When we are going out to preach the gospel by knocking on doors, we should not believe the falsehoods of the enemy, which may be feelings that we are tired, that we have no strength, or that we have a cold. We have to endeavor because there is a struggle.</p><h2 class="head1">DEPOSITING OUR TALENT WITH THE BANKERS<br />
AND GIVING FOOD TO THE LORD&rsquo;S HOUSEHOLD</h2>
<p>In Matthew 25 the Lord told us the parable of the talents. Each of us has received at least one talent from the Lord. The Lord has given us a talent, and now we have to use this talent to make some interest for the Lord. We have to contact the bankers and deposit our talent with them (v. 27). We may ask, &ldquo;Who are the bankers?&rdquo; The bankers are the very sinners whom we are going to visit. When we go out to knock on doors and we see the people, we should say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! Here is a banker.&rdquo; We need to deposit our talent with these bankers, and then we will receive some interest. The parable in Matthew 25 says that the one who had five talents and the one who had two talents made interest, but the one who had one talent did not go to the bankers. Instead, he buried his talent. Because he did not gain any interest, he was rebuked by the Lord, and in the coming kingdom age he will suffer a dispensational punishment. This parable in the holy Bible is a serious word. Just as we love John 3:16, we also have to love this parable in Matthew 25. The Lord has invested a lot in us. Now we have to do business for Him by depositing His investment with the bankers. Then we will gain interest for the Lord and be rewarded by Him.</p>
<p>In Matthew 24, the Lord reveals that as the Master, He has set some slaves over His household that they may give food to His household at the appointed time. This giving of food takes place in the home meetings and group meetings. When we go to visit sinners with the gospel by knocking on their doors, we are depositing the Lord&rsquo;s investment with the bankers. When we function in the home meetings and group meetings, we are giving food to the Lord&rsquo;s household at the appointed time. Every day is the appointed time. We have to go to distribute the Lord&rsquo;s rich food to nourish His household. The Lord said, &ldquo;Blessed is that slave whom his master when he comes shall find so doing&rdquo; (v. 46). If the Lord sees us feeding His household at His return, we will be blessed by receiving His reward in the kingdom age. Whether we will be rewarded or punished in the coming kingdom age depends upon how we work in this age. The punishment in the kingdom age will be to be cast out into the outer darkness (25:30), whereas the reward will be to enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s joy and to participate in His kingship (25:23). What we receive in the coming age depends upon how we work for the Lord in this age. We have the Lord&rsquo;s investment so that we can make a deposit with the bankers to gain some interest. We also have the ability to feed others, to distribute His rich food to His household at the appointed time. If we are faithful to serve the Lord in this way, we will receive a reward.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL CAN PROPHESY AND ALL SHOULD PROPHESY</h2>
<p>To knock on doors for the preaching of the gospel is to gain sinners, to invest our talent with the bankers. To have home meetings and small group meetings is to be faithful in distributing the Lord&rsquo;s rich supply to His household at the appointed time. This service to the Lord, though, still has not reached the ultimate point for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The building up of the Body of Christ is fully covered in the Epistles of Paul. First Corinthians 14 is the only chapter in his Epistles which stresses to the uttermost that the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ can be prevailing only by all prophesying.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 13 Paul talked about love as the excelling way for exercising the gifts. In the first verse of chapter fourteen, Paul says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.&rdquo; Prophesying is the excelling gift for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ. In verse 31 Paul says, &ldquo;You can all prophesy one by one,&rdquo; and in verse 24 he says, &ldquo;If all prophesy....&rdquo; We all can prophesy, and we all should prophesy. Paul also indicates in verse 12 that prophesying is something excelling all the other gifts. To prophesy is excelling because it builds up the Body of Christ. Paul dedicated all of 1 Corinthians 14 to promote this and encourage all of the saints to prophesy. At the beginning and at the conclusion of this chapter Paul tells us that we need to desire earnestly to prophesy (vv. 1, 39). For the Lord to gain the organic building up of His Body, we need to pursue and desire to prophesy, seeking to be rich in this excelling gift for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>In the past we did not know the true significance of prophesying. In the Pentecostal movement, there have been many false prophecies about the future. One so-called prophecy among them was that there would be a great earthquake, and the entire city of Los Angeles would go into the ocean. Eventually, there was no fulfillment of this prophecy. Because of the traditional teaching and practice of Christianity, we thought that to prophesy is merely to foretell, or predict. But if we carefully read 1 Corinthians 14, we can see that in this chapter to prophesy is not to predict but to speak for the Lord. When we look at the patterns of prophesying in both the Old and New Testaments, we can see that the saints spoke for the Lord. Luke 1:67 says, &ldquo;Zachariah...was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied.&rdquo; What Zachariah says after verse 67 is his speaking for the Lord. In the New Testament sense, to prophesy mainly means to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, to speak out the Lord, and to speak the Lord into others. Prophesying is the top gift for building up the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Today we are doing something particular, definite, and special for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. For the Lord to build up His Body in an organic way, we must gain sinners by knocking on their doors and have home meetings and group meetings. Millions of sinners may be brought to the Lord, but without the home meetings and group meetings, these new ones have no way to go on with the Lord and become remaining fruit. If we can carry out these steps, we will gain the proper increase for the church life. The Lord desires to build up His organic Body, not a congregation. This is why we stress the group meetings. It would be marvelous to see thousands of small group meetings of fifteen to twenty saints in every local church. There would be many small groups but no congregation as a facade to make a show. The Lord would be able to get the genuine worship in all of these small groups. If we had only the above steps, however, we would still fall short of the building up of the Body of Christ. There would be no practical building up of the Body of Christ organically because we would still be short of prophesying. We need the excelling gift of prophesying. When each one of us is prophesying, the Body of Christ is built up organically. This is surely an advanced recovery.</p>
<p>Throughout the past centuries, item after item of truth and practice have been recovered by the Lord, but the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has always been stopped and frustrated by people&rsquo;s contentment. The British Brethren were greatly used by the Lord, but at a certain point they became contented. They were stopped by being contented with where they were, and the Lord could not go on with them. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been progressing very slowly because of people&rsquo;s contentment.</p>
<p>By 1984 we were somewhat at a standstill, so I realized that we had to be desperate to go on with the Lord. By August of 1988, the Lord showed us that He needs to recover the truth of 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Ephesians 4:11-16. If we are going to have the practice of 1 Corinthians 14:26, of every saint prophesying, we must practice Ephesians 4:11-16. All the gifted persons must rise up to do the perfecting work. The evangelists do not only preach the gospel. They also spend time to perfect the saints to preach the gospel. Suppose an evangelist went to twelve localities and spent one month in each locality to perfect and to train the saints to preach the gospel. The result would be marvelous. In addition to being perfected to preach the gospel, we need to be perfected in cherishing and nourishing the new ones in home meetings and in teaching them in the small group meetings. Eventually, we all need to be perfected to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, in the larger meetings of the church. When we are all trained and perfected to prophesy one by one, the Body of Christ will be organically built up. This is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today.</p>
<p>The fellowship in this book presents the vision, the view, of the Lord&rsquo;s present, advanced recovery. Now we have to endeavor to get sinners saved for the Lord and to go to their homes to have home meetings with them in order to cherish them, nourish them, and raise them up. We have to endeavor to have small group meetings to educate, teach, instruct, perfect, equip, and furnish the new ones so that they will be enabled to do everything necessary for the carrying out of the church life. Finally, we have to endeavor to reach the point where all the saints have something of Christ to offer by prophesying in the larger meetings of the church according to the principle of 1 Corinthians 14:26. By this scriptural way, each one of us will be built up organically, and the Lord Jesus will be happy because He will be able to have something built up on this earth as His Body to be His bride so that He can come back.</p>
<p>Brother Nee saw that we needed to practice 1 Corinthians 14:26 over fifty years ago, in 1937. This fellowship is in his book <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em> At that time, however, we did not find a way to practice it. Brother Nee said in his book <em>Church Affairs</em> that to have a church meeting in which one person speaks to a big congregation is according to the customs of the nations (2 Kings 17:8&mdash;NASB) and that we should not maintain such a meeting. He told us that the traditional way of meeting had become a habit rooted deeply within us. He also told us that we had to have something better to replace this traditional way of meeting before we stopped it. Otherwise, the saints would stop coming to the meetings. Brother Nee shared these things and strongly stressed them in 1948. Soon after his fellowship, the communists took over mainland China. Brother Nee was put into prison, and I was sent to Taiwan, so we did not have the time to practice his fellowship.</p>
<p>Whenever I consider our history, I regret that we did not endeavor to put his fellowship into practice when I first came to the United States. We did not endeavor to practice it until we had drifted into a dormant situation, and we were forced to reconsider our way. It was in August of 1988 that one word came to me&mdash;<em>organic&mdash;</em> and I saw the Lord&rsquo;s desire in 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4. From that time, my burden has been focused on these two chapters. The more I speak on these portions of the Word, the more I have to speak.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO PROPHESY</h2>
<p>The conclusion of the scriptural way to build up the Body of Christ is that we all have to learn to prophesy. First Corinthians 14:31 says, &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn.&rdquo; Since the ones who listen to our prophesying learn, then we who prophesy must learn first. If we do not learn anything, we cannot teach others that they may learn something. A professor&rsquo;s students can learn much from him because he has learned much. Many of us have been in the church for years, but we have never been taught nor have we learned how to prophesy.</p>
<p>To learn we must first have a desire. If someone does not have the appetite or desire to learn, he will not learn. We must have a desire and a strong will to carry out our desire. It is easy to be a &ldquo;traditional Christian.&rdquo; We can just &ldquo;go to church&rdquo; every Sunday, and let others who are professionals serve for us. But today the Lord is recovering His interest on this earth. He is recovering the organic building up of His Body, the perfecting by the gifts of all the saints that they may do the same work of the New Testament ministry that the gifted ones do to build up the Body of Christ, and the church meeting in mutuality. The Lord is endeavoring to intercede for us so that He can recover these matters. Now we have to endeavor to practice His scriptural way. We have to pray, and we have to endeavor to learn how to be strengthened to save sinners by contacting them where they are. Then we have to dedicate ourselves and devote some of our time to the Lord to take care of home meetings and group meetings. Also, we have to endeavor to learn how to prophesy.</p>
<p>First, in order to prophesy we must be persons who have been saturated and soaked with the holy Word. Nearly every phrase and every point of Mary&rsquo;s short prophesying in Luke 1:46-55 is a quotation from the Old Testament. This proves that Mary, a young woman, was soaked in the Word. This is why the Lord chose her to be the mother of the Man-Savior. The Lord Jesus was born into a family that was full of the knowledge and love of God&rsquo;s holy Word. Mary&rsquo;s example shows us that if we are going to prophesy, we must get into the Word, being saturated and soaked with the Word to become one with the Word.</p>
<p>Second, in order to learn to prophesy, we must be ready in the spirit to have the inspiration of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 14:32). A ready spirit is a spirit that is always one with the Lord, the Spirit, fellowshipping with Him, remaining with Him, and abiding in Him. When we have such a ready spirit, we can have the spiritual inspiration at any time. We can even tell the Lord: &ldquo;Please give me the inspiration. I am ready in my spirit, and I have to prophesy.&rdquo; To prophesy, we need the knowledge of the Word and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. The knowledge of the Word is constant, and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is instant. The instant inspiration depends upon our constant readiness. We have to be constantly ready in our spirit to receive the instant inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>If we only have the knowledge of the Word and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, we still will not be able to prophesy. We need to have a clear view to see through all things in all situations. We will not know what to say without a vision. We need to have a clear sky all the time. We need to be sober in our mind and in our spirit. We need a clear view concerning the Lord&rsquo;s interest on this earth, concerning His Body, concerning the local churches, concerning the individual saints, and even concerning ourselves.</p>
<p>If we have the three items mentioned above, we can prophesy at any time. With a clear view to see, we have something to speak. We also have the ability to speak because we have the knowledge of the Word for the utterance and the proper expressions. Furthermore, we have the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. When we speak with these three elements, our speaking is the speaking of the Lord and the speaking forth of the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PATTERNS OF PROPHESYING</h2>
<p>The patterns of prophesying can be seen with Isaiah and Jeremiah in the Old Testament and with Mary and Zachariah in the New Testament. Isaiah&rsquo;s prophesying in Isaiah 12:2-5 is not foretelling. He speaks the Lord in these verses: &ldquo;Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation. Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted. Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth.&rdquo; In this portion of the Word, Isaiah speaks the Lord, speaks forth the Lord, and speaks the Lord into all of us. When we read this portion from Isaiah, we have the feeling that Isaiah has spoken the Lord into us.</p>
<p>Jeremiah&rsquo;s speaking in Lamentations 3:22-26 is another pattern of prophesying: &ldquo;It is of the Lord&rsquo;s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. The Lord is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. The Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him. It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord.&rdquo; Jeremiah told us that it is of the Lord&rsquo;s mercies that we are not consumed. This is not foretelling but blessing, well-speaking. He told us that the mercies, the compassions, of the Lord are new every morning. We need to learn to prophesy in this way. Jeremiah told the Lord, &ldquo;Great is thy faithfulness.&rdquo; There is a well-known hymn based upon this verse (<em>Hymns,</em> #19). Jeremiah also said that the Lord was his portion. It is marvelous that there was a prophet in the Old Testament who knew that the Lord was his portion. When we tell others that the Lord is our portion, we are speaking the Lord to them.</p>
<p>We have already seen how both Mary and Zachariah spoke for the Lord in Luke 1. Their speaking in this portion of the Word (vv. 46-55, 67-79) is prophesying. They were saturated with the holy Word, they had the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and they had a clear view.</p>
<p>In October of 1988, I began to teach the saints in Taipei how to prophesy. Taipei has over one hundred district meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day with about fifty saints in each district meeting. Fifty is a good number because it gives all the saints more of an opportunity to prophesy. The saints are in a particular book of the New Testament, and each week they cover one chapter from this book. The brothers divide this chapter into six portions for six days of the week, and the saints use these portions each day for morning watch. Each portion may have about six to seven verses, and two of these verses are chosen for the saints to pray-read that they may enjoy the Lord in His Word.</p>
<p>I told the saints to write down a short reminder of what the Lord inspires them with each morning. After Saturday morning the saints will have six notes of the inspiration that they received during the week. I shared with them that on Saturday evening they can pray-read these six inspirations. When the saints add these six inspirations together, they will have a total inspiration. They can then compose a prophecy with this total inspiration. Some of the brothers function as tutors or coaches to help the saints compose their prophecy. These brothers may advise them to adjust their prophecy so that it is close to three minutes long. If their prophecy is too short, they will be asked to lengthen it. If it is too long, they will be asked to shorten it. The brothers also help the saints with the form and content of their prophecy.</p>
<p>On the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, the saints pray to get their spirit prepared. They go to the meeting with the prophecy they have prepared and with a living and ready spirit. When the saints come together in their districts on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, each one has something. The saints are so happy to speak when they labor in this way. In the past we may have charged the saints to speak, to function, but they did not know what to speak or how to function. With this kind of practical perfecting today, the saints know what to speak, they are learning how to function, and they are looking forward to the meeting so that they can grasp an opportunity to speak for the Lord. The saints are ready to speak when they come to the meeting like runners ready to run in a one hundred yard dash. The saints in Taipei have been practicing this, and they have testified that this way to prophesy is rich, high, and living.</p>
<p>I would like to recommend this way to all the local churches. If we decide to go through the Epistles of Paul, covering about one chapter a week, we can finish them in about two years. If we take this way, within two years the saints will be greatly edified and built up organically. This practice of all prophesying will bring in the organic building up of the Body of Christ. We need to consider this practical way to help the saints prophesy, but we should not do it legally.</p>
<p>The elders may be excited about the fellowship in this book and may be eager to practice it, but we should not practice it too fast. We should do everything gradually. We still need to keep the big meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to have the Lord&rsquo;s table and to have a time to practice the mutual speaking. In the initial stage this meeting may not be so rich. The leading ones should prepare something to share at the end of the meeting for ten or fifteen minutes in order to strengthen and enrich the meeting and satisfy the attendants. In this way we can keep the attendants, and gradually they will learn to prepare something to prophesy and speak mutually in the meetings. At a certain time, when the brothers feel that the time is ripe, the church can practice what I have fellowshipped above. We should not do this suddenly but gradually. It may take six months to a year for the leading ones to prepare the situation and help the saints get used to a meeting that is in full mutuality. We should not have a sudden change of our present situation in the church life. To change our practice suddenly is to ask the saints to &ldquo;jump from the fifth floor.&rdquo; Instead we must lead the saints to take the &ldquo;stairway&rdquo; so that they can gradually be brought into the Lord&rsquo;s scriptural way. Eventually, the saints will be ready to have a complete change, and we will not lose anyone. I hope that the Lord will give us the wisdom to practice the scriptural way so that He can have the present advance of His recovery.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">FOLLOWING THE LORD IN HIS MOVE<br />
ACCORDING TO HIS SPEAKING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:1-5, 12, 23-25, 31, 39</h1>
<p>In this chapter and the next chapter, we shall fellowship concerning the Lord&rsquo;s move and the present need of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. First, in this chapter we shall see our need for prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ. In recent years I have traveled much and have observed the situation among us. I have also studied the Word and studied our history. The consummation of my observations and study is a realization of the importance of prophesying. The Lord&rsquo;s move today, the new way, consummates in the building up of the Body of Christ, and the way to build up the Body is by prophesying. The revelation of the divine dispensing in the entire Bible consummates in the matter of prophesying.</p>
<p>In the Bible, to prophesy does not mainly mean to predict, to foretell. To prophesy primarily means to speak something for God and to speak forth God to others, to speak to dispense Christ into others. First Corinthians 14:3 says, &ldquo;But he who prophesies speaks to men building up and encouragement and consolation&rdquo; (Gk.). This verse does not say that he who prophesies foretells or predicts. Building up, encouragement, and consolation are not foretelling. Building up concerns the Body of Christ, encouragement concerns our goal, which is the building up of the Body of Christ, and consolation concerns our personal welfare related to our goal. Prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14 refers to these three things rather than foretelling.</p>
<p>Verses 24 and 25a say, &ldquo;But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all; the secrets of his heart become manifest.&rdquo; This verse does not say that when all prophesy, the unbeliever or unlearned person receives foretelling. Prophesying causes people to be convicted and judged and makes the secrets of their hearts manifest. Prophesying in this way is for the building up of the Body of Christ (vv. 12, 26).</p>
<p>In 1963 certain Pentecostal saints in Los Angeles announced that there would be a great earthquake and that the whole city would fall into the ocean. However, this never happened. The same kind of prophecy was made the next year in San Francisco. This is not to prophesy in the biblical way. The Old Testament book of Isaiah is a book of prophecy, but there is not much foretelling in that book. Rather, the sixty-six chapters of Isaiah are full of the speaking for God and the speaking forth of God to us. Even those prophecies which are foretelling convey much speaking for God. Isaiah 7:14 says, &ldquo;Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.&rdquo; This is a foretelling, but it speaks forth something of God to us. The proper prophesying, even in the sense of foretelling, speaks something concerning God into our being.</p>
<p>To prophesy is to speak God as the very nourishing element into others. Isaiah 7:14 is a foretelling spoken about seven hundred years before Christ. Yet still today, the more we pray-read it, the more we are nourished. We may pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, thank You. You are my God, yet You became a child in the womb of the virgin. After You were born, people called You Immanuel, God with us!&rdquo; When we read this verse again and again, we may not have much thought of the foretelling, but we are nourished. This nourishment is God&rsquo;s dispensing into us. When we read the Bible not merely with our mind for our understanding but by pray-reading, every word becomes life dispensed into our spirit that we may receive the rich nourishment. As a result of this dispensing, we grow, and this growth is the addition of the Triune God to the Body of Christ. In its initial stage, the Body of Christ may be like a small baby, but after much nourishing, the Body will grow with the addition of God. This dispensing for nourishment takes place by prophesying.</p><h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING FOR GOD&rsquo;S DISPENSING</h2>
<p>God has a plan, an eternal purpose, which He made in eternity past for eternity future (Eph. 3:11). The New Testament speaks of the dispensation, the economy, of God (Eph. 1:10; 1 Tim. 1:4). Economy is an anglicization of the Greek word <em>oikonomia,</em> which is composed of the words <em>oikos,</em> meaning house, and <em>nomos,</em> meaning law. An economy is the law of a household and denotes an administration according to a certain arrangement. This arrangement is a dispensation for the carrying out of an administration. God&rsquo;s dispensation is His arrangement, His plan, for dispensing the riches of Christ into God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s administration is a family matter. In ancient times, the administration among large families was mainly for distributing the food, the necessities, to all the members of the family. Our God has the biggest family in the universe. God has a family plan to distribute all His rich provision to His children. His rich provision is altogether embodied in a person, the Second of the Trinity, Christ. All the riches of the Godhead and the fullness of the Godhead are embodied in Christ. God&rsquo;s family plan, God&rsquo;s family administration, is to distribute, to dispense, all the divine riches in Christ into His saved ones for their nourishment and feeding, resulting in the building up of the Body of Christ. Today we are under God&rsquo;s economy to enjoy His rich distribution.</p>
<p>We are now under God&rsquo;s dispensing, and this dispensing is by prophesying. Prophesying is the unique way, the best way, the excelling way, to dispense all the riches of Christ into God&rsquo;s people for the building up of the organic Body of Christ. The dispensing of the riches of Christ by prophesying can be illustrated by the dispensing of food by a mother. Day by day a mother distributes, or dispenses, food to her little baby until he becomes a strong and husky boy. The little baby becomes such a big boy by the distributing of rich food. To prophesy is to distribute, to dispense, the Triune God as the rich food, the nourishing element, into others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EACH ONE SPEAKING</h2>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 14, prophesying should not be by only one speaker. Verse 26 says, &ldquo;What is it then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.&rdquo; Each one has. You have something and I have something. We all have something ready to speak by prophesying.</p>
<p>Those in the denominations who have a pastor listen to him week after week. After listening one time, they may feel good about him, but after listening to him for half a year, they may become bored, and he will become tired. He may be afraid to speak every week; it is hard to prepare a message with many stories, illustrations, quotations, and references. This kind of dispensing can be compared to one person trying to feed five hundred people with a single dish. Recently I attended a meeting in which many saints spoke. It was a feast for me to listen to each one. Each one spoke for less than three minutes with good content. In their speaking there were strong points which were not according to natural, traditional theology. Every one spoke on a particular point of the revealed Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN WAY TO MEET AND SERVE</h2>
<p>Many people have the concept that the way Christians meet to worship God is to come together on Sundays to listen to a hired, learned preacher or pastor. This is the natural concept, and this natural practice has become the habitual and traditional way of many Christians. In 1937 Watchman Nee, the senior co-worker among us, called a special meeting in Shanghai for the leading co-workers. These messages were published in the book <em>Rethinking Our Mission,</em> which he later translated in England as <em>Concerning Our Mission,</em> and which have been published in America as <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em> In these messages he said that the scriptural way for the church to meet was in 1 Corinthians 14:26, but we did not find a way to practice what he saw. Eleven years later in 1948, Brother Nee held a four-month training in which he gave a series of messages which has been published in <em>Church Affairs.</em> In these messages he pointed out that the way of Christianity, the traditional service with one man speaking and the rest listening, is according to &ldquo;the customs of the nations&rdquo; (2 Kings 17:8&mdash;NASB). He told us that this way of meeting should be stopped and replaced. He said that we should push against the pressure of tradition. Twice in his life the leading co-worker among us strongly spoke concerning the traditional way of meeting, but we did not find the way to practice what he taught.</p>
<p>In October of 1984, I finished the Life-study of the New Testament and the writing of the notes for the Recovery Version. At that time I realized that our way of meeting and serving in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery was old, traditional, natural, and according to habit. I stopped my work in this country and went back to Taiwan to study our situation. At that time I felt that I could not do much to help the churches in the United States. After a model church life would be raised up in Taiwan, I planned to return to the United States with a new way for the church life.</p>
<p>Because I realized that the way of meeting in the Bible was not like the old, traditional way, I began to reconsider the entire New Testament related to Christian meeting and service. I discovered that according to the New Testament record, the way ordained by God for Christians to serve and meet is absolutely different from our common practice. I determined that the old practice among us must be ended and that I must release to God&rsquo;s people what I had seen in the New Testament. I must let them know that at the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s time it was not as it is today. Our way of service and meeting has been altogether old, natural, habitual, and traditional.</p><h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL FOR THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>In the fall of 1986, we started to have a formal training in Taipei because there were at least three or four hundred college graduates who desired to give their time to serve the Lord. That training was my laboratory for experimenting with what I had studied in the Bible. We discovered that four things are crucial for the new way: the preaching of the gospel, the home meetings, the small group meetings, and the church meetings.</p>
<p>For the new way, we must preach the gospel. We should not merely meet in our halls, but we must go out to visit people for the purpose of preaching the gospel. That was why we began to visit people for the gospel by knocking on their doors. In Taipei about seven hundred saints among us went out to preach the gospel for about one and a half years. By October of 1987 we had baptized thirty-eight thousand. We discovered that by knocking on twenty doors we could find one son of peace (Luke 10:6).</p>
<p>According to a recent article in a Southern Baptist newspaper, that denomination plans to train eighty-nine thousand of their lay members, mostly young people, to visit people for the gospel. They plan for one million persons to be saved in two months and for seventy thousand to be baptized. For eighty-nine thousand to bring one million people to salvation in two months means that every person will gain, on the average, about one and a quarter persons a week. This is the same statistic that we discovered through our experience in Taiwan. I would like to see them succeed. Perhaps after not too long a time, many denominations will pick up this practice. This newspaper article said that to preach the gospel by visiting people where they are is according to the New Testament plan and will never be improved upon. This is the God-ordained and God-initiated plan. Who can improve upon God&rsquo;s invention? Visiting people for the gospel by knocking on their doors is not the only way to preach the gospel; the gospel can be preached in a hundred ways. However, this way is the top way.</p>
<p>In order to study our situation, I collected statistics. By these statistics I found out that many of the denominations, especially in England and the United States, have been decreasing in number for over fifteen years. All the denominations are studying how to go on. It seems that the traditional way has brought them to a dead end. They cannot go on. We also have been somewhat at a standstill, but now we must change and drop the old way. Visiting people for the gospel by knocking on their doors is the first matter that is crucial for the new way, and by our experimenting we have found that this is the excelling way to preach the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO PROPHESY</h2>
<p>The other matters that are crucial for the new way are the home meetings, the small group meetings, and the church meetings. Recently the Lord impressed us that we need meetings full of mutuality according to 1 Corinthians 14:26. The way to have these meetings is in 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4. It is by prophesying through the perfecting of the gifted persons (Eph. 4:11-12). First Corinthians 14 is a strong encouragement by the apostle for us to learn, to practice, and to desire earnestly to prophesy. To prophesy is the top way and the unique way to have a meeting full of mutuality. Prophesying is the way to meet according to 1 Corinthians 14:26. &ldquo;Each one has&rdquo; something by prophesying.</p>
<p>However, even if we desire to prophesy, we will not be able to without learning. We have to be instructed, and we have to practice according to what we have been instructed. I have bought a number of pianos, and I have composed a number of hymns, but I cannot play the piano. The pianos are here, but not everyone can play them. However, if we desire to play the piano, we can. We all can play the piano, but we have to be under a tutor and learn how to use our fingers properly, and we have to practice for years. We must spend the time and energy to learn and to practice. Some may say that to learn is too hard. They may say that if learning to prophesy is like learning to play the piano, they will not be able to make it. However, it is not that hard. If you are under the proper instruction and practice for only two months, you will prophesy quite well.</p>
<p>Some may say that because they were not born with eloquent speaking ability, they cannot learn to prophesy. However, as long as we can speak a natural language, we can also prophesy, which is to speak the divine language. It is not too hard. If we do not care to be instructed or to practice, we will remain in the old way, the traditional way of Christianity, the way of hiring a professional speaker to speak for us while we sit in a pew. We will become &ldquo;pew members&rdquo; of the church. We cannot be built up, and we cannot minister anything to build up others in this way. This is the wrong way. This is absolutely not according to the Bible. We must put it away and come back to the Bible. Let us all be faithful to the very One whom we love. We have to be faithful to learn to prophesy.</p>
<p>Many of the older saints in Taipei were saved through the message meetings of the church, the meetings in which one speaker gives a message, and their church life experience for many years has been related to the message meetings. When I first returned to Taipei in 1984, many of the saints expected that I would give them more messages. However, they soon became apprehensive because they learned that I wanted to stop this way of meeting. They thought that there would no longer be a place to meet and listen to messages. Because a good foundation had been built up in our relationship, these saints did not oppose what I was doing. However, they were apprehensive and privately spoke to one another about it.</p>
<p>I did not ask them to stop their way of meeting right away. Instead, for over three years, from October of 1984 to November of 1987, I tried my best to prepare them and help them to realize their need. Then in November of 1987 I told them that we should combine the meetings of the full-time trainees with the local saints and discontinue the message meetings. We should instead practice meeting according to 1 Corinthians 14:26. At that time about four thousand saints were meeting in large congregations in twenty-three halls, so we divided them into one hundred district meetings, each with about forty to fifty saints. Because the saints had been prepared, they were not troubled. They all began to practice a new way of meeting.</p>
<p>Then I charged them to learn. First Corinthians 14:31 says, &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged.&rdquo; We prophesy that others may learn. Therefore, before we prophesy, we have to learn. A professor of mathematics must first have learned mathematics before he can teach his students. We cannot prophesy without learning. If we have never learned something, we will not be able to teach it to others.</p>
<p>To help the full-time trainees and co-workers to learn to prophesy, I showed them how to compose a three minute word of prophecy. Every day we contact the Lord in the morning by pray-reading at least two verses. At that time we enjoy something, and we see something of the Lord. Each morning we can record what we have enjoyed and seen in a notebook. By Saturday of every week we will have recorded our &ldquo;harvest&rdquo; of the past six days. On Saturday night we can look at our notes and combine them into a single point to be used as the subject for our prophesying. We should compose something in spoken form and practice it. If it takes more than three minutes, we should shorten it. When the full-timers and co-workers in Taipei began to practice this, they had a success. If those trainees could do it, we all can do it also. This will not only enrich the meetings, but also increase the meetings. Recently I learned that in Taipei the number of saints in the district meetings has gone up to five thousand.</p>
<p>In the old way of meeting in the church in Taipei, there were only twenty-three speakers in the twenty-three halls, only twenty-three distributors of the riches to four thousand people. Now in the new way, one third of the attendants prophesy. Out of about five thousand saints meeting together there are close to seventeen hundred speakers. Instead of twenty-three dispensers, there are now seventeen hundred dispensers.</p>
<p>If one-third of those in a meeting of fifty saints speak, there can be seventeen speakers. How many riches could one speaker alone have? One may be rich, but his riches cannot equal the riches of seventeen speakers. One speaker can only serve one &ldquo;dish,&rdquo; but seventeen speakers can serve a seventeen course feast with many riches.</p>
<p>Many of us have experienced that the best meetings are the meetings in which we speak. When we do not speak in a meeting, we may consider that the meeting was not so good. Even if the meeting was good for others, it was not good for us because we did not speak. Even if a meeting is poor for others, it will be a good meeting for us if we speak in it. If a brother speaks in a meeting and his wife asks him how the meeting was, he will say it was wonderful. If he did not speak in the meeting, he may tell his wife it was a poor meeting. The meeting became poor simply because he did not speak. When we speak, the first ones who get nourished are ourselves. We speak to others, but we feed ourselves. There is a rich benefit in speaking.</p>
<p>It is not hard to learn to prophesy, and it is profitable to the entire church. It is profitable to every attendant, especially to ourselves. Prophesying will change our life. If we speak one time in the church meeting, our life will be changed. When we return from a meeting, we may find something disturbing at home. If we did not speak in the meeting, we may immediately lose our temper. However, after speaking in the meeting, something will remind us that we have just spoken, and this will restrain us from losing our temper.</p>
<p>The new way is the Lord&rsquo;s move today. In every age the Lord moves and works according to His plan, and His moving is by His speaking. For God&rsquo;s move there is always His present speaking. In this age God is also moving, and for His work and move He is speaking according to His holy Word. What we are speaking here is absolutely according to the Bible. We all have to rise up to follow the Lord in His present move according to His present speaking. I hope that we all will receive help from the fellowship in this book and will learn to prophesy.</p><h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING&mdash;SPEAKING WITH THE DIVINE ELEMENT</h2>
<p>The book of 1 Corinthians begins with the enjoyment of Christ as our portion (1:9) and consummates with prophesying. In chapter 14 Paul exalts prophesying as the goal and consummation of this long Epistle. Because prophesying is such a great matter, we must endeavor to practice it.</p>
<p>Prophesying is the carrying out of God&rsquo;s oracle, God&rsquo;s divine speaking. Prophesying is different from the testimonies which we have given in the past. In the past, our sharing and testimonies were a repetition of a message which had just been given. Now we have much speaking instead of a message, but we must realize that the speaking should be divine. To prophesy is not to speak ordinary words. To prophesy is to speak something divine with and in the element of God&rsquo;s divinity. Therefore, in our prophesying there must be the element of God&rsquo;s divinity. Without the divine element our speaking is not prophesying.</p>
<p>Many among us have had a turn in our way of speaking, but we still need to pay much attention to the divine element for our speaking. The more of the divine element there is in our speaking, the more our speaking is prophesying. If I speak something without the divine element, my speaking is not prophesying. To prophesy is to speak something divine in the divine way with the divine element.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THIRTEEN TERMS RELATED TO PROPHESYING</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 14 there are thirteen terms used by the Apostle Paul to encourage, charge, and compel us to prophesy. Paul uses five verbs: pursue, desire, seek, excel, and learn. He mentions six results when all prophesy: building up, encouragement, consolation, convicting, judging, and making manifest the secrets of the hearts. Finally, he says we need to use two organs to prophesy&mdash;our mind and our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Pursuing and Desiring</h2>
<p>In verse 1 Paul says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.&rdquo; In this verse the verbs &ldquo;pursue&rdquo; and &ldquo;desire&rdquo; are used. In Greek the word for pursue has the meaning of persecute. Our pursuing must be like a persecuting. To desire earnestly means to be eager to obtain.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that we must pursue and desire earnestly to prophesy, but this has been neglected and missed by Christians for centuries. In the Pentecostal movement, the manifestation of the gifts, including prophesying, is talked about, but prophesying is interpreted in that movement as predicting, foretelling. As we have seen, to prophesy, especially in 1 Corinthians 14, does not mainly mean to predict, to foretell, but rather to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord to others. This is to speak God into others. In our prophesying we minister Christ into people, we dispense the very Christ whom we have received, experienced, and enjoyed to others. Thus, prophesying denotes the divine speaking, the divine oracle, not only in the New Testament but also in the Old Testament. As we have pointed out earlier, the foretelling in Old Testament books such as Isaiah and Jeremiah does not occupy many chapters. Most of the chapters in these books are the speaking for God and the speaking forth of God. Therefore, the Old Testament also is God&rsquo;s oracle, that is, the divine speaking, with the divine element. If we only speak something ordinary and natural, we do not need to pursue. We have been born with the ability to speak, but in order to prophesy we must learn how to have the divine element and mingle it with our speaking in the divine way. This is why we have to pursue prophesying with the divine element, desiring it earnestly and being eager to obtain it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeking, Excelling, and Learning</h2>
<p>Verse 12 says, &ldquo;So also you, since you are zealots of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the building up of the church.&rdquo; We pursue and desire in order to excel. Whatever else we pursue and obtain may be low. Speaking in tongues is a spiritual gift, but it is a lower gift. It is not an excelling gift. However, to prophesy with the divine element in the divine way is excelling and high.</p>
<p>Verse 31 speaks of learning. It says, &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged.&rdquo; In order to know how to prophesy, we should study the words pursue, desire, seek, excel, and learn. Do not take this matter lightly. To learn to prophesy is a weighty lesson. We all have to pursue it, desire to obtain it, and seek after it. To prophesy is to excel, so we are pursuing an excelling matter. Therefore, we have to learn.</p><h2 class="head2">Building Up, Encouraging, and Consoling,<br />
and Convicting, Judging, and Making Manifest</h2>
<p>As we have mentioned before, verse 3 says that to prophesy is to speak the building up of the Body of Christ, encouragement for the divine goal, and consolation for the saints. This is further evidence that in this chapter to prophesy is not to foretell. We have also seen that, according to verses 23 through 25, to prophesy is to convict and judge people, to convince them that they are sinful and have done something against God, and to make the secrets of their heart manifest.</p>
<p>We should study these terms related to prophesying. By his use of these terms, we can see that the Apostle Paul considered prophesying to be the consummation of all his teachings. Paul taught many things, but all his teachings consummate in his word that we can all speak for God, we can all prophesy one by one (v. 31). Paul wrote fourteen Epistles, and by God&rsquo;s sovereignty they have been preserved for many centuries. They have now come into our hands and have been translated into our language. This was not simply so that we might be saved, edified, perfected, transformed, conformed, and eventually glorified. It was so that we would speak as Paul did, that is, that we would prophesy.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I have been speaking in this country for over a quarter of a century. Many have been learning of me, and the goal of their learning is that they would speak what I am speaking. A professor&rsquo;s teaching consummates in the students&rsquo; ability to teach as he does. I am teaching you what I have learned from Paul, and the goal, the consummation, of my teaching is that many would repeat the speaking of Paul which I am speaking. To prophesy, to make all the believers prophets, is the consummation of the teaching of the entire New Testament concerning the divine dispensing. In 1 Corinthians 14:31 Paul said, &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one,&rdquo; and in verses 23 through 25 he said, &ldquo;If therefore the whole church comes together...if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all; the secrets of his heart become manifest; and so falling on his face, he will worship God, reporting that God is really among you.&rdquo; Paul desired that you and I would all speak for God, that is, that we would all prophesy.</p>
<p>With this in view, we must realize that the old, traditional way of meeting must be put aside. The apostle did not desire to see one person speaking and the rest listening. What the apostle desired was that each of the believers would be like him, that we would all prophesy in the way he did. He desired that his teaching would consummate in our prophesying.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Exercising Our Mind and Our Spirit</h2>
<p>If we are going to pursue, desire, obtain, and seek this excelling matter, we have to learn, and this learning involves two organs of our being. We must exercise our mind, and we must also exercise our spirit. Paul said, &ldquo;I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray also with the mind&rdquo; (v. 15b). He also said, &ldquo;In the church I would rather speak five words with my mind that I might instruct others also&rdquo; (v. 19). To prophesy requires a very good, sober mind, a mind that not only understands but also remembers what it understands. Often when young ones are sharing, they forget what they should say in their speaking. When they forget, they may say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Whenever one does this, he indicates that his memory is weak. He forgot what he wanted to speak and got lost in his speaking, so he tries to cover his forgetting by calling on the Lord. After calling several times, he may give up because he simply cannot remember what he wanted to speak. We must learn to use our mind, training it to cooperate with our spirit.</p>
<p>We have to exercise our spirit because our spirit is where the divine oracle is, but this divine oracle needs our human cooperation. To exercise our mind is our human cooperation with God. If we exercise a sober mind and a very clear spirit, we will be qualified to learn to prophesy, that is, to speak for Christ, to speak forth Christ, and to speak Christ into people, to minister and dispense the Christ whom we enjoy into others. Prophesying in this way should be the main practice in the church meetings. It is by such prophesying that the organic Body of Christ can be built up organically.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>

<h1 class="title">A TIMELY WORD<br />
CONCERNING THE PRESENT NEED<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:26; Eph. 4:11-16</h1>
<p>In this chapter I would like to fellowship concerning the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s move today. As I mentioned in the previous chapter, a burden came to me in October of 1984 concerning the situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery at that time. I was burdened to go to Taiwan to study our way of meeting and service, and to experiment with a new way. At first I was not clear what the Lord would lead us into, but I was burdened. According to my observation, the recovery had fallen into a situation of oldness and had become stale.</p>
<p>I spent time to research the statistics concerning Christianity. Through those statistics I came to the conclusion that all of Christianity, including Catholicism, the Protestant denominations, and the free groups, had come to a standstill in every way. In the last century and the first part of this century, many good expositions of the holy Word, messages on life, and messages on the principles of the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection were published. However, since the end of World War II, very few books of spiritual value have been published in Europe and America. Although a number of word studies and dictionaries have been published, there have been hardly any books with a definite revelation of the divine truths and a rich supply of life. Andrew Murray, Jesse Penn-Lewis, and T. Austin-Sparks may be considered to be the last three writers in the line of the inner life. After their writings, almost nothing new has come out.</p>
<p>With regard to gospel preaching for the increase, the situation in Christianity in the United States has also been going down. I came to this country in the early 1960s and have watched the situation in Christianity for over a quarter of a century. Recently a number of large denominations came together to study how to cover the entire earth with the gospel of Christ by the year 2000. The conclusion they arrived at was that they are short of persons. Actually, they are not short of persons because there are millions among them. One denomination alone numbers eleven million in the United States and three million abroad. Because the practice of the clergy-laity system has annulled so many of them, they say that they are short of persons. Many of the major denominations have been decreasing in number for the past fifteen years. In the matter of increase, Christianity has come to a standstill.</p>
<p>By 1984 there were at least seven to eight hundred local churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery around the earth on six continents, but we also had nearly come to a standstill in our increase. That caused me to be burdened. Even though I was occupied with the revision of the Recovery Version of the New Testament, I never forgot this burden for a single day. I have been seeking a new way for a new start for the Lord&rsquo;s interest on this earth. I reconsidered the teaching of the Bible, especially of the New Testament. I reconsidered church history and the different practices of Christians in the past. I also paid much attention to the present situation of all the denominations.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOSPEL PREACHING AS THE BEGINNING<br />
OF THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>In October of 1984, I did not fully know how the Lord would lead us. However, I had the full assurance that the new way must begin strongly with gospel preaching. The gospel has to be spread, preached, and announced, not by inviting people to come to us, but by going to them where they are. I knew that this way for the gospel was biblical, and I knew that we must experiment with it at any cost to our resources. Before any new thing is developed, it must be tested many times, and the Full-time Training in Taipei was the &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; for us.</p>
<p>During this time of experimenting, I suffered more criticism than ever in my over fifty years of serving the Lord. However, I did not care about the criticism because I had the assurance in what I was doing. I was assured that not only we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery but also all of Christianity needed a new start. Without a new start, there could be no way for the Lord to complete the building up of His Body as a preparation for His return. There is no use in maintaining something old and unscriptural. Everything must be up-to-date and scriptural. Something that is out-of-date and unscriptural will not only decline but will come to an end. We must learn what the Lord&rsquo;s will is for the present time and how He desires to go on.</p><h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING FOR MEETINGS IN MUTUALITY</h2>
<p>I knew that preaching the gospel by going to people where they are was the first step for the new way, but I was not yet enlightened to fully see the following steps. In the summer of 1988, though, I began to see that after the preaching of the gospel, we must have meetings in mutuality by prophesying (1 Cor. 14) through the perfecting by the gifted persons (Eph. 4:11-16). First Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4 became so clear, living, impressive, and encouraging to me. Although I have expounded 1 Corinthians 14 a number of times in the past and have conducted at least four studies of the book of Ephesians, these two portions of the Word were never as clear to me as they have become recently.</p>
<p>The stress and emphasis of 1 Corinthians 14 is not simply on meeting but on prophesying, on every member of the Body of Christ speaking for the Lord. In verse 31 the Apostle Paul was strong to say, &ldquo;You can all prophesy one by one.&rdquo; In this chapter to prophesy does not denote to foretell, or to predict, but to carry out the divine oracle, that is, to speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord into others&rsquo; spirits. This is to dispense the Triune God in Christ, His embodiment, into the needy ones. This is the top definition of prophesying. Paul promoted prophesying to the uttermost. In verse 1 he says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.&rdquo; To prophesy is the top gift. In verse 39 he repeated his desire: &ldquo;Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must stress speaking for the Lord by every member of the Body. In verses 24 and 25, Paul said, &ldquo;But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all; the secrets of his heart become manifest; and so falling on his face, he will worship God, reporting that God is really among you.&rdquo; First Corinthians 14:26 says, &ldquo;What is it then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.&rdquo; The principle of 1 Corinthians 14:26 is a meeting full of mutuality. Every attendant has something.</p>
<p>In our past we did not have meetings according to 1 Corinthians 14:26. I also could not find any mention of the practice of such meetings in church history or in the biographies and writings of great Christians. In 1937 Brother Watchman Nee, the senior co-worker among us, saw the light concerning 1 Corinthians 14:26, and he was caught by this vision. He pointed out that the old way of a congregation with one person speaking and the rest listening is according to &ldquo;the customs of the nations&rdquo; (2 Kings 17:8&mdash;NASB). In the Old Testament, God charged His people not to worship according to the customs of the nations after they came into the good land. The traditional practice of meeting is not scriptural but rather is something of the Gentiles, and we have to give it up. Brother Nee proposed that instead of having a meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, the saints should go out to preach the gospel. However, at that time we did not have a way to do this or to practice 1 Corinthians 14:26 because we had nothing with which to replace the traditional way.</p>
<p>The meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning has become a strong habit with Christians. Even the unbelievers, before they become Christians, have the thought that the Christian way to worship God is to come together on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning as a congregation with a certain speaker. This is the prevailing concept in almost every country on earth. It is hard to remove this habit from the dear saints who have been accustomed to it for years. Many may feel happy about church meetings in the principle of one man speaking with the rest listening. If we stopped the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting in order to go out to preach the gospel, many would simply become idle. Some might even become disappointed and drop the church life.</p>
<p>In 1948 Brother Nee conducted a training for four months. In that training he gave a series of messages on different subjects. One series of messages has been translated into English as the book <em>Church Affairs.</em> In these messages he repeated and stressed again more strongly that there is no need to maintain the old practice of meeting which is so strongly a part of people&rsquo;s habit. He told us that if we all pushed against the pressure of tradition, our situation would eventually change.</p>
<p>At the end of 1948 China fell into the hands of the Communists, and I was sent to Taiwan. There was no more time for us to practice the revelation Brother Nee had seen and published. Shortly afterwards, in 1952, Brother Nee was put into prison where he remained until he died in 1973. In Taiwan and the Philippines and later in this country, we never practiced his revelation. For many years Brother Nee had seen the vision from 1 Corinthians 14, and he spoke concerning it in messages which we printed, yet his vision simply remained on our bookshelves. In 1984 when I went to Taiwan to seek the Lord for a new way, a new start, this vision came back to me and I reconsidered it. I had the revelation concerning 1 Corinthians 14, but I did not know the way to practice it. However, when our situation came to a standstill, I was forced to study the way. After close to four years of study, 1 Corinthians 14 was made clear to me.</p><h2 class="head1">EVERY MEMBER SPEAKING FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>Every member of the Body can speak for the Lord. Certain saints had been under my ministry for over thirty-five years, but they still could not speak even a short word to save sinners. When the gospel was being preached, they brought their relatives to the gospel meeting. After the preaching, they brought them to the brother who did the preaching. They wanted the preaching brother to talk to their relatives. They felt that they were not preachers and could not say anything. They only knew that the Lord Jesus was good and that they believed in Him and had joy and peace within. They could not speak a word for the Lord. This was the poor situation among us. In certain denominations many lay members not only do not know how to speak for the Lord, but they also do not even know how to pray. When their relatives are sick, they invite the pastor to come to their home to pray for them. We should not remain in this kind of situation.</p>
<p>In 1984 in Taipei there were about three thousand at the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting in twenty-one halls (later two more were added), but there were only twenty-one speakers among them. There were three thousand meeting, but it was hard for the elders to prepare twenty-one speakers to speak every Lord&rsquo;s Day. This was a poor situation. We were not happy to remain in that old situation. Those who listened to the same speaker every Lord&rsquo;s Day may have become bored of his speaking, and the speaker himself may have become tired of speaking. However, today not only has the number of saints meeting increased from three thousand to five thousand, but of these five thousand, at least one-third can and do speak for the Lord. Instead of twenty-one speakers, they now have seventeen hundred speakers. In Taipei on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, at the same time in different halls, five thousand come together and at least one-third in each meeting speak forth the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>At first, when many in Taipei began to practice 1 Corinthians 14:26, I was not so clear how to help them to improve their speaking and how to help them help others to speak. In June of 1988, however, in my contact with the Lord, I put 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4:11-16 together. In order to have a meeting full of mutual prophesying according to 1 Corinthians 14:26, we must practice Ephesians 4:11-16. Although I had expounded Ephesians 4:11-16 in the past, they became new verses to me. Verses 11 and 12 say, &ldquo;And He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; When 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4 were opened to me at the same time, I saw the way to help each saint to speak forth Christ in the meetings. The way is the perfecting of the saints by the four kinds of gifts&mdash;the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. In the past we did not see this light so clearly, and we did not practice this perfecting work to a proper extent. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day, one speaker would give a message, but at most that message only edified the saints; it did not perfect them.</p>
<p>In Acts 20 Paul called for the elders from Ephesus and reminded them: &ldquo;How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and to teach you publicly and from house to house&rdquo; (v. 20). That was the real perfecting. The apostle not only spoke the word in public meetings, but he also did the perfecting work in home after home with all humility and tears and trials (v. 19). In Taipei I began to teach the co-workers, the elders, and the leading ones to prophesy and to perfect others and teach them to prophesy. They became the &ldquo;coaches,&rdquo; teaching and helping the &ldquo;players&rdquo; how to &ldquo;handle the ball.&rdquo; Within only two or three weeks of practicing this way of perfecting the saints, we saw the saints rise up. We had a success.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR PRACTICE IN THE PAST</h2>
<p>Our practice in the past, the old way, was mainly to build up a congregation. The old way can never build up the organic Body of Christ. It can only build up a congregation as a facade for a show. Our practice in the past has also lacked the development of the organic functions of the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ cannot be built up organically by the old way. In the old way one person spoke general messages to an audience. There was no personal, direct contact to meet the personal, particular needs. The organic Body of Christ cannot be built up without helping the organic members of the organic Body to function.</p>
<p>The members of the Body have not been developed in their organic functions under the old way. One might have been under my ministry for over thirty-five years without being able to say anything for the Lord because his organic function has not been developed. Just as a little child has all the organic functions in his body, we also have our functions in the Body of Christ, but these functions need development. This development can only take place by our eating and by our being trained and taught. In the old way we did not practice this development. Without the development of our functions, how can we expect all the members to function organically, and without all the members functioning organically, how can the organic Body of Christ be built up? In the old way, all we can accomplish is the building up of a congregation as a show to others. We can only be a congregation coming together to listen to a good speaker. However, once the speaker leaves, the congregation may disappear within three years. This is not the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEVELOPING THE SAINTS&rsquo; ORGANIC FUNCTION</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s way is to practice Ephesians 4:11-16. To appoint elders and speak to a congregation is only a part of the work of the apostles. According to Acts 20:20 and 31, the main work of the apostles is to visit the saints in home after home. Paul did this among the Ephesians day and night for three years. This not only edifies but also develops the saints&rsquo; organic function.</p>
<p>As part of the development of their function, the saints can be instructed how to go to the meeting with something in their hands. In the Full-time Training in Taipei, we have been teaching the co-workers and full-timers how to prophesy for three minutes. Every morning they pick up two verses and record in their notebook the main point they have enjoyed. On Saturday night they add together all the points which they have enjoyed the past six mornings and compose a prophecy. They practice speaking it to determine if it is too long or too short. If it is too long, they trim it. If it is too short, they add something and speak it again until it is three minutes. Then a &ldquo;coach,&rdquo; a teacher, may check their composition to correct or improve it. On the next morning when they go to the meeting, they have something. Everyone goes and everyone has.</p>
<p>Some saints may not have liked to go to the meeting because they felt they had nothing to speak and did not know how to speak. But after composing a prophecy the night before, they desire to go to the meeting to speak for the Lord. They want to go to the meeting because they have something to speak. In such a meeting everyone competes for time to speak. The saints in Taipei have at most ninety minutes for this kind of sharing, and each person takes about three minutes. There are almost always fifty people in the meeting and sometimes as many as seventy. All the speakers are ready with something in their hand. Everybody speaks, and they learn to speak in a good sequence. They learn which part should be spoken first and which part should be spoken next. I now have the way for all the saints to speak, and I am presenting this way to you. This way of speaking is good news for us. We should learn to speak for the Lord in this way.</p><h2 class="head1">BEGETTING, NOURISHING, TEACHING, AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>We can now see the two ends of the new way. The new way begins with visiting people for the preaching of the gospel to gain sinners for the increase, and it culminates with building them up through meetings of mutuality in which everyone speaks forth the Lord. This is the way the Body of Christ is built up. In between the preaching and the building up are two &ldquo;bridges.&rdquo; The first &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; is the home meetings for the nourishment of the newly baptized ones. The newly baptized ones may be likened to newly delivered babies. After being delivered, the little ones need nourishing. The second &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; is the small group meetings for teaching. From the small group meetings the new ones may be brought onward to the church meeting for the building up.</p>
<p>The new way comprises begetting, nourishing, teaching, and building. The new way is not merely door-knocking. The new way is first to go to where the people are to bring God, the Lord Jesus, the Bible, the gospel, and salvation with redemption to them in their homes. Jesus said, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Matt. 28:18b-19). Each one of us has to go in order to preach the gospel. This is the biblical way.</p>
<p>After preaching the gospel, the new way is to nourish the new believers as babes, teach them as children, and then build them up in the church meeting through the mutual speaking forth of Christ. We must learn to practice to preach the gospel by visiting people, to have home meetings to nourish the babes, to have group meetings to teach them the truths, and then to have the church meetings to build them up by the mutual speaking forth of Christ. You speak to me, I speak to you, and we all speak to one another. All speak, all listen, and all are built up. By this new way, we will have the organic building up of the organic Body of Christ. Regardless of where we are, we will be built up into the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEMAND OF THE LORD TODAY</h2>
<p>Today the Lord demands that we have the recovery of the meeting in mutuality, as unveiled in 1 Corinthians 14:26, by practicing Ephesians 4:11-16. We must have the perfecting of the saints by the gifts that the saints may participate in the work of the unique ministry of the New Testament&mdash;the work of the building up of the Body of Christ. The practice of Ephesians 4:11-16 is for the building up of the Body of Christ by the Body itself in the increase of the Body&rsquo;s growth in the divine life. This is accomplished by the wide spreading of the gospel of Christ by visiting people for the producing of the new believers, by home meetings to nourish the new believers, by group meetings to take care of the saints and teach them the truth for their edification, and by church meetings to exhibit and minister Christ to the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ by the developing and exercising of the saints&rsquo; organic functions.</p></body></html>
