   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the son, Isaac, we can see a person who inherited and possessed and enjoyed all the riches of God typified by the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The grandson of Abraham, Jacob, shows a person who was chosen and selected by God to a destiny, that is, to be transformed into a prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By his natural birth he was a supplanter, a heel-holder.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But such a one was transformed into a prince of God to execute God's government on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was fully represented by Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually Joseph as an annex to Jacob or Israel, the prince of God, reigned over the entire world and supplied them with food.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So in this complete person you can see God's choosing, God's calling, God's redemption, and God's transformation to execute His government on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The goal of all God's doing is to have man to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With these nine great men you cannot see a clear view of God's expression until this transformed person, Israel, was reproduced manyfold so that his descendants formed a people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The people of Israel as a collective people were used by God to express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God brought His people out of the tyranny and slavery in Egypt to Mount Sinai where they received the revelation to build up the tabernacle of God on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the tabernacle was completely built up, God's glory came down from the heavens in a visible way to dwell with man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Isn't this marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On this earth there was a people among whom God had gained a dwelling place to express Himself in His expanded glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Up to the end of Exodus God's expression was quite complete.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Consider how big the universe is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Within the universe there is a globe which is good for life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is good for the vegetable life, the animal life, for the human life and even for the divine life to be expressed through the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually in Exodus the divine life came and dwelt in its splendid glory among the human life, even visible to the human eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Again I say that by the end of Exodus God's expression on this earth was fully complete.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And that expression was traveling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It traveled through the wilderness for at least thirty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A people on this earth did not live on anything from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While they were traveling they lived on manna, something from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Early in the morning they gathered manna, and they drank of the living water that came out of the rock which followed them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Among them there was the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God dwelt in that tabernacle. and God overshadowed that tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In other words, God was fully expressed in that dwelling place among the human race on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From Exodus to Malachi there are still thirty-seven more books in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is the content of those books?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The content in the first stage was the tabernacle and in the second stage the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The tabernacle was a precursor of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The tabernacle or the temple was the center of the history of these thirty-seven books from Leviticus to Malachi.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And what was the tabernacle or the temple?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That was the expression of God among the human race on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is so easy to remember the entire Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All you need to remember is nine great men plus the tabernacle and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually, those nine great men issued in God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the way to understand the Bible with a heavenly view.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Old Testament tells us about nine great men and a dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The dwelling place of God was just God's expression as an issue coming out of those nine great men.</S>
