<h2 class="head1">HOW TO CREATE A SENSE OF NEED</h2><p>Let us now consider a few ways to create in man a sense of need.</p><h2 class="head2">Finding Rest</h2><p>Matthew 11:28 is a verse frequently used by gospel preachers. This verse has saved many people, both in China and in other countries. We have to use this verse to challenge men: "Are your burdens heavy? Are you toiling? Do you long for rest?" We have to make them feel the burden of the human life. We have to show them that human life is full of many burdens. Today man is anxious over many earthly things; he is full of burdens. The human life is indeed a restless life. A poor man has anxieties. A rich man has even more. A poor man is conscious of the pain of want, while a rich man worries that his money will be taken away. Those who have few possessions worry much, and those who have many possessions worry even more. The human life is indeed a suffering life, but the Lord said that He would give rest to those who come to Him.</p><p>After we speak about this verse, we can testify, saying, "Since I believed in the Lord, my burdens are gone. I now have rest." We should also ask seven or eight others to give their testimonies. This will generate a sense of need. The majority of people must have a sense of need evoked within them. This verse has saved as many people as John 3:16 has. This is a good way to preach the gospel.</p><h2 class="head2">Joy and Satisfaction</h2><p>Other than rest, we can also preach the gospel by talking about the need for joy and satisfaction. We can use John 4:13-14: "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life." Some people are never satisfied; they are always conscious of the vanity of life. A man can increase his wealth, but this does not increase his satisfaction. Money, children, and friends cannot satisfy man. The world is empty. When a man does not have something, he wants it. When he has it, he quickly becomes thirsty again. Before a man in this world receives the Lord, he pursues after satisfaction all the time. He can be satisfied for a few days, but very shortly he will be at the end of himself and thirsty once again. He is like a child who wants some toys before receiving them, yet tires of them once he receives them. Everything of the world can offer man only temporary satisfaction. After a man drinks of it, he will be thirsty again. He is like the Samaritan woman who was not satisfied even after having five husbands. The Lord Jesus said, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again."</p><p>After saying this, we have to ask the brothers to give their testimonies; they have to speak of drinking the living water through receiving the Lord, of finding true satisfaction, and of being thirsty no longer. If we use this way to preach the gospel, we will create a need for joy and satisfaction in some. They will see that they do not have the joy that others have, and they will feel their need. When we place joy in front of those who do not have joy, the joyless ones will hunger for joy. Most Japanese are saved because they see the joy in the preachers. We have to preach the gospel this way. However, we have to drink and be satisfied first. We must receive the living water and joy from the Lord before we can create this sense of need in others.</p><h2 class="head2">On Death</h2><p>Death is also a good topic for the gospel. Death is fearful, and it is common for men to be afraid of death. Among the Chinese, every young person is afraid of death, while most old ones are not afraid of it. This is a phenomenon peculiar to the Chinese. An old person regards death as understandable and inevitable; most are not afraid of facing death. Among young people, however, the fear of death is prevalent. When preaching to young people, death is a good subject. When we are with many young people, we can preach about death. We can testify to them that Christians are not afraid to die because we have a Savior who enables us to overcome death. A sinner, however, does not have the Savior. If he dies, what will happen to him? Christians are a great testimony; they are a living testimony of men who are not afraid to face death. Church history testifies how many Christians sang and praised God at the time they were about to die. They knew that angels would come and receive them. When a believer dies, he should declare, "I am not dying. I am temporarily leaving this earthly home to meet my Lord." These are good testimonies.</p><p>Death comes to every man once (Heb. 9:27). An unbeliever may ask, "What is to become of me after I die?" No one can escape this judgment. All young people are afraid of death. They do not know what to do when death comes to them. In preaching the gospel, we can use death to create a sense of need in man. Not only should we speak of death, but also we should tell others the truth concerning the Lord Jesus' death for us. We should tell them that the Lord Jesus has tasted death for everyone (2:9). He has defeated the devil, the one who has the might of death (v. 14). Those who believe in Him are released from death; they will no longer be under the slavery of death (v. 15). They can boldly declare, "Where, O death, is your sting?" (1 Cor. 15:55). We should tell them that the Lord Jesus has removed the taste of death. This will make them sense their need for deliverance from the bondage of death.</p>
