   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE HUMANITY OF JESUS FOR THE LORD'S RECOVERY Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:1-5, 16-17; 2:21-22; 1:7; 4:22</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The eleventh point concerning the humanity of Jesus is that it is necessary for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must realize that the letters written by Paul to Timothy and Titus were written for recovery, because at that time degradation had already occurred in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>History tells us that the Roman Empire began to decline at exactly the same time as the church, during the last part of the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By reading 2 Timothy 3, we see the situation that existed at the end of the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul said that in the last days perilous times would come, and it was not long before this prophecy was fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>History tells us that by the end of the first century, there was much corruption and ruin in the society of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>TODAY'S SITUATION</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are in exactly the same kind of situation today as was the early church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that time the church was degraded and society was ruined, and it is clear that it is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we must all realize that we are in a situation that requires the Lord's humanity for His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There must be a group of people to stand against the tide of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But what is the way for us to stand?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Is it by divine power?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is rather difficult to find much in these three books about divine power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These books are from Paul's later ministry which has very much to do with the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have previously mentioned from these books that the humanity of Jesus is necessary for the church service, which involves the co-workers, elders, deacons, and deaconesses.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the verses related to these serving ones mention something concerning the human virtues of the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul did not tell Timothy to be an example in power, but in love, in word, and in the way he conducted himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is all a matter of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the qualifications for the church service are human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The same principle applies to the Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To deal with the older brothers and sisters as well as the young brothers and sisters requires the uplifted humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is abundantly clear from these three books that we need a strong, adequate, and proper humanity in order to have the Lord's recovery in such a degraded time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not need divine power as much as we need the humanity of Jesus to stand up in such a degraded age.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the standing power of the acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we follow the course of today's age, we are like the jellyfish, without any backbone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whatever way the tide goes, the jellyfish follow.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do need a strong backbone to stand against the current of today's age for the Lord's recovery, and this backbone can issue only from the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The background of these three books the degradation of the church and the corruption of society is exactly like today's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, these three books should really be applied to us today.</S>
