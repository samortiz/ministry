   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN FUNCTION BY PUTTING OFF THE OLD Scripture reading: Ephesians 4:13-16, 22-24; Colossians 2:6-7; 3:10-11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have pointed out that if we are going to have the proper function in the local church, we need first of all to be captured by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ must exercise His victory over us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are not defeated by Him, it is impossible to have a real spiritual function in life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is because the function of the Body is simply the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to have the expression of Christ, we must be subdued, captured and taken over by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And after being captured by Him, we must grow in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more we grow in Him, the more we will receive of Him our function in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The function must come completely out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we are devoid and short of Christ, we may have many activities, but we do not have any function in life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some dear ones in the church only have activity, but this is not the function of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Activity is natural.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps I am clever and capable in speaking; so I stand up to give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But this is not the function in life; this is an activity of the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All such activities are not good for the church; they are only good for some social organization.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are not good for the expression of Christ, because the expression of Christ is simply Christ manifested through His members.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we, His members, must be captured and taken over by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And we must grow, not only in Him, but also with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The real essence of growth in life is nothing less than Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then, we will have the function with Christ in life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>PUTTING OFF AND PUTTING ON</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The above verses in Ephesians and Colossians set forth a number of principles concerning our function in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One of the basic principles is the putting off the old man and the putting on the new.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am afraid that many of us have been Christians for years, but have never learned the practice of putting off and putting on.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some may ask, "Put off what?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must put off the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some may ask, "What is the old man?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Apostle Paul said that in the new man, which is the Body of Christ, there is no Greek, no Jew, no circumcision, no uncircumcision, no barbarian, and no Scythian.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that there is no natural person, no religious nor unreligious person, and no cultured nor uncultured person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The natural person must be put off.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are a religious person, you also must be put off.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some of us are still so religious.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But in the church there is no circumcision nor uncircumcision, no religious nor unreligious.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many have the concept that as long as we are religious, it is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But in the church there are no religious people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The religious are really dreadful; they are a real damage to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the unreligious are even more dreadful.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no circumcision nor uncircumcision, no religious nor unreligious in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And there is also no Scythian.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Scythian refers to those who are highly cultured.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Culture or education, just as religion, mean nothing in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Race means nothing, religion means nothing, and education means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whatever you are means nothing, and whatever you have attained means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do not think that you are something in the church because you have the highest attainment in education and religion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You must listen to the word of the Apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the new man, the Body of Christ, there are no Gentiles and no Hebrews, no religious and no unreligious, no cultured and no uncultured.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All of these must be put off.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have never learned how to put off, we may be very active in the church, yet we are not functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is a great difference between activities and functions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Activities are natural; they are something either of religion or of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the church life we do not need activities.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need the functions which are the flow of life, the manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is not something of religion, nor of culture or education.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We all must learn to put off all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everything of religion, everything of culture or education, and everything of natural ability must be put off.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As a Christian, we may have learned how to be adjusted or corrected, but I am afraid that we have never learned how to put off.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must simply put off ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must put off our religion, and we must put off our education.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only then can Christ flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we put off what we are and have, our natural being, our religion, our education, etc., then we can function and express Christ, who is the very life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit.</S>
