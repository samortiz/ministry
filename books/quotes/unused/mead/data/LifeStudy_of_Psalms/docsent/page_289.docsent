   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE THIRTY-NINE THE PRAISE OF GOD'S ELECT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONSUMMATING IN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE PARTICULAR POSITION OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Psa 111 118</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we come to the hardest point in the Bible Christ as the cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Who would think that Christ would be the cornerstone?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Prior to the Psalms there is not a verse which speaks of Christ as the cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then, all of a sudden, Psalm 118:22 says, "The stone which the builders rejected/Has become the head of the corner."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once again I would call your attention to the arrangement of the Psalms into five books.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Book 5 begins with Psalm 107.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The main psalms in Book 5 that unveil Christ are Psalm 110 and Psalm 118.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Psalm 110 is on Christ as the exalted One, as the One who in His ascension has been uplifted to the right hand of God in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this psalm there are two matters which are difficult to understand adequately "the dew from the womb of the morning" v. 3 and "the brook by the way" v. 7 . Whereas the brook is for drinking, the dew is for watering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As Christ is on His way to carry out God's economy, He needs to be watered, and He needs something to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is watered by those who offer themselves willingly to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whoever volunteers himself to Christ as an offering is a young man likened to the dew conceived in the womb of the morning for watering Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we are thirsty from working or from running a race, dew is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need water to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ also needs something to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, in addition to the dew, which is moisture for comforting, Christ needs to drink of the brook flowing by the way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we will see, Psalm 119 is on Christ as the cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we come to this psalm, we will consider a number of verses related to Christ as the cornerstone for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After Psalm 119 the revelation concerning Christ in the Psalms is closed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Psalm 119, a particular psalm, is followed by fifteen psalms which are called songs of ascents.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After these psalms, we have the last sixteen psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In these thirty-one psalms we cannot find anything concerning Christ, for Christ has been revealed to us adequately beginning with Psalm 2 and ending with Psalm 119.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the next message we will see that Psalm 119 is on Christ's being the reality of the law as the testimony and the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The one hundred seventy-six verses of Psalm 119, arranged in twenty-two sections of eight verses each, are on Christ as the law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Toward the beginning of the Psalms, in Psalm 2, the Spirit turns the reader of the Psalms from the law to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After all the revelations of Christ in Psalms 2 through 118, the Spirit gives us Psalm 119, indicating or implying that Christ is the real, actual, and practical law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Old Testament, the law was put in the ark, which is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the entire law of God is in Christ, making Christ the reality of the law of God.</S>
