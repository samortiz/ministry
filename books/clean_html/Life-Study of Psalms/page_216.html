<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Portraying a Scenery in Typology<br>concerning God's New Testament Economy</H2><P>In the praise rendered to God by His elect, there is portrayed a scenery in typology concerning God's New Testament economy in the accomplishment of God's redemption for His salvation by Christ and in the spreading of the glad tidings of Christ's accomplishment with the goodly words of the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Little Benjamin</H2><P>Verse 27a speaks of "little Benjamin."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. As the Son of Sorrows, Benoni</H2><P>Benjamin had two names, the first of which was Benoni. This name, given to him by his mother Rachel as she was dying in childbirth, means "son of my sorrow" (Gen. 35:18a). As the son of sorrows, Benoni, Benjamin typifies Christ who, as the Man of sorrows in His incarnation and human life on earth, accomplished God's eternal redemption for His full salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. As the Son of the Right Hand, Benjamin</H2><P>Whereas Rachel named her son Benoni, Jacob immediately changed the child's name to Benjamin, which means "son of the right hand" (v. 18b). To be at the right hand is to be in a position of glory and honor. As the son of the right hand, Benjamin typifies Christ who, as the Son of the right hand of God in His resurrection, victory, and ascension, ministers in the heavens to carry out the application of God's redemption for His salvation. Christ was incarnated to be Benoni, the Man of sorrows, but in resurrection He became Benjamin, the Son of the right hand of God in glory and honor.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Princes of Judah</H2><P>Psalm 68:27 speaks also of the princes of Judah. Judah is the lion with the power and the scepter, and he is the peace (Shiloh) to God's people (Rev. 5:5a; Gen. 49:8-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Typifying Christ as the Victory for God's People<br>and the Peace to God's People</H2><P>Whereas Benjamin typifies Christ mainly in His humanity, Judah typifies Christ mainly in His divinity. In His divinity, Christ is not a Man of sorrows but a lion with power and authority (signified by the scepter). In particular, Judah typifies Christ as the victory for God's people and the peace to God's people. In the application of redemption, Christ is our peace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. As the Kingly Tribe, Accompanied Always<br>by Benjamin, as a Warrior Tribe</H2><P>Judah, as the kingly tribe, was accompanied always by Benjamin, as a warrior tribe (Gen. 49:27), for God's kingdom on the earth. In typology Judah and Benjamin, who were joined geographically, form a group concerning the accomplishment and application of Christ's redemption for God's salvation. With Benjamin the emphasis is on the accomplishment of redemption; with Judah the emphasis is on the application (in Christ's ascension) of redemption.</P>
