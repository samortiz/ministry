   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A RECEIVING ORGAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our spirit was created by God as the organ for us to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must not confuse it with another organ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose a medical doctor considered that the stomach, the heart, the liver, and the kidneys were all synonyms for the same organ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What kind of a doctor could he be!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The stomach is the receiving organ for our food.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We take in food with our mouth; then the food passes to the stomach to be digested.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This food, after being completely digested, is assimilated into our tissues and cells, becoming part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How useful is this physical organ which receives our physical supply!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have another receiving organ, that we may take in the spiritual supply.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This supply is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After man's creation God provided him with the tree of life and told him to freely eat Gen 2:8-9, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was an indication that the man created by God needed to receive this life, which was God Himself, as his supply.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 6 makes this clear.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus said, "I am the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He who eats Me shall also live because of Me" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>48, 50, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can eat the Lord Jesus because He is our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is the food of life from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A SENSING ORGAN</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us consider the organ which receives this spiritual and heavenly food.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Where is our spirit located?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This we are not sure of.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We know that we have two hearts: a physical one and a psychological one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The location of the physical one we know; but where is the psychological one?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is hard for us to pinpoint its exact location, though we know from experience that it is inside us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The same is true of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our experience confirms that we do have such an organ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let us suppose that the thought comes to me that I need to contact Brother So-and-so.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>My mind considers it and approves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My emotion has the desire to go.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>My will then makes the decision that I will go.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nonetheless, deeper than all these there is a sense that I should not go.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>My mind, emotion, and will are all in agreement that I should take one course.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What part of me is saying that I should take another?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It cannot be the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let us use another illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You may have quite a comfortable life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have a good family.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You live in a nice house.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You eat well and dress well.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You are happy with your work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the evenings you enjoy listening to good music.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Your environment is peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Nonetheless, you sense a lack.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You need something more.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Where does this sense of emptiness come from?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Outwardly you are satisfied, but deep within you are not.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This part deep within us that feels dissatisfied, the Bible calls the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even in fallen man the spirit has been preserved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His evil doings come not from his spirit but from his mind, emotion, will, and heart.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No verse in the Bible tells us that man's spirit is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The mind, in contrast, is spoken of as corrupt 2 Tim 3:8 ; the heart, as deceitful and wicked Jer 17:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The spirit in fallen man, though deadened Eph 2:1, 5 , has been sovereignly preserved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we hear the gospel preached, God's Word touches our conscience and causes us to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Repentance is an act from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is a response to the conscience, which is part of the spirit, in fact, the main part.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then, when we believe in the Lord and call on His name, the Spirit of God enters into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He comes in to enliven us with God's life, that is, to regenerate us.</S>
