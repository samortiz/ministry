   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 3 the word divine denotes the eternal, unlimited, and almighty divinity of God.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we receive the Lord Jesus, the Triune God enters into us as life in resurrection.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The divine power in 2 Peter 1:3 is the power of the divine life, and this divine life power has given us all things that relate to life and godliness.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The divine power in 2 Peter 1:3 is the power of the divine life related to the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is beyond our ability to measure this divine power.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the realm of human power we are impressed by the kind of power that it took to land a man on the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But how much more power was necessary to raise Christ to the third heaven, to the center and height of the universe!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul speaks clearly of this divine power in Ephesians 1 when he prays that we would know what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies vv.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>2 Having Granted to Us All Things</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Which Relate to Life and Godliness</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 2 Peter 1:3, Peter says that this divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The word granted here means imparted, infused, or planted.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All things which relate to life and godliness have been imparted into us, infused into us, by the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who regenerates us and indwells us 2 Cor 3:6, 17; John 3:6; Rom 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All things which relate to life and godliness in 2 Peter 1:3 are the various aspects of the divine life, typified by the riches of the produce of the good land in the Old Testament.</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Life is within, enabling us to live, and godliness is without as the outward expression of the inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Life is the inward energy, the inward strength, to bring forth the outward godliness, which leads to and results in glory.</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All things have been given, imparted, and infused into us so that we may live the divine life and also live out this life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The life is inward, but godliness is outward, for it is God Himself expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In all our living we should express God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should testify of God and speak about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When God becomes our expression, this is godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In our conversation we should express God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we are expressing God, surely we could not engage in gossip.</S>

   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The imparting into us of all the things of life is through the full knowledge of God, which is conveyed and revealed to us through His word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This becomes the faith objective , in which our faith subjective is produced.</S>
