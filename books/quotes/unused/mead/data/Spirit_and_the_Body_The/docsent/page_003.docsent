   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LEADING, WORKING, AND SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us consider a number of verses in the book of Acts pertaining to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the beginning of Acts, the one hundred twenty did not form anything, start anything, initiate anything, or intend to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, they prayed again and again for ten days Acts 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Their prayer was absolutely in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then, to their surprise, the Spirit was poured out upon them, and they became a people wholly in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From that time onward, whatever they did, whatever they said, and wherever they went was utterly a matter in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the day of Pentecost, when Peter stood up with the eleven and spoke, he did not speak without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, Peter was filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Peter spoke to the religious leaders in Acts 4, he was again filled with the Holy Spirit Acts 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Stephen was also a man filled with the Holy Spirit Acts 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No one was able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke Acts 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Stephen was a person living, speaking, and ministering in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Philip preached the gospel in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Philip did not determine to do this preaching or make a decision to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was simply living and walking in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, when the Spirit told him to go to the Ethiopian in the chariot, Philip ran to him Acts 8:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After Philip had preached the gospel to the eunuch and had baptized him, he did not intend to go away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit, however, "caught away Philip" Acts 8:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Where Philip, an evangelist, was to go did not depend on his decision; instead, it depended upon the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit led Philip to preach the gospel to the eunuch, and it was the Spirit who caught Philip away after he had preached to him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All of us, especially the young people, must be impressed that in the Spirit there is no such thing as a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit must take the lead, the Spirit must do the work, the Spirit must do the speaking, and the Spirit must even do our living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We, the people in the church, must be those absolutely saturated with the Spirit and absolutely one with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If so, then whatever we say is the Spirit's speaking, whatever we do is the Spirit's doing, and whatever work we do is the Spirit's working.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the book of Acts we do not see any kind of movement.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, we see the leading, working, and speaking of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the whole book of Acts there was, strictly speaking, just one conference, and that took place in Acts chapter fifteen.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is very different from today's Christianity where conferences are held one after another to decide what to do and where to send people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Christianity the sending out of people depends upon decisions made at a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the book of Acts, however, we do not see such conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Acts the apostles did not gather together to discuss and to make decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They did not ask questions such as, "Where is the need?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Where should we go?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How many should we send?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nothing took place according to manmade decisions; rather, everything was according to the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The way Peter behaved and worked was not dependent upon Peter; it was due to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What Stephen and Philip did was not the result of a decision made at a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No, they were in the Spirit, and the Spirit took the lead in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was the same with the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Acts 13 the prophets and teachers at Antioch did not call a conference and discuss matters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No, they prayed and fasted, and as they were praying, the Holy Spirit spoke to them, saying, "Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them" Acts 13:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Again, there was neither a discussion nor a decision, but the speaking of the Holy Spirit.</S>
