 <h2 class="head1">OVERSEEING AND SHEPHERDING</h2>
<p>In verse 28 Paul admonishes the elders to &ldquo;take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently it was Paul that appointed them as elders. Actually, it was the Holy Spirit that placed them as overseers. Here Paul used the term <em>overseers</em> instead of <em>elders.</em> These two synonyms are used interchangeably. The term <em>elder</em> refers to the person, but <em>overseer</em> speaks of their responsibility. An overseer should not be sloppy or sleepy but all the time watchful. He must be aware of the situation of the church and oversee each member of the flock. If so, he will know what the need is and what they should do.</p>
<p>Paul charged the elders not only to teach but to shepherd the church of God which God obtained through His own blood. <em>To obtain</em> in Greek also denotes to acquire, or purchase. His own blood is a dear term. God considers the church as a treasure which is very dear and precious in His eyes. He loves the church to such an extent that He purchased it with His own blood.</p>
<p>Similarly, the elders should also love the church as God does. Even the parents always save the best things for their dear children. God used His own blood. So we must love the church with this kind of fine feeling and affection.</p>
<p>Verse 29 says, &ldquo;I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.&rdquo; To spare the flock means that we love the flock with tender care by cherishing and nourishing. However, the wolves would not care for the church in this way. On the contrary, they would sacrifice the church for their own interests and satisfaction. They are wolves hunting for prey.</p>
<p>Verse 30 follows, &ldquo;And from among you yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.&rdquo; Not only will wolves come in from without, but men will rise up from within the church, speaking perverted things.</p>
<p>Throughout the centuries there have been these two classes of negative people. Paul likened one class to wolves and the other class to perverted persons who would rise up from within the church to speak perverted things with the purpose of drawing away disciples after themselves. These two classes of people were there at Paul&rsquo;s time and they are still here today.</p>
<p>Throughout our own history of the past sixty-seven years in mainland China, Taiwan, and the United States, there have been these two classes of people. Romans 16:17 tells us to keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling.</p>
<p>This word by Paul was not just an admonishing word but a prediction, telling us what would happen. Within a short time, this word transpired at Ephesus (2 Tim. 1:15).</p>
<h2 class="head1">ADMONISHING WITH TEARS NIGHT AND DAY</h2>
<p>Finally, verse 31 says, &ldquo;Wherefore watch, remembering that for three years, night and day, I did not cease admonishing each one with tears.&rdquo; Paul did not only go to their house, but he also admonished each one of them with tears day and night. The elders among us must pick up a burden to do this day and night. They should go to the homes of the saints and admonish each one with tears.</p>
<p>To admonish with tears is not so easy. At first the saints may not listen to you. Some may listen yet they would not take your word. Then your word would not be very effective. Quite often one drop of tears may work much better than a thousand words. This is especially true with the sisters. At times rebuking and advising may not do as much good as dropping your tears.</p>
<p>Paul was a very emotional person. Acts 20 mentions tears twice. In verse 19 Paul served the Lord with humility, tears, and trials. Again in verse 31 he spent three years, night and day, admonishing each one with tears. This kind of admonishing is the necessary responsibility of the elders.</p>
