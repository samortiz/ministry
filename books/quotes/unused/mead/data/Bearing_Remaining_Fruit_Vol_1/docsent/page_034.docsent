   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING TO WORK WITHOUT OPINIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In all our service we need to learn to have no opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those who like to talk a lot and have many opinions often do not work much.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who truly work do not talk much and do not have opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The capable ones among the co-workers usually do not have opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They simply do whatever is fellowshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The quiet ones are usually the ones who work; the talkative people are usually the ones who do not.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may illustrate this with the printing of Life Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The last word was completed recently on a Friday at 9:05 P.M. Then the serving sisters immediately started working.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who typed did the typing, and those who proofread did the proofreading.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They worked until 2:00 A.M. because the manuscript had to be ready by Saturday morning for imaging, typesetting, and printing so the book could be ready by the coming Monday.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That was a good coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The serving sisters did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every one of them worked silently and diligently without any opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They worked entirely according to the instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Especially in proofreading, the sisters paid much attention to the use and choice of diction in the manuscript that I gave them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They all worked according to instructions without any opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In theory, every road leads to Rome ; there is not only one way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, if everyone has something to say, and if everyone has his opinions, it will never be possible to get to Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In American culture, the one who drives the car is properly respected.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The one with the steering wheel in his hands is the one who drives, and everyone else in the car should not talk.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This makes it very easy to get to the destination.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If someone keeps giving opinions and argues, this will only waste time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we should learn to work without opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if we know that the directions are not quite right, the steering wheel is not in our hands, so we should still remain silent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way, even though we may end up taking a few more turns, we quietly follow the driver.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we experience that all things are under the Lord s sovereign hands.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He never fails us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The capable ones do not talk much, while those who give opinions do not work much.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is an unchanging principle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who work know that there are different ways to do things, so it is not necessary to insist on a certain way, and there is no need to spend much time to study how to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, if we want to go to Yang-ming Shan, some may sit down to discuss which way is the shortest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a result, they will discuss for over half an hour before they set out.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who work faithfully will drive there right away and arrive in ten minutes, or twenty minutes at the most.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What we need is only to drive the car and get there.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From the beginning, the many young full-time serving ones among us need to learn the lesson of having no opinions and not giving any opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the proper attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE LEARNING NEEDED AND THE SUCCESS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>IN LEADING A HOME MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To perfect a home meeting, the first thing we need to learn is to sing the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We ourselves must be familiar with the tune of a hymn and sing it well before we can lead others to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If there are children in the homes, we need to encourage them to sing with us because children are the fastest learners of hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Upon hearing the hymns, the children will start humming them, and they will pick them up very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are truly the ones whom we can count on to start singing and lead the singing at home.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once they have learned the hymns, they can lead others to sing together.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not very easy for older people to learn to sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, when we lead a home meeting, we need to encourage the children to sing and ask them to lead the singing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is very needful.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although Life Lessons has its own sequence of lessons, we do not need to be rigid about the sequence when we use the book.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can choose any one of the topics from it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The principle is that the choice should be based on our knowledge of the particular home and their practical needs.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, there are some lessons, like Knowing the Church, which we must teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I believe that all of us who are leading a home meeting feel the need to teach this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Basically, we need to learn every lesson well.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order to use Life Lessons appropriately, we need to know the way the book is compiled.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>First, the Scripture reading in each lesson is very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Scripture as the basis is the most outstanding feature and the richest part of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Second, the explanation of the Scripture is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is better to be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because it is simple, it is easy for the new ones to understand, but it still has a crucial meaning and certain main points.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before we go to lead a home meeting, it is better for us to study one or two lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We not only need to study the verses thoroughly, but we also need to understand the main points in the explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this way we can understand the book thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Moreover, no lesson exceeds six pages.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some lessons have only three pages.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>On average, each one is four to five pages.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The portion is just right.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At the end of each lesson there is a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the summary of the whole compilation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is best for us to follow this line when using the book.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>CONSTANTLY SEEKING TO BE FILLED</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The one who leads the meeting must be living.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If he is not living, the meeting will definitely have no vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we are a burning person, once we enter the meeting, everyone will be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If five or six people are together talking and laughing excitedly and someone comes in weeping, they will hardly be able to continue laughing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After a while others may begin to shed tears.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This illustrates that one person s situation can greatly affect the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we are a weeping person yet try to give a message to make people laugh, no one will laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>On the other hand, if we are a laughing person, yet we try to give a message on repentance, confession, fasting, mourning, and lamenting, we can shout at the top of our voice, but no one will cry or feel sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In this matter we cannot pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we pretend, we will just be performing like actors.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We are not actors, so we should not act.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Even if we act well, it will still be false.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should not put on a mask, let alone give a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Whether or not the leading ones are living depends on their daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we walk according to the truth and the Spirit in our daily life, as time goes by we will be a certain kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Then when we are in the home meetings, we will be those who walk according to the truth and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Whether or not we speak, we will be such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The kind of living a person has is the kind of person he will be.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>A person who is filled with the Spirit will bring the Spirit wherever he goes.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When he speaks, the Spirit will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When he cries, the Spirit comes out, and when he laughs, the Spirit also comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When he reads the Bible, the Spirit comes out, and when he sings, the Spirit also comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is the most important matter.</S>
