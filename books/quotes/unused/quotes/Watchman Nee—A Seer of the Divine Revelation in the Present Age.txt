It was only from the beginning of the nineteenth century that the pure gospel and the Bible were brought to China
Robert Morrison landed in Canton, capital of the southernmost province of China, in the early years of the nineteenth century
The China Inland Mission pioneered a number of inland provinces, and other missions settled in many other territories
These missionaries brought with them three treasures: the Lord's name, which is the Lord Himself, the gospel, and the Bible
These 'native' preachers became prevailing in gospel preaching, and their preaching reached the students of China's new generation
Nee Shu-tsu's mother, Lin Ho-ping, also a second generation Christian, studied in the Chinese Western Girls' School in Shanghai
Watchman Nee was given by the Lord to His Body for His move of recovery on the earth, not only in China but also throughout the entire world
She traveled extensively through many provinces doing gospel work and became a prevailing witness for the Lord
In February of 1920 Dora Yu was invited to Foochow the capital of Fukien province where she preached the gospel in the Methodist auditorium
He felt that he must go to Dora Yu's meeting and see what it was that had brought about such a change in his mother
When my mother gave birth to two girls people said she would probably be like my aunt bearing half a dozen girls before bringing forth a boy
For some this step might be easy, but for me, with many ideals, dreams, and plans, it was exceedingly difficult
Because he had certain habits of which she did not approve, such as sleeping late, Dora Yu decided not to keep him
During his school days Watchman Nee's seeking after the Lord brought him into frequent contact with Margaret E
Her co-missionaries became jealous of her and fabricated a serious charge which caused her to be recalled from the field
She simply remained at home, praying much for the Lord's move in China and helping those who sought her counsel in seeking after the Lord
On February 7 1950 in his fellowship with the church in Hong Kong he said There were sixtysix young people under Sister Barbers training
Panton, he said that it would be considered good if after ten years six of those young people would still remain
Throughout all his travels he said that he scarcely found one person in the Western world who could compare with Margaret Barber
He frequently told others that it was through a sister that he was saved and that it was also through a sister that he was edified
When appealing to Miss Barber for the solution to their problems, she would continually put him down, saying that Leland was older than he
She would not yield him any ground so that he might learn the lesson of the cross and learn not to reason but to submit
We had a co-workers' meeting every Friday in which the other five were often forced to listen to the arguing between the leading two
It is not a question of right or wrong; it is a question of whether or not one is like the bearer of the cross
2The study of a particular book such as Genesis Daniel Matthew Romans or Revelation to probe the depths contained in that part of the Word
8)The study of numbers, such as the numbers three, five, seven, eight, and twelve, to understand their significance in the Scriptures
11)The study of history, such as the history of Israel and the history of the church, to see how God administrates in His government
12)The study of psalms and songs, such as psalms in the book of Psalms and songs in other books, to learn how to praise and pray
14)A study referring to the original Hebrew or Greek text to acquire the accurate meaning of a certain word or phrase
For this purpose he used a different Bible without any remarks or notes that he might receive new light for spiritual nourishment
20)A study done by memorizing certain crucial verses or portions to store the Word in the heart for constant and instant needs
There were books on the floor and a row of books on either side of his bed, with only a narrow space in the middle to lie down
Watchman Nee studied the hymnals of different Christian groups along with the songs and poetry of many authors
7)Light concerning the matter of abiding in Christ was received from the books of Andrew Murray and the biography of Hudson Taylor
8)He received help on the subjective aspect of Christ's death and on spiritual warfare from the books of Jessie Penn-Lewis
11)Light concerning the church was received from the writings of John Nelson Darby and other Brethren teachers
Watchman Nee's study of the Bible and his reading of many spiritual books greatly enlightened him regarding God's economy
Shortly after he was saved, he began to love the Lord and was intensely burdened to preach the gospel to his schoolmates and countrymen
For a period of time, he fasted every Saturday that he might have power to preach the gospel in the Sunday morning preaching meeting
Through his preaching nearly all his schoolmates were led to the Lord, and a revival was brought into his school
Thousands of copies of each issue were printed, and hundreds of young followers of the Lord were immensely edified by these messages
Since he knew the Bible thoroughly, he desired to expound the Bible book after book, but the Lord frustrated this intention
Because of his own experience along this line, he was specifically burdened and commissioned by the Lord to bear testimony to this truth
Watchman Nee's ultimate burden was to establish and build up local churches for the satisfaction of God's desire
These things are not Gods goal they are only procedures to accomplish Gods goal which is the establishment and building up of local churches
Today, throughout the whole world, nearly all Christian bookstores carry his books, but very few stock his books on the church
Because the vision was so clear and the commission so real, he did not care that he was rejected, opposed, and condemned
They felt that we should be zealous in revival and gospel preaching work and that the fruit of such work could be easily seen
Since the light each of us had received in respect to the work was different, our ways of working were also different
What God wants is not individuals trying to be victorious or spiritual; He wants a corporate glorious church presented to Himself
Having taught us the Bible for a year, he continually said that as long as it is the teaching of the Scriptures, it should be followed
There are so many denominations today, yet there is no Methodist Church, Presbyterian Church, or any other denomination in the Bible
Being a personal friend of the bishop was one thing, but the fact that denominations are unscriptural was another thing
Was it true that only those who had received ordination could break it, while those who had not received ordination could not?
Leland Wang was living in a house borrowed from a girls' school and was moving soon, so he felt it would not be too convenient
She replied, 'I am afraid that among the names in that book of life many are dead and not a few are perishing'
She replied, 'If your name is recorded in the book of life in heaven, what good will an earthly book of life do you?
In essence, the letter said this: 'We have seen that sects are unscriptural and that denominationalism is sinful
We are doing this not because of any personal animosity, but simply because we wish to obey the teaching of the Scriptures
They said, 'One only hears of a church excommunicating its members, never of a member excommunicating himself from a church
Later our pastor the district superintendent and the bishop all came asking whether we had taken this action because of baptism by immersion
They explained that if members of the Methodist Church wished to be baptized by immersion, there was no problem
Thank the Lord, after several months, all but one of the seventy persons whose names were in my notebook were saved
For two weeks he asked God specifically to fill him with the Holy Spirit that he might lead a victorious life with power
Following his salvation, Watchman Nee first began bringing people to the Lord, and second he began learning to live in the Lord's presence
At the same time he saw that he must make thorough confession of sins to God and fully rectify any wrongs regarding people
In order to stay in God's presence, he repeatedly wrote to the saints confessing his wrongs, offenses, and faults, asking for forgiveness
Many times at the Lord's table he was heard to confess in prayer that he was sinful and to ask the Lord to forgive him
His conscience was so keen because he always kept it pure by dealing with sins before men and God, leaving nothing undealt with
He would not observe any festival or celebrate a birthday because to his enlightened understanding these things were worldly
His flesh was continually suppressed by simply living in the spirit and behaving according to the inner anointing
It was revealed to Watchman Nee that fallen man is saturated with Satan and can easily become the very embodiment and expression of Satan
In following the Lord Watchman Nee continually denied the self in order to continually enjoy the Lord's presence
Rather, his behavior and his work always left the impression that he was a person bearing the cross and denying the self
He would not tolerate any self-preference to exist between himself and the Lord in order to maintain the presence of God
For him to obey the Lord meant to cleave to the Lord's purposed will; it did not mean to take His permissive will as Balaam did
Margaret Barber told him and he passed it on to his close associates that a small leaf on a tree can block out the full moon from ones sight
In order to keep his fellowship with the Lord untarnished, Watchman Nee learned how to apply the blood of Christ to his situation
When he told her that he was still under condemnation she repeated to him several times, 'The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us'
Eventually, he received light that only the blood of the Lord can keep one's conscience from any kind of condemnation before God
He realized that even a little negligence regarding the inner anointing would keep him away from the presence of God
No shadow whatsoever was allowed to come between him and God, and his fellowship with the Lord was constantly maintained
It was in this kind of uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord that he continually received heavenly light and spiritual revelation
It is obvious that he received much help from the book The Practice of the Presence of God by Brother Lawrence
From the very beginning, Watchman Nee realized fully that he should live by faith, not only for his living, but also for the Lord's work
We can do whatever we like, whenever we like, without needing to seek the Lord's will or to wait for His guidance
To live by faith requires us to be restricted to the Lord's will; otherwise, when we pray in faith He will not answer
Through living by faith, Watchman Nee was preserved from being distracted by the outward appearance of the work
He knew that if he performed any work which was not done in life and according to God's will, God would never respond to his faith
He became a strong example for all his close associates who had been called by the Lord to live and work for Him by faith
Regarding many spiritual testimonies, an appropriate length of time should be allowed to elapse before they are divulged
In China today there are approximately fifty brothers and sisters in fellowship with us who live by relying solely on the Lord
She had many friends, Chinese and foreign, and the field of her work was very wide since she preached everywhere
The devil said, 'You could ask the co-workers to buy your ticket, then repay them when you reach the provincial capital'
It was not only sufficient for my return expenses to Foochow, but also for printing one issue of The Present Testimony
At this point she continued with tears, 'If you had not given us the five dollars on that day, we would have suffered hunger
From her natural being, the widow who gave two half-farthings might have grudged doing so, but she was praised by the Lord
The letter read, 'I like to distribute gospel tracts and feel constrained to assist you in the matter of printing gospel tracts
In the few years after the publication work was begun, God always answered my prayers and supplied all our needs
Then she took out thirty silver dollars and placed them on the table, saying, 'Spend it on whatever you feel the need is'
In Watchman Nee's Narration of the Past, given in a meeting on the Lord's Day, December 4, 1932, he related the same matters in more detail
Pray before each donation; then give it either to the poor or to some work, but never to an improper organization'
Later, another person gave an additional thirty dollars, which was sufficient for the postage and incidental expenses
Before long the Lord provided four hundred dollars, and we entered into a contract with a printer to commence printing the book
Seeing that we were able to maintain good faith, the printer said, 'No one but you church people make payments so punctually'
We have no lack of money for printing, although we have asked contributions from no one, and no one has given us an endowment fund
He gave the following words of gratitude in his open letter in the twelfth issue of The Present Testimony, published December 19, 1929
Watchman Nee received the revelation that he had been crucified with Christ that it was no longer he that lived but Christ that lived in him
He realized that for him to have such an experience God must sovereignly arrange his environment making it a practical cross for him to bear
Throughout the years he was a person under the cross, willing to be opposed, rejected, criticized, and condemned
He would not vindicate himself, excuse himself, reason with people, or explain things in order to reduce his sufferings
He felt that his six co-workers had unfairly excommunicated him, and he intended to return and vindicate himself
Miss Groves a sister who had previously been a help to him heard the rumor and came to ask Is it true that you have a woman living with you
He did not say a word to vindicate himself; neither did he take any steps to appease the situation or reduce his suffering
During that sixyear period of suffering he did nothing to attempt to recover his ministry nor did he attempt to start any other kind of work
He kept himself fully in the confinement of Christ's death and experienced Christ as his life during that long trial
Its wine throughout the winter Warmth and sweetness ever bears Unto those in coldness shiv'ring, Pressed with sorrow, pain, and cares
Without, alone, the grapevine Midst the ice and snow doth stand, Steadfastly its lot enduring, Though 'tis hard to understand
Breathing air, untainted, heavenly, As it lifts its arms on high, Earth's impure, defiled affections Ne'er the vine may occupy
Facing sacrifice, yet smiling, And while love doth prune once more, Strokes it bears as if it never Suffered loss and pain before
He was still willing to face any sacrifice by being pruned once more, as if he had never suffered any strokes before
One evening after the meeting, two young men standing at the front gate of the meeting hall were distributing flyers criticizing him
The Lord, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself
It was also by the resurrection life of Christ that he served the Lord, worked for Him, and carried out His commission
He further saw that the church as the Body of Christ was simply the enlargement, expansion, and expression of the resurrected Christ
He not only ministered by the resurrected Christ, but also ministered the resurrected Christ to the saints for the building up of His Body
The more he continued his ministry, the more he ministered the resurrected Christ to the saints and to the churches
The rich provision of God's sufficient grace enabled him to live such an overcoming life by the power of the resurrected Christ
By the crucified and resurrected life, he overcame sin, the world, self, self-pity, natural temperament, the flesh, and Satan
By the crucified and resurrected life, he also overcame defeated, degraded, and deviated Christianity with all its forms and traditions
He equally overcame Christianity's criticisms, rejections, oppositions, and persecutions by the crucified and resurrected life
By living such a life, he followed his Master as the Lamb and bore His reproach outside the camp of Christianity in an overcoming way
In spite of the situation he was in, he proceeded to prepare the current issue of The Present Testimony for publication
With tears of joy we thank the Lord today that He has enabled us to put out this issue of The Present Testimony in His victory
Watchman Nee lived an overcoming life, worked by such a life, and ministered such a life to the saints and to the churches
In the final period of his life, to all appearances he was taken away from his ministry by a change in the political situation
However, he was sovereignly put into an environment which afforded him a long period of twenty years to live an overcoming life
Margaret Barber was a great example to Watchman Nee in the one matter of paying more attention to life than to work
What he admired might be able to stir people up and motivate them to perform certain works, but it could never minister life to people
Through such spiritual diagnosis, he was educated to discern and distinguish the difference between life and work
He began to realize that most of the sermons given by preachers and Christian teachers were not grains of life but flakes of chaff
He also observed that in most Christian work, supposedly carried out for Christ, there is very little life ministered to people
Rather, he considered these things a sort of safeguard to preserve him in life and cause him to grow more in the Lord
Watchman Nee saw through 1 Corinthians 3:12-15 that the important thing regarding our work is not its quantity but its quality
We will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ not according to the quantity but according to the quality of our work
With the gifts, knowledge, and ability he had, he could easily have acquired a large following in Christianity
His ministry began from the year 1922, and the church in Shanghai, which was fully under his ministry, was raised up in 1927
After he had been in his ministry for over six years, the number of saints in the Lord's recovery at that time was still so small
He was not disappointed; rather, he was strongly encouraged because he realized that that small number was the issue of his ministry
Because Watchman Nee was not interested in the outward work, the life-issue of his ministry has flowed throughout the whole earth
It is a sad thing that while the children of God realize that God is not in excitement, they still are bent on having excitement
Because of overwork and lack of adequate physical care, Watchman Nee became sick with tuberculosis of the lungs in 1924
During this time of illness, he was greatly exercised to trust in God for his existence, and God faithfully cared for him
We all know that human beings love themselves and consider it more comfortable to die in bed than to die standing
He experienced the reality of Psalm 73:25 in a practical way, to have no other love in heaven or on earth but the Lord
She made a threat that if Watchman Nee would not pay her the customary courtesy call she would cause him trouble
It was God's sovereign arrangement that they had no children to burden them while undergoing such a long trial
Watchman was blamed by his parents for helping many other brothers, but not helping his own brother in business
Due to this family feeling, Watchman began to help his brother in the management of the pharmaceutical factory in the latter part of 1939
Because of his rich experience in the Lord, he was enabled to work with government officials in a very efficient way
He never attempted to prove that he was superior rather he lived and worked in the spirit of submission and took orders from those above him
He was saved through the preaching of Dora Yu perfected under Margaret Barber and sustained by two elderly coworkers Ruth Lee and Peace Wang
Dora Yu and Margaret Barber were of the older generation, whereas Ruth Lee and Peace Wang were of the same generation as Watchman Nee
When her boat arrived at the pier, many brothers and sisters went on board to welcome her, but Watchman Nee stayed somewhat behind
Later she read a book on church history, saw that the origin of the denominations was not scriptural, and became somewhat clear
Since she was a person with a deep sense of responsibility, she had no way at that time to carry out her desire to resign
Several of the church buildings and the office of The Spiritual Light magazine were desolated by those who opposed Christianity
Being now free from her editorial responsibility, she traveled to Shanghai to meet with some sister co-workers
In the same year Watchman Nee moved his gospel bookroom to Shanghai and asked Ruth to help him in the editorial work
She had an excellent command of the Chinese language, and from 1927 on, all of Watchman's writings were edited by her
In 1933 he decided to publish Collection of Newsletters for communications and fellowship between the saints and the churches
At that time Watchman began to publish The Open Door magazine to facilitate the flow of information among the saints and the churches
In the years 1950 to 1952, Watchman Nee was desperately burdened to speed up the publication of messages from his 1948 and 1949 trainings
Ruth Lee not only had a solid foundation in spiritual life and knowledge; she was also adequate in knowing and experiencing human life
She was able to supply much care not only to the sisters but also to the brothers, both in the churches and in the work
If God has raised up some to do another kind of work, we ask the Lord to bless it and our hearts rejoice for it
What we pray for and hope for is that we may be faithful to the Lord within the limits which He has measured to us
We do not want the truths of God to be stored only in the heads of men, nor to always be displayed on bookshelves
We hope that with every issue you receive you do not merely read it through, but rather spend time to comprehend it in depth
When we learn to put ourselves aside and only exercise our faith to identify with Christ in His fullness, how restful it is
Rather, He wants us to admit that we have come to the end of our road and that the goodness of our flesh is but vanity
A little thought for the flesh is enmity with God; a little care for this life is sufficient to make our hearts entangled
Our brother Watchman Nee says, 'I tremble at the thought that the lamps of the foolish virgins will not burn long enough'
After she became a Christian, she adopted the new name, Wang Pei-chen, which means admiring and wearing the truth
It was there that she not only contacted Christianity but also heard the gospel, believed in the Lord Jesus, and received salvation
She was not only saved but also very much attracted by the Lord, and she became zealous for the preaching of His gospel
They were greatly surprised at her announcement that she was leaving home and intended to travel for the preaching of the gospel
In answering the Lord's call to give her life for the preaching of His gospel, she was desperate to terminate her engagement
Eventually, they all agreed that her cousin, the daughter of her father's brother, should be engaged to the young man in her place
She preached to a crowd of over one thousand, not about sin or about hell, but concerning how Satan possesses and occupies people
While studying in the seminary in Nanking, she met Sister Ruth Lee along with other sisters and also Watchman Nee
Through her contact with them she received enlightenment concerning the denominations negatively and the church positively
By doing this, she dropped her popular preaching which was highly esteemed by hundreds of Christians in the denominations
To her, however, it was obedience to the heavenly vision for which she was willing to pay the price at any cost
Eventually, after the war, in 1946 the Lord used her with the help of Brother Yu Cheng-hwa to reopen the doors of the church in Shanghai
After the restoration of the church in Shanghai, she strongly exercised her spiritual function in taking care of the young believers
From 1942 to 1948 she played a crucial role under the Lord's leading and anointing to maintain the lifeline of the Lord's recovery
In his second training there, in 1949, Peace Wang was of great assistance to him in caring for the sisters and young trainees
Peace Wang was also imprisoned in 1956 and remained in prison until she went to be with the Lord whom she loved at the age of about seventy
Watchman Nee saw that what we are by nature means nothing; only what the Spirit constitutes within our being counts
He also works in our environment to arrange every detail, person, matter, and thing in our situation to tear down what we are naturally
All things of our natural life must be torn down, that our being may be reconstituted by the Holy Spirit with the divine life
Through all the things that happened to him through the years, he learned that God's children need the discipline of the Holy Spirit
He was always ready to cooperate with the indwelling Spirit to carry out His discipline through outward circumstances
No doubt, during the long period of his suffering, he learned many lessons, but in his fellowship he indicated no other lessons
He not only talked about the breaking of the outer man and the release of the spirit, but these experiences were also his reality
He frequently shared that though the Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit, if our outer man is not broken, our spirit could never be released
The scriptural basis for this reality is 2 Corinthians 416 Though our outer man is decaying yet our inner man is being renewed day by day
How much life can be imparted in testimonies and ministries depends on how much spirit can be released from within us
The result was that what he spoke to others was not mere knowledge or instruction but life supply conveyed in his released spirit
It was not difficult for Watchman Nee to release his spirit, for through years of suffering his outer man had been broken
It was difficult for those of us who were with him to release our spirit because our outer man still remained whole
The book of Genesis reveals that by the time Jacob reached the end of his life, he had matured to become Israel
It was unnecessary for him to prepare himself to minister; he was able to minister life to others constantly and instantly
In November of 1948 and February of 1949, Watchman Nee called two urgent conferences in Shanghai for the leading co-workers
After he had made the decision to stay in Shanghai, he took immediate steps to carry out his second training in Kuling
Because of his burden for the churches, the co-workers, and the Lord's testimony on the mainland, without hesitation he determined to return
Anticipating what was soon to come, he also grasped the opportunity to publish the messages delivered in his two trainings at Kuling
What they have written concerning him is drawn from their personal knowledge and firsthand experience extending over a period of years
Following the operation, the enemy attacked her with accusations and caused her to think that she was about to die
He fully realized that the warfare was not simply a matter for my wife alone, but that the warfare also required her husband and the church
Through his spiritual discernment, my family was helped and was brought back to a complete union with Christ in our daily living
His disposition, character, and behavior had been transformed through the years under the perfecting hand of Miss Margaret E
He was a man whose inner being had been touched by the Lord, and one who had acquired much rich experience from being dealt with by the Lord
He worked with his own hands, teaching others to work together with tenderness, love, patience, and cooperation
Many schoolmates did believe in the Lord and began voluntarily to pray in the college chapel, even during weekdays
He also preached on the secret of the overcoming life which is to let Christ live in our stead according to Pauls testimony in Galatians 220
In 1937 Watchman Nee began the Lord's work in the southwest part of China in the city of K'un-ming in Yunnan province
His words were full of impact and the power of the Holy Spirit, and the meetings were full of the Lord's presence
There is only one Christ but due to different viewpoints and emphases of the workers it seems that Christ has been divided into many Christs
Perhaps some have indeed touched His back, held His hand, or torn His garments; yet they have no relationship whatever with Him in life
Among the many who thronged Jesus the woman with an issue of blood was not the only one who was ill but she was the only one healed in life
They may be able to expound the Scriptures and may cause others to become truly fervent in their hearts; yet it is all to no avail
Simply commit yourself into the Lord's hand and believe that He is able to take care of you, and spontaneously He will bring you through
In those days the Jews had water ponds beneath their houses to store rain water or water diverted from another source
From all appearance, to rise up and walk with God's word is the same as to rise up and walk without God's word
Because the Lord had spoken a word to him, he did not wait until the symptom changed to believe that he was healed
Whenever Watchman Nee was asked a question, his answer was always practical, to the point, clear, full of anointing, and filled with light
Not only would he not explain or vindicate when being backbitten; he would not reason or argue even when rebuked to his face
He was entrusted with large amounts to distribute in the Lord's work, and he also earned large sums in his business
At those times when there was nothing to rebuke, she would ask questions until some fault was found; then she would rebuke him
Watchman Nee sat calmly in his chair, holding a newspaper, without changing expression, as if nothing were happening
The implication was that every circumstance was under God's sovereign arrangement and that he was willing to receive it as such and to obey
On one occasion he said, 'The brothers who transgress are like little children who have fallen into a miry ditch
Concerning the Lord's leading for the work, Watchman Nee was very keen in his discernment and quick in making decisions
On one occasion Watchman Nee instructed some of us, saying, 'Christians must escape the system of Christianity
When asked whether it was permissible to play cards without betting money, he replied, 'To the Christian there is no absolute right or wrong
On how to maintain fellowship with the Lord Watchman Nee used the following example Suppose a train is traveling from Szechuan to Kunming
If you have the Spirit, there is no need of cultivation; if you do not have the Spirit, there is no way to cultivate
Another of his sayings went like this: 'Some who fall, fall on the upper floor, while some who stand, stand on the ground floor
Concerning admonishing someone, Brother Nee said, 'There can be two results: 1) The person you admonish is restored, or 2) He is hardened
If after such a one rejects your fellowship, he still continues to have fellowship with the Lord, it proves your admonition was wrong'
Later, when he moved into his own factory buildings, it made no difference; his attitude was the same as before
Concerning eating, he sometimes ate only bread and water, and at other times he enjoyed an abundant love feast
Rademacher was a missionary in Shanghai during World War II and now serves the Lord in the church in Huntington Beach, California, U
Most foreigners living in the International Settlement in Shanghai, China, were under the jurisdiction of the Japanese
At that moment something happened to me, and Watchman Nee, being aware of it, said, 'Don't be afraid, Miss Peck'
There are also other recollections of very practical and considerate expressions of loving concern: the day Watchman and Mrs
The ministry of the Word was life-giving, and many impressions were so deeply implanted as to be unforgettable
Since we were not always aware of his movements or his engagements in other places, it did not seem strange at first
Since at this time he was involved with the CBC Laboratories, we received a personally conducted tour through the company
No matter how others may have felt during that time of his 'tentmaking,' we had nothing but trust and confidence in his leading
He also believed that the destiny of every believer is to be an integral part of the church which is the Body of Christ and the house of God
One of the first basic items which the Lord revealed to Watchman Nee was the believers' assurance of salvation
Throughout all of China in those days, the scriptural teaching of the assurance of salvation was seldom taught by any Christian group
He also pointed out to them that the Spirit of God dwells in them and witnesses with their spirit that they are God's children
Most Christians in those days did not have the assurance of salvation, because they did not know the distinction between grace and law
Victory, however, is a matter of overcoming sin, the world, the flesh, the self, and all other negative things in our daily living
Any Christian who is not clear about the difference between salvation and reward will have difficulty being assured of his salvation
Such a living is an exercise in this church age and qualifies us to participate in the Lord's millennial rule in the kingdom age
Such participation is a reward for living a life under the heavenly rule and is not a matter of eternal salvation
The universal church is composed of all the local churches, and the local churches are the practical expression of the universal church
Without the local churches, there is no way to participate in the universal church, and there is no way to have a practical church life
At the same time he received revelation concerning the church, Watchman Nee also saw the evil of denominationalism
Denominationalism cuts the Body of Christ into pieces, and the clergy destroys the function of all its members
Watchman Nee received the clear revelation from the Scriptures that the church should be governed by a presbytery of elders
Every local church needs a group of experienced brothers to take the lead and to exercise oversight over the church's activities
The Lord's table is a remembrance of the Lord and a testimony concerning the oneness and the fellowship of His Body
By the laying on of hands, spiritual gifts are imparted to the members, and fellowship is realized between the members of the Body of Christ
Watchman Nee saw that the real servant of God must live by faith in God and not be hired as the employee of a religious organization
The practice of living by faith was practically unknown in China in the early years of Watchman Nee's ministry
To live by faith was simply not in the Chinese Christian's concept; however, Watchman Nee both taught this way and practiced it himself
To him it was not merely an outward, miraculous gift, but an inward experience, producing the building up in life
In our Lord's resurrection, His divine life was released to regenerate the believers and make them members of the Body of Christ
From His resurrection the church came into existence, and also in His resurrection the Body of Christ is being built up
By His ascension He has been made Lord of all , and also by His ascension all His followers have been brought into the heavenly places
To those engrossed in the world, He will come as a flash of lightning from the air to the earth after the great tribulation
In His secret coming, believers will be raptured to the air; whereas, His open coming will bring judgment to the world on the earth
The crucified resurrected and ascended Christ is now indwelling the spirits of His people as the Spirit of life making Christ real to them
Along with the revelation he received concerning the Holy Spirit, Watchman Nee also received light concerning the teaching of the anointing
The law of life replaces the Old Testament law, and the teaching of the anointing replaces the Old Testament prophets
In the early years of his Christian life, Watchman Nee came to see that man is composed of three parts: spirit, soul, and body
The spirit must be divided from the soul so that believers can walk, live, and work in their spirit and be spiritual men
While their teaching on holiness was accurate, it was too objective and consisted merely of a sort of positional change
Watchman Nee pointed out that all these examples refer to an outward change of position, but none involves an inward dispositional change
Because the whole church has missed the mark, the Lord has sounded His call to those who love Him to overcome the degraded church
If they take sides with Satan, they are rebelling against God; if they take sides with God, they are fighting against Satan
All the overcoming believers must realize that they are on the battlefield; they are fighting for God's divine purpose
In the years 1933 and 1934, Watchman Nee saw that the boundary of the local church is the boundary of the city where the church is
In 1939 Watchman Nee received further light regarding the church, this time concerning the practicality of the church life
He stressed that the content of the church must be Christ living in and being lived out through all the members
Real oneness is not the oneness of doctrines, opinions, or certain practices; real oneness is the Spirit Himself
Even though we may be one in doctrine and in the way we do things, if we are not in the Spirit, we do not have genuine oneness
In the years 1939 to 1942, Watchman Nee was consistently burdened concerning the revelation of the Body of Christ
Watchman Nee saw that since the Body of Christ is an organism, the Holy Spirit must have authority over everything in every part
The term spiritual things is vain and empty unless the Holy Spirit Himself is the content and reality of every spiritual thing
All the members in the local church need not only to be built up with others but also to coordinate with others
He saw that God sovereignly arranges our environment to work good for us through the discipline of the Holy Spirit
If our outer man is not broken, our spirit with the Spirit of Christ is confined in the shell of our outer man
The discipline of the Holy Spirit is both to tear down some aspects of our natural life and to break our outer man
The churches under Peter's work were in respective localities, but Peter's work was in a district which comprised all these localities
It even affords the Lord an opportunity to use their possessions for His purpose and to grant them more physical blessings
Because he continually fought the battle for the Lord's recovery, he was continually under attack from the enemy
The sovereign arrangements of God in his environment were also a source of trouble and a means by which God dealt with him
Still, he was enlightened to the extent that he was able to fulfill the Lord's calling by serving Him entirely by faith
It was during this period that he became afflicted with tuberculosis of the lungs and suffered for several years from this disease
My illness during the last two or three years has surely been used by God to test the compassions of many saints
In the last few months, due to heart disease and other physical illness, my earthly tent is again in danger of collapsing at any moment
One top theologian in China reacted by saying, 'Watchman Nee is just a clever young man who has excelled in reading English books
Watchman and those with him fully followed this word to bear the reproach of Christ outside the camp of organized Christianity
Even though they despised him, Watchman Nee was accomplishing something; when this became evident, they began to publicly criticize him
Such a ministry to God's people as Watchman Nee's stirred up the opposition of the denominations, and they rose up to oppose him
The following excerpts from his open letters in The Present Testimony unveil his attitude toward the opposition
We care only to work faithfully, keeping the first love and maintaining a single eye while waiting for the Lord's return
He taught that all denominations were unscriptural and that only one kind of church is scriptural: the church in the locality
When the Lord was on earth, the Judaizers also despised Him, criticized Him, opposed Him, attacked Him, and spread rumors about Him
Sufferings from the denominations came from without, while sufferings from the brothers and sisters came from within
Two years after the church life began to be practiced in Watchman's home town in 1922, he was excommunicated by his co-workers
Most of the believers who met with them sided with him, but the Lord would not allow him to do anything to vindicate himself
In January 1934, while he was conducting the third overcomer conference in Shanghai, this sister was in the meetings
He saw many things the brothers did not see, and their immaturity and incompetency caused him a great deal of suffering
He held stubbornly to this point concerning fellowship and used it to insist that the young man should not be baptized
Watchman told him that if to baptize the young man was a mistake, he would bear the full responsibility before the Lord
In 1933 Watchman began to realize that for the sisters not to pray in the prayer meetings of the church was a great loss
Among the first three brothers to come into the church in Shanghai in the very beginning, one was very ambitious to be a leader
Eventually, however, when they discovered that they could not obtain what they were after, they left and became opponents
He never passed on mere teachings and doctrines; his messages contained the reality he acquired through the experience of suffering
He was purified, dealt with, torn down, and constituted by the Holy Spirit with the divine life through his sufferings
Summer is here, and although more exposure to the sun can alter a little the color of my skin, it cannot change the illness
Watchman wrote this letter to his sister-in-law, who was his wife's oldest sister and whom he addressed in the letter as 'eldest sister'
Both of these words show us that while he was suffering his imprisonment, he trusted in the Lord and had much fellowship with the Lord
He was like the apostle, who, while suffering imprisonment, rejoiced in the Lord and encouraged his readers to also rejoice in the Lord
Angina pectoris, the chronic illness which he had, is a disease which causes chest pain due to a lack of blood supply to the heart muscles
Longing very much to be with my relatives' indicates that he was expecting to be released from prison and to stay with his nephew-in-law
At that time he considered himself as a fallen leaf returning to its root seeking a final resting place for the remaining years of his life
To accomplish this matter for me' indicates that he had requested his nephew-in-law to prepare a resting place for him
Going to Chekiang' indicates that this relative's home was in Chekiang where Watchman intended to go and rest during his remaining years
In the salutation it should be the commune administration writing to Pai-Mao-Ling Farm, Kwang-Te County, Anhwei province
14 PaiYunShan Farm KwangTe County Anhwei province indicates that Watchman died in the PaiYunShan Farm KwangTe County Anhwei province
Before his departure, he left a piece of paper under his pillow, which had several lines of big words written in a shaking hand
That truth is 'Christ is the Son of God who died for the redemption of sinners and resurrected after three days
Nee were both transferred by his two nephews from Chekiang to a public cemetery in Shiangshan in the city of Soochow of Kiangsu province
They were both buried in 'The Christian Cemetery' beside Watchman's brother Nee Hwai-tsu and the latter's wife
The following two stanzas are the conclusion to Hymn 635 in our hymnal, which is on the suffering of the grapevine
Not by gain our life is measured, But by what we've lost 'tis scored; 'Tis not how much wine is drunken, But how much has been outpoured
For the strength of love e'er standeth In the sacrifice we bear; He who has the greatest suff'ring Ever has the most to share
He who treats himself severely Is the best for God to gain; He who hurts himself most dearly Most can comfort those in pain
He who suffering never beareth Is but empty 'sounding brass'; He who self-life never spareth Has the joys which all surpass
In all his Epistles we have this sequence first the revelation second the sufferings and third the ministry which came out of the first two
When the painting is burned into the vase, no one can erase it; neither can the vase be separated from the painting
A minister is a person who has a real ministry, a ministry which issues from these two things revelation plus suffering
When you behold a man speaking, walking, and gesturing, you do not imagine that he is a horse or some other kind of animal
Many in the United States are aware that he put out book after book concerning Christ as life and Christ as everything
Watchman saw the vision that Christ is not merely for the believers individually but even more for the church corporately
Watchman Nee's vision of Christ was that Christ is for individual believers to enjoy in order to be built up in the church
Watchman also saw that this reality of the church is also practical and that we need the practicality of the church
Watchman's ministry regarding Christ as our life was fully accepted; but his ministry regarding the church was frequently rejected
Many have received help from his ministry regarding Christ as life, but those same people would not take his ministry regarding the church
In one of these messages, given shortly before his imprisonment, he said that what he saw in 1937 concerning the church was absolutely right
During his whole life, his ministry was for Christ and the church not for Christ only, but for Christ and the church
The five general means were preaching the gospel, teaching the Bible, traveling, contacting people, and corresponding with people
He preached to both crowds and individuals; he preached in homes and on the streets; he preached in cities and in villages
Before 1928 he conducted a thorough study of the book of Revelation in Shanghai with a small number of believers
After 1931 he conducted an intermittent study of the Gospel of Matthew with the church in Shanghai over a period of years
In May 1935 at the request of a few co-workers , he conducted a thorough study on the Song of Songs at West Lake, Hangchow
In October of the same year, he held another study with the church in Shanghai on the difference between the local churches and the work
Although he had no desire to be popular, under the leading of the Lord, he traveled through a number of provinces in China
In 1922 he visited Shanghai, testifying in the Christian and Missionary Alliance Auditorium at North Szechuan Road
In the second half of 1926 he visited south Fukien again and established gatherings for the Lords recovery in Amoy TungAn and nearby places
He stayed in the home of Brother Cheng and helped him translate Scofield's Bible Correspondence Course and preached at Nanking University
In the beginning of 1927 he took up residence in the town of TsaoChiao Wusih Kiangsu where he wrote the first volume of The Spiritual Man
In January 1931 he visited Swatow and Chieh-Yang, Kwangtung, returning to Shanghai at the end of the same month
While in Tsinan he spoke to over eighty students at Chi-Loo University who were on a mountain retreat in Taishan
In June of 1932, he was invited by the Chinese Independent Church in Chefoo, where he spoke to denominational believers for one week
In August of the same year, he visited Chefoo from Shanghai and held a special conference with the church there
In October, again of the same year, he visited Kulangsu in south Fukien, holding a conference with the co-workers
From Peking he went on to Tientsin to strengthen the new work there by holding special gospel preaching meetings
At this conference he released his messages on the Rethinking the Work, which has been republished as The Normal Christian Church Life
In December of 1937, he went to Hong Kong, polished messages for the Rethinking the Work, and returned to Shanghai in January of 1938
Meetings were held with them on the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3, which was the study that formed The Orthodoxy of the Church
In February 1938 he traveled from Shanghai to Hong Kong Singapore and Penang holding meetings with the churches in these places respectively
He hesitated at first, but after checking with Sparks and being encouraged by him, he offered the following prayer: 'The Lord reigneth
1 This prayer was offered in the presence of a Japanese Christian at the time the great havoc of the invading Japanese army was increasing
The atmosphere at that time was not conducive to the release of his ministry on the practicality of the church life
His visits to the foreign countries left those who met him with a deep impression that he was commissioned by the Lord
The last of the several general means Watchman Nee used to fulfill his ministry was correspondence with others
He possessed the adequate knowledge and bountiful life supply to answer the questions of his correspondents and supply their need
What follows is an excerpt from his open letter in the fourth issue of The Present Testimony, published in July 1928
The five general means of Watchman Nee's ministry mentioned in the previous chapter are common to all Christian workers
The regular meetings of the church were not sufficient for the release of the special messages he received from the Lord for the present day
In our conferences our intention is only to speak forth the message of the victory of Christ, not to speak of other matters
In reality unless a person knows God in the aspects of trusting and obeying Him it is of little use to speak to him concerning other matters
For this reason, we are free in these meetings to bring up those things which we would be reluctant to bring up in conferences
At this stage, if certain things are not clear to some, we would be most willing to help them in the Bible study meetings
Twenty or thirty were from outside Shanghai, mostly from the northern province of Kiangsu and the county of Ping-Yang in Chekiang province
For this reason we must lay much emphasis on the testimony of 'the victory of Christ,' which the Lord has committed to us
He unveiled the real meaning and content of the new covenant God enacted for us through the redemption of Christ
He promised His people in His Word that He would do certain things for them according to His plan; then, His Word became His promise
We have previously held two conferences of the same nature, one in February of 1928 and one in October of 1931
The extract of these messages was published in the thirty-fourth issue of The Present Testimony of March April 1934
The second line was the spiritual warfare, showing how to fight the enemy for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose
In his third visit to Chefoo in August of 1935, he held a special conference with the church there on the overcoming life of Christ
In October following the conference in Shanghai he also held a conference with the coworkers in Kulangsu in south Fukien on the same subject
His burden was to share with his co-workers the new vision he had received from the Lord concerning the work and the local churches
Although the messages were the same as those given in Shanghai, the content was deeper and the revelation clearer
In 1950 during the months of January and February, he held a long special conference with the church in Hong Kong
A number of brothers and sisters were led to hand over all their possessions to the work, which in turn revived the whole church
On the negative side, there would be training for the purpose of learning how to deal with sin, the world, the flesh, and the natural life
Planning for building on that site is in progress, and before long, young people will be able to go there for training
Just before the building work was completed, the war between Japan and China broke out, and the building was destroyed
The training lasted about two years, and quite a few from other cities remained in Shanghai for a longer period to be trained
In the midst of the training, he moved it from Kuling Mountain to his home at Customs Lane within the city of Foochow
After the second training was completed, due to the political change, he had no more opportunity to continue his training
In the past two or three years we have sent out more than five million tracts, and this year we have printed one and a half million tracts'
These messages were especially designed for the cultivation of the spiritual life and made no attempt to engage in intellectual debate
We also fully realize that the Lord will raise up many other believers besides us to bear this testimony together
Believers today have failed because they have not allowed the cross to work deeply and destroy all the works of the flesh
There is still a mixture of the new and the old creation in the lives of believers because the old creation has not yet been replaced by God
Without the cross standing between the new and the old creations, a person's spiritual life is false, shallow, and superficial
By the grace of the Lord, we would remind the church of God that the Body of Christ must rise up to work with Him to bring in the kingdom
CONTENT The Christian contains messages short articles stories signs of the times studies expositions of the Bible and questions and answers
It was through these messages on the seven epistles that denominationalism was fully exposed and the proper church revealed
It is almost unbelievable that that young man of just twenty-two years of age could expound the Scriptures in such a way
In those issues he expounded not only the first twelve chapters of Revelation, but also the first two chapters of Genesis
He said clearly that the land rising out of the water on the third day was a type of Christ coming forth from the dead
Those who are aware of the Lord's soon return, yet still love the world, are in a very pitiful spiritual condition
Others preach the salvation of God by their own intelligence and wisdom and do not have the Holy Spirit working with them by power
Since its inception, readers everywhere have indicated that it does meet a great need in the church today and has its unique place
When we published our first issue of The Christian, we included a statement stating our goal, standard, and affiliation
GOAL: In this little monthly publication, our desire is to supply spiritual milk to the young believers and solid food to the older ones
There is a certain pastor who regularly reads the gospel messages of this paper to his congregation on Sundays
He feels that even though they cannot hear our preaching personally, he still can use this direct method to meet the need
After twenty-four issues of The Christian had been published, Watchman was burdened to resume the publications of The Present Testimony
Also, humanly speaking, it seems that since this paper is enjoying such a wide circulation, that it is a shame to discontinue it
If we continue our tiring reiteration it will make The Christian a paper specializing in leaving the denominations baptism by immersion etc
Henceforth, The Present Testimony will be a written testimony of the believers who meet and have fellowship in Shanghai
It was my hope that God's children might receive benefit and be linked up with the truths which have the nature of The Present Testimony
We realize that the principles of the spiritual life are truly of foremost importance, but the light on the pathway cannot be lacking either
While we should certainly pay attention to the spiritual life, scriptural knowledge should by no means be ignored
Although the Notes on Scriptural Messages ceased to be an independent publication, its essential existence has not been abolished
On one hand The Christian resumes publication, and on the other hand, Notes on Scriptural Messages is also preserved
In this way they will be able to see how to go on today and obey Christ that He might have a larger and fuller place in their lives and work
Although this responsibility is great and we are poor and weak, we do not look to ourselves nor to anything of ourselves
Since this earth is one that has rejected the Lord, should not attack and opposition also be the portion of those who follow Him?
CONTENT: Notes on the Scriptural Messages, Twelve Baskets Full, Stories, Testimonies, Questions and Answers, and Bible Studies
At times it covers the gospel at other times the work and person of the Lord and at still other times messages for edifying young believers
Although the assemblies in the Bible all had their own local administration, they still maintained fellowship with each other
We believe God's will is that we should be local in administration and yet at the same time be open to correction from others
Local administration enables us to bear our own responsibility, while fellowship enables us to receive help and correction from others
Unless we are open to correction from others we may be wrong without realizing it and others may advance while we do not know how to follow
We feel that such intercommunicating of news is both fitting and urgent, but we have lacked adequate time to write such letters
When we published the first issue of Notes on Scriptural Messages, we intended to include news from various localities
If we are accurate in our perception, the greatest shortage among today's believers is that they do not know what the Body life is
How we wish that from now on the children of God would learn to forget about the self and to be the servants and slaves of the brothers
To do such a thing does not mean that you are free from selfconsideration on the contrary it means that you are always looking at yourself
May we, on the one hand, not purposely try to shrink back, and, on the other hand, not intentionally try to show off
5)The responsible brothers in each locality are cautioned against passing on this publication to those who do not meet with us
We need a paper for the intercommunication of news which will serve all the localities, that is, one which will serve the work
If this had been undertaken by someone else, it would have been merely personal and done by someone who was gifted to do it
Please keep in mind always, brothers, that this is a personal ministry and not the instrument of an organization
4)The addresses of the meeting halls of the local churches in order that the brothers who are escaping the war might know where to meet
5)The whereabouts of the brothers in the Lord at every place in order that comfort might be given those who are concerned for them
Because the itinerary of the co-workers in the various places is continually changing, it presents a problem to those who wish to write them
Anyone wishing us to forward their mail may send it to the above address, and it will be taken care of accordingly
After the third overcomer conference this past January, the co-workers from the various localities had a meeting in Shanghai
In that meeting most of the co-workers expressed the hope that a written testimony could be issued solely for the preaching of the gospel
Recently, several co-workers in Shanghai also increasingly felt the burden to publish such a written testimony
The content of this paper was to be the way of the gospel, the way of life, the way of Bible study, and the people of the way
For this reason, we are publishing The Ministers with the hope that the brothers will understand what we as ministers really are
Finally, we hope that through this, the brothers will find out some of the things that are happening among the ministers
The Present Testimony was resumed in January 1951 with the thirty-seventh issue and continued for two more issues until April 1951
In addition to publishing periodicals, Watchman Nee also published many books for the carrying out of his ministry
Although gospel preaching was not the central feature of his ministry, Watchman Nee published twenty-one booklets on the gospel
He also published a book of questions and answers on gospel truth, giving explanations on fifty aspects of the gospel
In his training on Kuling Mountain, Watchman shared a series of fifty messages for the edification of new believers
Thirty-five of these messages were reprints of the above-mentioned books, and seven were reprints of books on central messages
His burden to hold the overcomer conferences and to publish The Present Testimony was to present such central messages
After publishing two editions of The Spiritual Man, Watchman Nee realized that many of his readers became introspective
Roberts and Penn-Lewis saw only the individual aspect of spiritual warfare, and thus they presented it as a difficult matter
The twofoldness is this: On one hand God desires us to 'work out' our salvation, and on the other hand, God 'works in' us
We Christians are persons in Christ, enjoying redemption, life, peace, victory, and all spiritual blessings in Him
The power of resurrection is the power of the Holy Spirit in which the believers live work and overcome and by which the church is built up
God has put us in Christ and has made Christ in us to be our wisdom for our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
The first aspect is to know God the Father and to experience Him as the source of all blessings, as portrayed by the experience of Abraham
2)A Synopsis of the Book of Revelation gives some crucial knowledge for studying Revelation and a full outline of its twenty-two chapters
4)Study on Revelation concerns the prophecies of the church, the Jews, the world, the great Babylon, and the New Jerusalem
9)Once a Year through the Bible gives the subjects and the outlines of all the books of the Bible with assigned portions for daily reading
In addition to all the above books some spiritual books in English were translated under Brother Nees publication ministry through the years
2)Hymns: A larger collection of 1,052 hymns compiled and composed by Watchman Nee with the cooperation of some brothers
By reading his writings we can realize that he received a clear vision and a definite commission from the Lord concerning this goal
Today some lay much stress on preaching the gospel, and by so doing they replace the church with gospel preaching
The reason is because from eternity past God's emphasis was the church, but man's emphasis in this age is missions
Satan's subtle method is to utilize works used by God and substitute them for the church, which God in His eternal will intends to establish
Many Christians may say, 'We have not established mission boards, humanistic societies, Sunday schools, schools, and hospitals'
You have been a Christian for these many years, but how much time have you spent considering what God is after?
Or has your primary attention been paid to how to pray, how to overcome sin, how to help sinners be saved, and how to study the Bible well?
The Lord was raised from the dead to be far above all rule and authority, and He is above all to be Head over all things to the church
It is for the building up of the church that God has given us apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers
May the Lord have mercy on us and deliver us from our limited vision into His goal and into what He emphasizes in the Scriptures
Before the New Jerusalem descends from heaven, God's goal is to have a miniature of the New Jerusalem in every city
The local church is the miniature of the magnificent church of God, a small-scale model expressing the New Jerusalem
Rather, we should go a step further and ask what we should do in order to be fitly framed together with other brothers and sisters
Many Christians today are very good, and others are extremely shining and beautiful, but they cannot be framed together
If you are a stone which leaves cracks between you and the other stones, you are not of much use in the house of God
Watchman Nee's ministry was received by many Christians, but the goal of his ministry was rejected by the majority
He was neither narrow-minded nor wrong; he was faithful to his Master's goal and took that goal as the goal of his ministry
His deep longing was that all would receive the light to see what the Lord was really after and seek the Lord according to His heart
As he began to preach the gospel, he discovered the need of some clear teaching concerning assurance of salvation
Along with his preaching of the gospel, he incorporated the clear word of the Bible concerning the assurance of salvation
In the twelve years between 1922 and 1934, through his labor this matter was made clear to the Chinese Christians
One brother in Shanghai testified that when he first heard Watchman speak, even when the Lord's name was mentioned, it was so sweet to him
Watchman's ministry also had the characteristic that it stirred up his listeners to seek the truth according to the Scriptures
Before his ministry was raised up, not many Christians in China were interested in checking all truth with the Scriptures
After Watchman's ministry sounded the trumpet against denominationalism, no one dared use the term 'denomination' in a positive sense
A good number of those who came in touch with him were brought into identification with Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension
The achievement of his ministry consummated in the establishment of hundreds of local churches, mostly in the Far East
Most of the seeking Christians in the Chinese-speaking world received spiritual food and life supply from his publications
All the above twelve items are the most mysterious matters in the divine revelation according to the Scriptures
She studied in the American Southern Baptist mission school and as a teen-ager was baptized into the Southern Baptist Church about 1885
An issue of the paper was published with a notice saying that Watchman Nee would publish his own paper, to be entitled The Christian
At the same time the Southern Baptist Seminary in Hwang-Hsien, a city close to Chefoo, also invited Watchman to speak there
I, with others, went to meet the steamship on which he was arriving, and when the two of us saw each other, immediately we knew one another
Following the meetings at the seminary, Watchman returned to Chefoo and stayed in my home for two or three days
Burnet was an aged man and an excellent Bible teacher who had learned at the feet of the Brethren teacher Benjamin Newton
Those days with Watchman affected my pathway in the Lord throughout all the following fifty-nine years, since 1932
He came in April of the following year to confirm and strengthen us in the Lord's recovery and was a guest in my home for about ten days
His messages greatly edified all the attendants and helped the building up of the church there in the Lord's recovery
He recounted all the main things which occurred concerning the church, and the way he did it was deeply significant
A good foundation was laid for my work, even up until the present time, in the matters of life, the church, and the work
Various persons had written him asking questions about the church, church practice, life, and about the interpretation of the Bible
Watchman appreciated it very much and published it in the fourth and fifth issues of Collection of Newsletters
On one occasion the first hall in Shanghai arranged to hold a gospel meeting, but no one knew who the speaker would be
If we do not believe in Christ, we will remain sinful in Adam, and one day we will be together with Satan sharing God's judgment upon him
He said, 'Brother Witness, we the co-workers here all feel that you should move your family to Shanghai and work together with us
The day after my arrival, Watchman came to my place, threw a bundle of articles to me, and said, 'Please write a preface for these articles'
The publication of The Christian was suspended for a period of seven years, during which he published only The Present Testimony
From the end of 1933, Watchman Nee also issued a paper with news of the work and the churches entitled Collection of Newsletters
We five brothers from five different provinces ranging from the far north to the far south traveled and lodged together for a number of days
We enjoyed Brother Nee's helpful building-up fellowship and the Lord's presence with the oneness and harmony in the spirit
Although they have left their particular denominations, they have never left the work which these denominations afforded them
He should never have the thought that since he has been a worker before, he can therefore go ahead and begin a work in any locality
Most of the brothers and sisters in Swatow are like a sheet of white paper all that is needed is some good writing
2)The brothers and sisters in a locality who are lacking in gift should procure proper jobs and serve God with their jobs
If a brother or sister professes to be called by the Lord yet is not gifted, then in the eyes of others, this calling is questionable
We should let any seeking one after hearing the truth and realizing the error in which he is be willing to pay the price to follow the Word
If the sisters intentionally refuse to stand on the proper position, then the brothers will not have a standing there
It is excusable to be in this situation if one is unclear, but if he is disobedient after knowing, then it becomes a matter of motive
The brothers in Swatow are very burning for the gospel, preaching twice weekly with two brothers responsible each time
Recently quite a few brothers and sisters in each locality were out of jobs, while the others mostly had only average jobs
Although many brothers and sisters have given their utmost, there is still a lack for the work and the workers
Concerning the localities, we have neither the power to control any of them nor the right to interfere with any of their activities
We told her immediately that we would be more than happy to do what Watchman desired and felt honored to be asked by him
After three or four months, Watchman returned, and by May of 1935, although the storm was still present, it had calmed somewhat
Eventually, he did it himself and asked me, another co-worker, and the three elders in Shanghai to sign the letter with him
For a number of days Watchman went to stay in Tsinan with Brother Stearns, who was an American Presbyterian doctor
Since the Lord had caused a revival the decision was made that the coworkers were to go out to the major cities to spread the Lords recovery
In January of 1936, I, together with Peace Wang, a young sister under instruction, and two young brother co-workers, were sent there
After those special meetings, Watchman returned to Shanghai and continued to work there for the Lord's recovery
We preached the gospel to the governor and all his high officials with their wives and friends in that brother's courtyard in the evenings
Peace Wang, Chang Yu-tzu, a third co-worker, and myself arrived at Shanghai early on the morning of January 1, 1937
In that conference, messages were released which now form the substance of the book entitled The Normal Christian Church Life
The construction work of the training center was damaged by the invading Japanese in August 1937 before it was completed
One day while walking with him down the stairway of the meeting hall, he said to me, 'We have the blueprint of God's plan in our hand'
In the same summer Watchman returned from Chungking to Shanghai and located there for his pharmaceutical business
Many times we had fellowship concerning life, the Spirit, the work, the churches, and the Lord's move in the recovery
Many who were distracted by the storm in 1942, which caused the church in Shanghai to be closed, were recovered
To our surprise a sister sitting among those far away burst out, 'Why should we not do it right now according to Brother Nee's message'?
In one of the conference meetings in Shanghai, he requested that we sing the spiritual prose on the life of the grapevine
His desire after so many years of suffering was to express his spiritual sentiment through the singing of that prose
It was, therefore, necessary to build a larger meeting hall, and a piece of land was purchased for that purpose on Nan-Yang Road
He replied that the Lord knew that Judas was stealing from the purse, but He still allowed him to care for the money
He presented a bundle of interest bills to us showing that Brother Nee still owed him a good amount of interest
He continued by saying that to do anything with a purpose, regardless how good, spiritual, or scriptural it might be, is to play politics
As long as you are unable to say that your going there is following the Lord's leading, you are playing politics
There was prayer, and Watchman closed with these words: 'Let us bring this matter to the Lord and see how the Lord will lead us'
In the revival in Hong Kong, some brothers and sisters handed over their possessions to the work for the Lord's recovery
After some had started to pray, the Holy Spirit continued to work, and over twenty people consecrated themselves one after another
Half of these proceeds should be given to the elders of the church for the building of the meeting hall in Hong Kong
We hope that you can be faithful in this matter and that you can give a good account before the Lord as a faithful steward on that day
How we thank the Lord that He has touched you regarding this matter and given you the enabling grace to meet His demands
You still may follow the leading of the Holy Spirit and either put the money into the offering box or send it to other work units
Nee said If a mother discovered that her house was on fire and she herself was outside the house doing the laundry what would she do
He never compromised regarding the Lord's interest, nor did he sacrifice any truth for the sake of convenience
He would frequently compare one view of a certain thing with other views that he might be kept from falling into some extreme
He practiced rejecting the mind, emotion, and will of his soul, and he also practiced behaving and acting in the spirit
Through the years in his ministry, he not only stressed the experience of Christ but also emphasized the practice of the church life
