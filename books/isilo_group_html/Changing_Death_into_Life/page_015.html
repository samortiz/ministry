<p>When the Samaritan woman asked the Lord for the living water, the Lord asked concerning her husband. He brought up this matter so that she could gain the living water. The Lord said, &ldquo;Go, call your husband and come here&rdquo; (v. 16). She asked the Lord for living water, but the Lord asked her about her husband. Her husband was her history. Her manner of life was included in the matter of her husband. Therefore, the Lord asked her for her husband in order to lead her to know her corrupt manner of life and to confess her sins.</p>
<p>In order for the Samaritan woman to receive the living water of life, she had to confess her sins related to her husband. How could she confess such sins? The Lord is so sweet! He wanted her to confess her sins, but He did not point out her sins. Instead, He gently brought up the matter of her husband in order to lead her to know her corrupt living and to confess her sins.</p>
<p>When the Samaritan woman heard the Lord bring up the matter of her husband, she sensed her corrupt living, but she was unwilling to confess her sins. Instead, she told a truthful lie, saying, &ldquo;I do not have a husband&rdquo; (v. 17). She attempted to deceive the Lord Jesus with a half truth. But the Lord Jesus is God; He knows everything related to man&rsquo;s living, and He knows what is in man. He knew her hidden living, and He knew that she was attempting to deceive Him, but He did not rebuke her. Instead, He said, &ldquo;You have well said, I do not have a husband, for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly&rdquo; (vv. 17-18). The Lord took the lead to bring out her secret living when He said, &ldquo;You have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s word not only brought forth her history, her hidden living, but also confessed her sins for her. The Lord Jesus is great and fine, full of insight yet very considerate, respectable and lovely, and awesome yet approachable.</p>
<p>When the Samaritan woman asked the Lord for living water, He led her to know her corrupt nature and then to confess her sins. If someone asks for living water, the Lord will lead him to know his corrupt nature and to confess his sins. Unless a person confesses his sins, he will not receive the Lord&rsquo;s salvation and the Lord&rsquo;s life. Therefore, no one can ask the Lord for living water without being led by the Lord to know his corrupt nature and to confess his sins. An idol will not lead a person to see his corrupt nature or to confess his sins. The Lord Jesus, however, will lead a person to know his corrupt nature and to confess his sins. Some people sense their sins before they even approach the Lord Jesus. Some sense their sins and defilement as soon as they have the thought to ask the Lord for living water.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s leading people to sense their corrupt nature and to confess their sins proves that He wants to give them His life. The Lord asked this woman for her husband because He wanted to respond to her prayer and to give her living water. Whenever someone asks the Lord for salvation, the Lord asks him about his sins. Whenever someone asks to be saved, the Lord wants him to confess his sins.</p>
<p>There was a person who was always praised and felt that he was not bad. He despised Christianity and thought that a gentleman like him did not need Christianity. One day while he was recuperating in a hospital, however, he decided to ask the Lord Jesus for living water. While he was asking, he sensed that he was full of sins. He prostrated himself on the floor and confessed his sins to the Lord with many tears. After confessing his sins, his heart was filled with joy, and he knew that he had been saved by the Lord.</p>
<p>If you want the Lord to save you, you must let the Lord lead you to see your sins and to confess them to Him. When you give your sins to the Lord, the Lord will give His salvation to you. Your sins need to be confessed. The matter of the husband had to be brought forth in order for the living water to flow into the Samaritan woman.</p>
<p>After hearing the Lord&rsquo;s words concerning her husband, the Samaritan woman said, &ldquo;Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet&rdquo; (v. 19). She now considered the Lord to be a prophet. However, she turned the subject from her husband to worship. Her husband was a matter of sin, which was scandalous. Worship, however, was a matter of religion, which was noble. It is not easy to confess one&rsquo;s sins, but it is easy to talk about religion. Therefore, she turned from an embarrassing topic to a convenient topic. But the Lord Jesus is truly the Lord. He could lead this woman from the impersonal topic that she had brought up to the practical matter of contacting God with the human spirit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Changing Death into Life &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
