   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You are not coming together for a performance nor to be entertained.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You live Christ and feast on His Word day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then as you meet with the saints, if you have a hymn, you call for it.</S>
