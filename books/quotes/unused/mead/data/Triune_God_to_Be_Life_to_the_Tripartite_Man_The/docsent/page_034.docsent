Sixth, to be saved in the divine life from our body of humiliation is by the transfiguration in the virtue of the divine life 8:30c; Phil 3:21; Rom 8:11 . The word virtue can denote excellent conduct or the excellent expression of certain attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It can also denote the power to carry out these excellent attributes.</S>
