   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit is not explicitly mentioned in verse 23 but rather is implied, for the Spirit dwells in the regenerated spirit of all those who love the Lord Jesus.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the building up of the Father's house through the constant visitation of the Triune God.</S>
