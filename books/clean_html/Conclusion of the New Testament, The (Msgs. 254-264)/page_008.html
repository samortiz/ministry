<h2 class=head3>8. Our Ultimate Destination</h2><p>Throughout the centuries, the believers have not had a complete, overall view of the New Jerusalem. For this reason, the crucial matter of the New Jerusalem has been a mystery. The entire Bible consummates with the New Jerusalem. If we do not have the vision and proper understanding of the New Jerusalem, we will not have answers to our questions concerning our ultimate destination. Neither will we have the knowledge of genuine, biblical eschatology. However, if we have seen an overall vision of the New Jerusalem, we will know what our destination is. We shall realize that not only are we going to the New Jerusalem but that we have already come to it. The marvelous entity of the New Jerusalem is what Abraham was looking for and waiting for. He was looking for this, and we have come to it. Not only have we come to the New Jerusalem—we are parts, components, of the New Jerusalem.<p>The fact that we are parts of the New Jerusalem is indicated by the word in Revelation 21 concerning the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles. Verse 12 tells us that the city has “twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.” The names of the twelve tribes represent all the Old Testament saints. Verse 14 says, “The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.” The names of the twelve apostles represent all the New Testament saints. Therefore, the New Jerusalem is a composition of the Old Testament saints, represented by Israel, and the New Testament saints, represented by the apostles. Since the New Jerusalem is such a composition, we have a strong basis for saying that we are parts, components, of the New Jerusalem.<p>The use of the number twelve in the description of the New Jerusalem indicates multiplication and mingling. Multiplication is shown by the fact that the city is square, having four sides. On each side there are three gates (Rev. 21:13). The number twelve here is the product of three multiplied by four. This kind of multiplication is surely a mingling. The number three signifies the Triune God, and the number four signifies man as God’s creature. Therefore, the New Jerusalem is a matter of three multiplied by four, that is, a matter of divinity mingled with humanity to produce a marvelous entity for the eternal expression of the processed Triune God.<p>The New Jerusalem is the conclusion of the entire divine revelation. The New Jerusalem is also the central and ultimate consummated significance of the entire divine revelation. The record concerning this wonderful entity in Revelation 21 and 22 could not have been written by anyone other than the Triune God Himself. Only He has the wisdom to speak of an entity that is the tabernacle of God and also His wife. Only He could compose these chapters that speak of a city with twelve foundations and twelve gates, a city that is pure gold and that has the glory of God (Rev. 21:18, 11). The vision of the New Jerusalem was given to the apostle John, but this vision has a source, and the source is the Triune God. Therefore, we may have full assurance regarding the truth, the reality, of the heavenly Jerusalem presented in Revelation 21 and 22. The revelation concerning the New Jerusalem was put into writing by John, but for centuries it has not been properly and fully understood by God’s people. How we thank the Lord for giving us a clear view of the New Jerusalem! Having this view, we may be certain of our destination. Our ultimate destination is the heavenly city, the Jerusalem above, the New Jerusalem.
