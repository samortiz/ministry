   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Triune God Becoming Our Life and Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How is it possible for the Triune God to be our life and blessing?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not a simple matter for something to become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, the food we eat and digest becomes our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order for anything to be our life or life supply, that thing must be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you swallow a stone, that stone cannot become your life supply, because a stone is not living and organic.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only something organic can be digested by us and then assimilated into us to become our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In a similar way, in order for the Triune God to be our life supply and even our life, He must come into us to be digested and assimilated by us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be sure, the Triune God is living and organic.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to chapter six of the Gospel of John, Christ is a loaf, the bread of life, for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus said, I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever, v. 51 . Then He went on to say, As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me. v. 57 . Any believer who eats the Lord Jesus as the bread of life will live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we eat this bread of life, He comes into us to be digested by us and to be assimilated into us organically.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the only way the Triune God can become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Triune God becomes our life supply and our life by entering into us organically to be assimilated into the very fibers of our spiritual being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Remembering the Lord by Eating Him</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Taking in the Lord to digest and assimilate Him that He may become life to us is signified by the eating of the loaf on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we come to the Lord s table, we see a loaf.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That loaf is not merely for display; it is for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Lord Jesus instituted His supper, He took bread, and blessed and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, Take; this is My body Mark 14:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to Luke 22:19, the Lord Jesus said, This is My body which is given for you; do this unto the remembrance of Me. This verse speaks of remembering the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For years, I remembered the Lord at His table merely by concentrating on His incarnation, His life of suffering, His death, and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I had not been told that the proper way to remember the Lord Jesus is to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The real remembrance of the Lord is to eat the bread and drink the cup 1 Cor 11:24, 26 , that is, to participate in, to enjoy, the Lord who has given Himself to us through His redeeming death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To eat the bread and drink the cup is to take in the redeeming Lord as our portion, as our life and blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is to remember Him in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE DEEP SIGNIFICANCE OF EATING THE BREAD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>AND DRINKING THE CUP OF THE LORD S TABLE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day, more than thirty years ago, I was seeking to define the significance of the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As I considered the bread and read the verses in the New Testament concerning it, light came to me regarding what it means to remember the Lord at His table.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I saw that to remember the Lord is not merely to think about Him, not merely to recall what He experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, to remember the Lord is to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord clearly said, This is My body which is given for you; do this unto the remembrance of Me. By this we see that the proper remembrance of the Lord is to eat Him, to take Him in as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The bread on the table is not for us to analyze or merely think about; the bread is for us to take in, to eat, as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This bread should be digested and assimilated by us to become our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The significance of this is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eating the bread of the Lord s table indicates that the Lord comes into us as our life supply and then actually becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we consider the matter of eating, we shall realize that the food we eat eventually becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may say not only that the food becomes us, but even that we become the food.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only is there an organic union between us and the food we eat, digest, and assimilate; we are mingled with the food we assimilate into us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is a serious mistake to say that mingling is not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How could anyone reasonably deny the fact that we are mingled with the food we eat, digest, and assimilate?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In fact, assimilating food into our being goes beyond mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We do not have the words to describe this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, we do know that we are mingled in a deep way with the food we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In a similar way, when we take in the Triune God as our food, we are truly mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order for the food we eat to become our life, it must be mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The principle is the same with taking in the Triune God as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have pointed out that eating food involves something much more than an organic union between us and the food.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Actually, eating, digesting, and assimilating food involve an intrinsic mingling of the food with our being.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What we eat actually becomes part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, this is not only a mingling; it is also a becoming.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The food we digest and assimilate becomes part of our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For this reason, after we have thoroughly digested and assimilated our food, it is impossible for it to be located within us, because it has become a part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We use this matter of assimilating food to illustrate the deep significance of eating the bread of the Lord s table.</S>
