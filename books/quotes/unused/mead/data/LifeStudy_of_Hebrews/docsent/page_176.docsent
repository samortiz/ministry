   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO DO NOT FALL AWAY FROM GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter twelve we have the fifth and final warning in the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This book has a special arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It has five main teachings, and with each teaching there is a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Three of the warnings come after the teachings 3:7-4:13; 10:19-39; 12:1-29 , and two are inserted into the teachings 2:1-4; 5:11-6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All of chapter twelve is a warning which follows the teaching given in chapter eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This warning tells us to run the race and not to fall away from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The race needs the grace, and the grace is sufficient for the race.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before we consider the matter of falling from grace, I would like to say a further word concerning the race.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In chapters ten and twelve we have three synonymous terms.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 10:20 we have the new and living way and in 12:1 we have the race.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we have seen, the race is the way on which we are running.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are walking, the way remains a way, but once we begin to run, the way becomes the race.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The third of these synonymous terms is paths 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The living way, the race, and the paths all point to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The way on which we walk should be the race we are running, and the race should be the paths.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whether we call it the race, the way, or the paths, the meaning is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps you are wondering why both the way and the race are singular while the paths are plural.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is like one freeway which has many sections.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The many sections are many paths.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The way in 10:20 is the way to enter into the Holy of Holies, and the race in 12:1 is for reaching the goal and obtaining the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 12:13 we see that on this highway into the Holy of Holies and toward God s goal, there are paths, and that these paths must be straight, not having any curves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some Christians have weak ankles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If their way is not made straight, they will fall away because their ankles are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, we must make straight paths that their ankles would not be put out of joint, that is, be dislocated or wrenched, but rather be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To remain in the Holy of Holies is to continue the running of the race.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to our experience, whenever we exercise our mind to compromise a little, we can sense deep within our spirit that we are away from God s presence, that we are no longer in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Immediately, our way of contacting God is no longer straight; it has become curved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This curve leads us away from the Holy of Holies, away from the ark of testimony, the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the tables of the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although at the beginning we may be only a short way off from the Holy of Holies, eventually we find that we are a great distance away.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our race must eventually be in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are running the race only in the outer court, we are too shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must run our race in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Perhaps you are thinking that the Holy of Holies is too small an area in which to run a race.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yes, in the tabernacle it was a cube only ten cubits in length, width, and height Exo 26:8, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the temple it became twenty cubits in length, width, and height 1 Kings 6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, in the New Jerusalem it will be twelve thousand stadia in length, width, and height Rev 21:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The cubical dimensions of the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle and in the temple and of the New Jerusalem signify the completeness of God s eternal being.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From any direction, God is perfect and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His completeness and perfection is eternal, unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more we run, the larger the Holy of Holies becomes, expanding from the tabernacle, to the temple, and ultimately to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we first run the race in the tabernacle, it is ten cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As we continue to run, it becomes twenty cubits in the temple and twelve thousand stadia in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we run the race in eternity, we shall discover that it is eternally spacious.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can never exhaust the race in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have been running the race for many years, and the more I run, the longer, wider, and higher the Holy of Holies becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For the young people, the Holy of Holies in which they are running may be just ten cubits long, wide, and high.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After they have been running the race for a number of years, it will be much larger.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we enter into eternity, we shall see that the whole city of New Jerusalem, which is the same in each of its three dimensions, is the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today our continual race is in the Holy of Holies, and the paths of this continual race must be made straight.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In order to make the paths straight, we must have grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must run the race and not fall away from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need grace to run the race.</S>
