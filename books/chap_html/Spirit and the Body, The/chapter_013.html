<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRACTICALITY OF THE BODY</H1><P>In the previous message we saw in the book of Ephesians four main aspects of the Body: that the Body comes into existence through the transmission of Christ; that the Body has been brought forth through the abolishing of all the ordinances; that the Body is a matter of our being joint-heirs and joint-partakers of the promise in Christ; and that the Body is a matter of the Spirit. The words "one body and one Spirit" indicate that the Body of Christ is wholly a matter of the Spirit. If we have the Spirit, we have the Body. In this message we shall see further, from 1 Corinthians 12, that the Body is a matter of the Spirit. In 1 Corinthians 12 the Body is covered in detail.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING BEING SPIRITUAL</H2><P>Many translators are troubled by 1 Corinthians 12:1. According to the King James Version, this verse says, "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant." In this verse the Apostle Paul uses the adjective form of the word pneuma, which means spirit. Some translations have added the word "gifts" after "spiritual" to make it read, "Concerning spiritual gifts." But this is not altogether accurate. If Paul had meant this, he would have added the word "gifts." Other translations say, "Concerning spiritual matters." This is better than "spiritual gifts," for when you use the word "gifts," you limit the matter to the realm of gifts. However, "spiritual matters" implies a larger realm, a broader scope. It includes not only gifts, but also other spiritual things. I prefer the rendering, "Concerning being spiritual." I believe that this was Paul's meaning in this chapter. Paul's meaning was that we all need to be spiritual, to be in the condition of being spiritual. It is possible to have the Spirit, but not to be spiritual at a particular time. Being spiritual is a practical matter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRACTICALITY OF THE BODY</H2><P>We all are members of the Body. But suppose when we come together as the Body, we come in a way that is careless, loose, and sloppy. If we all were like this, where would the Body be? Practically speaking, there would be no Body. The Body would be there doctrinally, but not practically. However, suppose when we gather together everyone is filled with the Spirit, bubbling, and saying, "O Lord Jesus. Jesus Christ is Lord. Oh, I'm so happy this morning! I have something to share of the Lord." This is an illustration of being spiritual. Whenever we come together as members of the Body, we must be spiritual in a practical way. But suppose no one prays, calls on the Lord, or stands up to give a word of testimony. In such a case we would not be spiritual in a practical way in the meeting.</P><P>As Paul was writing this chapter, he realized that when Christians gather together they need to be spiritual. Whenever we are spiritual, the gifts will be manifested, and many things will happen. If we are practically spiritual in the meetings of the church, both the spiritual gifts and other spiritual matters will be evident. In this way we shall have the Body in a practical way.</P>
