   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By the Lord's grace they are safe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because of the danger in traveling, there is now only a home meeting in Brother Rang's house.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The saints in Hu-Shu have been dispersed to the nearby villages.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The meeting in Hu-Shu is better than before.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every Lord's Day there are about thirty to forty people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On March 26 five brothers and ten sisters were baptized, and they began to have the Lord's table also.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can only say that everything that has happened in the past was according to His grace, and we can only thank and praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Peace to you in the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition to the newly baptized ones, there are over twenty brothers and sisters meeting in Hu-Shu, Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The ones who are responsible for the Lord's work are Brothers Lee Kwai-sien and Tao.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have not been to Hu-Shu for over two years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I must admit that I was never a responsible one there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although I have my signature in the letter, I feel that I have come very short of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>May He bless Brothers Lee and Tao and all the saints in Hu-Shu.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A Letter from Wang Shu-fa, Ping-Yang</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Issue No. 14, Brother Yu Yun-fei of Ning-Po wrote, "Brother Wang Shu-fa from Ping-Yang wrote that he is clear concerning the Lord's calling..." I would like to make the following corrections:</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Indeed, I told Brother Yu the above.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But by the mercy of the Father and through His enlightening, I have repented in dust and ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I confessed my sins to God, and I have to ask Brother Yu and those who have received my word to forget about me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I cannot hide the Father's grace in me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He showed me clearly that my duty in the Body of His Son is to be a member.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But my corrupted self did not accept this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How wicked I was!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was my wish and inclination to work full-time for the Lord because I was sick and tired of my job as a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, I took the excuse to say that I was called.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, this was not God's will but my own will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I was acting according to the desire of my heart!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, my flesh was never dealt with, and my self was so big.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I do not have a particular determination, nor do I have a righteous and sanctified living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am only a small, crooked bamboo shoot.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How can God use me?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I was deceiving myself and deceiving others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I was even deceiving God!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I considered God's work to be such a light and frivolous matter!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am indeed the chiefest of all sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No one is more wicked than I am among the brothers and sisters!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May I be spit upon, and may I receive shame!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I deserve this through my ignorance and wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But thank the Lord that His lovingkindness has preserved me from this crooked way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is still binding me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am still teaching at Pei-Ling School, and His light is still enlightening me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I would like to confess my sins before the Father and before the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May the Father forgive me and wash away my unrighteousness with the Lord's blood, and may the Father lead me to be faithful to death and to follow only the Lord's will, not my own will, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I, Wang Shu-fa, have been too forgiving of myself, which has given license to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is detestable!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By grace I hate myself, deny myself, and exercise the authority of the victory of the cross to condemn everything that is of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Please in the future call my name "Wang Yee-lieh."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A weak brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Wang Yee-lieh i.e., Wang Shu-fa , March 23</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Surabaya, Dutch Indonesia</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Surabaya is not a small place.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There are many Chinese from Fukien and Kwangtung here.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But we have met very few brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Perhaps the reason for this is the language barrier.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I hope that we can meet more brothers among the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I believe that there are many brothers from Fukien and Kwangtung who have come here for business.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If the brothers in all the localities can write to me and recommend these brothers to me, we can meet them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At the meeting on March 12, we received X dollars from the offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The believers in Miri have also sent us X dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are forwarding them to the Gospel Book Room.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Please distribute it according to the Lord's leading to the brothers and sisters in tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In Him,</S>
