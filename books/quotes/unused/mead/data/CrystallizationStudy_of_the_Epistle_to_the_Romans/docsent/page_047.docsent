   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. The Nicene Creed Being Fundamental,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>but Not Complete</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today many Christians appreciate the Nicene Creed, put forth at the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This creed is still recited weekly on Sunday morning in many places.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Nicene Creed is fundamental and scriptural, but it is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is because it does not cover the five following major points.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit Was Not Yet</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Nicene Creed does not mention John 7:39, which says that the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Last Adam Became a Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After I came to the United States thirty-two years ago, I was filled with the burden to speak concerning Christ as the last Adam becoming a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1963 I wrote some hymns in our hymnal which declare this truth Hymns, #493, #539, #745 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Is the Spirit,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>the Transforming Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Nicene Creed does not point out that the Lord is the Spirit, the transforming Spirit, as mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3:17-18.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Compound Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Another great item missed by the Nicene Creed is the compound Spirit, compounded with Christ s divinity and His humanity and with His sweet death, the sweet effectiveness of His death, and His all-conquering resurrection with its repelling power Exo 30:23-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No one can deny that there is such a type in the book of Exodus, accompanying the type of the tabernacle, with the altar, the laver, the showbread table, the lampstand, the incense altar, and the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Christianity there are interpretations of these things, but none of the writers of Christianity has ever fully touched the type of the holy anointing ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They have missed the truth concerning the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Sevenfold Intensified Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The fifth major point missed by the Nicene Creed is the sevenfold intensified Spirit Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now we can see that in the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, the Spirit of God is unveiled in stage after stage.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first mention of the Spirit of God is in Genesis 1:2, which says that the Spirit was brooding over the dark waters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Spirit of God is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus said, God is Spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit is the very essence of God, the very reality of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>So when the Bible unveils the Spirit of God, that means the Bible unveils God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first stage of the revelation of the Spirit is the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then the last stage is in Revelation 22:17, which speaks of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Old Testament, there are the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the New Testament, there are the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, at the end of the Bible there is only the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The title the Spirit is mentioned the first time in John 7:39, which says, The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified resurrected .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But at the resurrection of Christ, the Spirit was consummated to be the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, at the end of the Bible there is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Concerning the Spirit of God as revealed in the holy Scripture, the Spirit of God is at the beginning, and the Spirit is at the end.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Bible speaks of the resurrection of Christ, it says that in resurrection this very Christ who was the last Adam, a man in the flesh, became the Spirit who gives life to us 2 Cor 3:6b and transforms us vv.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>17-18 , the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This life-giving Spirit is the issue of a man in the flesh who was called the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The last Adam is Jesus Christ, so the life-giving Spirit is the equivalent of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is God s embodiment in man Col 2:9 , and this Christ became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ is the equivalent of God plus man, and the life-giving Spirit is the equivalent of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, no doubt, this life-giving Spirit is a compound Spirit a Spirit of both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The compound Spirit is compounded not only with God and man, but also with Christ s death, the effectiveness of Christ s death, Christ s resurrection, and the power of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>So this compound Spirit is a compound of six elements: the divine element, the human element, the death element, the effectiveness element, the resurrection element, and the power element.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually, this compound Spirit becomes the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This Spirit is the very Triune God who has been processed and consummated!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is the realization of Christ, who is God embodied in man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is also the reality of Christ, the application of the pneumatized Christ, and the very pneumatic Christ in our experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, this life-giving Spirit, the compound Spirit, the sevenfold Spirit, is altogether the Triune God Himself in many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Bible unveils all this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Bible unveils who God is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our God is the Triune God becoming a man to be Christ; Christ in His resurrection became the life-giving Spirit; and the life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God embodied in a man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today the life-giving Spirit is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God, man, Christ, the life-giving Spirit, the compound Spirit, and the sevenfold intensified Spirit are one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are all resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The reality of resurrection is the life-giving Spirit, the life-giving Spirit is the realization of Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God in man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Today we are in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we are in resurrection, we are in the life-giving, compound, sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we are in resurrection, we are in the pneumatic Christ, the pneumatized Christ, Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we are in resurrection, we are in the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
