   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. ABEL CONTACTING GOD IN GOD'S WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The characteristic of Abel's life was that he contacted God in God's way Gen 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not say that as long as you contact God everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In whose way do you contact God in your way or God's?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are three peoples who claim to contact God: the Jews, the Moslems, and the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Jews contact God in their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Romans 10:2-3, the Jews seek to establish their own righteousness and do not submit to the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that they contact God in their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Moslems are even more devoted to their own way of worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you visit a Moslem mosque, you will find that the Moslems appear pious and godly, worshipping God by bowing themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many so-called Christians, including Catholics, do their service to God according to their own way, not through the redemption of Christ, nor in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is the origin of man's own way of contacting God?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The source is man's troublesome mind, which can produce nothing except knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, men contact God in the way of knowledge, not in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Abel, however, contacted God in His way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we shall see in the following message, his elder brother, Cain, contacted God in his own way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's way is life; Cain's way is knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all need to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although you may say that you are for God, perhaps you are for God in your own way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You approach God in your self-invented way, and that way is entirely a matter of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not follow that way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should observe the example of Abel and contact God by laying aside our thought, opinion, and concept.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Lord, I contact You in Your way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I don't contact You by my thought, concept, or knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Lord, You are my way."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do this, we will enjoy God as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Abel did partake of God as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He truly ate of the fruit of this tree.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>SETH AND ENOSH</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>CALLING UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Perhaps the names of Seth and Enosh are unfamiliar to you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Seth and Enosh were the third and fourth generations of mankind, although the Bible considers them as one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After Abel was slain, the line of life seemed to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nevertheless, Seth and Enosh were raised up to continue it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These two generations had one outstanding characteristic they began to call upon the name of the Lord Gen 4:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They not only prayed, but called on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you read the original text of the Hebrew and Greek, you will see that the word call means to cry out, not only to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although all Christians pray, few pray in a calling way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Most pray very quietly, even in silence.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, the third and fourth generations of mankind learned that in order to contact God they needed to cry out to Him and call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not argue that God is not deaf, that He is able to hear us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even the Lord Jesus Himself prayed with a strong cry in the garden Heb 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>During the time of Seth and Enosh, men learned how to pray to God in the way of calling on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you try it, you will discover that it makes a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Apostle Paul said that the Lord is rich unto all who call upon Him Rom 10:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you want to enjoy the riches of the Lord, you need to call upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suppose you are helping a new convert touch the Lord in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He prays, "Jesus, You are the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You died for me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I take You as my Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thank You."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although this is a good prayer, it is better for him to call on the Lord in a strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If he says, "O Lord Jesus, thank You for dying for me," his spirit will be stirred up and he will touch the Lord in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although the third and fourth generations of mankind discovered the way of calling on the name of the Lord, this way of calling on Him was gradually lost.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many Christians today neglect it and even despise it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, no Christian can escape calling on the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>During peaceful and untroubled times you may retain your composure, unwilling to lose your face by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, during a time of difficulty, perhaps after an automobile accident or in a time of sudden illness, you will call on Him spontaneously, saying, "O Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is unnecessary for us to teach people to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One day they will call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When troubles come, they will have the need to call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To call on the name of the Lord is simply to enjoy Him and to eat Him as the tree of life.</S>
