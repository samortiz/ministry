   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Perhaps you will ask, "What then shall I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is not a matter of what you should do.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, you must have the ability to discern.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You must be able to discern that such a brother may have all the reasons, but his very person is wrong before God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you can exercise your discernment to such an extent, you can help him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Gradually, you may fellowship with him and explain to him, "Brother, in this matter no doubt you are right.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the reasons are on your side.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the blame is on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But brother, let me have some fellowship with you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this matter, what is your inner feeling before God?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you fellowship with him in such a way, you will be not only a severe judge, but a serious doctor; he will have no other way but to submit to you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He will say, "Although in this matter I am right, yet in these days my fellowship with the Lord is not as it was before.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I do not feel any sweetness within.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It seems that the Lord is not pleased with my condition."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once he says this word, you will have many opportunities to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Immediately you can tell him, "Brother, you are right.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is my feeling also.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although you were not wrong in this matter, I have been really concerned that your condition before God is off.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I dare not speak for your side, because I am afraid that I may damage your spiritual condition before God and cause you to incur more severe dealings in the future."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no need to speak too much; these few words will suffice; no doubt you will have given this brother some serious help.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no need to judge who is right and who is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This brother can have his problem solved from within, and solved before God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the end, both brothers, the one who was right and the one who was wrong, are brought before God by you; both of them receive a solution from within.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason, brothers, the ability to discern is crucially related to the administration of the church!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must believe that all the brothers and sisters are very much under the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the other hand, we must also admit that we who are under God's grace are not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are a Jacob, a natural person, but we are also born again as Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our expression is often that of Israel outwardly, but Jacob inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, many times when brothers and sisters come to speak to you, you cannot believe them according to their words only.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You must also have the ability to discern.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You must enter into their spirit and touch the feeling of their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, some brother may say: "I am saying these things not as slander against the elders."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet, you can sense that he is altogether trying to slander the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Another may say, "I am not at all opposed to the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I can see that they are all quite good."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nevertheless, while he is speaking, you can feel that this person's spirit is definitely an opposing, judging spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is true that they are not intentionally lying, but each of these is one person on the outside, and another inside.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here is the need for discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The elders' shepherding of the brothers and sisters and their handling of the affairs of the church, their judgments and their decisions, are all based on their ability to discern.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you have the spiritual discerning ability, nearly no one will be able to hide anything from you when they come before you and present their cases before you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You can discern a person to the marrow of the bone, penetrating him more than an x-ray.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You can clearly discern the motive of this person and the spirit of this person, whether they are calm, tender, pure, and single.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You can tell if this person is in resurrection or in the natural realm.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You can have a thorough discernment of his condition.</S>
