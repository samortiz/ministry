What is a living faith? It is when man's heart turns to God and touches Him. This is the meaning of a living faith. God's Word says, "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart." Therefore, with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation (Rom. 10:8, 10). Believing in the heart is touching the Lord with the heart. This is all that is needed. Some people think that a man has to be clear about the gospel before he can be saved; they try to present the gospel as fully as possible. But in actuality, as soon as a man touches the Lord and says with his mouth, "Lord," he is saved. On his way to Damascus, the Lord only said to Paul, "Why are you persecuting Me?" Paul only opened his mouth, saying, "Lord," and he was saved (Acts 9:3-6). He became clear about gospel truths later. The thief who was crucified with the Lord mocked Him first. Later, he had a turn within. He touched the Lord and was saved. He was not clear about the gospel. As long as some people turn their heart to the Lord and call on Him with their mouth, they are saved even though they are not clear about the gospel.</p><p>The seed of the gospel is the word of God (1 Pet. 1:23). Once a man touches God's word, he is saved. This is a wonderful thing. Sometimes we do not have to present the word of the gospel too clearly. As long as we can lead men to the Lord, they will be saved. This is another way. This way does not emphasize the speaking of the word, but the act of prayer. Once a man prays, he becomes clear. The way does not involve being clear about the gospel first, but praying first. The key to this way is to bring men to God. This is all that is needed. Once a man is saved, he can be taught the truth. Before he is saved, we should not worry whether or not he is clear. Just bring him to God, and he will be saved.</p><h2 class="head1">EVERYONE CONCENTRATING ON HIS OWN SPECIALTY,<br />AND THE WHOLE BODY COORDINATING TOGETHER<br />FOR THE GOSPEL</h2><p>Generally speaking, the Bible gives us these six lines, and gospel preachers in the past generally have taken these six lines. In order to learn to preach the gospel well, we have to pick one of these six lines. Today the preaching of the gospel is not the work of evangelists alone; the whole church has to rise up. Every brother and sister in the church has to do the work of an evangelist. We have to pursue deeper spiritual experiences, but at the same time, everyone has to do the work of the evangelist. No one can use spiritual pursuit as an excuse for not preaching the gospel. On the contrary, the deeper a man pursues after spiritual life, the better he should be at preaching the gospel. This is the complete work that has been entrusted to the church. Everyone has to preach the gospel, and everyone has to have his own line of preaching the gospel. We must all present ourselves to God and ask Him to show us a clear way. This way will bring in the Lord's blessing. After He has shown us the way, we have to dig deep into it.</p><p>Each one of us has to be perfected in one of these ways. We have to pray to God and seek after Him. We have to give our thoughts and our time to it. We have to build up our own topics and material for the gospel. We should not imitate others; we should pay attention to our own specialty. We should do everything to develop our specialty. If everyone develops his own specialty, the preaching of the church will be complete. We will only succeed if we tackle the matter from every different angle. Those who can save souls are wise. If one line will not work in one place and the needs are not met, we have to change to a different line. If one person is not enough to meet the need, we can ask other brothers to come and help us. We should never be proud in the matter of preaching the gospel; we must learn to coordinate. In this way more sinners will be saved.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 60: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (2) &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
