<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Father, as the Origin, Being the Fountain,<br>the Son, as the Expression, Being the Spring,<br>and the Spirit, as the Transmission, Being the Flow</H2><P>The Father, as the origin, is the fountain; the Son, as the expression, is the spring; and the Spirit, as the transmission, is the flow. A fountain is the origin, the source, of a stream or a river; a spring is the emergence, the expression, of the fountain; and the stream or river is the flow. In Jeremiah 2:13 God refers to Himself as the fountain of living waters; in John 4:14 Christ is the spring of water that wells up in the believers unto eternal life; and in Revelation 22:1 the Spirit is the flow, the river of water of life. This shows that God is essentially one yet economically three.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Not Three Separate Gods (Tritheism),<br>Not with Two Divine Fathers,<br>and Not "Jesus Only"</H2><P>It is wrong to say that the Three of the divine Trinity are three separate Gods; that is the teaching of tritheism. Likewise, it is wrong to say that there are two divine Fathers, one, the Father among the Trinity (Matt. 28:19), and the other, the Father of eternity mentioned in Isaiah 9:6 (lit.). We do not have two divine Fathers; we have only one divine Father. Thus, the Father of eternity is the Father among the Three of the divine Trinity. Moreover, the particular teaching expressed in the term "Jesus only" also is wrong.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Father Being Embodied in the Son<br>and the Son Being Realized as the Spirit</H2><P>The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit. This is fully revealed in John 14:16-20. If we read those five verses, we will see that the Spirit is the realization of the Son, Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Father Purposed,<br>the Son Accomplished<br>What the Father Had Purposed,<br>and the Spirit Applies<br>What the Son Has Accomplished</H2><P>The Father purposed (Eph. 1:4-6), the Son accomplished what the Father had purposed (Eph. 1:7-12), and the Spirit applies what the Son has accomplished (Eph. 1:13-14).</P>
