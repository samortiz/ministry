<h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S COMING DOWN<br />
OUT OF HEAVEN TO THE AIR</h2>
<p class="indent1">Revelation 10:1 through 6 shows us Christ&rsquo;s coming down out of heaven to the air. Before that time Christ was in the heavens with the overcomers who were raptured to the throne. That was the beginning of His <em>parousia</em> (presence). Now His <em>parousia</em> comes down out of heaven to the air. In His <em>parousia</em> in the air, He is clothed with a cloud&mdash;in secrecy (Rev. 10:1a). This is His secret coming, the secret section of His <em>parousia.</em> The rainbow is upon His head as a reminder of the covenant God made with Noah concerning the existence of the living creatures on the earth (Rev. 10:1b; Gen. 9:8-17). He will place His right foot on the sea and the left foot on the land&mdash;to take possession of the earth (Rev. 10:2b). At that juncture He will declare that there should be delay no longer, but in the days of the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet, the mystery of God will be finished as the good news God announced to the prophets (Rev. 10:6-7). After this insertion of Christ&rsquo;s coming down out of heaven to the air, God&rsquo;s plan continues to be carried out with the sounding of the seventh trumpet.</p>

<h2 class="head2">The Seventh Trumpet&mdash;<br />
the Finishing of the Mystery of God</h2>
<p>In the days of the seventh trumpet will be the finishing of the mystery of God (Rev. 10:7; 11:14-18).</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Eternal Kingdom of God and of Christ<br />
and the Judgment of the Dead</h2>
<p>At the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet will be the eternal kingdom of God and of Christ (Rev. 11:15). It will be at that time that the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of God and of Christ. He shall reign forever and ever. The trumpeting of the seventh trumpet also comprises the judgment of the dead (Rev. 11:18a) to decide among all the dead persons who should participate in the first resurrection (Rev. 20:6a), the resurrection of life (John 5:29a) before the millennium, and who should still remain in death until the resurrection of judgment (John 5:29b) after the millennium to be judged at the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-12). First Corinthians 15:52 says that at the last trumpet, the dead will be raised. This is the seventh trumpet, a trumpet of God (1 Thes. 4:16). This brings us to the insertions of the rapture of the majority of the saints and the rapture of the two witnesses.</p>

<h2 class="head1">INSERTION III.</h2>
<h2 class="head1">THE RAPTURE OF<br />
THE MAJORITY OF THE SAINTS</h2>
<p class="indent1">The rapture of the majority of the saints will be to the Lord&rsquo;s barn in the air within the clouds (Matt. 13:30), where Christ&rsquo;s <em>parousia</em> (presence) will then be (1 Thes. 4:17). The majority of the saints will be raptured not to the peak of the universe, to Zion in the third heavens, but to the air. The Bible likens the believers to the harvest and the Lord to a farmer. The rapture of the majority of the saints as the harvest will be at the consummation of this age, after the manifestation of Antichrist, at the end of the great tribulation, at the last trumpet, that is, the seventh trumpet (Matt. 13:39; 2 Thes. 2:1, 3b-4; Rev. 14:9-12). This rapture will comprise the resurrected saints who will be resurrected &ldquo;in the twinkling of an eye&rdquo; (Matt. 25:1-12; Rev. 15:2; 20:4-6; 1 Thes. 4:16; 1 Cor. 15:51-52), and also the remaining saints (1 Thes. 4:15-16; Rev. 16:15; 14:14-16; Matt. 13:30). The majority of the remaining saints, who will be left after the rapture of the overcomers to pass through the three and a half years of the great tribulation, will be preserved in a place prepared by God for them in the wilderness for those three and a half years (Rev. 12:6, 14). Because they are preserved in a place prepared for them by God for those three and a half years, which is the entire length of time of the great tribulation, the rapture of the majority of the saints must be at the very end, the last day, of the great tribulation. Those who will be saved in Christ and have the testimony of Jesus during the great tribulation (Rev. 12:17) will all be included among the remaining saints, whom the Lord will remind of His coming in Revelation 16:15.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INSERTION IV.</h2>
<h2 class="head1">THE RAPTURE OF THE TWO WITNESSES&mdash;<br />
MOSES AND ELIJAH</h2>
<p class="indent1">At the end of the great tribulation, there will be also the rapture of the two witnesses&mdash;Moses and Elijah (Rev. 11:3-12). What they will do in Revelation 11:5-6 is just like the deeds of Moses and Elijah (Exo. 7:17, 19; 9:14; 11:1; 2 Kings 1:10-12; 1 Kings 17:1), who appeared before the Lord on the mount of transfiguration (Matt. 17:1-3). Moses, representing the law, and Elijah, representing the prophets (Luke 16:16), both testify for God. They are the two olive trees, the two sons of oil (Rev. 11:4) in Zechariah 4:3 and 11-14. They will prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, when the holy city, Jerusalem, will be trampled by Antichrist for forty-two months (Rev. 11:3, 2). When they will have completed their testimony, Antichrist will war with them and kill them (Rev. 11:7). Their corpses will be on the street of the great city (Jerusalem) for three and a half days (Rev. 11:8-9). After the three and a half days, they will resurrect and be raptured in the cloud on the last day of their ministry of one thousand two hundred and sixty days, that is, on the last day of the great tribulation (Rev. 11:11-12). Since we have seen the insertions of the rapture of the majority of the saints and of the two witnesses, we come to the seven bowls, which are the negative contents of the seventh trumpet.</p>
