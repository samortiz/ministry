   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we all know, the writer is the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 1:1 says, Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul was made an apostle of Christ, not by man, but through the will of God, according to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because Paul was not a self-appointed apostle, but an apostle through the will of God, he had the authority that comes through God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This standing gave him authority to put forth the revelation in this Epistle of God s eternal purpose concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church is built upon this revelation 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul s being an apostle of Christ refers to his position, and his being an apostle through the will of God refers to his authority.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The receivers were also the faithful in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The faithful are those who are faithful in the faith, as mentioned in 4:13; 2 Timothy 4:7; and Jude 3.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The receivers, the faithful in Christ Jesus, have not only a sanctified position, but also a faithful living.</S>
