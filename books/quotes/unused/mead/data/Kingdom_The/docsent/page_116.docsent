   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LIFE IN THE WILDERNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can we make a living in the wilderness?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The answer to this question is found in the case of Jesus' feeding 5,000 people with five loaves and two fishes Matt 14:19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John used the same case to indicate that Christ is the bread of life John 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Matthew, however, used this case in a different way, showing how the Lord can afford us a living in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you simply follow Him, He can provide you a living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we preached the gospel in the Far East, sometimes the unbelievers would ask us, "Can Jesus take care of my eating?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Will Jesus always afford something for my living?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many times the unbelievers asked us these questions, and we dared not answer them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But I can tell you, the kingdom people, that the Lord Jesus truly provides us a living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Matthew 6:33 the Lord Jesus said that if we seek the kingdom first, everything we need will be added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While all the religious and political people are busy earning a living, the kingdom people follow the Lord Jesus in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even the disciples had a natural thought concerning their living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They recognized the need of the people, and advised the Lord Jesus to disperse them into the villages to purchase something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, eating here refers to the entire realm of making a living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus answered, "They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat" Matt 14:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are all familiar with what happened.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With only five loaves and two fishes the Lord Jesus fed the entire multitude.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This case shows us a principle: the kingdom people who are following the Lord Jesus must realize that their living is not based upon their doing or working, but upon His caring.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus cares for their living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As you read this, you may be asking, "Should we all give up our jobs and simply follow the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you could do this, it would be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But as we discover later in the Epistles, we should still keep our jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, we should not put our trust in our jobs for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should never allow our jobs to frustrate us from following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Following Him and seeking the kingdom must be first, and all we need will be added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually, the thousands of people who followed the Lord Jesus into the wilderness had something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is living by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The kingdom people live by faith, and they live in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today the Lord and His kingdom are still rejected by religion and politics.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we must follow the Lord Jesus by going to Him in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Following Him must be our consuming desire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Don't be anxious about your education, profession, or job.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not worry about your living.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you follow Him, He will care for your living.</S>
