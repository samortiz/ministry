   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Second Period for Lighter Subjects</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>During the second twenty minutes, we can turn to lighter subjects, such as the study of specific words.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are at least two to three hundred words in the Bible that need to be studied in depth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, the word blood is used in the Bible over four hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should go over all the verses that speak of the blood, note the important ones, and group the ones with similar meanings together.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this way we will compile for ourselves a kind of concordance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is more meaningful than buying a concordance from a store.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It also would be good if we could memorize these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Later the Spirit of God may give us revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When a revelation comes, we immediately will be able to recall all the verses on the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A word such as calling was once studied by some brothers, who grouped the verses into ten sections See heading XXVI in Chapter Five, "Various Plans for Studying the Bible" .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can spend twenty minutes a day studying such words.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Twenty minutes is enough for this kind of study.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not expect to finish a word-study in a day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some words require two months to finish.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The study of the Bible takes time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot be sloppy about it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Otherwise, we will not have the sword of the Spirit but a worthless reed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to dive into the Word in a solid way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If our study of the Word is solid, our preaching will also be solid.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If our study of the Word is sloppy, our preaching will also be sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suppose someone comes to us and tells us that the blood can give us a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we have studied the word blood carefully, we will know that this teaching is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The life contained in the blood is the life of the soul, not the new life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to acquaint ourselves with the fundamental teachings of the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Otherwise, we will simply take what others say and be led astray by their mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A knowledge of the fundamental teachings of the whole Bible is not something that comes to us in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must study each word carefully one by one before we can know what the whole Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Young brothers and sisters have to be conscientious in word-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we can get through several dozen words in a year, we will be able to go through all the important words in the Old and the New Testaments in ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>C. The Third Period Collecting Facts</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the third period, we should spend ten minutes collecting facts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to do this every day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What should we collect?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the metals in the Bible, such as gold, silver, bronze, and iron, have special significance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The precious stones in the Bible also have special significance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not consider them as minor issues.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They occupy an important role in the interpretation of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why was the bronze serpent bronze?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why does Revelation 1:15 say that the Lord's feet were "like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace"?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why was the head of the image in Nebuchanezzar's dream golden?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why were some of the utensils in the temple golden?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Why was the ark covered with gold, not silver?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Why were the bases of the tabernacle silver?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Zechariah 5 we find lead.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What does this refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to study these things carefully before we can understand what they mean exegetically.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>During this period of time, we should collect all these facts and write down the verses one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Later, we may devote the first period of time to meditate on them and study them, or we may read about them in the second period.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In other words, during the third period, we collect material for our study in the first and second periods.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The book of Ephesians speaks of the spirit fifteen times.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can use the third period of time to find these fifteen instances.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Ephesians 1:13 speaks of the seal of the Spirit, and we can write down all the verses in the New Testament that speak of the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Ephesians 1:17 speaks of a spirit of wisdom and revelation, and we can write down all the verses that link the spirit with wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After we have collected and sorted out all these facts, we can study them during the twenty minutes of the first or second period.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we do not have the facts gathered and sorted ahead of time, our study will not have a basis and will not be that accurate.</S>
