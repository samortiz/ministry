<p>If we do not see the mystery of Christ’s redemptive work, we shall not know the significance of the blood and water flowing out from His side. The flowing of the blood and water is mysterious. Blood is for redeeming, but water is for life-imparting. This is mysterious because life-imparting is a mysterious matter. As we have pointed out, the Lord’s death on the cross was likened to a grain of wheat falling into the earth to die in order to bring forth many grains. This aspect of Christ’s death is also a mystery.<p>Another mysterious aspect of the Lord’s death is referred to in John 3:14 and 15: “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that every one who believes in Him may have eternal life.” This is the fulfillment of the type of the brass serpent lifted up on a pole by Moses (Num. 21:4-9). When the children of Israel sinned against God, they were bitten by serpents. God told Moses to lift up a brass serpent on their behalf for God’s judgment so that by looking upon that brass serpent all might live. That was the type. In John 3:14 the Lord Jesus applied this type to Himself. As the fulfillment of the type of the brass serpent lifted up on a pole, the Lord was lifted up on the cross to deal with Satan, the old serpent. This is certainly a mystery.<p>Of course, the incarnation is a great mystery. Christ’s deity is a mystery, and His becoming flesh is also a mystery. How could the very God become flesh? This is mysterious.<p>All the Gospels record miracles done by the Lord Jesus. But in Matthew, Mark, and Luke they are called miracles. However, the miracles in the Gospel of John are not called miracles; the Greek word is signs. For example, in Cana of Galilee the Lord changed water into wine. This was a miracle. But John 2:11 says, “This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.” A sign signifies something invisible. It is a symbol that points to a mystery. All the miracles in the Gospel of John, being signs, signify certain invisible mysteries. Every sign in this Gospel is a symbol of a mystery. Therefore, the Gospel of John is a book of mysteries.<p>As a book of mysteries, the Gospel of John is the story of God. It is not merely the story of a man named Jesus. It was the very God who lived in this Man who performed these miracles, these signs. Therefore, we may say that the Gospel of John is the story of God in the Man Jesus. This God does many signs. Whatever He does is a mystery. We may know all the miracles recorded in this Gospel, but we may not have seen that these all are signs of mysteries. I point this out because we need to realize that the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings is altogether a mysterious matter.<p>We have seen that the Gospel of John, along with his Epistles and Revelation, is a book of mysteries. This Gospel speaks of the mystery of Christ’s divine Person and work. John 1:14 says, “And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.” Here we see three mysteries. The Word is a mystery, the flesh is a mystery, and even the tabernacle is a mystery. The Word, the Logos, is a mystery to us. In eternity Christ was the Logos, and in time this Logos became flesh. According to John 1:14, this flesh is a tabernacle. All this is a mystery that is beyond our ability to comprehend fully.<p>Sometimes we say, according to the Bible, that we are the dwelling place of God. This means that we are God’s sanctuary. In the Lord’s recovery, we would never refer to our meeting hall as a sanctuary. But we definitely have a sanctuary in the church life, for we, the believers in Christ, are God’s sanctuary. No, we do not have a so-called sanctuary built of wood, steel, and stone. Instead, we have a sanctuary built of the living members of Christ. Unbelievers are not able to understand this. If we tell them that we, the living members of Christ, are God’s sanctuary, they would say, “What are you talking about? I don’t understand how you people can be a sanctuary.” The reason unbelievers cannot understand how we can be God’s sanctuary is that this is a mystery.
