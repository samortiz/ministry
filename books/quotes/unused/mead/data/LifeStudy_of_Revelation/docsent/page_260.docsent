   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SERVING GOD AND THE LAMB</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 22:3 also says, His slaves shall serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To serve God and the Lamb will also be a blessing to God s redeemed in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The pronoun Him in this verse refers to God and the Lamb; God and the Lamb are one in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is the same with His in the next verse.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although God s redeemed will serve God and the Lamb in eternity, they will not serve Him as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Strictly speaking, in the new heaven and new earth there will be no priests.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There will be service, but there will be no priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Priestly service always includes the aspect of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because in the new heaven and the new earth there will no longer be the problem of sin, there will be no need for any redeeming work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, there will be no priestly service there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, we shall still be the servants of God and of the Lamb, and we shall serve Him for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>SEEING THE FACE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 4 says, And they shall see His face.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This also is a blessing to God s redeemed in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The His in this verse refers to both God and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Seeing His face means seeing the face of God and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>HAVING THE NAME OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>AND THE LAMB ON THEIR FOREHEAD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God s redeemed will have the name of God and the Lamb on their forehead v. 4 . This is still another blessing of God s redeemed in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We shall not have two names; we shall have just one name, the name of God and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is similar to Matthew 28:19, which speaks of being baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In eternity both God and the Lamb will have one name.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because we belong to Him, this name will be written on our foreheads forever.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not only shall we belong to Him; we shall also be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>GOD ILLUMINING THEM</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 5 says, And night shall be no more; and they have no need of the light of a lamp and the light of the sun, for the Lord God shall illumine them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Being illumined by the Lord God is another blessing to God s redeemed in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We shall have no need of a lamp, the light made by man, nor of the sun, the light created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God Himself will shine upon us, and we shall live under His illumination.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>X. REIGNING FOREVER</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 5 also says, And they shall reign forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To reign forever will be the final blessing to God s redeemed in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These are the blessings we shall enjoy for eternity in the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
