<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Twig from the Stem of Jesse</H2><P>As we have seen, Christ is a twig from the stem of Jesse (Isa. 11:1a). The stem of Jesse indicates the deprived human royal source (Ruth 4:17b). A twig from the stem of Jesse indicates the restoring power of life in freshness. A twig is so green, so tender, and so fresh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. A Branch from the Roots of Jesse</H2><P>Christ is also a branch from the roots of Jesse (Isa. 11:1b). The roots of Jesse indicate the hidden deepening power of life. A branch from the roots indicates the growing power of fruitfulness. A twig is the beginning of a branch, and a branch is for fruitfulness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Full of the Spirit of Jehovah</H2><P>When Christ as the twig and the branch is here, the Spirit is here. The four Gospels show us that wherever Jesus is, the Spirit is. In the four Gospels, the twig is there, the branch is there, and the Spirit is there. This Spirit is the Spirit of Jehovah, who is the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, and the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of Jehovah (Isa. 11:2). The Spirit of wisdom and understanding is for the mind and is mainly related to humanity. The Spirit of counsel and might points to Jesus Himself as the Wonderful Counselor who gives us counsel all the time by the Spirit (Isa. 9:6). The Spirit has both counsel and might.</P><P>The Spirit is also the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of Jehovah. The fear of Jehovah goes together with the proper knowledge. Before we were saved, we were afraid of nothing because we were ignorant. From the time we were saved by the Lord, we have been receiving a spiritual education and acquiring spiritual knowledge. Today many of us can testify that we would not dare go to a movie or to other worldly and sinful places. There are many places to which we dare not go, because we have the fear of Jehovah. Someone may ask us to do something, but we dare not do it, because we have the fear of Jehovah. We dare not buy certain clothes which have the modern appearance of this age, because we fear Jehovah. We fear Jehovah because of the spiritual knowledge. Because this Spirit is of seven items&#151;Jehovah, wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, and the fear of Jehovah&#151;we may say that He is the sevenfold intensified Spirit. These seven items depict the situation in the church. Therefore, this indicates that Christ as the twig and the branch is here with us. The Spirit is His presence.</P>
