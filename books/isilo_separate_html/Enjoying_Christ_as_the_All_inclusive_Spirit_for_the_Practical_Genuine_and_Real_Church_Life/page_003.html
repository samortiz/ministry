<p> In order to know the subjective, indwelling, and transforming Jesus, we need to see more concerning the veils. To this end, following 2 Corinthians there is the book of Galatians. Strictly speaking, sin is not a veil that covers people, because everyone knows that sin is evil. Likewise, the world does not veil us, because many who seek God know that the world also is evil. The primary veil revealed in Galatians is religion. In the eyes of many people, religion is a good thing. No dictionary or lexicon tells us that religion is something negative. Apparently, religion causes people to be for God, to fear Him, and to worship Him. In actuality, religion is the strongest, thickest veil.</p>
<p>The first layer of covering that veils our eyes is religion, and the second layer is tradition. In every religion there are many traditions. Before Saul was saved, he was not worldly or sinful; he was altogether religious and traditional. He says, &ldquo;I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more abundantly a zealot for the traditions of my fathers&rdquo; (1:14). He was a model of a topmost religious person, outranking others and excelling in religion and tradition. Nevertheless, he was blinded by his veils from seeing Christ, God&rsquo;s will, and the church (cf. Acts 9:8; Phil. 3:4-8). Saul&rsquo;s veils were the typical, sound, biblical religion of Judaism along with its many traditions.</p>
<p>Saul was not for the world or for anything sinful. He considered that he was fully for God, but blinded by the veils of religion and tradition, he persecuted the churches excessively and ravaged them (Gal. 1:13). One day he went to the high priest to receive the authority to bind the members of the church, all those who call on the name of Jesus. While Saul was on the way to Damascus, the Lord Jesus appeared and shined on him, and he was knocked down. The Lord said, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; (Acts 9:4). Saul was surprised, thinking that he had never persecuted anyone in the heavens. All the ones whom he had persecuted were the disciples on the earth. Saul asked, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; When he called, &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; Jesus came into him. Then Jesus said, &ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you persecute&rdquo; (v. 5). At this point Saul lost his sight. One who says he is confident that he can see indicates that he is actually blind, but one who confesses that he is spiritually blind is in the position to receive revelation. Many religious people say, &ldquo;I know there is one God. I know the sixty-six books of the Bible. In fact, I know many things.&rdquo; Much of their knowledge, however, is of a religious and traditional nature, becoming veils to cover their sight. We need the Lord to come and take away all the veils so that we may gain inward sight and revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SATAN UTILIZING RELIGION TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM<br />
CHRIST AND THE CHURCH AS GOD&rsquo;S WILL</h2>
<p>Nothing used by Satan is as subtle as religion. Satan uses sin and worldliness to keep people from God, but it is easy to understand that sin and the world are not good. However, it is difficult to realize that religion is a strong enemy of Christ. Satan utilizes the veil of religion to deceive people. This is true not only of Judaism but even of Christianity, which is a more developed religion. We may compare Satan&rsquo;s system to a large university, in which there are many departments. In Satan&rsquo;s &ldquo;university&rdquo; there are departments of dancing and drinking for those who like those things, but if someone considers those things to be ungodly, Satan will offer them a better department&mdash;the department of religion. Because the people in this department kneel, pray, fear God, and praise Him, it seems very attractive.</p>
<p>As long as Satan can keep someone away from Christ and His Body as the will of God, he is satisfied. However, there is no &ldquo;department&rdquo; of the genuine church in Satan&rsquo;s system. The Lord said, &ldquo;I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). Satan is truly afraid of the church. If someone seeks after dead and doctrinal knowledge, he can find it in Satan&rsquo;s department of religion, but if some proclaim themselves in a proper way to be the church, Satan trembles. Many good Christians today have been cheated by Satan. They may speak about the Body of Christ, but they have no practice of the Body. They may even say, &ldquo;It is too difficult to have the church life. Once you touch the matter of the church, you have many problems. It is wiser to stay away from it.&rdquo; This is the subtlety of the enemy. The wonderful Jesus has been imparted into the believers for the purpose of the Body and the practical church life. We must not expect that some day in the future the church will arrive or that the church will be in heaven. Rather, the church must be here today on the earth, even in our own locality. If we are not in the church life, we are still veiled and are being cheated.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
