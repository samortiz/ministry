<p>Today, the Holy Spirit is the compound Spirit. This enables us to understand John 7:37-39. We need to quote these verses: &ldquo;Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; The Spirit mentioned in these verses is the compound Spirit. The Spirit of God was there from the very beginning (Gen. 1:1-2), but the compounded Spirit &ldquo;was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; This means that at that time Jesus had not been crucified and resurrected and had not ascended to the heavens. He had not yet been glorified. It was not until Jesus had been crucified and resurrected and had ascended to the heavens that the compounding of the anointing oil was accomplished. Since Jesus&rsquo; resurrection and ascension, the Holy Spirit has been the compound Spirit.</p>
<p>What is included in this compound Spirit? Everything is here. The compound Spirit includes the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In the compound Spirit we have the number one, the Creator, and the number four, the creature. This Spirit also includes Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. It contains the effectiveness of the death of Christ and the power of the resurrection of Christ. Recall that the measures of the cinnamon and the calamus denote the splitting of the second of the Triune God on the cross. How much is contained in the compound Spirit: the divine nature, the human nature, the Creator, the creature, the Triune God, death, resurrection, ascension, and glorification.</p>
<p>God is wise. If He merely taught us about this, it would be difficult for Him to explain it. Everybody knows that a picture is better than a thousand words. How much easier it is, for example, to look at my head than to describe it in writing. Likewise, due to our weakness, it is difficult for God to tell us what the compound Spirit is. Therefore, in His wisdom, He used the picture, the symbol, of the anointing oil in Exodus 30. If you would know the compound Spirit, you must consider the compounded anointing oil in this chapter. This is not a doctrine; it can be confirmed by our experience. This holy anointing oil that abides in us contains God Himself and the humanity of Christ. It contains the killing power to cross us out, and it also has the resurrection power to enliven us. Furthermore, it contains the intensified ability to bear responsibility. All this is here in this Spirit. When we have this compound Spirit, our daily living, our daily &ldquo;cooking,&rdquo; becomes filled with sweet spices.</p>
<p>Christianity today is truly poverty stricken. Christians lack both the proper knowledge and the adequate experience. But thank the Lord that through the past fifty years He has not only shown us many things, but He has also caused us to experience them. I experienced the compound Spirit before I saw the light regarding this matter in the Scriptures. One day, after having considerable experience, I read Exodus 30 again, and everything became clear. When I first began to say that the death of the Lord Jesus is included in the Spirit, one of my co-workers, being a little cautious, said that it is not so right to say that the Lord&rsquo;s death is included in the Spirit. That was in 1954. I took this brother&rsquo;s advice and spent much time with the Lord, asking Him what term I should use. The Lord said that it was better to say that the effectiveness of the Lord&rsquo;s death is included in the Holy Spirit. I told that brother that from now on I would not say that the death of Christ is included in the Holy Spirit, but that the effectiveness of the death of Christ is included in the Spirit. At that time, I had not seen Exodus 30. This chapter was not opened to me until approximately eight years ago in Los Angeles. After receiving this light from the Bible, I gave definitions of all the items related to the anointing oil. Since that time, I have had more utterance to speak of the compound Spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> </body></html>
