   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Men sin because their nature is corrupt by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They do not need to learn how to sin because they are born with the innate ability to sin.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not just slightly wicked; it is entirely wicked altogether incurable.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moreover, the evil of the heart spreads from within.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although there may be no appearance of wickedness outwardly, the heart is corrupt within.</S>
