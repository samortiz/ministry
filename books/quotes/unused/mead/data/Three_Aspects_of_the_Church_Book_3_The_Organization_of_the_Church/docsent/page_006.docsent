   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING OF THE AUTHORITY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The organization of the church issues from the growth in life, and the arrangement in the organization is altogether a matter of the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the church the authority of God is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the arrangement in our serving should be tested by life and by the authority of God the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a brother is appointed to be an elder, those appointing him should ask, Is the authority of the Holy Spirit in this brother?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Does the Holy Spirit reign in the matter of his being made an elder?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Is there the authority of God in this appointment or arrangement?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Does this appointment issue from the authority of man or from the authority of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has sometimes given me a commission to appoint elders in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At such times, what I fear the most is that I might exercise my authority and offend God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am not afraid of making a wrong arrangement; I am afraid that the arrangement might come out of my authority and not out of God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are able to realize and sense such matters; hence, we need to be cautious.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The organization of the church is a matter of life and of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Who is ruling?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Is it man, or is it the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Is it us, or is it God?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a solemn matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If man rules, this is according to the principle of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Holy Spirit must rule, and the authority must be in the hands of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only then can we be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, we who work for the Lord and serve in various places must check with ourselves concerning where the authority for our coordination lies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only should the leading brothers ask themselves concerning who has the authority, but also those who are learning to serve should ask themselves whether in obeying the leading brothers they are obeying man or obeying God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If they are merely obeying man and man s authority, their obedience is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the organization and coordination of the church, not only should those who serve as authorities be careful about the matter of authority, but also those who submit to them need to take heed to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a brother is elderly and is a deputy authority, he needs to ask himself whether it is he or the Holy Spirit who has the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As those who submit to authority, the saints also need to check whether they are submitting to man s authority or God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every saint can sense this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a saint submits to the authority of the Holy Spirit, inwardly he will sense the supply of life; however, if he submits to man s authority, he will immediately sense that he is detached from the Body and that he is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every saint has the capacity to discern this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I hope that all the saints will realize that in the organization of the church there is the matter of the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If someone submits to my authority because of who I am, or if I submit to others authority because of who they are, it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The significance of being an authority and submitting to an authority is related to the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why should I submit to a certain brother?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is because I recognize that he has the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have been shown mercy and have learned the lesson that there is an order and a building in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I know that God has placed brothers above me, and I have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This kind of submission to authority has enabled me to touch life, the presence of God, and the fellowship of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is another kind of submission that gives us a sense of death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is something of Babylon, not of the New Jerusalem or the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is organization in the church, but every item and aspect of this organization issues from God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who serve as authorities are under God s authority, and those who submit to authority are also under God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The submission of some of the brothers and sisters among us still bears the flavor of society; it is the submission common in a human community and is not a result of seeing the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In arranging the services, the responsible brothers in the church need to be able to tell the Lord, O Lord, this arrangement issues altogether from Your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only this is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many times even though the brothers may agree among themselves, their inner feeling does not agree with them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In appointing elders, the co-workers especially need to examine and touch the Lord s feeling with a clean conscience, just as Samuel did when he anointed David 1 Sam 16:1-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our inward motive must be that we are but a messenger and that the authority is in God s hands.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must allow God to reign in every appointment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moreover, everyone who is appointed must know God s authority and realize that he is not submitting to man s authority but to God s authority, to the Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This bears an entirely different flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The organization of the church must be of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although there are arrangements and coordination, these must issue from the inward growth in life because the church is the Body of Christ, an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The organization of the church must also be under the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The arrangements and coordination must be the result of God s authority, of the authority of the Holy Spirit, not the issue of man s authority.</S>
