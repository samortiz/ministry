   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE REMAINING SABBATH REST 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to the Sabbath rest 4:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the Sabbath rest?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As I have already pointed out, throughout the centuries it has been difficult for Christians to understand the matter of the good land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Likewise, Christians have been unable to understand properly the Sabbath rest revealed in Hebrews 4.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some say that the Sabbath rest in this chapter is the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They say that the millennial kingdom, a period of a thousand years Rev 20:4 , will be the seventh period of a thousand years, the first six thousand years being the period from the time of Adam s creation until the time of the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This concept is based upon the fact that in the eyes of the Lord a thousand years are the same as a day 2 Pet 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to those who hold this concept, six days mean six thousand years, and the seventh day will be the seventh thousand, the Sabbath rest during the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This interpretation has never satisfied me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To say that the Sabbath rest in 4:9 is simply the millennial kingdom is not altogether accurate; it is only partially correct.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I. THE FIRST MENTION OF THE SABBATH REST</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to have the proper understanding of the Sabbath rest, we need to consider the first mention of it in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first time that the Bible mentions the Sabbath is after the creation of man Gen 2:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many Christians, looking at this matter superficially, only see that the Sabbath was the seventh day, the day on which God rested after completing His work of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although it is correct to say this, we need to look into the contents.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why did God not rest on the fifth day?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may say that He did not rest on the fifth day because He had not finished His work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What, then, did God lack?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is very meaningful to see what He lacked.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the record of Genesis 1, God created all things by means of His word, calling things not being as being through His word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the creation of man was not done in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God did not create man simply by saying, Man, and bringing mankind into being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No, God made man with the dust of the ground Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nothing else was made with any kind of material substance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When God wanted light, He said, Light, and light came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The creation of man, however, was absolutely different.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When God created man, He did not call things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Firstly, there was a conference among the Godhead Gen 1:26 and then He used a certain material, the dust of the ground, to create man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If man had not been created on the sixth day, God would have been unable to rest on the seventh day even though everything else had been created.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was not the completion of the work that caused God to rest it was the creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After God created man, He was satisfied and was able to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How can we prove this?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In all the days of creation, except for the second day, God looked at His work and said, Good.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But at the end of the sixth day, after man had been created, God saw everything that He had made and said, Very good Gen 1:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When He said, Very good, it meant that He was satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the end of the sixth day, seeing man in His image to express Him and committed with His authority to represent Him, God was satisfied and said, Very good.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our study of the Bible has been greatly influenced by our religious background.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even before we ever read the Bible, we already had certain concepts about it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These concepts are damaging.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before we could look at the colors in the Bible, we had already put on colored eye glasses.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a result, we could not see the real colors in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must take off our glasses and look at the Bible in a pure way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why I say again and again that we must return to the pure Word and reread and restudy it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to forget what we have heard about Genesis 1 in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you reread Genesis 1 and 2, you will see that God rested on the seventh day not mainly because His work was finished but because He had attained what He desired.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What God desired was not a finished work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, He wanted mankind to be on the earth expressing and representing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is His heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As long as God can have this, He is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God s heart is satisfied by having man on the earth expressing and representing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When God had this, He rested on the seventh day.</S>
