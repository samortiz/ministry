   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let us first consider what these parables show us concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Behold, a people that will dwell alone, /And will not reckon themselves among the nations!"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>23:9b .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that the church is composed of a separate people, a particular people, a people sanctified to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church is not mixed with the nations but stands alone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob;/Nor has He seen trouble in Israel" 23:21a .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that, in the sight of God, the church is perfect, having no iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church is perfect because the church is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"How fair are your tents, O Jacob,/Your dwelling places, O Israel!"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>24:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that in appearance the church is beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In summary, we see in the first parable that the church has a particular standing; in the second parable, that the church is perfect in the sight of God; and in the third parable, that the appearance of the church is fair, beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Balaam's fourth parable contains a prophecy concerning Christ 24:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A church that is sanctified, perfect, and beautiful is a church that is full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church can be holy, perfect, and beautiful because the church has Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the content of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is the constituent of the church and every part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the church as the new man Christ is all and in all Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Christ prophesied in Numbers 24:17 is not an earthly Christ but a heavenly Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is the Star that comes forth out of Jacob and the Scepter that arises out of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Out of the church comes forth the Christ who is the Star, and this Star is the Scepter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that the heavenly Christ is the authority in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today Christ is our Star, but in the future He will be the Scepter, the One with universal authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Balaam's prophetic parables we see not only certain aspects of Christ and the church but also many of the riches related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church "has as it were the horns of the wild ox" 23:22; 24:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that the church is victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church is also likened to a lion and a lioness 23:24; 24:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a further indication that the church is victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Numbers 24:6 and 7 speak of "valleys that stretch afar," "gardens beside a river," and water that flows from buckets.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This reveals that the church is like a garden, that the church has valleys, and that in the church there is an abundance of water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ephesians is a heavenly book on the church, but we do not find in Ephesians the aspects of the church presented in Balaam's parables in Numbers 23 and 24.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Ephesians does not tell us that the church is a garden by a river or that in the church water flows from buckets.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moreover, Ephesians does not reveal that the church has valleys or that we in the church are lions and lionesses.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the church there are lions that can devour the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even Moab realized that God's people are like an ox that licks up the grass of the field Num 22:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we see the church as it is revealed in Numbers, we will not despise the church or look down on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Seemingly Numbers is merely a book of history concerning Israel's journey in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, the intrinsic contents, the intrinsic constituents, of this history are nothing other than Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Having seen the picture of Christ and the church presented in Numbers 20 24, let us now go on to consider 25:1-18.</S>
