   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Nicodemus was an upper class man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was a moralist, a teacher, and a master of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He also feared God, so he was qualified to represent the moral people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The matter of human behavior This man came to Jesus and discussed with Him the matter of human behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nicodemus focused on the matter of human life as a matter of behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He called Jesus Rabbi, and he also said that Jesus was a teacher come from God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A teacher is one who teaches people how to keep the law and how to behave themselves before God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord s answer revealed to him that man s real need before God is not to improve himself, but rather it is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord answered him, Unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord s answer was to change Nicodemus concept.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What Nicodemus asked was a matter of behavior, but what the Lord answered was a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord uses this answer to show that the real need of the moral people is not to improve their behavior but to be regenerated with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The need to be reborn The human life received by natural birth is corrupted and cannot be improved any more.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For man to reform himself is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man s real need is to have the divine life remake him; that is, to be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The meaning of regeneration The definition of regeneration is to be born anew.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But Nicodemus thought regeneration was to enter the second time into his mother s womb and be reborn.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the definition of regeneration is to be born again, yet the meaning of regeneration is not to enter the second time into your mother s womb and be reborn, but rather to be born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To be born of God is to be born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is when the Holy Spirit comes into us that we receive the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be born again is to receive God s life in addition to our own life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How to be regenerated On the objective side through the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The death of Christ eliminated the sins of man; the resurrection of Christ released His life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His death has erased the problem of sins; His resurrection has dispensed His life into man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the subjective side firstly, we need to confess that our human life is corrupted and cannot be improved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Secondly, we have to confess that the Lord has died and was raised for us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thirdly, we have to receive this resurrected Christ as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must look upon Jesus on the cross as the Israelites looked upon the brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By looking upon that brass serpent, they lived.</S>
