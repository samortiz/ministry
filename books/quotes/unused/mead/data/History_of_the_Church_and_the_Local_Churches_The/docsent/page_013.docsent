   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICING THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY BEING STRONG AND RICH IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some young people among us have really been saved and they are members of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are members of the Body in actuality, but according to their outward appearance they do not express much of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They need some time for transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Perhaps some would like to "protect" the church by not receiving young people who are "hippies."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By doing this we make a big mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have this thought or would do this, we have never seen what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This does not mean that the church should be loose or worldly, but the church should not regulate people's outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both ways are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to practice the proper church life, we have to be in the Spirit, be strong in the Spirit, and be rich in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, we will be neither loose nor outwardly regulated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ as the reality will be within us in a living, inspiring, revealing, subduing, and conquering way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then the church will be neither loose nor demanding.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although the doors of the church are open to receive everyone, negative persons will be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some negative persons may come in among us, but eventually they will be subdued or they will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church is not a worldly organization or a human society.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church is something of life with power and impact.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The elders should not regulate the church outwardly, but they need to get themselves sevenfold intensified with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then there will be neither outward regulation, nor outward demanding, nor any looseness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church life will be full of liberty, yet there will be the demanding from the inner life and the inner control of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When some come in among us, they will either be convinced, subdued, captured, and wrecked, or they will stay away.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In these messages I do not have the intention of giving a detailed history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>My burden is that we would pick up some lessons so that we would learn not to repeat the mistakes of this sad history.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not care for religion, philosophy, vain teachings, natural opinions, human authority, human organization, rank, position, hierarchy, or clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not agree with anything worldly, anything of the natural life, or anything fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although we do not agree with any of these negative things, we would not use any rules to regulate or to demand in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to go to the Spirit to be burned and intensified with the sevenfold Spirit Rev 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we will have something living and burning with the impact, with the power, and with the way to minister the riches of Christ to people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no need for us to be anxious about guarding the church or watching over so many negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We believe that the power, the reality, the weight, and the impact of Christ as the life-giving Spirit is with the church.</S>
