Rather, it is the outflow of our inner being, the expression of what we are within.</p><p>The sequence of these verses is very significant. Firstly, we must be poor in spirit, and then we can mourn. If we are not poor in our spirit, we do not have the capacity for the King to come in to establish His kingdom within our being. [Thus,] we cannot realize how negative and pitiful the whole world is.…For this reason, the Lord Jesus did not speak first of mourning and then of being poor in spirit. He put the matter of being poor in our spirit first.</p><p>If you have been fully occupied within by the heavenly kingdom, you will mourn…and be meek...toward every pitiful person.…The New Testament tells us that we do not fight against flesh and blood, but against the devil, against the enemy of God. [But] toward all men, including the adversaries and opposers, we must be meek.</p><p>As we are being meek toward others, we must hunger and thirst for righteousness. We ourselves must be right with everyone.…Do not think that, if we are mournful and meek, we can afford to be loose. No, we must hunger and thirst for the highest righteousness.</p><p>Although we must be strict with ourselves in righteousness, we must learn to be merciful to others and not to place demands on them.…When others offend us, thereby exposing their shortage, we must be merciful toward them. All those who are self-righteous condemn others and never let them go.…To ourselves, we must be righteous and strict, serious and sober. But toward others we must be merciful.…This matter…is not firstly a matter of outward behavior; it is firstly a matter of our inward attitude, of our inward being.…Although righteousness and mercy are two opposite poles, they must meet in your experience.</p><p>[Our] being pure in heart comes after the showing of mercy to others.…If we are strict with ourselves and merciful to others, we shall have a pure heart, a heart single toward God.</p><p>You will also be a peaceful person.…Peacemakers…do not like to offend, hurt, or damage anyone.…To be a peacemaker does not mean to be political. To be political is falsehood and hypocrisy. We must be righteously square, not politically round. Remember, the New Jerusalem is square.</p><p>The eighth blessing concerns the persecution for righteousness (v. 10).…If we would have the kingdom of the heavens remain in us, we must stay in righteousness. But…be prepared to confront persecution.</p><p>[The ninth blessing concerns being reproached for the sake of Christ.] The entire world, whether it is the political, religious, educational, commercial, or industrial world, is against Christ. Therefore, if you live by Christ, for Christ, and with Christ, you will surely be reproached and evil spoken of.</p><p>Each of the nine blessings has a reward. The reward of the first is the kingdom of the heavens; of the second, comfort; of the third, the earth; of the fourth, satisfaction; of the fifth, mercy; of the sixth, seeing God; of the seventh, being called the sons of God; of the eighth, the kingdom of the heavens; and of the ninth, Christ. If we have Christ, we have the kingdom of the heavens.…Thus, the real blessing is Christ with His kingdom.
