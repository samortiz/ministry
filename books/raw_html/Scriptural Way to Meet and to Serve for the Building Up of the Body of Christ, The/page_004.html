 <h2 class="head2">Christ Meeting with His Brothers in the Church</h2>
<p>The church was redeemed by the death of Christ, the church was produced in the resurrection of Christ, and now Christ meets with His brothers in the church (Heb. 2:11-12). Do we have a full realization that when we come to a meeting, Christ is meeting with us? It may be that not many of us have this realization. After Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, He came to meet with His brothers. We have to put John 20 and Hebrews 2 together. When He came back to His brothers, He not only breathed Himself as the Spirit into the disciples (John 20:22), but He also met with them and declared the Father&rsquo;s name to them (Heb. 2:11-12). We need to have the inner realization that when we meet, He is meeting with us (Matt. 18:20).</p>
<p>In the early days of the church life, I heard a message given by Brother Watchman Nee on this point. Suppose there were fifty brothers and sisters meeting together. He would ask how many of us were meeting together. Some said that there were fifty meeting there, but Brother Nee disagreed. At that time hardly any of us understood. Eventually he said, &ldquo;Is the Lord Jesus not here?&rdquo; We all said, &ldquo;Yes. He is here.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;So we have fifty-one meeting here.&rdquo; He continued by asking us, &ldquo;Where is He? You can number Him, but you cannot see Him.&rdquo; We said that He was among us, and Brother Nee responded by saying that He was not only among us but also in each one of us, the fifty attendants. He went on to tell us, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you realize that when you praise, He praises the Father in your praising? When you speak, He speaks in your speaking. Whatever you do, He does in your doing because He is meeting with us here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to realize that whatever we do in the meeting, Jesus, the Son of God, is doing in our doing. He makes Himself one with us. In this sense, we all have a &ldquo;double character.&rdquo; In the Christian meeting, I am not one, but I am two. In my speaking, Jesus Christ is speaking. Whenever we count the number of persons in our meeting, we must add one. If there are one thousand people meeting together, we have to say that there are one thousand and one. All the churches who keep statistics should add one to their number. If we do not add one to our meeting number, we forget about the Lord Jesus Christ, who is really meeting with us.</p>
<p>All the points we have fellowshipped so far will transform us in the meetings. The meetings should be linked with such a resurrected Christ, who is now both in the heavens and in us to make us persons in resurrection. This vision and realization changes the condition of our meeting and transforms the nature of our meeting. We are having a meeting in resurrection because He is here. The resurrected One is here meeting with us to bring us all into His resurrection. The new way to meet implies this point. In the traditional way, we were never helped to realize that the Christian meetings should be linked with the resurrected and ascended Christ.</p>
<p>Christ is meeting with His brothers in the church in resurrection to declare the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers (Heb. 2:12). We need to ask what it means for the Son to declare the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers. For the Son to declare the Father&rsquo;s name to us is to make us know that in the whole universe there is the Source, and this Source is the eternal Father, the begetting Father. All of us believers were begotten of Him to be the sons of God. He is the Source of all us sons. The Son would also make us realize that God&rsquo;s economy is His arrangement or plan to have a group of sons to express Him.</p>
<p>Peter, James, John and the other disciples, except for Judas, were Jews who came from Galilee (see note 42 in Matthew 10&mdash;Recovery Version). They knew God as their Creator, and they knew Jehovah as their Lord, but they did not know that this very Jehovah God in the resurrected Christ had become their Father and that they were the sons of this begetting Father. This meant that they were persons with God&rsquo;s life (1 John 5:11-12) and God&rsquo;s nature (2 Pet. 1:4), that they were the family of this one Source, this one Father, and that they were all one in this Father. Before the resurrection of Christ, the disciples&rsquo; relationship with God was nearly the same as the other creatures. God was their Creator and they were His creatures. But Christ&rsquo;s resurrection changed their status, making them not only creatures of God but also sons of God.</p>
<p>As an illustration of what it means to declare the Father&rsquo;s name, let us suppose that there is a certain family with a father and eight children and that this family owns a dog, a cat, a bird, and some fish. When this family gathers together with all their pets, these creatures are not related at all to the father in life or in nature. The eight children, however, are related to the father in life and in nature, and they are of the same source. These little children may have never picked up this kind of understanding. So their big brother comes in to declare the father&rsquo;s name, to tell them, &ldquo;Brothers, Hallelujah! We all have our father&rsquo;s life and nature, and we all came out of him as our one source.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is it to declare the Father&rsquo;s name? It is to make all the saints know what kind of relationship they have with God and where they are today. They are in the sonship. They are no longer merely creatures. They are the sons of God. They are of the same source, the eternal Father. They have the eternal Father&rsquo;s life, and they have the eternal Father&rsquo;s nature. In life and in nature they are exactly the same as the Father, and they are even one with the Father.</p>
<p>Christ meets with His brothers in the church to praise the Father with and in the brothers in the midst of the church (Heb. 2:12). When the Son meets with His brothers in resurrection, whatever He does is a kind of praise. The very intrinsic nature of praise is to manifest the Father. When the Lord Jesus is speaking within me, when He is speaking in my speaking, this speaking is a praise to the Father. It is a praise to the Father because this speaking magnifies God, expresses God, manifests God. Whenever you pray, praise, read the Bible, or speak the word and Jesus is the contents of what you do, whatever you do is a magnification, a manifestation, an expression, of the Father. Thus, what you do is a praise to the Father. We may come to the meeting and speak in a natural way: &ldquo;The weather is too cold, the world situation is a mess, and the oil is so cheap that it affects the Texas economy. Let us ask the Father to be merciful to us Texans by reducing the oil production of the Arabs that our oil may sell more.&rdquo; Do you think this is a praise to God? In many so-called church buildings they talk about things like this. The Christian bookstores are full of books that talk about things such as how to have a modern marriage life and other secular and worldly topics. Sometimes we could fall into this category in our meeting life. But if we have the revelation that our meeting is linked to the resurrected Christ, we would never talk about things like this. Whatever we say and pray that is linked to the resurrected Christ is a praise to the Father. It is a praise with Christ to the Father because it is a manifestation, a magnification, an expression, of the very unique Source in this universe.</p>
