<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Migration</H2><P>After the brothers and sisters are trained, they can be sent out. The apostles are the ones who should remain in Jerusalem. In reading the Bible, many people think that the twelve disciples were supposed to go to the ends of the earth. If that were to be the case, how could the twelve disciples travel through the whole earth? The Bible shows us that the twelve apostles were to remain in Jerusalem, and that Samaria should be taken by Philip. Peter's visit to Samaria was a temporary one. It would have been wrong for him to settle down in Samaria. The gospel work is a relay race; it is not done by one man alone. Today, the co-workers should remain in their own Jerusalems. After they gain some people, they should send them out. If they do not send out people, persecutions will come, and difficulties will arise. In order for the gospel to go out, there is the need for migration. The apostles should remain in Jerusalem and work there, and all the brothers and sisters should receive training from the church. At the same time, the church should care for the poor people, the unbelievers, and the new believers; it should learn how to deal with them, how to gain them. After they are perfected, they should be sent out. This kind of coordination will be effective; it will spread to all the places. Not only do the apostles have to preach the gospel; all the brothers and sisters have to preach the gospel as well. Philip was not specially ordained to be an evangelist, in the same way that Stephen was not specially ordained to be a martyr. We think that only special brothers can do special works. Yet, Philip was simply one of those who were serving the tables. We have to know that Samaria was taken over by such a table-server. Coordination requires that everyone be consecrated and that everyone offer up what he has.</P><P>Perhaps many will say, "I do not have the eloquence. I do not know how to preach the gospel." You have to start learning today. If you preach well, you have to preach. If you do not preach well, you still have to preach. Perhaps the first time you preach, the sinners will not be saved. But the second time you preach, they will be saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Working Saints Offering Up<br>Their Material Riches</H2><P>Whoever wants to be a Sunday-goer or a spectator can continue to be a pew-member. But in the church, everyone has to offer himself up. To the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs, I have to say that from now on you are no longer working for money. If a person does not offer up his riches, his consecration is invisible and intangible. No one can tell when he has taken back such a kind of consecration. The Bible says that the disciples laid everything at the feet of the apostles (Acts 4:35).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ALL MYSTICAL THINGS BECOMING TANGIBLE<br>AND PRACTICABLE</H2><P>Today, every mystical thing has to become practicable. For example, Christ says that we have to humble ourselves and to love others. Is this good? Yes, it is good. But the Lord's word does not stop here; He charges us to wash each other's feet. Today, no one would admit that he is proud. No one would put up a sign and say that he is humble. Yet whether or not you are humble depends on whether or not you have washed each other's feet. All the mystical things have to become tangible before they can become reliable.</P><P>The book of James says that if there are poor brothers among us, and we love them, we cannot merely lift our hands and say, "May the Lord bless you. Be warmed and filled" (cf. James 2:15-16). The mystical love is eternal; yet it is useless as far as practical matters are concerned. It is more practical to give the poor brother a bowl of rice.</P><P>If a brother offends me, I have to forgive him. But if this forgiveness remains a mystical one, I can forgive him fifty or a hundred times, and others will still not realize it. This kind of forgiveness must be transformed into a kind of tangible dealing.</P>
