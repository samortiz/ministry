   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CENTRAL THOUGHT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With every book of the Bible, there is also a central thought.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The central thought of Genesis is:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is the hope and salvation of fallen man, and God will make fallen man to fulfill His purpose through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once we have a real and thorough understanding of the book of Genesis, we can see that it presents Christ as the hope and salvation of fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Through Christ God will enable fallen man to accomplish His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Genesis is a book with Christ as the center, and Christ is life to the people whom He restored from the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why does this book give us such a record of creation in the first two chapters?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why does it give us the biographies of eight persons in the following forty-eight chapters?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need a deeper understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first two chapters appear to be a record of creation, but this is superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The underlying thought is focused on life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These two chapters are a record of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are too simple and too brief to be an adequate account of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Genesis 1 and 2 were not intended by God to be a record of creation, but a revelation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Look into these chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First, it mentions that God created the universe, and that the universe was ruined, becoming waste, empty, and full of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then, the Spirit of God came in to brood in order to produce life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Following the Spirit of life came the light, also for producing life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After this, the air was made to divide the waters of death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then the land emerged out of the death waters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The land appeared for the purpose of generating life, and immediately every kind of plant life was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then came the animal life in the water, the animal life in the air, and the animal life on the earth, and, eventually, the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Following the human life is the divine life, indicated by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, we can see that these two chapters, strictly speaking, are not a record of creation, but of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What about the biographies of the eight persons?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we read Genesis carefully once again, we may be surprised that these biographies say very little about the works of these men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What mostly has been recorded is their life, their living, and their way with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible tells us little of what Adam did, but it does say how long Adam lived 930 years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we were to write Adam's biography, we would need hundreds of pages to tell about his work and all that he did.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But Genesis only tells us how Adam walked in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We come to Abel, and then to Enoch.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Genesis doesn't say anything about Enoch except that he walked with God, and eventually was taken to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I do hope that I could be such a person, doing nothing and being nothing, just walking with the Lord until the day I am taken to be with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may ask, didn't Noah do something?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yes, he did some work, but not according to himself nor for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He did everything according to God's revelation and for God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We go on to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is hard for us to see that Abraham did a good work, neither Isaac nor Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It seems that Jacob's son, Joseph, did something, but if we know the record we will understand that Joseph's work was the reigning part of Jacob's life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Joseph was reigning as a king.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Strictly speaking, Genesis is neither a book of creation nor a book of biographies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God uses the record of creation to show the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God uses the biographies of eight persons to show how He needs a life to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this book the last life was the life of Jacob, one who was eventually called Israel, the prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is God's intention to have an Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all need to be brought to the place where God can consider us to be His Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is wholly a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>So, Genesis is focused on life, and this life is Christ.</S>
