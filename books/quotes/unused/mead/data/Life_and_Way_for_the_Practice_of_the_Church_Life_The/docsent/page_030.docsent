   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The subject of this book is the life and way for the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ Himself is the life, and He is the Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today the Body life, the church life, is Christ Himself realized as the Spirit and dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The only thing you need is to realize that you have this wonderful Spirit within you as the reality of Christ, as the fullness of the Godhead, and as everything to you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, you have to renounce yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Renounce both your evil things and good things, both your failures and successes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Renounce your whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Forget about yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have Christ as the Spirit in you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is moving, acting, living, working, shining, regulating, and anointing within you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You need to follow this wonderful Spirit and cooperate with Him, go along with Him, and take Him as everything for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, you need to learn the lesson of renouncing yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You can never practice the church life by the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you do not learn the lesson of remaining on the cross all the time, there will be a lot of trouble in your practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every brother and sister is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Human nature is troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All of us have to go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If there are "you and I," there is no Body, no church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why Paul said, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I...but...Christ..."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Gal 2:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all have to see that the practice of the church life is not by bringing everyone into agreement with one another through discussions, talks, and negotiations with certain terms or conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, the way to practice the church life is to put everyone and everything on the cross and to have everyone take Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we will be permeated and saturated by Christ and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we will be from within to without, wholly, thoroughly, and absolutely a member of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Body of Christ is the new man created in Christ Eph 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you think the creation of the new man has been accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, it has been accomplished, but on the other hand, it is in the process of being accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Day by day we are under the process of transformation, permeation, and saturation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to see that God desires to transform our whole being, that is, to permeate our whole person with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not merely a religious change, improvement, correction, or adjustment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is absolutely a transformation with Christ, by Christ, and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE LAW OF LIFE SATURATING OUR INWARD PARTS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to be transformed by Christ and saturated with the wonderful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is why the one law in Jeremiah 31:33 has become many laws in Hebrews 8:10.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are many laws because we have many parts, our inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jeremiah 31:33 says, "This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith Jehovah: I will put my law in their inward parts" ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One law is put into many parts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The term inward parts is also mentioned in Psalm 51:6, which says, "Behold, You delight in truth in the inward parts."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our inward parts are the parts of our soul the mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have the mind to think, the emotion to love, and the will to make decisions; all these parts need to be saturated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God put His one law into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This one law is the law of the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The law is the Spirit and the Spirit is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God put Himself into us as the all-inclusive Spirit, who is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This law saturates our emotion, subdues our will, and renews our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This one law regulates us, rules us, controls us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We do not need outward teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have an inner regulating, which is illuminating, energizing, and strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, the one law put into us becomes the many laws in our inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Actually, there are not many laws, but one law with many functions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is the same with the one Spirit of God who is referred to as the seven Spirits in the book of Revelation 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The one Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit, the sevenfold Spirit, with many functions for many purposes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Seven is the number that represents completion and perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Spirit of God is complete, perfect, and all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is one Spirit with many all-inclusive functions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we remain on the cross and go along with the wonderful, indwelling, all-inclusive Spirit with His many functions, we will become a real part of Christ and will automatically, spontaneously, happily, gladly, and enjoyably have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We will have the reality of the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is no need for any kind of organization, because we are a living organism of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I hope that we all can see the central thought of God as revealed in the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I do believe this is what the Lord is going to recover in these last days, that is, the knowledge, the realization, and the apprehension of the wonderful Spirit transforming, working, subduing, illuminating, anointing, and regulating within us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord is working in this country to recover the genuine church life, not the church organization, forms, formalities, rituals, charters, regulations, and rules.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The time is ripe now, and people everywhere in this country are really seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They are seeking Christ as life and the church as the living expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I do have the assurance in these days that the Lord is going to recover the experience of Christ as life and the way to practice the church life so that Christ may have a living expression through His Body in many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the unique burden with which the Lord has burdened us.</S>
