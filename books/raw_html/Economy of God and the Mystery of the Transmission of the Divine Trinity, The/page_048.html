<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>LEARNING OUR SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES IN THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h1><p>Concerning the dispensing of the Triune God, there are a few more crucial verses—2 Corinthians 13:14 and Revelation 1:4-5.<h2 class=head1>THE DISPENSING OF THE TRIUNE GOD VERSUS THE CULTIVATION OF RELIGION</h2><p>The dispensing of the Triune God is the basic requirement for spiritual experiences We cannot be separated from this dispensing even for a single day. Whenever we stay away from the dispensing of the Triune God, our spiritual experiences are empty and worthless. We have to know that not only Chinese Confucianism has its so-called moral cultivation, but even the other religions in the world such as Hinduism and Buddhism also have their so-called moral cultivation. In religion, self-mortification is a common practice, and moral cultivation is also considered necessary. For this reason, if a Christian pursues so-called spirituality apart from the dispensing of the Triune God, his pursuit is a kind of religious cultivation.<p>Whether in Buddhism, Hinduism, or Confucianism, the principle of seeking perfection in ethical pursuits is the same: it is the exercise of self-control. On the positive side, this is to control one’s emotions and to not do things according to the dictates of one’s heart. On the negative side, this is to restrain one’s lusts and to not indulge oneself in sinful things. Wang Yang-ming was the most famous one among the moral cultivators of the different schools in China. In the Catholic Church, the most well-known ones were the mystics, including Madame Guyon, Fènelon, Brother Lawrence, and Thomas à Kempis, who were raised up three hundred years ago and who all had their form of moral cultivation. Among this group of people, Madame Guyon was the most spiritual one; however, if you read her autobiography, you will find that she had a very strong will, within which there was a considerable measure of her own natural element.<h2 class=head1>OUR SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES NOT BEING ACCORDING TO THE FLESH BUT ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2><p>At its inception the Lord’s recovery in China was deeply influenced by the mystics, especially in the experience of pursuing spiritual life. In the first thirty years there was much exercise and practice in this matter. Later we found that without the Spirit, that kind of exercise is just like the practice of having strict, ascetic rules in religion. I use the expression “the Spirit,” because today the light of revelation is very clear, showing us that the Spirit is the Triune God processed and dispensed into us. The Triune God who has been dispensed into us has an abbreviated title, or we may say a general title—“the Spirit.” Paul wrote fourteen Epistles on the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in which he concluded that we must walk “by the Spirit” (Gal. 5:16, 25; Rom. 8:4). We should not forget this word: our spiritual experiences are not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.<p>In Romans 8:4 the word spirit denotes the mingled spirit, that is, our regenerated spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit to be one spirit. In this mingled spirit the main component is the Holy Spirit. Today in the Lord’s recovery we all know that this Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, and at the same time, Christ Himself. He is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God and the ultimate reaching of the Triune God to man. Once He reaches man, He enters into man’s spirit to be mingled with man’s spirit as one. This is the spirit referred to in Romans 8:4. Today we do not walk according to anything other than such a mingled spirit.
