<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Leading of the Ark&#151;the Crucified<br>and Resurrected Christ in His Resurrection</H2><P>The remaining verses in chapter ten reveal the leading of the ark&#151;the crucified and resurrected Christ in His resurrection (vv. 33-36). Today, the leading One among the churches is the crucified and resurrected Christ, who is the ark.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Sons of Israel Setting Out<br>from the Mount of Jehovah Three Days' Journey,<br>and the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah Going<br>before Them to Seek Out a Resting Place for Them</H2><P>"They set out from the mount of Jehovah three days' journey; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them three days' journey, to seek out a resting place for them" (v. 33). Here we see that the sons of Israel went three days' journey. The way was not paved, the oxen were slow, and travel for the wagons was difficult. However, the ark (Christ) of the covenant of Jehovah went before them to seek out a resting place. The ark, with all the contents of the tabernacle, including the altar, showbread table, lampstand, and incense altar, was the responsibility of the Kohathites and was borne by them. The Kohathites should have set out after the camp of Reuben; nevertheless, the ark came to the front to take the lead.</P><P>There is a difference between guidance and leading. The term guidance is used with respect to the cloud and the blowing of the trumpets, but concerning the ark we have used the term leading. Guidance is general; leading is particular. The cloud and the trumpet guided the children of Israel in a general way. However, the ark did not render a general guidance but a particular leading to the people. Thus, the ark became the leader, taking the lead to find a resting place.</P><P>During the forty years the children of Israel traveled in the wilderness, it was difficult to find a resting place for two million people. Today our Christian life is a long journey on a rugged, unpaved way. As we are journeying on this rugged way, it is not easy for us to rest. The Lord Jesus, the Forerunner, has cut the way (Heb. 6:20), but He did not pave the way. He passed through the rugged way, and now we are following His footsteps on this way. We have need of a resting place. Here no one, not even the older and more experienced ones, can help us. Concerning this, we should not put our trust in man. The unique One in whom we can trust is Christ as the ark. He is the Leader, and He leads us to the proper place of rest. He not only guides us in a general way but leads us in a particular way.</P><P>In Numbers 10 the real leader was not Moses. At that time, even Moses was inadequate. The ark led the children of Israel in a particular way, much like a small boat leads a large ship through a narrow strait and a swift current into the harbor.</P><P>Not only was the ark a living ark, but the rock that followed the Israelites was also living (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4). In the wilderness Christ followed the children of Israel as a rock to supply them with living water. As the ark, He was their Leader, taking the lead to find a resting place for them and to lead them through the hard part of their journey.</P><P>The children of Israel were led not by man (Moses' father-in-law) but by the ark (Christ) of God's covenant. This indicates that the leadership of Christ is faithful. This leadership is not according to emotion or affection but according to a covenant. God made a covenant with Abraham and his descendants to bring them into the good land (Gen. 12). Eventually, God's covenant was placed in the ark, and thus the ark was called the ark of the covenant (Num. 10:33). Hence, Christ is the Christ of the covenant, the Christ of God's faithfulness. Christ must lead us into a resting place because He is the Christ of God's covenant.</P>
