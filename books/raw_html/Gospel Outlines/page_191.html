<h1 class="title">THE NECESSITY OF BELIEVING THAT GOD IS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Heb. 11:6</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God is
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The creation of the universe proves that God is.</li>
	<li>The order of the universe proves that God is.</li>
	<li>Man&rsquo;s physical body and mentality prove that God is.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God is hidden
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Although God exists, He is hidden.</li>
	<li>Because God is Spirit, He is hidden to materialistic man. As a result, the materialistic man cannot see or touch the Spirit.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s honor, greatness, and holiness cause Him to hide Himself from man who is low and filthy.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>You must believe that God is
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>You must believe because God is hidden.</li>
	<li>You must believe because God is Spirit and cannot be seen by man&rsquo;s naked eye.</li>
	<li>You must believe because God is honorable holy, and we are low and filthy. Thus for man to touch God, there is no way other than the way of believing.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The results of believing in God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>By believing in God you receive His life.</li>
	<li>Believing in God causes you to have the sensation of being enlightened within.</li>
	<li>Through your believing you become well-pleasing to God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to believe
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Confess that you are a sinner before God.</li>
	<li>Repent and come forward to God, believing that He is.</li>
	</ol></li>
