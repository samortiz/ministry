Psalm 102:25-27 prophesies that Christ as the Creator of the universe will remain unchanged and that His years will not fail
Hebrews 1:11 indicates that the old creation will be terminated and that the new heaven and the new earth will be ushered in
He does not say, And to the seeds, as concerning many, but as concerning one, And to your seed, who is Christ'
On the one hand Christ is the seed of Abraham on the other hand He is the Lion of Judah a royal tribe from which Christ came to be the King
The words 'thou art gone up' imply that the young lion first had to come down from the mountain to the plain to capture his prey
Righteousness represents what is related to God, and lawlessness represents what is related to Satan, the wicked one
For Christ to love righteousness and hate lawlessness means that He loves the things related to God and hates the things related to Satan
In God's economy Christ is God's appointed One to accomplish God's plan, and we are Christ's partners in the divine interest
We are partners of Christ, sharing with Him the spiritual anointing, even as the members of the Body share the Spirit with the Head
Luke 2:11-12, the fulfillment of this prophecy, says, 'A Savior was born to you today in David's city, who is Christ the Lord
Immediately after they arrived in Bethlehem, the child Jesus was born in fulfillment of the prophecy in Micah 5:2
The report of Christ's birth aroused the hatred and jealousy of King Herod, who was angered that a kingly child had been born
When Joseph returned and learned that Archelaus, the son of Herod, was in power, he was afraid to remain in the territory around Bethlehem
The flight to Egypt and the escape to Galilee to dwell in Nazareth were fulfillments of Old Testament prophecies concerning Christ
He was raised in the home of a poor carpenter in the despised town of Nazareth and in the despised province of Galilee
Although He was the Godman having divinity and humanity He grew up in a poor family and had no form or comeliness that He should be desired
In the foregoing message we saw that in the fulfillment of certain Old Testament prophecies Christ is both God and man
When John the Baptist was conceived, it was said that he would go before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah
According to Matthew 3:3, John the Baptist was sent to prepare the way of the Lord, to make His paths straight
John the Baptist prepared the way so that Christ could come to dispense God into all those who would be called by Him
In Matthew 17:10 some of the Lord's disciples asked Him, 'Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first'?
The Greek word rendered 'bring good news' in Luke 4:18 is euaggelizo,which means to evangelize, to announce good news
Every fallen human being has lost the right to enjoy God as the tree of life and the right to enjoy Christ as the good land
All fallen people, therefore, have lost their right to enjoy Christ and have sold themselves to negative things
The year of jubilee indicates that we can be released from bondage and recover the right to enjoy Christ as our portion
Once we were captives, but we have been released from slavery and brought back to the freedom of the glory of the children of God
Since the New Testament age is the real year of jubilee, this means that God will restore us to our original condition
Peter, Andrew, James, and John did not realize that they were in darkness as they were working by the Sea of Galilee to make a living
Peter Andrew James and John were attracted and captured at the seashore not by seeing what the Lord did but by realizing what the Lord was
After the Lord cleansed the temple, 'His disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of Your house shall devour Me'
When the Lord saw the corrupted situation in the temple, He could not tolerate it, but cleansed it, even with a whip
The prophecy concerning this is in Deuteronomy 18:15, 18-19, and the fulfillment is in John 1:45 and Acts 3:22-23
Some of His speaking in the Gospels includes predictions concerning God's economy, especially concerning the fulfillment of God's economy
Matthew 12:19 says of Christ, 'He shall not strive nor cry out, nor shall anyone hear His voice in the streets'
Matthew 12:20 goes on to say, in fulfillment of Isaiah 42:3, 'A bruised reed He shall not break, and smoking flax He shall not quench'
As we consider Isaiah 53, Psalm 22, Luke 22, and Matthew 27, we see a portrait of Christ as a despised man of sorrows
Isaiah 53:4 says, 'Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted'
The application of healing by divine power can only be a foretaste in this age; the full taste will be accomplished in the coming age
The Lord purposely went back to Jerusalem not to minister but to present Himself as the Lamb of God to be crucified
Most of the crowd spread their own garments in the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them in the road'
In honoring the meek King with whatever they were, the people recognized that He was the One with the victorious life
In the warm welcome of the King, the people shouted out a quotation from Psalm 118:26: 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord'
According to Psalm 118, only the One who came in the name of the Lord was qualified to be praised in such a way
The spontaneous praise of the people sovereignly indicated that this meek King came not in His own name but in the name of Jehovah
Jesus says to them, Yes; have you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings You have perfected praise'?
Verse 5 says, 'Wherefore, coming into the world, He says, Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me'
Christ, as the real sacrifice for sin which has taken away sins, has sanctified us through the offering of His body once for all
The second of the divine Trinity was ordained to be the Lamb of God before the foundation of the world, that is, in eternity past
In the sight of God Christ as the Lamb of God was slain from the foundation of the world that is from the existence of Gods fallen creatures
In the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies Christ is the One betrayed by His friend, who sold Him for thirty pieces of silver
Christ was sold for thirty pieces of silver by men, but following that He was smitten on the cross by God Himself
All, especially Peter, had the assurance and the confidence that they would follow the Lord to the end, no matter what the pathway might be
The Lord, standing before the Sanhedrin like a sheep before its shearers, would not say a word to vindicate Himself, fulfilling Isaiah 53:7
Isaiah 53:12c tells us that 'he was numbered with the trangressors,' and verse 9a, that 'he made his grave with the wicked'
As the fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiah 53 Luke 2332 and 33 say Two others also who were criminals were led with Him to be executed
When they came to the place called Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left'
The fact that Christ was executed with two criminals indicates that the Roman authorities considered Him a criminal
According to Luke 23:34, the fulfillment of this prophecy, Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing'
In fulfillment of this prophecy, Matthew 27:35 says, 'When they had crucified Him, they divided His garments among them, casting lots'
According to Genesis 315 the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent and the serpent would bruise the heel of the womans seed
Psalm 22:1 prophesies concerning Christ as the One forsaken by God: 'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me'?
The fulfillment of this prophecy is in Matthew 2746 About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice saying Eli Eli lama sabachthani
Because our sin and sins and all negative things were dealt with, darkness came upon all the land , and God forsook Him because of our sin
God forsook Christ on the cross because He took the place of sinners , bearing our sins and being made sin for us
When the Lord Jesus, the God-man, died on the cross under God's judgment, He had God within Him essentially as His divine being
As our Substitute on the tree, the cross, Christ not only bore the curse for us, but He also became a curse for us
A vessel full of vinegar was lying there; so they put a sponge full of vinegar on hyssop and brought it to His mouth'
At the end of His crucifixion, when He was thirsty, vinegar was offered to Him in a mocking way , and He took it
In His crucifixion Christ suffered to such an extent that He poured out His soul, His entire being, unto death
Verse 34 says, 'One of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water'
Christ's death is, on the negative side, to take away our sins and, on the positive side, to impart life into us
The Jews, not wanting the bodies to remain on the cross on the Sabbath, asked Pilate that their legs might be broken
The fact that Christ's legs were not broken signifies that in Him there is something unbreakable and indestructible
The Roman soldiers and the Jewish people could come together to put Christ on the cross, but they could not break His eternal life
In the same principle, Christ's unbroken bone signifies His unbreakable and indestructible eternal life that imparts His life to us
In Christ as our Passover lamb there is such an unbreakable and indestructible life that can impart life to us
Christ, the Messiah, was cut off, crucified, in the seventh year of the sixty-ninth week from the decree to restore and to build Jerusalem
Daniel 9:26a goes on to say, 'And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself'
However evil were the events and however much He suffered, He endured them all and passed through them victoriously
After the Lord accomplished His redemptive and life-imparting death, His situation of suffering immediately changed into an honorable one
Acts 2:24 says, 'Whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it'
He delivered Himself to death, but death had no way to detain Him; rather, death was defeated by Him, and He rose up from it
Acts 2:26 continues, 'Therefore my heart was made glad and my tongue exulted; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope'
In the original Hebrew text the word for tongue is 'glory,' which is a synonym of soul, according to Genesis 49:6 and Psalm 7:5
After Christ died on the cross, while His soul exulted in Hades, His flesh rested in the tomb in hope, trusting in God
Acts 2:27 goes on to say, 'Because You will not leave my soul in Hades, nor will You permit Your Holy One to see corruption'
The Jews treasure the Old Testament as the Word of God, but because they are blinded by tradition they do not see anything concerning Christ
In this message we shall see more concerning Christ's person in the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies
The Lord Jesus was born of a virgin to be the Son of Man, yet He still needed to be born of the Father to be the firstborn Son of God
The resurrected Christ, who is God's firstborn Son brought forth through His second birth, His resurrection, is the holy and faithful things
Now through His death and resurrection, the Father's only begotten Son has become 'the Firstborn among many brothers'
His many brothers are the many sons of God and the church , as the corporate expression of God the Father in the Son
The many brothers are the propagation of the Father's life and the multiplication of the Son in the divine life
He was born to be the firstborn Son through His resurrection, and we were produced to be His many brothers in His resurrection
Acts 13:39 says, 'From all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified'
Romans 4:25 says that Christ 'was delivered because of our offenses and was raised because of our justification'
The death of Christ fully satisfied God's righteous requirements so that we may be justified by God through Christ's death
His resurrection is a proof that God is satisfied with His death for us and that we are justified by God because of His death
As the resurrected One He is also in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and is always acceptable to God
Ephesians 2:14 says, 'He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity'
Christ, who has accomplished full redemption for both Jewish and Gentile believers, is Himself our peace, our harmony, making both one
Due to the fall of mankind and the call of the chosen race, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles
Ephesians 2:16 continues, 'And might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, slaying the enmity by it'
We have a prophecy concerning Christ as the stone rejected by the Jewish builders who became in resurrection the cornerstone
The stone here is Christ for God's building , and the builders are the Jewish leaders, who were supposed to work on God's building
Peter had come to know Christ as the precious stone held in honor by God, as he expounded concerning Him in his first Epistle
In the four Gospels we have the King-Savior in Matthew, the Slave-Savior in Mark, the Man-Savior in Luke, and the God-Savior in John
Peter 24 also speaks of Christ as a stone To whom coming a living stone having been rejected by men but with God chosen held in honor
Christ was appointed by God to be a test to the children of Israel so that many of them would be stumbled by Him and many raised up by Him
In the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies Christ is also a stone of foundation on whom the believers believed
In 1 Corinthians 3:11 Paul says, 'Other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ'
As the Christ and the Son of the Living God, the Lord Jesus Christ is the unique foundation laid by God for the building of the church
In this message we shall consider further aspects of Christ's person in the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies
Christ is the One who in His reproducing resurrection declared the Father's name to the brothers and praised Him in the midst of the church
On the day of resurrection the Lord came to them to declare the Father in order to make them know the Father as the source of life
According to this prophecy, after His resurrection Christ came to His disciples to make the Father known to them
When we, the many sons of God, meet as the church and praise the Father, the firstborn Son praises the Father in our praises
It is not that He praises the Father apart from us and alone, but rather within us and with us through our praising
In Psalm 2222 and Hebrews 212 we see that after declaring the Fathers name the Son sings hymns of praise to Him in the midst of the church
Psalm 110:4 says, 'The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek'
Hebrews 56 a quotation from Psalm 110 says As also in another place He says You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec
Aaron was established in honor to be the high priest only for his lifetime, for he was prevented by death from continuing
Having the qualifications of His divinity and His resurrection life, He is able to minister the processed God to us
He is the One who expresses God and represents Him, the One who holds the key to open everything in God's dominion
Revelation 37 says that Christ the One who has the key of David is the One who opens and no one shall shut and shuts and no one shall open
We see that God's great power that operated in Christ seated Him at God's right hand in the heavenlies far above all
Gods right hand where Christ has been seated by the surpassingly great power of God is the most honorable place with the supreme authority
The list in Ephesians 1:21 includes not only angelic, heavenly authorities, good or evil, but also human, earthly ones
The ascended Christ has been seated by the great power of God far above all rules, authorities, powers, and lordships in the entire universe
In Ephesians 1:21 'every name that is named' refers not only to titles of honor but also to everything that has a name
The fulfillment is in Ephesians 48 Wherefore He says Having ascended to the height He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men
The word 'height' in the quotation of Psalm 68:18 refers to Mount Zion , symbolizing the third heaven where God dwells
Psalm 68 implies that it was in the ark that God ascended to Mount Zion after the ark had led the way to victory
In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan's captivity and took them to Himself
The Amplified New Testament renders 'He led a train of vanquished foes' for 'He led captive those taken captive'
Vanquished foes' may refer to Satan, to his angels, and to us the sinners, also indicating Christ's victory over Satan, sin, and death
In Christ's ascension there was a procession of these vanquished foes as captives from a war for a celebration of Christ's victory
The issue of Christ's ascension is that certain of the defeated foes have been given as gifts by the Father to Christ for His Body
In Paul's quotation and application of the word in Psalm 68:18, he changed the thought from receiving to giving
On the one hand, when Christ ascended on high, He received gifts; on the other hand, the ascended Christ gave gifts
All the gifted persons were received by Christ when He ascended to the height, and then He gave them to the church
Christ is the Man, inferior to the angels, crowned with glory and honor, and set over the works of God's hands
Hebrews 29 says But we see Jesus who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor
Adam lost the dominion that God gave to him, but according to the prophecy of Psalm 8, Christ has recovered what Adam lost
Christ the second Man has been glorified crowned with glory and honor and entrusted with the divine dominion that was lost by the first man
As a man in the flesh, He was inferior to the angels, yet He was crowned with glory and honor in His ascension
On the one hand, the ascended Christ is far above all; on the other hand, all things have been subjected under His feet
To accomplish God's purpose and to establish the kingdom of the heavens, it was necessary for the Lord to be a man
Without man, God's purpose cannot be carried out and the kingdom of the heavens cannot be constituted on earth
They returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away'
The saints in Zechariah 14:5 denote the Old Testament saints and New Testament saints who will come back with Christ as the Son of Man
In verse 12 the Lord in a parable says A certain man of noble birth went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return
The kingdom which Christ will establish on earth will be the kingdom of God, the kingdom that is from ancient times, even from eternity
According to the context of Zechariah 12, the tribes are not all the nations of the earth but the twelve tribes in the Holy Land
When Christ appears with power and glory to be seen by all in the Holy Land, the twelve tribes will behold Him and weep
In the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies Christ is the One coming in the name of Jehovah and blessed by repentant Israel
The Lord said to them, 'You shall by no means see Me henceforth until you say, Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord'
Christ will descend and place His feet on the Mount of Olives, which will be cleft like the waters of the Red Sea
In Matthew 21:44 the Lord, referring to the stone in Daniel 2, says that 'on whomever it falls, it shall scatter him as chaff'
The Jews who reject Him and are stumbled by Him will experience Him as the stumbling stone and be broken to pieces
Speaking of Christ's kingdom, 1 Corinthians 15:25 says, 'He must reign until He puts all His enemies under His feet'
The fact that these prophecies are fulfilled in the New Testament is a strong proof that whatever the New Testament reveals is fully of God
In this message we shall begin to consider Christ's person in the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament
In His wisdom God uses not only prophecies to predict the coming of Christ but also types and figures to portray Christ
We need to learn how to understand the types and figures of Christ in the Old Testament and their fulfillment in the New Testament
According to Genesis 1, after light came into being, the way was opened for God to bring other things into existence
In John 812 the Lord says I am the light of the world he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness but shall have the light of life
When we received Christ, He became our life, and this life is now the light of life within us that brings us out of darkness
Having received Christ, who is the expression of God, we now have Him as our life, and this life is the light shining within to enlighten us
The tree of life signifies the Triune God in Christ to dispense Himself into His chosen people as their generating life
The fact that He said in John 6 that He is the bread of life indicates that He has come to us as the tree of life in the form of food
Through the redemption of Christ, the way to touch the tree of life, which is God Himself in Christ as life to man, has been opened again
In the church's degradation religion crept in with its knowledge to distract the believers in Christ from eating Him as the tree of life
The word for 'tree' in Revelation 2:7, as in 1 Peter 2:24, is 'wood' in Greek, not the usual word used for tree
We have seen that the tree of life refers to Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God to be our life in the form of food
The eating of the tree of life not only was Gods original intention concerning man it will also be the eternal issue of Christs redemption
Revelation 22:14a says, 'Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life'
After his creation, man was put before the tree of life as an indication that he was privileged to partake of this tree
Because of the fall of man, the way to the tree of life was shut to man by God's glory, holiness, and righteousness
The believers who wash their robes in the redeeming blood of Christ have the right to enjoy the tree of life as their eternal portion
Whatever He did and whatever happened to Him is also participated in by all the members of His Body, the church
In the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament Christ is the sacrifice affording the coats of skins for Adam and Eve
God came in to deal with the situation, promising that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent
Christ has done everything for us on the cross, but without union all that He has accomplished is not related to us
By both faith and baptism we have been immersed into Christ, having thus put on Christ and become identified with Him
To put on Christ by being baptized into Christ is to clothe ourselves with Christ, to put on Christ as a garment
Through the inward action of believing and the outward action of being baptized we make one complete step to enter into the Triune God
According to 1 Peter 3:20-21, the ark made by Noah and into which he and his family entered is a type of Christ
In Genesis 61416 we see that the ark had three stories that it was made of gopher wood and that it was pitched within and without with pitch
The fact that creatures as well as human beings were in the ark indicates that Christ accomplished an all-inclusive death for every creature
Genesis 14:18 says, 'Melchisedec king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God'
Melchisedec did not appear to Abraham with an offering to take away sin, but with bread and wine to nourish him
As such a High Priest Christ does not take away sin but ministers to us the processed God signified by the bread and wine as our nourishment
Today Christ is no longer offering sacrifices for sin; instead, He is ministering the Triune God to us as our supply
As the priest of the Most High God, Melchisedec did not offer sacrifices to God for Abraham's sin; he ministered bread and wine to him
As indicated by the symbols of the Lord's table, in the Bible bread and wine signify the processed God as our supply
Melchisedec is also the king of Salem, which means the king of peace, signifying that Christ is also the King of peace
According to the type in Genesis 14 after Melchisedec the king of righteousness and the king of peace came there was righteousness and peace
In such an environment and condition of righteousness and peace Melchisedec ministered the bread and wine to the victor
In this message we shall consider further Christ's person in the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament
He was not required to do anything in order to inherit these riches, and he did not do anything for the inheritance
As the real Isaac, Christ has inherited all that the Father is and has, and He has obtained the church, the real Rebekah
Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen'
As the Lamb of God, Christ was willing to have His horns caught by humanity so that He might be offered as our Substitute
We can see from the typology in the Old Testament that the animal sacrifices were to be without blemish and without spot
The words 'without blemish and without spot' in 1 Peter 1:19 are Old Testament terms used with respect to sacrifices offered to God
In the eternal view of God, from the foundation of the world, that is, since the fall of man as a part of the world, Christ was slain
Unlike Peter in Acts 10:9-16, Jacob did not see something coming down; he saw something that was already on earth
We are not told that the ladder reached the earth, but that it was 'set up on the earth' and that 'the top of it reached to heaven'
Our Christ, who is the ladder bringing heaven to earth and joining earth to heaven, is now not only in heaven but also on earth
Christ has been set up on earth and He is reaching into heaven for the purpose of coming to us and joining us to Him
As the universal ladder, Christ brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven and thereby makes God and man one
On this ladder the angels of God ascend and descend as they do their service 'for the sake of those who are about to inherit salvation'
In the Bible Joseph is the perfect one in the Old Testament, and Jesus is the perfect One in the New Testament
Genesis 37:3 says, 'Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age'
The words, 'from the prey, my son, thou art gone up,' indicate that the lion has gone up the mountain to devour his prey
The fulfillment of the figure in Genesis 499 is in Revelation 55 where we are told that Christ the Lion of the tribe of Judah has overcome
No matter how much Moses prefigured Christ, he was still only a part of the house, whereas Christ is the Builder of God's house
Moses was an apostle sent from God to constitute God's house on earth, and Christ was also the Apostle doing the same thing
Eventually, the Passover became a proper noun in English, a noun that has its source in the words 'pass over' in Exodus 12:13
The items of the Passover in Exodus 12 include not only the lamb the flesh the blood the unleavened bread and the herbs but also the house
Speaking of the Passover lamb, Exodus 12:6 says, 'The whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening'
As the children of Israel applied the Passover lamb, they were in houses that had been sprinkled with the blood of the lamb
In John 6:53 the Lord Jesus tells us that we need to eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and in verse 55 He declares, 'My flesh is true food'
In Exodus 12:8 the children of Israel were given the proper way to eat the flesh of the Passover lamb: roasted with fire
The children of Israel were to observe the feast of unleavened bread as a continuation of the feast of Passover
Continuing from the feast of the Passover, there was another feast, the feast of unleavened bread, which lasted seven days
Eating unleavened bread indicates that God's people should not live in sin, that is, should not live a sinful life
In color, shape, appearance, taste, and in every other aspect it was absolutely different from anything they had ever seen before
The bread of life refers to the nature of the bread, which is life; the living bread refers to the condition of the bread, which is living
John 7:39 goes on to say, 'But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive'
The spiritual drink refers to the living water that flowed out of the cleft rock, which typifies the Spirit as our all-inclusive drink
In this message we shall cover further aspects of Christ's person in the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament
The Old Testament tabernacle was a type, a prefigure, of the real tabernacle, which was Christ Himself in the flesh
In the time of the New Testament Christ in the flesh was the tabernacle that brought God to man so that man might enjoy Him
The fullness of the Godheadthe Father the Son and the Spiritwas embodied in the tabernacle and this embodiment was Gods dwelling among men
The first item of furniture in the Holy Place was the showbread table , which signifies Christ as our life supply
In particular the showbread table signifies Christ as the feast for Gods priests since only priests were qualified to be in the Holy Place
Because those who ate the bread displayed on the showbread table were priests, this table indicates that Christ is a feast for God's priests
Within Christ, His humanity is the basic element for our enjoyment, and upon Him is divinity as the expression of God
As we enjoy the Lord Jesus as the life supply with which we serve God, the outcome will be gold, Christ's divinity as the expression of God
The fact that the lampstand follows the showbread table indicates that the light comes out of our enjoyment of Christ as our life supply
Gold is the substance with which the lampstand is made the stand is the embodiment of the gold and the lamps are the expression of the stand
As a type of Christ, the lampstand portrays Christ as the resurrection life growing, branching, budding, and blossoming to shine the light
Christ grows first in Himself, signified by the stalk of the lampstand, and then also in us, signified by the branches
Without such an interceding Christ, the proper relationship between God and us could not exist, or could not be maintained
The incense altar also had a crown of gold round about, rings of gold, and poles of acacia wood overlaid with gold
The crown of gold around the incense altar signifies the glory of Christ's divinity being the preserving power of His intercession
All these aspects of the interceding Christ typified by the incense altar are fulfilled in the New Testament, especially in John 17
The ark of testimony is a type of Christ, the true testimony of God, who is the embodiment and expression of all that God is
As a type of Christ, the ark, which contained the tablets of the testimony, typifies Christ as the embodiment of God's testimony
The ark as a type of Christ also indicates that God's redeemed people can contact God and enjoy God in Christ and through Christ
Christ became the embodiment of God's testimony in His humanity, which is the basic substance for expressing God
According to Exodus 31:18, the tables of stone on which the Ten Commandments were written are called the 'two tables of testimony'
In particular, the law, the Ten Commandments, testifies that God is holy and righteous and that He is love and light
In type Aaron offered both gifts and sacrifices for the people and himself but in reality Christ offered Himself as the sacrifice for sins
Aaron was established in honor to be the high priest only for his lifetime, for he was prevented by death from continuing
As the high priest in type, Aaron bore the names of the twelve tribes of Israel on his shoulders and on his heart
The burnt offering , which was wholly for God's satisfaction, typifies Christ as God's pleasure and satisfaction
When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He made God happy and satisfied Him because He always did God's will and sought His glory
The meal offering typifies Christ in His humanity as food for God and especially for those who have fellowship with God and serve Him
The fine flour, with its evenness and fineness, typifies Christ's perfect humanity with its balance, evenness, and fineness
The sin offering is a type of Christ as the One who died on the cross to deal with the sinful nature of our fallen being
As the reality of the type of the sin offering, Christ, who did not know sin, was 'made sin on our behalf' by God
According to Romans 83 God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin so that He might condemn sin in the flesh
As the fulfillment of the type of the heave offering, Christ is the ascended, exalted, transcendent One, the One who is 'far above all'
In the Old Testament a drink offering was poured out on one of the basic offerings described in chapters one through seven of Leviticus
Among these seven feasts, the three major ones were the Passover, the feast of Pentecost, and the feast of tabernacles
In Colossians 2:16 and 17 Paul says that the Sabbath and the feasts are 'a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ'
The Sabbath signifies completion and rest, and the feasts, the annual Jewish festivals, signify joy and enjoyment
As the fulfillment and the reality of the Sabbath and the feasts, Christ is our completion and rest and our joy and enjoyment
The people came to Moses, confessed that they had sinned, and asked him to pray that the Lord would take away the serpents
As such serpents, we need a substitute, someone with the form of a serpent but without the poisonous element of the serpent
In Romans 8:3 Paul says that God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin and condemned sin in the flesh
In this message we shall cover more aspects of Christ's person in the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament
Whereas the Jews had the Scriptures concerning Christ and knew where He would be born , the magi saw the star of Christ
The Jews had the knowledge in letters concerning Christ, but these learned men from the east received a living vision concerning Him
Crucifixion was a heathen practice adopted by the Romans for the execution of slaves and heinous criminals only
In Deuteronomy 32:15; 2 Samuel 22:47; and Psalm 95:1, Christ is the Rock of our salvation, and this Rock is our strength and our refuge
The good land, the land of Canaan , is a type of the all-inclusive Christ, the Christ who is all and in all and who is everything to us
The Passover, the manna, the tabernacle with its furniture, and all the offerings are types depicting various aspects of Christ
The land that came out of the death water on the third day is a type of the resurrected Christ who came out of death on the third day
Just as the land of Canaan was everything to the children of Israel so Christ the reality of the type of the good land is everything to us
He is the wheat, which signifies the incarnated and crucified Christ, and the barley, which signifies the resurrected Christ
The name Joshua, which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah , is a Hebrew equivalent of the Greek name Jesus
The real David and His followers were also rejected and took action to eat, seemingly against the sabbatical regulation
King David Gods anointed and his followers were rejected by the people and the real David Gods Anointed and His followers were rejected also
Neither David and his followers nor Christ and His followers had anything to eat, but there was the place where there was something to eat
The Lord's word in Matthew 12:3 and 4 also implies the dispensational change from the priesthood to the kingship
The coming of David changed the dispensation from the age of the priests to the age of the kings, in which the kings were above the priests
By the coming of Christ the dispensation was also changed this time from the age of the law to the age of grace in which Christ is above all
In the Gospels Christ spoke in Jesus, then in the Acts and the Epistles He spoke from within Peter, Paul, John, and others
Stone signifies transformed humanity; cedar, humanity in resurrection; fir, humanity through death; and gold, divinity
With the temple we see the mingling of divinity with humanity through death and in resurrection and transformation
Revelation 2122 speaks of the ultimate consummation of the temple in the New Jerusalem Its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb
According to the Bible, the temple is the place where God dwells and also the place where His people worship Him
In eternity Christ with God will be such a temple, a temple that is both God's habitation and our dwelling place
For eternity we shall dwell in Christ to enjoy the Triune God, and by enjoying Him we shall worship Him and serve Him
Just as Elisha came after Elijah and was the continuation of Elijah, so Jesus came after John the Baptist as his continuation
When the scribes and Pharisees asked Him for a sign, He said that no sign would be given 'except the sign of Jonah the prophet'
The heart of the earth' is called the lower parts of the earth and Hades , where the Lord went after His death
Hades, equal to Sheol in the Old Testament, has two sections: the section of torment and the section of comfort
In John 10:11 the Lord Jesus said, 'I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep'
Hebrews 13:20 tells us that God 'brought up from among the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep'
Now He is our soul's Shepherd in the resurrection life within us and thus is able to guide us and supply us with life
In this message we shall consider further aspects of Christ's person in the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament
Psalm 24710 is fulfilled in a full way in Revelation 191116 which speaks of Christ as the Warrior who is King of kings and Lord of lords
As the King of glory Christ has many diadems on His head His name is called The Word of God and a sharp sword proceeds out of His mouth
As Christ fights against the enemy, He proclaims to the universe that God is sovereign, righteous, and orderly
As the King of glory Christ is the King of kings and Lord of lords, a name that is written on His garment and on His thigh
In Old Testament times God's people could enjoy this fatness only in the place God had chosen for His habitation
Psalm 36:9a is also fulfilled in Revelation 21:6: 'I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely'
In 2:3 she both appreciates and enjoys him: 'As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons
Finally in 814 she urges him to come quickly Make haste my beloved and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices
One day He said, 'I have come a light into the world, that everyone who believes in Me may not remain in darkness'
When Christ, the embodiment of the divine life, shines within us as the light of life, we are under His enlightening
Having received Him as the expression of God, we have Christ within us as our life , and this life is the light shining within us
Peter 2:4 says that Christ is 'a living stone, having been rejected by men, but with God chosen, held in honor'
To the Pharisees and all the others who opposed Him, the crucifixion of Christ was a sign that God had rejected Him
Through Christ as righteousness we have been justified by God so that we may be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life
In Zechariah He is portrayed as the stone which is the topstone with the seven eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth
As the building stone, the Lord Jesus was 'engraved,' dealt with, by God on the cross for the iniquity of God's people
Zechariah 4:2 speaks of a lampstand with seven lamps, and verse 10, of 'those seven,' referring to the seven lamps in verse 2
When we put together verses 2 and 10, we see that the seven lamps of the lampstand are the seven eyes of the Lord
Revelation 4:5 says that 'seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God'
As a further development over Zechariah, the seven eyes are not only the seven eyes of the stone but also the seven eyes of the Lamb
In Zechariah 3 and 4 we see the seven eyes of the stone, the seven lamps of the lampstand, and the seven eyes of the Lord
The stone that was rejected by the builders and that became the cornerstone is the very stone with the seven eyes in Zechariah 3:9
In the sight of God, when the Jewish builders rejected Christ, they rejected both the Lamb and cornerstone of God's building
The fact that Christ, the Lamb of God, is the building stone with seven eyes reveals that the seven eyes of Christ are for God's building
In Malachi 4:2 the sun is a type of Christ: 'Unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings'
From on high' means from God and indicates that it is in His deity that Christ is the rising sun from the heavens
Chaff in Matthew 3:12 refers to unrepentant Jews, whereas the tares in chapter thirteen refer to nominal Christians
All those who repent and believe in the Lord will be baptized by Him in the Holy Spirit that they may have eternal life
The judgment of a judge is according to righteousness, whereas the healing of a physician is according to mercy and grace
The Lord's word in Matthew 9:12 implies that the self-righteous Pharisees did not recognize their need of Him as the Physician
They regarded themselves as strong; hence, blinded by their self-righteousness, they did not know that they were ill
The Lord Jesus did not simply tell His disciples that He came not as a judge but as a physician; that would have been mere doctrine
As the Lord was feasting with those who were spiritually sick, He revealed Himself as the Physician and healed them
The ministry of John the Baptist was to introduce people to Christ so that Christ might become their Redeemer, life, and all
The Bridegroom was taken away from the sons of the bridechamber when the Lord Jesus was taken up from the disciples into heaven
In dealing with the self-righteous Pharisees of the old religion the Lord indicated that He is the Physician to heal the sick
In dealing with the fasting disciples of John, who had formed a new religion, He revealed Himself as the Bridegroom coming for the bride
The Lord did not answer with a doctrine but with the revelation of Himself as the Bridegroom with the sons of the bridechamber
Before His crucifixion He was unshrunk cloth, but after His resurrection He is the new garment for us to put on
The 'old garment' in Matthew 9:16 signifies man's good behavior, good deeds, and religious practices by his old natural life
A patch of unshrunk cloth put on an old garment pulls away from the garment by its shrinking strength, thus making the tear worse
Putting a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment signifies trying to imitate what Christ did in His human life on earth
He is not only the Bridegroom but also the new life to excite us inwardly for the enjoyment of Him as our Bridegroom
Old wineskins signify religious forms rituals and practices such as the fasting by the Pharisees and the disciples of John in their religion
We should never try to put the wine of Christ's life into the wineskin of old religious practices, for the wine will burst those practices
In Matthew 9:38 the Lord Jesus says, 'Beseech the Lord of the harvest that He may thrust out workers into His harvest'
He is their Teacher, Lord, and Master of the house, and they are His disciples, slaves, and those of His household
John the Baptist and Christ played the flute to preach the gospel of the kingdom but the Judaizers did not dance for the joy of salvation
John and Christ sang 'a dirge' to preach repentance, but the Judaizers 'did not beat the breast' for the grief of sin
In Matthew 11:18 and 19 the Lord goes on to say, 'John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a wine drinker, a friend of tax collectors and sinners'
John, coming to bring men to repentance and to cause them to grieve for sin, had no taste for eating and drinking
Christ, coming to bring salvation to sinners and to cause them to rejoice in it, had the joy of eating and drinking with them
Christ is not only the Savior; He is also the friend of sinners, sympathizing with their problems and sensing their griefs
In the parable of the tares He says, 'The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man sowing good seed in his field'
As a result of the Lord's sowing, a great change took place in the being of both the leper and Peter's mother-in-law
The three measures of meal refer to fine flour made of wheat grain, fine flour that was used in the meal offering
The meal offering is a type of Christ in His humanity, with the fine flour signifying the fineness and evenness of Christ's humanity
When the Lord appeared to Abraham, Abraham told Sarah to prepare a full meal with three measures of fine flour
The church, as the practicality of the kingdom of the heavens, should have only Christ, the unleavened fine flour, as its content
Christ first found the treasure when He came out to minister, declaring, 'Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
He went to the cross to buy not only the treasure but also the field and thereby redeem the earth created by God
Christ went to the cross to redeem the God-created earth because within the earth there was the kingdom, the treasure
No doubt this kingdom is realized in the church life, but its manifestation is related to the redeemed nation of Israel
After finding it in Matthew 16:18 and 18:17, He went to the cross and sold all He had and bought it for the kingdom
His resurrection life was secreted, covering us again and again, and made us the pearl, the church, taken out of the water of death
The parables in Matthew 13 reveal that the Lord Jesus came as the Sower to sow the seed and that eventually He gained the pearl
One day a Canaanite woman cried out to the Lord Jesus saying, 'Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is badly demon-possessed'!
The holy land of Israel was the table on which Christ, the heavenly bread, came as a portion to the children of Israel
They threw Him off the table to the 'ground,' the Gentile country, so that He became broken crumbs as a portion to the Gentiles
The morning denotes the earliest part of the church age, when Christ came to call His disciples into the kingdom
Those hired at the eleventh hour received a denarius and those hired first supposing that they would receive more also received a denarius
The Lord strongly indicates that His reward to His followers is not commercial but according to His desire and grace
In this parable the householder is God, the vineyard is the city of Jerusalem , and the husbandmen are the leaders of the Israelites
The husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him and possess his inheritance'
Christ is not only the foundation stone and the topstone , but also the cornerstone, the stone that joins the walls
Through Christ as the cornerstone the Jewish and Gentile believers are brought together as one building for God
Now for God's building we need to enjoy and experience Christ as the building stone, as the building life and element
In the latter parable Christ is the Bridegroom who satisfies the Father's desire and becomes the pleasure of God's invited ones
In Matthew 24:3 the disciples asked the Lord Jesus concerning the sign of His coming and of the consummation, the end, of the age
Christ will also be clothed with a cloud in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear like a flash to the earth
The 'householder' refers to the believer and the 'house,' to the believer's conduct and work that he has built up in his Christian life
Because Christ will come to steal valuable things, we should seek to be precious, worthy of being 'stolen' by Him in His secret coming
Verse 45 says Who then is the faithful and prudent slave whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the appointed time
To 'give them food' is to minister the Word of God with Christ as the life supply to the believers in the church
To be 'blessed' is to be rewarded by Christ, the Master, with ruling authority in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
The Master will set the faithful slave 'over all his possessions' as a reward in the manifestation of the kingdom
Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom'
In the parable of the talents Christ is the man who going into another country called his own slaves and delivered to them his possessions
To His slaves Christ delivered His 'possessions,' which include the gospel, the truth, the believers, and the church
The Lord's word reveals that He is the moneylender and that both the Pharisee and the woman were sinners, debtors to Him
In verse 48 the Lord Jesus showed His tender care for the sinful one when He said, 'Your sins have been forgiven'
After a priest and a Levite passed by a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came down to him and observing him was moved with compassion
When He saw him, He was moved with compassion in His humanity with His divinity and rendered him tender healing and saving care
Because the Jews did not repent, even after the Lord Jesus died and resurrected and the Spirit came, the 'fig tree' was 'cut down'
The Son comes to accomplish redemption, which is the first need, because redemption is the foundation of our salvation
The shepherd going into the wilderness to seek the lost sheep indicates that the Son has come into the world to be with men
While he was still speaking, the father interrupted him and said to his slaves, 'Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him'
He must have been glad to hear his father say, 'Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry'
As we eat Christ as the fattened calf, taking Him into our being, we are filled with the divine life for our enjoyment
Christ as our righteousness is our outward salvation; Christ as our life and life supply for our enjoyment is our inward salvation
The best robe qualified the prodigal to match his father's righteousness, and the fattened calf satisfied his hunger
Wearing Christ as our robe, we feed on Him as the fattened calf, digesting Him and assimilating Him into the very fibers of our being
The parable of the minas depicts how the saved ones should serve the Lord so that they may inherit the coming kingdom
In verse 12 the Lord Jesus says, 'A certain man of noble birth went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return'
In the parable in Matthew 25:14-30 the slaves are given a varying number of talents according to their individual ability
The point of both parables is the same: the faithfulness of the slaves will determine their portion in the coming kingdom as their reward
The man of noble birth rewarded the slave who used the mina to gain ten minas and also the one who used the mina to gain five
He took away the mina from the slave who had laid it away in a handkerchief and then gave it to the slave with the ten minas
The taking away of the mina signifies that the Lord's gift will be taken away from slothful believers in the coming kingdom
Giving the mina to the one who has ten minas signifies that the gift of faithful believers will be increased in the coming kingdom age
The sheepfold signifies the law, or Judaism as a religion of the law, in which the sheep, God's chosen people, were kept until Christ came
Christ was the door of the Old Testament sheepfold so that God's chosen people could enter the fold and be preserved there
Christ is the door through which the sheep are brought out, and He is also the pasture to which they are brought
Now, since Christ has come, all God's chosen people must come out of the law and come into Him to enjoy Him as their pasture
In our daily Christian life we should have the sense that we are in the pasture enjoying Christ as the rich supply of life
As the Shepherd Christ takes the sheep out of the fold through Himself as the door and to Himself as the pasture
It is the Father's pleasure that all He is, all the riches of His nature, and all the fullness of the Godhead be the riches of this vine
Everything that God the Father is and has is for the center, is embodied in the center, and is expressed through the center
Not only is Christ the embodiment of the Godhead, but, according to John 1:18, He is the declaration, the manifestation, of God
A vine is not noted for its blossoms or its materials; rather, it is noted for its manifestation of the riches of life
Christ, the true vine, is not life for people to appreciate as blossoms; neither is He life to be used as material
According to Acts 13:33, the Lord Jesus was born, begotten, in resurrection to be the Son of God with respect to His humanity
In the incarnation He was born of Mary to be the Son of Man, and in resurrection He had another birth to be the firstborn Son of God
When Christ was born of Mary, He was born as a man, and His humanity had nothing to do with His being the only begotten Son of God
After the Lord's resurrection, this 'woman' had a newborn child-the resurrected Christ as the firstborn Son of God-and she rejoiced
After His resurrection He was the 'child' with the divine life and the human nature with both divinity glorified and humanity 'sonized'
In this message we shall cover Christ's person in the Father's husbandry, in the new covenant, and in the apostles' preaching
Christ as the true vine is the center of God's economy, the center of God's husbandry, of God's universal enterprise
Everything that God the Father is and has is for the vine as the center, is embodied in the center, and is expressed through the center
In the new covenant God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings
Christ, our Apostle, came to us with God to share God with us so that we may partake of His divine nature, life, and fullness
He has two natures humanity which is good for the material for the building of Gods house and divinity which is the element of the Builder
Christ was sent from God to be the Apostle to form, build, and constitute God's house, the church , and then to take care of this house
In the old covenant the high priest was a mortal man, and his ministry was a shadow of the good things to come
As the One who came from the Father, the Sender, Christ is the Apostle, and as the One who went back to the Sender, He is the High Priest
Christ can be a faithful High Priest because He, as the Son of God, is actually the faithful and almighty God Himself
Christ can be a merciful High Priest because, as the Son of Man, He experienced human life with all its sufferings
The new covenant required the shedding of the blood of the God-man, the shedding of the blood of Jesus, the Son of God
Without forgiveness of sin there is no way to fulfill the requirement of God's righteousness that by it the covenant may be enacted
The living God, whom we desire to serve, always comes to our spirit by touching our conscience, the leading part of our spirit
Even more important than this, the better blood of the new covenant brings us into the very God who is our portion for us to enjoy
As the Mediator Christ goes between us and God, and in resurrection He executes the new covenant, which He bequeathed to us by His death
That Christ has become the Surety of a better covenant is based on the fact that He is the living and perpetual High Priest
He is the bondsman, the guarantee that He will do everything necessary for the fulfillment of the new covenant
Christ signed this bond by pledging Himself to the new covenant and to all of us who are under the new covenant
Christ is not only the Consummator of the new covenant; He is also the Surety, the pledge that everything in it will be fulfilled
Whether it is translated covenant or testament depends on whether the person who consummated the covenant is living or dead
Many parents, when they know that they soon will die, make a will in which they leave various things to their children
In the Bible, after God made His promise, He sealed it with an oath, swearing by His Godhead that His promise was confirmed
That the promises have become a covenant means that they cannot be altered; there is no possibility of repentance or change
After God made His promises in the Old Testament confirming them by His oath the Lord Jesus came and accomplished all that God had promised
After His death and resurrection the Lord Jesus ascended into the heavens leaving with us the covenant that He had accomplished by His death
As our High Priest in the heavens, the Lord is now the Executor of the new testament, executing what He has bequeathed
The new testament, the will, has been validated by Christ's death and is being executed and enforced by Christ in His resurrection
The animal sacrifices were shadows which could never take away sins , but His sacrifices are real and have put away sin once for all
The word 'us' refers to the conquered captives in the train of Christ's triumph, celebrating and participating in His triumph
Their move and their ministry for Christ is like a triumphal procession from one place to another under God's leading
Paul and his co-workers were Christ's captives, bearing the fragrant incense of Christ for His triumphant glory
After Saul was captured, he was placed in Christ's triumphal procession as one of the captives in a train of defeated foes
