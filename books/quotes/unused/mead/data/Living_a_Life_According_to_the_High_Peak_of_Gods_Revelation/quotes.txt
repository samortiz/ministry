[2]  In the type of Israel, there is a great part concerning the kings.
[3]  In this fellowship my burden is to turn us all to the mingled spirit.
[4]  THE REVELATION OF THE SPIRIT IN THE BIBLE The Spirit in the Old Testament
[5]  Throughout the Old Testament the Spirit is referred to as either the Spirit of God or the Spirit of Jehovah.
[6]  In Psalm 51:11 and Isaiah 63:10-11 the Spirit is referred to as the Spirit of God's holiness, but the divine title the Holy Spirit is not used in the Old Testament.
[7]  While the Lord Jesus was walking on the earth and ministering for God, Matthew 12:28 tells us that He cast out demons by the Spirit of God.
[8]  The apostle John said that the Lord spoke here concerning the Spirit not the Spirit of God nor the Holy Spirit, but the Spirit whom the believers were about to receive; "for," John wrote, "the Spirit was not yet."
[9]  In his masterpiece The Spirit of Christ, in the chapter entitled "The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus," Andrew Murray wrote that "the Spirit of God as poured out at Pentecost was indeed something new."
[10]  By passing through all the processes incarnation, human living, the all-inclusive death, and the all-releasing resurrection the Triune God, the God in the Divine Trinity, was consummated as one Spirit, that is, the life-giving Spirit.
[11]  REGENERATION, SANCTIFICATION, RENEWING, TRANSFORMATION, AND CONFORMATION BY THE MINGLED SPIRIT
[12]  We were regenerated by this life-giving Spirit, not merely by the Spirit of God or the Holy Spirit.
[13]  Hence, these two spirits the divine, life-giving Spirit and our spirit, which has been regenerated by the life-giving Spirit are mingled together as one 1 Cor 6:17 .
[14]  We need to realize that God has been consummated to be the life-giving Spirit, and now this Spirit, after regenerating us, indwells our spirit to be one with our spirit, to sanctify us, to renew us, to transform us, to conform us, and to seal us Eph 1:13; 4:30; 2 Cor 1:22 .
[15]  CHAPTER FOUR THE WAY TO WALK, LIVE, AND HAVE OUR BEING IN AND ACCORDING TO THE MINGLED SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 5:16-20; Rom 10:12; Eph 6:17-18; 2 Tim 2:22
[16]  In this chapter I want to share the real burden on my heart for my concern about the Lord's recovery.
[17]  The Lord has shown us His economy, and He has shown us the contents of His economy, especially throughout the past thirty-two years.
[18]  Most of the messages from this ministry have been put on audio and video tapes and have also been printed in books, yet according to our observation, generally speaking, we do not practice what we have seen of the Lord.
[19]  A God-man's life is a life of calling on the Lord, pray-reading His word as the Spirit, praying unceasingly, not quenching but fanning the Spirit into flame, and not despising but respecting prophesying.
[20]  THE NEED FOR A GENUINE REVIVAL AND A CORPORATE MODEL
[21]  I recently fellowshipped with the co-workers and elders by speaking a very frank word to them.
[22]  When you open your mouth with the exercise of your spirit to call on the Lord, right away you are under His shining.
[23]  CHAPTER FIVE A NEW REVIVAL BY LIVING THE LIFE OF A GOD-MAN
[24]  My burden in this chapter concerns a new revival.
[25]  In the past ten years the Lord has shown us His economy.
[26]  According to my study of church history and the biographies of many saints, I would say that before 1984 God's eternal economy as the very reality and the center of the Bible was never seen by God's people so fully as today among us.
[27]  To my knowledge, no other book has pointed out that God's eternal economy has Christ as its center and reality, with His Body, the organic Body of Christ, as the organism to the Triune God.
[28]  LIVING THE LIFE OF A GOD-MAN ACCORDING TO THE HIGH PEAK OF THE DIVINE REVELATION
[29]  I mean that we need a corporate model, a Body, a people who live the life of a God-man.
[30]  From today our practice should be to live the life of a God-man by realizing the power of the resurrection of Christ to take His cross as He did, to be crucified, to be conformed to His death, every day to live another One's life Phil 3:10; 1:21; Gal 2:20 .
