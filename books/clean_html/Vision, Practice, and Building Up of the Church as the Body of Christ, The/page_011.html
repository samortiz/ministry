<h2 class="head2">Our Full Sonship Requiring a Process<br />
That Includes Suffering</h2>
<p>We should spend more time considering the meaning of sonship in the New Testament. Sonship includes our becoming a child of God by the new birth all the way to the manifestation of the sons of God. From regeneration to the manifestation of the sons of God there is a process for us to undergo. Many things are involved in this process. If we consider the process itself, we will see a mess. We have compared this process to preparing a feast. Preparing a feast includes shopping in the supermarket all the way to serving the many courses. Between these two points there is a process, and the main part of the process is a mess in which the cook kills, cuts, scrapes, and mashes. We may also compare this process to cutting hair, which requires a number of instruments and also seems to make a mess.</p>
<p>In the early years of my ministry, whenever I saw troubles in the church among the children of God, I was sorry and disappointed. Today, however, if a brother has a failure, we can praise the Lord. Are there any problems? Praise the Lord for the problems! We need them. Without them nothing &ldquo;delicious&rdquo; will be cooked. The &ldquo;potatoes&rdquo; have to be &ldquo;mashed.&rdquo; We have to suffer and undergo many things. We may be sorry over the situation today, but the Lord is never sorry. He is happy, because He knows what He is doing. He is doing the cooking work. One day, sooner or later, He will have the full sonship among His children, and He will have their manifestation in glory.</p>
<p>The problem is that if we do not cooperate well with Him, we will delay Him and prolong the process. However, He is still wise. The more we prolong the time, the better He will do the cooking. I am not saying, &ldquo;Let us do evil that good may come.&rdquo; God is wise. He is wiser than we know. We all have to realize that we are under the process. We already have received the new birth, and now the goal in front of us is sanctification, glorification, full sonship, and the manifestation of the sons of God. If we cooperate with Him, we will hasten the time. If not, we will prolong the time a little. However, to the Lord it is the same. Eventually He will work it out. Eventually the whole universe will say, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; And the One on the throne will declare, &ldquo;Behold, I make all things new&rdquo; (Rev. 21:5). For the sons of God to be new is for them to be matured.</p>
<p>The correct, full meaning of sonship spans the new birth to maturity, from regeneration to glorification. If this will impress us and we are clear about this, the Scriptures will be open to us. Then our reading of the New Testament will be different from what it was in the past. God predestinated us unto this sonship, which starts from the new birth and consummates with maturity. I hope that from this time we all could be clear about this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUBDUING THE ENEMY BY MAKING<br />
GOD&rsquo;S WISDOM KNOWN THROUGH THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>God created man in His own image (Gen. 1:26). This image is related to the sonship; the sonship is the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s image. It is by the sonship that eventually we will fully be in the image of God. By the new birth we have the image of God within our spirit, and by transformation our soul will be conformed to the image of Christ (Rom. 8:29). Then by transfiguration even our physical body will be conformed to the full likeness of Christ. At that time we will have the likeness, the image, of God fully and thoroughly, from within to without (1 John 3:2).</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Purpose Being Not Only<br />
That Man Bear God&rsquo;s Image<br />
but Also That He Deal with His Enemy</h2>
<p>In His creation of man, God also committed His authority to man in order to subdue and deal with His enemy (Gen. 1:26). Therefore, the second item of God&rsquo;s purpose with the church is related to the second aspect of God&rsquo;s creation of man. God&rsquo;s creation of man was first for man to be in His image and second to have His authority to deal with His enemy. The church was predestinated for the sonship of God and also was destined to subdue the enemy. In subduing the enemy, the church will make the wisdom of God manifest to all God&rsquo;s enemies (Eph. 3:10).</p>
<p>The serpent first appears in Genesis 3, and he will be cast out in Revelation 20. Before Genesis 3 there are two chapters at the beginning of the entire Scripture, and after Revelation 20 there are two chapters at the end, but in between there is a long record. On the positive side, this record is full of many good stories concerning the sonship. On the negative side, there are also many victorious stories related to subduing and overcoming the enemy. Finally, in Revelation 20 the ancient serpent will be bound and cast out (vv. 2-3, 10).</p>
