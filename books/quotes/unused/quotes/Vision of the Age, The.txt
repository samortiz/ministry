We do not want to have some religious activities or busy outward works while missing Your inner presence and not touching You
Lord, in such a training, keep us so that we would remain in fellowship with You and that we would touch Your heart's desire and Yourself
We want to be taught and encouraged but more than that we want to know Your way and be preserved by You gained by You and sustained by You
May You grow within us, daily softening us, so that we would be truly mingled with You and be in one fellowship with You
May there be genuine growth within us, and may there be a broad pathway within us that will open all the doors in us
Save us, and remove all filthiness so that our mind, heart, and spirit, including our conscience, would be clear
Whatever we would cover, may all of us touch the same thing, and may all of us get into it and pursue after it in spirit
Even when a person understands a term, it is very important to know if he understands it correctly and accurately
In Acts 26:19, while he was defending himself before King Agrippa, he uttered this word: 'I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision'
In order to understand the meaning of the word vision, we must understand the context of Paul's speaking in verses 4 through 23
Prior to verse 19, Paul said that he was once a zealous Judaizer, being zealous for the religion and traditions of his forefathers
At the same time, he joined one of the strictest sects of Judaism and became a Pharisee, sitting under the most famous teacher, Gamaliel
While he was yet a young man, he received authority from the chief priests in the Jewish religion to put many believers into prison
He even requested a letter from the chief priests and took the lead to put into bondage all those who called on the name of the Lord
While he was on the way to Damascus, the Lord met him and said to him, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?
Concerning the word vision, our emphasis is not on its Old Testament meaning but on what Paul said in Acts 26:19
Later, while he was back in England on furlough, he went to the seashore one day to spend some time alone with the Lord
He felt that the Lord was calling him to consecrate himself entirely to those people and to send the gospel to the interior of China
In the following forty to fifty years, hundreds and thousands of people were sent to the interior parts of China to preach the gospel
The Old Testament begins with God's creation, or the creation of Adam, and spans four thousand years until the birth of the Lord Jesus
In Noah is seen one who walked with God and worked with God to build the ark to meet the need of that generation
In Abraham is seen God's calling, God's promise, justification by faith, the living by faith, and the living in fellowship with God
The Life-study trainings emphasize life; they do not pay that much attention to history, genealogies, and dates
In Acts 13:20 Paul says, 'After these things, for about four hundred and fifty years, He gave them judges until Samuel the prophet'
Since this period of time has much to do with the vision given at that time, we must study the matter in depth
We can say that during that period of time there was no properly appointed king from God to unite the whole nation of Israel
Although Saul was appointed by God to be king, in God's eyes his words did not count; only Samuel's words counted
As for David, he was anointed early on, but at the beginning it was neither his words nor Saul's words that counted, but Samuel's words
Based on the above, we can make a clear conclusion: The age of the judges was terminated only after David became king over all of Israel
According to 1 Kings 6:1, from the time of the exodus to the fourth year of Solomon were four hundred eighty years
Although both Saul and David were kings, the only one who served according to a vision was Samuel, who served as a judge
Can we believe that at that time there were actually only eight people serving God, and the rest were worshipping idols and not serving God?
Some people might ask whether at the time Noah was busily building the ark there was not a single person on earth who feared God
In the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15, the prodigal said to his father when he returned home, 'I have sinned against heaven'
When Jesus of Nazareth came, He also served God, and a group of Galilean fishermen followed Him as His disciples
The Levites were divided into twenty-four orders and were offering sacrifices and ministering according to their orders
In the eyes of man, such services were certainly proper and dignified, but were they carried out under a vision?
We are all very clear that the services of the priests in the temple were not carried out under a vision; they were carried out by tradition
It was the Lord Jesus and those who were following Him who were serving under a vision and whose service was pleasing to God
Perhaps in the eyes of men this is blind following, yet this kind of following pleases God, and this kind of following is done with a vision
They did not receive any vision individually, but the One whom they were following had the vision, and that was enough
Some brothers and sisters on occasion have been asked by others You say that the pastors are wrong the pope is wrong and everyone is wrong
In Acts 5, while Peter was ministering, the Jewish synagogue rose up to oppose the apostles and put them into prison
The only ones who had the vision were the apostles who were imprisoned and the simple ones who were following them
We need to see that not only was Peter's service under a vision, but even the simple ones who followed him were serving under a vision
From that time onward, the Bible reverses the order of the two men; it begins to refer to them as 'Paul and Barnabas'
At the beginning of Acts 18, we are told that through his tentmaking Paul gained a couple, Aquila and Priscilla
Another group of people thought that they were superior; they did not consider themselves as belonging to anyone
Paul wanted to go to Corinth, and he wanted Apollos to go with him to solve the problem of division in the church in Corinth
It is difficult to say that the one who plants is under the vision, but the one who waters is not under the vision
Today in Christianity, many Christians claim that they are spiritual, but they do not like to listen to others
Sometimes we have a feeling concerning a certain matter, but we can only say to the brothers, 'I urge you to do this
If we study the book of Acts and the Epistles of Paul, we can see that many times Paul pointedly told people to do certain things
We see clearly from the revelation of the New Testament that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was acting under the vision
When Paul was raised up in his ministry, he received a vision that touched the heavens, the earth, and Paradise
Under the vision, however, Abel offered a sacrifice that was acceptable to God, but Cain offered his sacrifice apart from the vision
Noah's family of eight people, by serving according to Noah's pattern, became servants who served according to a vision
During those one hundred twenty years Noah was on the one hand preaching the word of righteousness and on the other hand building the ark
He acknowledged that Paul's word was as precious as the Old Testament Scriptures and that believers should take heed to it
Based on this, the names of all those who did not join themselves to Paul's vision were eventually dropped from the record of the Bible
We can ask ourselves the same question: Are we those who are serving according to the vision, and if so, what is our vision?
Some join our meetings because they think that the brothers and sisters here are very zealous loving the Lord and that the messages are good
When they hear that we go to church meetings, they also change their terminology and talk about attending 'church meetings'
The divine revelation upon which He based His speaking is veritable; it is written in black and white and is not abstract at all
On the Sabbath day, when He took His disciples across the grainfields, the disciples picked ears of grain and ate
The first message that Peter delivered on the day of Pentecost was a defense based extensively on the Scriptures
He quoted the prophet Joel and proclaimed that Jesus of Nazareth, whom the people had crucified on the cross, had been raised up by God
With the truth of the Bible as our guiding principle, we can study and examine all the denominations and sects that we find today
It considers all British citizens members of the Anglican Church by birth, whether or not they are believers and have been baptized
We cannot say that as long as people have the Bible, they have the revelation or are acting according to the vision
It is very possible that they merely hold the Bible in their hands; they have not realized the vision and revelation contained in the Bible
The standard of such revelation must be sufficiently high; it must be up to the standard of the divine revelation
The way to build this ark is to preach the gospel, set up home meetings, teach the truth, and have everyone prophesy
Perhaps you expound the Bible, and perhaps you serve very zealously, but your service is not 'building the ark'
We have the same Bible in our hands, but some people have no light even after they have read it a hundred times
In the Lord's recovery, every page, every verse, every sentence, and even every word shine with revelation and light
In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul said that Apollos watered, but in the same verse he told the Corinthians that he was the one who planted
The Catholic Church builds up its own church, and the charismatics build up their own tongue-speaking churches
No one is building according to the blueprint that Paul received; no one is building according to the revelation of the Bible
The Lord issues the blueprint, the revelation, and the utterance, and through one man He supervises and completes the building work
In the first chapter, entitled 'Vision in God's Economy,' we read how God's servants and the Lord's followers must see a vision
We have to believe that Adam and Eve not only lived by the vision, but they also told their children about this vision
Abel belonged to the first kind; he lived under his father's vision, and his father's vision became his vision
For man to call on the name of Jehovah means to receive the Triune God into him to be his enjoyment and supply
He inherited Adam's vision, Abel's vision, and Enosh's vision, but he went on to see that he could not be separated from God
We have to believe that Noah at his time inherited Adam's vision, Abel's vision, Enosh's vision, and Enoch's vision
He saw the tabernacle and the ordinances regarding the offerings and other matters, which we cannot describe here in detail
Not only did they prophesy and speak for God; they saw vision after vision in a definite way and served according to these visions
They turned the kings back from the things contrary to the visions to a service that was once again under the visions
He did not wear a priestly garment but instead lived in the wilderness, eating locusts and wild honey and wearing camel's hair
The baptism of John the Baptist initiated the Lord Jesus into His office for the accomplishment of His ministry
John the Baptist clearly indicated that his ministry was a pioneering and initiating ministry , but his disciples did not understand this
Not only were the Jewish religionists not under the vision; even the followers of John the Baptist were not under the vision
On the other hand, He encouraged John to take the way that the Lord had ordained for him and to experience the blessing in that way
They even forsook their fishing career, leaving behind their fathers and their nets, and followed the Lord single-heartedly
At that time all those who were following the Lord Jesus, male or female, including such ones as Mary, were all foolish
When we come to Acts 10, however, we find that his strong Jewish background stood in the way and caused the vision to suffer a setback
On the day of Pentecost, Peter used one key to open the door for the Jews to enter God's New Testament kingdom
In Acts 7 through 9 he was Saul of Tarsus, a person who was in the Jewish religion and had received the highest education
He also put many believers into prison, cast votes to condemn them to death, and persecuted them even as far as foreign cities
Saul, however, was not under the vision, yet one day on his way to Damascus the Lord met him and showed him the vision
We do not see anything about the believers being built up into the Body of Christ to be one with the Triune God as His organism
All the members together with Paul were constituted to become His Body and were joined to Him to become an enlarged 'Me'
Although the vision Paul saw at the beginning was so high and profound, he did not take up his ministry immediately
If we carefully study the book of Acts and Paul's Epistles, we will discover that this matter is not that simple or shallow
Although he was the one who ushered Paul into the service, when Paul saw the up-to-date vision of the age, Barnabas was left behind
Paul worked throughout the Gentile world, but he never stayed in one place for as long as three years except in Ephesus
The reason that the church in Ephesus degraded was that it had taken the lead to depart from the teaching of the apostles
With the departure of the apostles' teaching came the teaching of Balaam , the teaching of the Nicolaitans , and the teaching of Jezebel
If anyone tries to cut off anything, he will be cut off from the blessing of the tree of life, the water of life, and the city of life
In order to serve God according to the up-to-date vision, we need to come up to the level of Paul's very last Epistles
In the National Palace Museum in Taipei, there is a painting on a long scroll called 'The River Scene at Ching-Ming Festival'
One has to go all the way from one end to the other end before he can have a clear picture or vision of the entire spectrum of life in China
It begins from Adam's vision of the tree of life in the garden of Eden and extends all the way to the New Jerusalem with the tree of life
Can we say that five hundred years ago Martin Luther saw this vision and was serving according to this vision?
The Jews are pious people; they are zealous in expounding the Scriptures from Genesis to Malachi, but they have only the Old Testament
The goal of all our services, including preaching the gospel and edifying the believers, must be ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem
The vision has never changed, but the persons have indeed changed, and those who follow the vision also have changed
In order for them to write a book to refute me, they must first read my books, but once they read my books, they are convinced and subdued
Between 1942 and 1948 there was a great storm, and Brother Nee was forced to discontinue his ministry for six years
Paul told Timothy, 'All who are in Asia turned away from me' , but Paul did not authorize Timothy to have another beginning
In the same way, at the time when almost everyone in China forsook Brother Nee, he did not try to make another beginning
You are following a vision a vision that matches the age a vision that inherits all that was in the past and a vision that is allinclusive
If you remain in the book of Acts, you may have inherited everything prior to that time, but you are not up to date
Although everyone says that he loves the Lord, there is no clear vision, and men are 'carried about by every wind'
My point is this: Although James was pious to the uttermost in Jerusalem, we cannot conclude from this that his pathway was the right one
We certainly need to exercise ourselves unto godliness; we should not be loose, and our personality and character, should be noble
Not only should the churches in Taiwan do this, but all the churches in all the continents throughout the earth should do this
Timothy 3:15-16 says, 'The house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth
What the church supports and upholds is the teaching according to godliness which is God manifesting Himself in the flesh through the church
If anyone teaches anything apart from the New Testament teaching, he is teaching differently, and he does not consent to healthy words
According to the record of Genesis 17, God established circumcision with Abraham as a sign of an eternally immutable covenant
The Jewish Christians argued that even in the New Testament age, God's people, that is, His children, were not exempt from circumcision
Healthy words are those that are not only scriptural, but those that consent to the revelation of the Lord Jesus
These words according to the mystery of godliness are the consistent and overall revelation of God in the New Testament
He reminded them how for three years he was in their midst, not shrinking from declaring to them all the counsel of God
In John 10 the Lord said that He is the good Shepherd and that He came to lay down His life that men may receive life
Outwardly, those who teach differently are God's people, but the different teaching that they are teaching is the unhealthy teaching
If we eat unhealthy food, not only will it not benefit us, but it will actually harm our body and threaten our physical life
Under the strong influence of Judaism, they mixed God's New Testament economy with the out-of-date Old Testament economy
He even told Paul, 'They have been informed concerning you that you are teaching all the Jews throughout the nations apostasy from Moses
James was saying that there were tens of thousands of believers in Jerusalem who could not accept what Paul had done
Since that is the case, why would Paul concede to James's proposal when he was in Jerusalem and go back to the law?
Although Paul tried to become as a Jew to the Jews and as a Gentile to the Gentiles, the Lord did not allow him to compromise
It not only saved his life from the persecuting hands of the Jews but it saved him from the peril of tearing down Gods New Testament economy
It was not absolute for God's New Testament economy, and it contained a strong mixture of Old Testament elements
Because his burden was so heavy, he was not able to forget about Jerusalem even during the third journey of his ministry
In the end, Paul was kept in custody under the hands of the Romans and was isolated from the disturbance and riot
He passed through Macedonia and wrote the first Epistle to Timothy, telling Timothy that some in Ephesus had a problem
A little more than a year after Paul was released from prison, Nero, the Roman Caesar, began to persecute the Christians
In 2 Timothy 113 Paul said Hold a pattern of the healthy words that you have heard from me in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus
We need to deposit the Lords healthy words including the riches of life in the Lords words into our being like we deposit money in the bank
When we come to Revelation 2 and 3 we find the Lord writing to the seven churches in Asia and the first letter was to the church in Ephesus
While he was alive, he was the only one on the whole earth who could echo what we saw concerning spiritual life principles
From 1937 to 1938 Brother Watchman Nee visited a number of countries in Europe and stayed there for more than a year and a half
At that time he called together a special fellowship meeting and reported to us in detail his fellowship with Brother AustinSparks in London
After his visit, he wrote three letters, one to Manila, one to Hong Kong, and one to Taipei, highly promoting Brother Austin-Sparks
He said that Brother Austin-Sparks was a spiritual giant and that he had a strong burden to come to the Far East to witness for the Lord
It is not very easy for a person to expose his flaws in the big things; the problems are always with the small things
In the January 1955 issue there was a column acknowledging the Christmas cards that he had received from readers
After visiting for about a month, one morning we asked him to have a time of fellowship with the hundred or more co-workers that we had
He took the initiative to ask that question in order to provide Brother Austin-Sparks the opportunity to speak what he had prepared
We need to realize that if one's vision is not clear, he can be very spiritual, but he can become quite confused in certain matters
After the meetings they would put on their caps and fellowship with the brothers and sisters in the meeting hall
Brother Austin-Sparks came to our meetings and started questioning such practices among us as the breaking of bread
These were traces that gave us a hint that his way and our way could not be reconciled because what we saw was different
Suddenly a brother asked, 'Brother Austin-Sparks, suppose here in Taipei there are five assemblies that meet in the Lord's name
We cannot say that simply because her spiritual stature was high that she was right in the matter of the church'
Whether or not a person has a justifiable position is based not so much on his condition as on the ground he takes
On one hand, no matter how spiritual a person was, if he remained in Babylon and stood on the ground of captivity, he was wrong
At any rate, we cannot despise the returned captives' ground simply because their spiritual condition was poor
Although he was a man in the New Testament, he had one foot in the New Testament and the other foot in the Old Testament
History tells us that he was so pious that the skin of his knees grew coarser than an elephant's skin from kneeling
We can detect through various hints that the cause of Ephesus's decline was its failure to rid itself of Apollos's seed
From the time of Paul's first imprisonment to the time he was imprisoned again was a period of about three years
During that period he charged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to take care of the church because there was a problem there
During Pauls second imprisonment he wrote the second Epistle to Timothy to tell him that all the churches in Asia had forsaken his ministry
The cause for the churches' decline was the forsaking of the apostles' teaching; they forsook the apostles' ministry
After he finished writing concerning the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth, God's visions were complete
At the end of Revelation, which is the end of the entire Bible, there is the warning against any further addition or deletion
During the first sixteen hundred years of church history, countless numbers of lovers of the Lord were raised up
Spontaneously they became different from the first group, and they discovered that they could not fellowship with the first group
Throughout the last sixteen centuries, many lovers of the Lord were raised up, yet they were not able to be in one accord
The reason is not that there was sin or evil among them, but that the vision each held was different in degree
A young brother once said, 'Brother Nee used to speak of the cross, but we do not speak concerning it anymore'
By reading the messages on the New Jerusalem, we can see that in order to become the gates of pearl we must pass through the Lord's death
Every one of the nineteen items in the book The Experience of Life involves dealings that are related to the cross
We need to speak regarding the dealing of the cross, but we should not make this truth our limitation or our issue
We do not oppose tongue-speaking, but if someone emphasizes tongue-speaking to the point of strongly promoting it, it becomes a great damage
One may do this out of harmless zeal, but if his listeners receive his speaking and enlarge upon it, it will bring a problem into the church
In practice, the Body is expressed as the local churches in various localities, practicing the Body life in a practical and proper way
Dispositional sanctification is transformation, and transformation includes the dealing and breaking of the cross
In the history of the development of Christian doctrine, this entire set of truths finds its full recovery only among us
In the end he not only destroyed himself, but he destroyed the work of God and brought trouble to all the saints in the land of Judea
The fact that Jerusalem was burned to the ground and that thousands of people were killed was altogether James's fault
Regrettably, today on the earth, when believers see a little revelation in the New Testament, they begin to think quite highly of themselves
We have the same Bible, the same God, and the same Savior, and we have received the same Spirit and the same salvation
We all believe in the blood of the Lord, and we all share the same faith, but any further advance beyond this basis ends in differences
Although the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 had degraded and their condition was poor, the Lord still recognized them as churches
Many have seen the initial vision, and they are satisfied with what they have seen, but they should not stop there
In the process of becoming this, we experience regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification
As we have seen, the vision that matches the age is the vision that extends all the way from Genesis to Revelation
You are following this ultimate and completed vision, and you are spreading the gospel according to the Lord's commandment
Those who are sitting here today are either co-workers, elders, or full-timers who are learning to serve the Lord
In the parable of Matthew 20, the householder went out and said to the idle workmen, 'Why have you been standing here all the day idle'?
Today when we speak concerning the one accord, we are not speaking concerning a certain method that we must practice
If we have different emphases and different ways of doing things, our energy will be dissipated, and our faith will be weakened
