   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God in the Redeeming Christ Sitting on the Throne</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The One sitting on the throne is God in the redeeming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 22:1 there are not two thrones, one for God and another for the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, God and the Lamb are sitting on one throne.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, They are not sitting side by side.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead, as indicated by 21:23, which reveals that God as the light is in the Lamb as the lamp, God is in the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The very God is in the Lamb as the lamp and shines out through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the New Jerusalem God in the redeeming Christ is sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The throne of God and of the Lamb, one throne for both God and the Lamb, signifies that God and the Lamb are one the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, God the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In eternity, the God who will sit on the throne is our redeeming God, from whose throne proceeds the river of water of life for our supply and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This depicts how the Triune God God, the Lamb, and the Spirit symbolized by the water of life dispenses Himself into His redeemed ones under His headship implied by the throne for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For the Administration of the Triune God in Eternity</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The throne in the New Jerusalem is for God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is the One who had a purpose and who made a plan in eternity past and who created all things for the fulfillment of His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lamb is the One who redeemed us, the One who accomplished a full redemption to fulfill God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, the throne of God and of the Lamb denotes that this throne is to carry out God's plan through Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Both God's plan and Christ's redemption are being carried out through this throne.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The throne is the source from which the river of water of life flows, and the river flows with the tree of life growing in it 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The throne for the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose is to flow out God Himself that by this flow of life His purpose may be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All that the redeeming God administrates is for the purpose that He might be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the New Jerusalem the throne of the redeeming God is the center of the city, and His expression extends to its circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the redeeming God administrating on the throne is the God both of administration and of expression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His administration serves the purpose of His expression in His eternal manifestation.</S>
