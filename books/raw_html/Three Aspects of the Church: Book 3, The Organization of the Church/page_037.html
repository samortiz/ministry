<h1 class="title">KNOWING THE SPIRITUAL ASPECT<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING IN RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>If we have seen the types and the plan concerning the church, we will have a clear understanding of the church. In its spiritual aspect the church is an entity in resurrection. Doctrinally, we know this, but experientially, we may not have arrived at this stage. The church has two natures; it is the mingling of God with man and man with God. In other words, the church is the joining of God to man and man to God. This joining takes place in resurrection.</p>
<p>The Lord was incarnated to bring God into man, but this was only half of the journey. After the Lord was resurrected, He brought man into God. This completed the journey. Therefore, resurrection involved incarnation, but incarnation did not involve resurrection. Incarnation was not the whole process. Resurrection completed the process. In principle, when God is joined to us, it is incarnation, but when we are joined to God, it is resurrection. Resurrection is to bring man into God, that is, for man to be mingled with God. It includes both God being joined to man and man being joined to God. The church can exist only in resurrection. The church is produced by the joining of God with man and man with God.</p>
<p>We should not consider that what took place at Bethlehem was merely the Lord being born to be among men. We need to see that the intrinsic significance of what took place at Bethlehem is that God was brought into man and mingled Himself with man. The importance of what took place at Bethlehem is not merely a birth but that God was mingled with man. In general, Christians consider that what took place at Bethlehem was simply a birth, but we should see that it was a mingling. The significance of the birth is relatively minor, but the significance of the mingling is very great. Similarly, we should not consider the meaning of resurrection to be merely that Jesus was raised from the dead; rather, we need to see that resurrection was a mingling. The mingling that took place at Bethlehem and the mingling that took place in resurrection produced the church, a divine-human entity. The church is an entity in resurrection. This is not merely a doctrine but an experience.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Experience of Resurrection</h2>
<p>Experientially, what is resurrection? Anything that is of resurrection has passed through death, and anything that has not passed through death is not of resurrection. Of course, not everything that dies is resurrected, but everything that is of resurrection has passed through death. Furthermore, anything that is of resurrection is not the first but the second (1 Cor. 15:47). When we speak of the experience of resurrection, we need to ask ourselves whether our working and doing are of the first or of the second? Are they what we possessed originally, or have they passed through rejection? Do they have their original appearance, or have they been under pressure? Have they always been highly esteemed, or have they been put aside? Have they always existed, or have they passed through death? Likewise, when we examine ourselves in this way, we will begin to see how many things in us are natural and how many things in us are of resurrection. Anything that is spiritual and of resurrection does not stir up much feeling within us. In contrast, anything that is natural causes us to argue with others and stirs up much feeling. Hence, anything that is natural can easily stir up our feelings and cause us to argue with others. If we do not have any feeling, we spontaneously will not argue. A bench never argues, because it does not have any feeling.</p>
<p>In some local churches there are good brothers who serve together, but they often have arguments and different opinions. This shows that they have not passed through death and resurrection. Whoever is in resurrection does not argue or have opinions. We must learn to deny ourselves. Not only should we deny our natural capabilities, but we should also deny our so-called spiritual views and spiritual gifts. If we deny ourselves constantly, we will genuinely experience resurrection. We should not think that if we deny our spiritual gifts and spiritual views, they will all be terminated and finished. We must learn that resurrection follows denial. Anything that is terminated after being denied is not of resurrection; that is, anything that cannot be raised up after being put to death is not of resurrection. However, resurrection fears neither death nor rejection. &ldquo;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit&rdquo; (John 12:24). If our gift and insight are spiritual, we will not be afraid of rejection. The more we reject them, the more they will be resurrected.</p>
<p>In the natural realm we obtain things by striving for them. In resurrection we obtain things by rejecting them. Some people think that if they do not speak and exercise their spiritual gift, they will lose the opportunity. However, this concept is not according to resurrection but of the natural realm. In resurrection to die is to live, and to reject is to gain. We should give all the opportunities to others and put ourselves in the place of being nothing. In this way, many things of resurrection will be expressed through us. This is not a doctrine. This is altogether a matter of experience. In resurrection there is no feeling, and even if we have some feeling, we have to put it to death.</p>
<p>A person who is in resurrection does not fight, because he knows that his gain comes from his loss, that is, he gains by losing. He gains life through death. Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone. However, anything that is put aside and put to death will multiply at least thirtyfold, if not one hundredfold.</p>
<p>Previously, we have said that we need to be strict and diligent in doing things, but now it seems that we are saying that we should not strive in doing anything. In fact, these are two sides of one matter. Although there are two sides, the two sides do not contradict one another. In order to be strict, we need to pass through death. In order to endeavor the most, we need to stop. In order to be the most diligent, we need to halt. To stop and to halt are different from being loose. Many times we cannot stop ourselves, but God&rsquo;s hand stops us. When God&rsquo;s hand puts us to death, we may think that we are finished. Actually, it is at this moment that we enter into resurrection. Being loose is not equal to being terminated or put to death. A loose person can never enter into resurrection. Only a person who is strict with himself every day can enter into resurrection. A loose person can never achieve anything. Only one who is serious and diligent before the Lord can be brought by God&rsquo;s hand to the point where he expresses resurrection.</p>
<p>When we experience living in resurrection, the church will be realized among us. To be the church is not a matter of being meek, loving one another, or being humble. It is true that meekness, love, and humility can be found in the church. The saints surely love one another and are humble and meek toward one another. However, we should not consider that having these conditions is equivalent to having the church. The church is something in resurrection. Only when a person is in resurrection is he a &ldquo;church-man.&rdquo; Human love is natural. People may love each other today and fight against each other tomorrow. Likewise, human meekness is natural. People may be meek today and argue with one another tomorrow. If a person has not passed through death, he will still have feelings that do not pertain to the church. For a person to feel that he loves people and is meek indicates that his feelings are not related to the church. They simply reflect his own naturalness.</p>
<p>The church is in resurrection; hence, whoever is in resurrection does not hold to his own feelings or argue with others. A person in resurrection may be very meek, but he has no feeling that he is meek. He may love people very much, but he has no feeling that he loves others. He may be very humble, but he has no feeling that he is humble. This is the proper condition of a genuine church. Throughout the churches we have observed many brothers who are good but who cannot work with others. They coordinate together, but often there are problems. Although this is common, it is definitely not a small matter. It is a serious problem for the brothers to not be in resurrection but to remain in their natural being. As a result of remaining in their natural being, they have opinions about others and are not able to be one with others. There are too many instances of brothers being in their natural man.</p>
<p>We all need to see the fact that the church is in resurrection. Anything that is originally ours is of the natural man. It is of the first man, and it is not the church. Anything that was there originally is in the natural man; it is not the mingling of God with man or the mingling of man with God. The basic principle in resurrection is the power of God&rsquo;s life operating in man, working in man, and bringing man into God so that all the fullness of God can be expressed through man. This expression is the joining of God to man and man to God. This is the Body of Christ, the church.</p>
<p>In the church as the Body of Christ a man&rsquo;s goodness and strong points have no place. In fact, every strong point and everything belonging to the goodness of man&rsquo;s natural being are problems to the church. For example, some are very diligent, but their diligence is inborn and natural. Hence, although the church may have benefited from their diligence yesterday, this benefit may eventually become a great problem to the church. In order for our diligence to be useful to the church, we must allow our natural diligence to be put to death by condemning it, rejecting it, and putting it aside.</p>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;If we put aside our diligence, will we not become slothful?&rdquo; If we become slothful once our diligence has been put aside, this shows that we certainly have no element of resurrection within us. If resurrection is in us, the more we put to death our diligence, the stronger and more multiplied it will become. In other words, once our natural diligence is put to death, a diligence in resurrection will be produced and multiplied. Only diligence in resurrection is profitable to the church and belongs to the church. The fact that the church is in resurrection is not merely a doctrine. May we be enlightened to see this.</p>
