   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Secret to Our Work Perfecting Others</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The job of the deacons is not only to be trained and to get things done but to raise up people and perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They must not only strive and learn to do things properly themselves but must continually raise up others to do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The goal of work in the church is not just to get things done but to raise up proper vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is wrong to have many people in the meetings and many things waiting to be done but not have the proper people to do them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The deacons must latch on to some people and work together with them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They should be like eels in the sea that move around by latching on to each others' tails.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many people have peculiar dispositions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are mainly two kinds of peculiarities.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first is telling others what to do without raising a single finger yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The second is trying to do everything by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You only have the confidence to use yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The proper way is to do everything with others and by others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have to wait for others to catch up with you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You have to have the patience to perfect others and train them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you are too harsh, others will not follow you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Being capable does not mean being able to do everything by yourself but being able to show others how to do the same thing that you are doing and to do it just as well or even better.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is what it means to be capable.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The problem with northern Chinese housewives is that most of them cannot retain a servant for too long.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The reason is not that the servants are ill-tempered or cold but that the housewives always think that they can do a better job.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To them it is hard to find one servant under the sun who is qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is always such a fallen concept in man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we have to learn, to be dealt with, and to assign things to others; we have to help them to do the things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the way to perfect others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The deacons must accept the arrangements of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They must also learn to work in coordination with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In handling business affairs, they have to learn to "sacrifice" and relinquish their responsibilities to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the deacons are the only ones who are busy from dawn to dusk, they need to be rebuked because they have not raised up anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You should not do things by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Taipei I pay much attention to the deacons' ability to raise up others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In arranging business affairs, we should not assign the jobs simply to the deacons but should distribute the work through the deacons to the hands of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The deacons must be able to work themselves, and they must also charge others to do the same work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They must be able to work in coordination with the saints, and they must raise up as many people as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The deacons cannot wait passively on the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is wrong for them to do nothing, but it is also wrong for them to do everything by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They must work with their own hands, and they must raise up others to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not Working according to One's Habit</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Lastly, the deacons have to learn diligently before the Lord not to work according to their own disposition and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They should not quibble over small things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everyone has his own disposition and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Taiwan I always tell the brothers and sisters that human habit is primarily a product of natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a Chinese is raised up in a foreigner's home, he will grow up acting like a foreigner; his habit will overshadow his original Chinese disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the world everyone likes to say, "This is the way I am used to doing things."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But you cannot say, "This is the way I am used to arranging the chairs."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You have to arrange chairs and clean windows according to the heavenly pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You may ask, "What should I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>My answer is, "In the church you have to learn to ask."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You may wonder whom you should ask.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You know whom you should ask.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The answer is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whoever assigns you to arrange the chairs and clean the windows and whoever commissions you to a job is the responsible one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You have to go to him and ask him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You must learn to ask before doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Should you use a wet towel or a dry towel to wipe the chairs and the windows?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You should follow neither the northern habit nor the southern habit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead, you have to ask all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This will show you how much of the self has been cut away from you every day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is good.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is the most beautiful thing in the universe to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who are in charge of chair arranging should not make decisions themselves either but should ask those above them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the end the asking will go all the way back to the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If a responsible brother cannot follow orders, he can never give orders.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A Christian must learn to take orders.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you can take orders, you can give orders.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I am afraid that some brothers and sisters can neither take orders nor give orders.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The church is a place of confusion when this happens.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Perhaps you still do not understand what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Let me ask: What would you do if you come to the meeting and see a chair turned upside down?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If one brother answers, "Turn it back up," this is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If another one says, "Leave it alone," how can one neglect this, being a part of the family?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The best answer is, "Find out who is responsible for the chairs and check with him."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If you do this, you will realize how much you have been dealt with in the church service, how much of the self is removed, and how much you have been perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we pay attention to the above points, we will see that many will be ushered into the service because of us, and many will be perfected to be sent out to other places.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All the brothers and sisters who are learning to serve the Lord should pay attention to these points.</S>
