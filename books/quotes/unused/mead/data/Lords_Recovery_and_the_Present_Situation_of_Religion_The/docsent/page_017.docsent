   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX ALL AGES BEING USEFUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE LORD S MOVE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have been speaking about the young people being useful in the hands of the Lord, the older brothers and sisters may have been bothered concerning their own usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because of this we need further fellowship concerning the function of the middle-aged and older saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For a fuller treatment of this subject, please see All Ages for the Lord s Testimony, published by Living Stream Ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THOSE OVER THIRTY YEARS OLD</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>BEING THE MOST USEFUL</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>IN CARING FOR THE LORD S TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In general, there are more middle-aged brothers and sisters in the recovery than young people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the middle-aged saints have more to do in the church than the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The young people need to go to the campuses, but the middle-aged saints do not need to go anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are already in the fishing pond, and the fish are all around them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The young people are full of energy and should sell all to go to the campuses, but the middle-aged saints do not need to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no need for them to go to the seashore, because the fish are in their own backyard.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The middle-aged saints are more useful than the young saints in caring for the church as the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In any nation the young people under thirty years old are good to be sent to the front lines to fight, but in general the middle-aged ones are not good for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, the middle-aged persons are useful in carrying out the governmental affairs at the various levels of country, state, and city.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A country cannot survive if it has only young people to send out to fight but no one to carry out its affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this sense, the persons of middle age are more important.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, because I have been emphasizing the young people in the Lord s present move in His recovery, many middle-aged saints may have become disappointed, puzzled, and frustrated, supposing that they are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is absolutely not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The family, the nation, and all society depend mainly on the middle-aged persons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, the Lord s recovery needs the young ones to go out to fight the battle, but the recovery stands and runs the race mainly through the middle-aged ones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, after the young people hear this, they should not feel less important and decide not to go out for the Lord s interests.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>NOT KEEPING AFFAIRS IN OUR OWN HANDS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>BUT HELPING EVERY AGE TO BE USEFUL</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Humanly, older persons like to keep things in their own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The older some are, the more insight and experience they gain, and as a result, they do not trust the younger generation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This problem came to light in our recent migrations.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before the summer of 1970 there were very few local churches in the United States, but all the migrations that began at that time were successful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There was a kind of explosion, and within three years there were over forty-five churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Beginning from 1974, however, the spread of the churches reached a blockade.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was due to the middle-aged brothers keeping everything in their hands, causing the younger generation to be unemployed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is why the Lord has now given us the burden to perfect the young people and encourage them to function.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From now on none of us should keep things in our own hands, trusting no one else.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since 1962 I was burdened by the Lord to begin the recovery in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the common way of preachers and missionaries, we could have taken several ways to carry this out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, we could have raised up a single church in Los Angeles, remained there for many years, and increased our number to become very large.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Certainly, every one would have considered this to be a success.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Second, we could have remained in Los Angeles for only a few years and then gone to other major cities successively, remaining in each one for a few years to establish the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This way is better than the first, since the total number of those meeting would be greater, and there would be several churches instead of one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The third way, however, is the way of migration, which is the way we have taken.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This has spread the churches over the whole country, and several thousand brothers and sisters are now meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Most of the spreading was accomplished through the migrations from 1970 to 1973.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After that time, however, the spreading stopped because certain middle-aged brothers kept everything in their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To be in the Lord s work is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must do things diligently day and night, yet we must also not exercise control over the things that are in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This gives others the opportunity to do the things and to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may compare this to a driving instructor.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He must be alert so that when danger comes, he can apply his hand to help the situation; however, after that he should let go again to let the car be in the hands of the learner.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then instead of having one chauffeur, there will be hundreds of drivers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some have criticized me by saying that I control the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I certainly do not have the ability to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How can one person with two hands drive a thousand cars?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At most, I am only a driving instructor.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All the dear saints who have been with us for many years can testify from their conscience that I keep nothing in my hands.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Not even the church in my own locality is in my hands, and many churches have not received a direct speaking from me for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I say this to illustrate that we should keep nothing under our control.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every age is useful for carrying out the Lord s work.</S>
