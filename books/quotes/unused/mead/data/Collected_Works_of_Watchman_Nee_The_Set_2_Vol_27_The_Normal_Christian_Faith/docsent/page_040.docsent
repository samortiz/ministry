   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW CAN GOD BE UNRIGHTEOUS?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once I met a sister in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She said that she was an evil person and had committed many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She had indulged in all a woman could ever commit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because of this, she thought that she could never be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I checked to see whether she believed that Jesus shed His blood for the sins of man, that is, for man's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She said that she knew all these doctrines, but having been a Christian for so many years, and committing the multitude of sins as she did, it was impossible to be forgiven anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I was sitting in front of her.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that point I stood up and solemnly looked into her eyes, saying emphatically, "I do not care whether your sins are forgiven or not!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the way you talk implies that God has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This I do care!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the one hand, you believe that you are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet, on the other hand, you do not believe that your sins can be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If God does not forgive you, does that mean that God is unrighteous?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If He is unrighteous, then He sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How can God ever sin?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I do not care if you are condemned and are going to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But God loved you and sent His Son to pay all the debts of your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His Son's death is now your death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All your sins are on His shoulder.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If what you say is true, then God has indeed taken back His words.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is coming again to collect the debts of your sins!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You are saying that God cannot forgive your sins and that He has become an unrighteous God!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What kind of talk is this?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this I have to stand up!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My God can never be unrighteous!"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On that day, tears streamed from her eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She exclaimed, "I am sinful, but God is righteous!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He has to forgive me in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although my sins are numerous, thank Him; He is bound to forgive me!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He would be unrighteous if He did not do so."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>SAVED ACCORDING TO THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is true that God is full of grace, but you do not have to be saved by His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You can be saved by His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The grace of God is based upon His love towards us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It makes Him willing to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But His righteousness is based upon His Son's death for us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It makes Him unable not to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before Jesus died, God was free either to save or not save us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But once Jesus died, God was bound!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is absolutely obligated to save whoever comes to God by the blood of Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Have we read this?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is impossible for Him not to forgive us!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is salvation according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before the death of Christ, if He had forgiven any of our sins or had acquitted us from the punishment for sin, He would have made Himself a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now He has caused His Son to be crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The judgment of sins has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The problem of sin is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God can no longer reject anyone who comes to Him by the blood of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now He will make Himself a sinner and an unrighteous one if He does not forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>IMPOSSIBLE FOR GOD NOT TO SAVE US</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some may think, "Is it that easy to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am afraid that I need to pray more.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I have to pray to an extent that God softens His heart and has favor upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only then will I be saved!"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today, even if God would not soften His heart, He still has to forgive your sins!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even if God is absolutely disgusted with you, He still has to grant you this forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It does not matter whether you pray for a long time or not.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Rather, it depends on the fact that redemption has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even if God does not want to save you, it is too late for Him to change His mind.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It would be all right if it were two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, God has accepted the sacrifice of Christ; now it is impossible for Him not to save you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A sinner can suffer judgment only once!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He cannot be judged twice.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In order to forgive our sins, God has taken all the trouble to accomplish the salvation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now He has commissioned us to go to the whole world to show others that God has accomplished this work of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He can now forgive sins without placing Himself in an improper standing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>GOD FORGIVES UPRIGHTLY</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Others may say, "Why don't I feel saved?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Why is it that after I believed, nothing special seemed to happen?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I don't feel the peace inside."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Please remember that it is not a matter of whether you have the peace or not.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whether or not you have the peace is immaterial.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The important thing is for God to have the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He has to grant a forgiveness that is just and honest.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When God forgives you in Christ, He does so righteously, uprightly, and openly.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>All you need to do is receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>A passage that is quite familiar to many people is Mark 10:45: "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Unfortunately, many only read up to this part.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They cut off the remaining half.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The word "and" following this phrase should be translated as "even to the extent that."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>To what extent did the Lord Jesus come to serve?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He came to serve to the extent that He gave His life as a ransom for many.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In Matthew 26:28 the Lord Jesus said, "For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Hence, the shedding of His blood is for the forgiveness of our sins and for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We can only obtain forgiveness in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Outside of Him, whatever kind of forgiveness you have is not just.</S>
