The Fourth Reason</H2><P>First Thessalonians 4:16-17 says, "Because the Lord Himself, with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we will be always with the Lord."</P><P>They quote this passage and argue, "Does this not refer to the rapture?" I say yes, and I believe that it does. But I would like to ask if 1 Thessalonians 4 mentions the time of our rapture. First Thessalonians 4 only tells us the fact of our rapture; it does not tell us when we will be raptured. If some say that this passage mentions the fact of the rapture, I would readily agree. But I cannot find the time of the rapture from this passage. No matter how I read it, forward or backward, I can only find the fact of the rapture; I cannot find evidence that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation.</P><P>A brother said to me once, "Do you not believe 1 Thessalonians 4?" I said, "First Thessalonians 4 does not say as much as you say. My 1 Thessalonians 4 only says that we will be raptured; it does not say that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation." This cannot be used as a proof. It is all right to take this verse as a proof that there will be a rapture. But it is not all right to take this verse as a proof that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Fifth Reason</H2><P>First Corinthians 15:51-52 says, "Behold, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed."</P><P>They argue that since it says we will all be changed, dead or alive, does it not mean that everyone will be raptured before the tribulation? I would say that this argument is the same as that in 1 Thessalonians 4. In fact, it only tells us that the church will be raptured; it does not tell us that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation. It does not say that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation; on the contrary, there is evidence that the rapture will take place after the tribulation. We see this from the words, "At the last trumpet...the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed." Which trumpet is the last trumpet? Only the book of Revelation talks about the seven trumpets. The seventh trumpet is the last trumpet. The last trumpet spoken of in 1 Corinthians 15 corresponds to the seventh trumpet mentioned in Revelation. If the last trumpet in 1 Corinthians 15 is trumpeted before the tribulation, how can there be, after this last trumpet, another seven trumpets being trumpeted in the tribulation? If the last trumpet is trumpeted before the tribulation, then there should not be another trumpeting during the tribulation. If the last trumpet is not the seventh trumpet in Revelation, then what trumpet does the last trumpet belong to? For instance, can someone say, "This is my last dollar, but I still have seven dollars"? If he says this, it would be very meaningless. Therefore, 1 Corinthians 15 is not a proof that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation; on the contrary, it proves that the rapture is after the tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Sixth Reason</H2><P>Luke 21:36 says, "But be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man."</P><P>They argue that this verse clearly says "that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man." Is this not a promise that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation? Yes, this is a promise. But can this verse be considered a proof that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation? This verse does not promise that once a man is saved, he will not go through the tribulation. This verse does not exhort men to believe in the Lord and be regenerated quickly in order to escape the tribulation. This verse says, "But be watchful at every time, beseeching." This is something that takes place after salvation. A man is not saved by watching and beseeching. We are saved by grace and through faith. There is no direct relationship between the rapture and salvation. One is raptured through watching and beseeching. According to the original text of this verse, it can be translated as, "But be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would be counted worthy to escape all these things which are about to happen, and stand before the Son of Man." Therefore, the rapture is not a matter of grace but a matter of being worthy. This verse is a promise, but it is a promise with conditions. If the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation, are all the Christians watching at every time and beseeching? If some of them are not, this verse cannot be used as an evidence that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 19: Notes on Scriptural Messages (3) &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
