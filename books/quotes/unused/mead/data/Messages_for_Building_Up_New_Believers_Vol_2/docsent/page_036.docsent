   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IT BEING IMPERATIVE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO DEAL WITH OUR REACTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The above portions of the Word all speak of one thing Christian reactions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once we settle the matter of reactions, we have dealt with at least half the problems of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We react when others behave in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We react when others say certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We adopt a certain attitude when others adopt certain attitudes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are filled with reactions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why I say that more than half of our Christian life is occupied with reactions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If more than half our life is occupied with reactions and if our reactions are Christian-like, we can expect God to be pleased with us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if our reactions are improper, we can never expect to be proper Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps some may wonder why we need to emphasize this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let me be quite frank with you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not think that we are touching something that is unimportant.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have had this deep sense within me for the last twenty or more years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many people have been Christians for eight, ten, even twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They have read the sermon on the mount dozens of times.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet they still do not know how the Lord wants them to react.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They have been Christians for years, yet they are still fundamentally wrong in their reactions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They argue about everything, and they talk about the law, about their rights, and about what others should or should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They have not seen what Christian reactions are.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Such ones have righteous reactions, legal reactions, Gentile reactions, and tax collector reactions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But they certainly do not have Christian reactions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They say, Am I not right?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They feel that they have all the reasons on their side.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But they have forgotten that a Christian s reaction should not be based on reason.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are totally unfamiliar with what Christian reactions should be.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because they do not know how a Christian should react, they also do not know how other people should react.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When a brother is silent about an unjust thing, these ones may think that he is admitting his guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Recently, I heard someone say, So-and-so was silenced by the rebukes of others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He thought that speaking up was right and keeping silent was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But this person does not know the meaning of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He does not know what the Christian life is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In fact, he does not know what a Christian is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A newly saved brother should know the Christian way to react from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once he becomes clear about this, he will know how he should live before God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christians have their own kind of reactions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you are not reacting in this way, you are just like a tax collector and a Gentile.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let me repeat that half of our human life involves reactions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We act a certain way because others act a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We feel a certain way because others feel a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are reacting every day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If our reactions are wrong, I am afraid that our daily walk will amount to very little before God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why we need to deal with reactions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF REACTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now let us consider the principles of reactions from this portion of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Man s reactions to ordinary matters can be classified according to three levels.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first is on the level of reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The second is on the level of good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The third has to do with God s holy life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you are on the level of reasoning, your reaction will be temper and wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you are on the level of good behavior, your reaction will be to endure.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if you are on the level of God s holy life, you will transcend everything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These are the three possible reactions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If someone strikes your right cheek today and you are full of reasonings, you may say, How could he have done that?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why did he hit me?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When others strike your cheek, you may fly into a rage and reason about it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means that you are on the level of reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perhaps you have the knowledge that Christians should have proper behavior and that temper is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When others ask for your tunic, you may endure silently and allow them to take it away.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This kind of reaction is much better than losing one s temper.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But the Lord tells us that there is another kind of reaction; it is the kind that He requires.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When others strike our cheek, the Lord does not want us to react with wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Neither does He want us to endure passively when others take our tunic.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord tells us to turn our left cheek when others strike our right cheek and to give others our cloak when they want our tunic.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When others want us to walk one mile, we should walk two.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is not endurance but transcendence.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This kind of reaction goes beyond man s demand.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Man demands only so much, but we can do more before the Lord than just meet man s demand.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We can exceed man s demand, not just meet it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brothers and sisters, the Lord tells us that Christians should have only one kind of reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should react by transcending, not reasoning or enduring.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Please remember that those who do not transcend are not acting like Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord does not tell us to return an eye for an eye, to hurt the other person s eye when they hurt our eye.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Neither does He say that we should passively endure when others hurt our eye.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He says that we should add an eye to an eye.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In other words, when one strikes my eye, I should let him strike my other eye.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Please remember that turning from an eye for an eye to an eye plus an eye involves at least two steps forward.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Turning from a cheek for a cheek to a cheek plus a cheek, from a tunic for a tunic to a tunic plus a cloak, and from a mile for a mile to a mile plus a mile involves at least two steps forward.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>An eye for an eye is a reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Anger is a reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Endurance is a reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>An eye plus an eye is another kind of reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Of these reactions, all but the last should be rejected.</S>
