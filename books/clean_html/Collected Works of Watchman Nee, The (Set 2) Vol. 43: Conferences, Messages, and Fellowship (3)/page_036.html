All revelation is found on the mountain. The Bible tells us that the mountain is the place where one draws near to God. If a man does not leave the plain and ascend to a higher place, he cannot draw near to God. We are all very familiar with these verses in Mark 9. But I wonder how many of us have truly seen the Lord's revelation of Himself. When the Lord was on the earth, He put on human flesh as a garment. He was first the Son of the living God, and then He became the Christ of God. What does this mean? As far as His person goes, He is the Son of God, and as far as His work goes, He is the Christ of God. The Son refers to His person, and the Christ refers to His work. Matthew 16:16 tells us that He is both the Son of God and the Christ of God. Actually, only the Son of God is qualified to be the Christ of God.</p><p>He was the Son of the living God with unmatched glory, position, and authority. Yet He put on the flesh and came to the earth "in disguise." Men did not recognize Him as the Son of God; they only recognized Him as the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon (Mark 6:3) and the cousin of John the Baptist. Men only saw His outward form; they did not recognize who He was within His flesh. They only knew Him as Jesus of Nazareth, and they criticized Him, saying, "Can anything good be from Nazareth?" (John 1:46). Unless a man receives revelation from the Holy Spirit, he cannot see the Lord.</p><p>Who is Christ? He is the Son of God in disguise. What is a disguise? It is putting on a form that is different from one's original form. The Word becoming flesh means that the Word put on a disguise. When the Word put on the flesh, He disguised Himself as flesh. Men only saw the disguise of the flesh; they did not realize that He was the Son of God. They could touch Him, hear Him, and see Him. They could be with Him in His preaching, eating, and casting out of demons. But they did not recognize Him as the Christ. Those who were more discerning, like the young man and Nicodemus, called Him Teacher, Rabbi (Matt. 19:16-20; John 3:1-2). They only knew that He had a relationship with God, but they did not know who He was. In Matthew 16:13 the Lord asked His disciples who men said that He was. They answered that some considered Him to be Elijah, while others considered Him to be Jeremiah. Why did men not consider Him to be Daniel or Zechariah? This is because no other prophet was as strong as Elijah; he condemned everything that was against God. He fought with the prophets of Baal and prevailed over them (1 Kings 18:18-40). Jeremiah was a very gentle person. He was so gentle that others called him the weeping prophet. When he was faced with a situation and could do nothing about it, he could only weep. He was not as strong as Elijah. Men said that the Lord Jesus was Elijah because He hated and condemned sin. They said that He was Jeremiah because He wept for the sinners, the poor, and Jerusalem. These ones knew Him a little, but they could only say that He was Elijah or Jeremiah. Men only saw His outward appearance; they only saw Jesus' relatives, dwellings, work, and character. They did not know the Lord Himself.</p><p>But one day the Lord brought Peter, James, and John up to the mountain, and He was transfigured before their eyes. His garments became as white as the light, and His face shined like the sun. The significance of the revelation on the mountain is that the Lord revealed His very own self to men. He was no longer wrapped in an outward shell and shrouded from men's knowledge. The Lord's transfiguration on the mountain did not change Him into something that He was not. Rather, He changed into what He was from the beginning. Through this He revealed to others the kind of person He is.</p>
