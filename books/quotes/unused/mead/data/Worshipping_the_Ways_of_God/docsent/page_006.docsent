   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Worshipping God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>as the Captain of Jehovah's Army</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the book of Joshua, God commissioned Joshua to lead the Israelites into the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What a weighty responsibility!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moses had become old and died; Aaron had died as well.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The only person left was the young man Joshua.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who had the ability to bear this burden had already gone, leaving a young man alone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What could he do?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What must he have felt?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The mature, experienced Moses could not do it; how can a young man like himself do it?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How could he cope with the seven formidable tribes inhabiting the land of Canaan?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And how could he lead a people like the children of Israel with their fear of death and their constant complaints?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Joshua was faced with this challenge.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Can we blame him for feeling overwhelmed?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No, we cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we were in the same circumstances, we would feel overwhelmed too.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At this point, however, Joshua saw a vision of a great Man with a drawn sword.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Joshua did not recognize the Man and asked, "Are You for us or for our adversaries?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must pay close attention to this question.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How did the Man answer him?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many people erroneously believe that the Man said He had come to help Joshua, but the Man did not answer in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In His answer He first said, "Neither," that is, I am not here to help you, nor to help your adversaries.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am here for only one thing; "as the Captain of Jehovah's army have I now come" v. 14 . Thank God for doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thank God that this is what the Lord Jesus does!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He does not help us, neither does He help our adversaries, but He comes as the Captain of the Lord's army.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are God's army, then He comes to be our Captain.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is not a question of receiving help, but of accepting leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He has not come to offer assistance but to demand subjection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He does not come to help but to lead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He says, "As the Captain of Jehovah's army have I now come."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How did Joshua react when he heard these words?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Joshua fell to the ground upon his face and worshipped."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brothers and sisters, we must learn the ways of God, and this is another of His ways.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God does nothing to assist us or to assist our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God does not stand in the midst of the conflict giving a little help here or there.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God wants to be the Captain, and He demands our submission.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the face of so many foes, the need would not be answered if God merely helped us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Submitting to Him will solve the whole problem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The issue is not whether or not God is helping us, but whether we are submitting to His leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When He is in command, all is well.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A great trouble today among God's children is that we want everything to revolve around us and everything to serve our interests.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But God will not allow this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He wants to bring us to the point of simply submitting to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When this matter is settled, all other problems vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Joshua fell to the ground upon his face and worshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we know God's ways by knowing Him as our Captain, God will handle everything, and we will worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God does not come to assist us in battle; He comes to lead the troops.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we hope He will help us in the fight, we have misunderstood God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God comes to lead the troops.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must submit before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we learn the true meaning of worship, we will also know that there is now a sword drawn on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Worshipping God</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>for Opening the Way</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the book of Judges there is a section that relates to Gideon.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In chapter seven Gideon had no assurance; he did not know if he would be able to win the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He went to the camp of the Midianites and heard one Midianite say to another, "I have just had a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There was this round loaf of barley bread tumbling through the camp of Midian.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>And it came to the tent and struck it, so that it fell and turned upside down.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>And the tent collapsed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>And his companion answered and said, This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God has delivered Midian and all the camp into his hand."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he worshipped vv.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Gideon did not just worship God; he also worshipped for the things God would do.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He did not just worship God for His power; he also worshipped for the way in which God would defeat the Midianites, for His choosing, and for the way in which He was pleased to fight the Midianites.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is God's ways and methods that bring in the worship in this instance.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Praise God that it is easy for Him to open a way for us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It seems absurd to expect three hundred men to overthrow the Midianite army, yet God is able to make a way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Please remember that God wants us to constantly emphasize one matter: The portion that God should receive from His children is worship.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This does not mean that the work of God is not important, but this does mean that worshipping God is to glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is what God requires of us.</S>
