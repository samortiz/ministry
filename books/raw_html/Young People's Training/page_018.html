 <h2 class="head1">NOT A MUSHROOMING DEVELOPMENT,<br />
BUT THE SLOW PROCESS OF LIFE</h2>
<p>With this as a basic concept, let us consider some other matters. We all have some peculiar concepts. If we are not concerned about the preaching of the gospel, we simply do not care for it at all. But when we are stirred up and burning, we take the thought that after a short time we shall bring many to the Lord. If, after a period of time, we have not brought anyone to the Lord, then we are disappointed. Many of us have known this disappointment in the past. But consider the fruit-bearing of a fruit tree. The fruit is not brought forth overnight; it takes time. It takes at least several months for fruit to be born. Gospel preaching is fruit-bearing through the overflow of life. It cannot be a mushrooming development. Rather, it must be the result of the slow process of life. Do not expect that if you contact people for a short while, you will catch many of them. This is a mistaken concept. Do not suppose that after reading these messages of the young people&rsquo;s training, you will know the secret and that you will bring many to the Lord. There will be no mushrooming development. Instead, you will bear fruit in due time.</p>
<p>Most fruit-bearing trees bear fruit once a year. For example, peach trees and apple trees bear fruit once a year. This is according to natural law. Do not expect that you will be able to bear fruit any faster than this. We all must make a deal with the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I don&rsquo;t want to dream any more. Grant me the overflow of life that I may bear fruit once a year.&rdquo; It takes time to bear fruit, but it should not take more than a year. I look to the Lord that next year at this time we shall come together with some produce to celebrate the feast of tabernacles, the feast that comes after the harvest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO CONTACT PEOPLE</h2>
<p>You all must go to reach people. Whether you have the overflow of life or not, you must still contact people. If you do not reach people, you will have no way of knowing where you are. But when you contact them, you will be exposed and become desperate, saying, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, how can I go on? Lord, I have discovered that I am empty.&rdquo; If I were to tell you that you are empty, you would probably be offended. You must go and discover this yourself.</p>
<p>More than forty years ago, I learned a principle in the church life. Everyone has an opinion. Usually those who do nothing are the ones who criticize those who do something. For example, someone who does not know how to cook may be the first to criticize the cooking of others. In the church life I have followed this principle: whoever criticizes others for the way they do a certain thing must do it themselves. If a brother or sister comes to me criticizing others, I say, &ldquo;You are the best one to do it. Since you criticize others, you should do it yourself.&rdquo; The first time I learned this principle was when a brother came to me saying, &ldquo;Brother Lee, those responsible for the cleaning are not doing a very good job.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;All right, you do it.&rdquo; When he declined, I said, &ldquo;You have been caught and now you must do it. If you are unwilling to clean, then don&rsquo;t criticize others.&rdquo; Eventually, the news spread throughout the church not to criticize anything or anyone to Brother Lee. This one principle, which I still practice today, has silenced all the gossip and subdued all the opinions. The point is this: when you do something, you get exposed. If you do nothing, you will think that you can do a great deal. But when you attempt to do something, you discover that you cannot do the slightest thing. Therefore, go to reach people and discover how needy you are.</p>
<p>We all need to devote more time for contacting people. One evening out of the week should be used for your personal affairs, three nights for the church meetings, and the three remaining nights for contacting people. In addition to these three nights, I hope that you will use every lunch hour for this purpose. Make an appointment with people to have lunch or dinner with them.</p>
