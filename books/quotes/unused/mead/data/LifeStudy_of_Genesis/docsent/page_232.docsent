   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 Man's Fall from Human Government</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Satan's Instigation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The fall from self-government to human government, however, was not the final fall.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man fell even further than this, falling from human government to Satan's instigation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Human government was of God's authorization.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But Satan utilized the authority which God gave man to form nations and to instigate a rebellion against God with the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, man fell into an open rebellion against God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is rebellion?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rebellion is the denial of right and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the rebellion at Babel, man declared that he denied God's right and that he was absolutely free from God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We see this in the world today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some people say, "Who is God?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is God?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They cast off the feeling of their conscience and deny God's right and authority over them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is exactly what happened at Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In that rebellion the human race cast away God's right and authority over man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although there is a tendency along this line today, a part of the human race still is not for this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the reason that God is able to allow the human race to remain on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the human race suddenly all became like man at Babel, God would have to say, "This is the time when I must come down to intervene."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have already seen that at the fall at Babel God personally intervened and judged that rebellion directly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The fourth fall at Babel was more than a fall; it was a rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That rebellion was a satanic instigation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fourth fall was not a matter of immorality, murder, or violence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you read the record concerning man's fourth fall in Genesis 11, you will find that it says nothing about immorality and violence being involved there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I read this portion of the Bible as a young man, I did not think that it was so bad.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I said to myself, "What was wrong for people to build a city and a high tower?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It seems wonderful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why did God have to come down to judge?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There was no theft, murder, or immorality."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At that time I did not see what was behind that rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the back of that rebellion was the satanic instigation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, man's fourth fall must be called a rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The question in that fall was not morality or immorality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was a question as to who would have the right and the authority in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do the right and the authority belong to God or to man?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is the Creator, the owner of all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All right and authority must be His.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At Babel, the creatures of God rebelled against Him, saying that they did not care for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They claimed that they were the owners, that authority was theirs, and that they would do whatever they wanted to do.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, that was not merely a fall, but a rebellion instigated by the rebellious Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Firstly, man was under God; secondly, man was under man's conscience; and thirdly, man was under human government.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Where was man at the time of Babel?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was under Satan's instigation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At that time man was altogether under Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Man collaborated with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This brings us to the second factor of the cause of the fourth fall.</S>
