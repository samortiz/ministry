	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">HELPING NEW BELIEVERS<br />
TO HAVE THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the first item to shepherd a new believer into immediately after he is saved. We need to help every new believer to have the assurance of salvation. After a person is genuinely saved by believing in the Lord and calling on His name, we should not rejoice and walk away from him. This can be compared to wrapping a package with rope without tying a knot. After two or three days, the rope will loosen and the packaging will fall off. In order to &ldquo;tie a tight and secure knot&rdquo; for someone who is newly saved, we need to help him have the assurance of salvation.</p>
<p>We can also use the example of purchasing a house. After purchasing a house, you must be sure that you have a legal document, the title deed, in your hand. The title deed is the evidence of possession. You know that you own the house and the land because you have the title deed. The assurance of salvation is the &ldquo;title deed&rdquo; to salvation. After leading a person to salvation, we must immediately help him to obtain the &ldquo;title deed&rdquo; to his salvation, that is, the sure proof of his salvation. This proof, or &ldquo;title deed,&rdquo; is the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Outward Proof&mdash;<br />
the Word of God (1 John 5:13)</h2>
<p>Let us consider some appropriate verses. A brother said that Ephesians 1:13 is a good verse: &ldquo;In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.&rdquo; Although this is a word of assurance, this verse should not be used too early when speaking to new believers. Others have suggested Ephesians 2:8: &ldquo;By grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God&rdquo;; Acts 16:31: &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household&rdquo;; and John 3:16: &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.&rdquo; These verses are words of assurance, but they are not the most appropriate, effective, and explicit statements regarding the assurance of salvation.</p>
<p>John 10:28-29 says, &ldquo;I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo; These two verses do not speak of the assurance of salvation but of the security of salvation. According to these verses, there are two hands&mdash;the hand of the Lord and the hand of the Father&mdash;holding us; hence, our salvation is secure. Hebrews 1:3 says that the Lord upholds and bears all things by the word of His power. God&rsquo;s hand upholds the earth, and this same hand upholds all the believers. Hence, every saved one is secure in the Lord&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>The best verse to use for the proof, the title deed, of salvation is 1 John 5:13, which says, &ldquo;I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God.&rdquo; The phrase <em>these things</em> refers to what is written in the Bible. An example is verse 12, which says, &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&rdquo; After reading verse 12 with a new believer, we can ask whether he has the Son of God. He might say that he does not know. At which point we should read both verses 12 and 13 to him. Then we should tell him that he has believed in the Lord and called on His name. The Lord&rsquo;s name is the Lord Himself. Since he has called on the Lord and is saved, he has the Lord, the Son of God. We can ask him again whether he has the Son of God. After listening to what we say, he will know that he has the Son of God. Then we should read verse 12 with him again and ask him whether he has the life. He might answer that he does not feel that he has it. We should tell him that it is not a matter of feeling but of fact. Using the purchase of a house as an example, we can say that after a person receives the title deed for a house, that house is his regardless of whether he feels it or not. It does not matter how he feels. What matters is that he has the title deed.</p>
<p>On the title deed of a house there are official statements that are approved by government agencies. These statements prove the ownership of the house. In the Bible there are many such &ldquo;official statements.&rdquo; We can read these statements to a new believer and tell him that these words are written for us so that we may know that we have eternal life. One official statement is Romans 10:13, which says, &ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo; Another is John 1:12: &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name.&rdquo; We can tell him that by these words he knows that he has the life of God, and he also has the authority to become a child of God. Hence, God&rsquo;s word is the greatest proof that we have for the assurance of our salvation. There are many words concerning the assurance of our salvation in chapters 1, 3, 4, and 5 of the Gospel of John as well as in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles.</p>
