   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUILDING UP A HABIT OF CONTACTING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must first pick up a concern for people and go to contact them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then we will learn their condition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In a local church the first thing that is needed is for the elders to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is very convenient, profitable, and necessary for them to contact people, especially the new ones, before and after the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, many of the elders have not picked up this habit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There may be many new ones in the meetings, but the elders do nothing to contact them after the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Contacting people must be our priority in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we have the practice and a strong habit of going out to contact unbelievers for the increase according to a schedule, others will know us to be those who are always busy gaining new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we are such persons, others will be helped to go out with us to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are not a society to take care of people's social problems.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not our way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are here to save people, to gain new ones, and to help people to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The way we practice the church life is our basic problem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nearly all the elders have accepted in theory the God-ordained way to meet and serve, but many do not practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those brothers who are elders must consider this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must practice what we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must practice going out to gain new ones in a desperate way, contacting people for their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must go to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To get one person saved and to bring that person into the church life is not an easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It requires us to pay the price.</S>
