   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Revival in England</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Upon returning to England, John Wesley became a powerful evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He rejected all the things of the Catholic Church and renounced the practices of the state Church of England as well.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He did not preach in church buildings or in the sanctuaries of the Church of England.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, he preached the gospel on the streets to the coal miners.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I once saw a picture of people with black faces but with two white lines running down from their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They were miners who had just come out of the coal pits.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They heard John Wesley s preaching and could not help shedding tears, producing two white lines on their black faces.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was truly touching.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From that time on, Christians in England were no longer bound by the old religion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While John Wesley was preaching, some were crying while others were laughing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their shouts of Amen! reverberated through the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Later on, this practice spread to America.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, some people could not tolerate this, so an Amen Corner was reserved in the Wesleyan chapels for the Amen shouters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Quakers were influenced by them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The founder, Mr. George Fox, shook whenever he gave a sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Taiwan there is a chair-shaking group.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This proves the great influence that John Wesley had on England and Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not only so, the upheaval of the French Revolution in 1789 spread through continental Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>England was also affected by this revolutionary storm.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, because of John Wesley s great evangelistic power, the storm was calmed down, and the effect of the French Revolution on England was annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because the royal family was very grateful for this, Wesley is commemorated at Westminster Abbey, thereby affirming his contribution to England.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Rise of the Pentecostal Movement</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Due to the influence of John Wesley and George Fox, the Pentecostal movement quickly sprang up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This movement was mainly to break through the old rules and to use the way of shouting to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Compared to the early days, the present Pentecostal movement is more orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once Brother Nee and I went to a Pentecostal meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We saw that some of them were jumping, some were shouting, some were yelling, some were laughing, and some were rolling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Each one did as he preferred without caring for others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the pastor was about to speak, no one paid attention to him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was not until the pastor beat a gong a few times that the congregation calmed down.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After the meeting, I was walking home together with Brother Nee, and I said to him, What way of meeting was that, with shouting, jumping, and rolling?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brother Nee s response shocked me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He said the New Testament does not have rules telling us how to have a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God s Reaction</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now fifty years have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These movements, from the mystics to the Pentecostals, were all originally reactions by God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because the church did not pay attention to the Holy Spirit, these reactions came forth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, these reactions went overboard, eventually producing the Pentecostal movement with shouting, speaking in tongues, interpreting of tongues, predicting, healing, and casting out of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have seen all of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because many of these practices were false, people gradually stopped believing in them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nonetheless, this was originally God s reaction with the intent that His children would rise up and pay attention to the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE HISTORY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT The Third of the Divine Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What is the power of the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The power of the gospel is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am concerned that even the saints in the Lord s recovery have not paid adequate attention to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Doctrinally, the Holy Spirit is a mystery, just as the Triune God is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Simply speaking, the Holy Spirit is the third of the Divine Trinity and the ultimate expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We cannot thoroughly explain the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is not the Father apart from the Son; nor is He the Son apart from the Father and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the wrong traditional doctrine taught in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to the Bible, the three of the Triune God are always together.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord s speaking in Luke 24:49 indicates that the Son would pour out the Holy Spirit as the promise of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we read the Bible, we often accept everything as a matter of course and therefore do not study to find the reasons behind it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This verse reveals that the Father promised and that the Son poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since the Father could make the promise, could He not also do the pouring out?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since the Son could do the pouring out, could He not also make the promise?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Of course, They could do so.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This simply shows that the One who promised and the One who poured out are actually the same person, yet with a distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Father promised, and the Son poured out what was promised.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to Acts 1:8, what the Son poured out was the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, Luke 24:49 tells us only that what would be sent forth, or poured out, was power and that this power was to be put on as a mantle by the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>According to the utterance, it seems there are three: the Father who promised, the Son who poured out, and the Spirit who descended.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Actually, They are not merely three but triune: the One who promised was the One who poured out, and the One who poured out was the One who descended.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, the Spirit as the descending One is the Triune God.</S>
