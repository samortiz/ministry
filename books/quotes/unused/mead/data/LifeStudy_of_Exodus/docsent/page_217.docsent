   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEHOLDING THE GLORY OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH AN UNVEILED FACE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul expounded Exodus 34 not for the sake of the children of Israel, but for our sake.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 18 he eventually speaks of an open face, an unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>An open face is actually a heart that has been turned to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 16 indicates that when the heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever the veil is removed, the face will be open.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From the context of 2 Corinthians 3, we see that the heart turned to the Lord causes us to have an unveiled face.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To have an unveiled face means that there is no indifference in our heart toward the Lord or His word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as there is indifference in our heart, there will be a veil on our face.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if our heart is turned to the Lord, the veil will be taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then with an unveiled face we shall behold and reflect as a mirror the glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When you look at yourself in a mirror, the mirror reflects you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if the mirror is covered by something, there will be a separation between you and the mirror.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This would make it impossible for the mirror to reflect your image.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But as soon as the covering is removed from the mirror, the mirror will reflect you once again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to be unveiled mirrors beholding the Lord and reflecting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If this is our experience, we shall truly be transformed into the same image from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be transformed is to have the image of the Lord impressed into us and then reflected out from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Just as a mirror may be filled with a person s image and become the reflection of that image, so we need to be transformed from one degree of glory to another until we become the reflection of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to Paul s word in 2 Corinthians 3:18, this comes from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have pointed out that both the ministry of Moses and the ministry in the New Testament can become in our experience ministries of death and condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The crucial matter here is the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are covered by a veil, the result of both the Old Testament ministry and the New Testament ministry will be condemnation and death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For those whose hearts are hard and turned away from the Lord, even the gospel of grace will become such a ministry of condemnation and death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever our heart is turned away from the Lord, our heart becomes a veil separating us from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Regarding this, I am concerned not mainly for Christians in general, but particularly for us in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am concerned for those who come to the meetings of the church, but who have a veil separating them from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although they sit in the church meetings, they, like the children of Israel at the foot of Mount Sinai, are covered by a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What matters here is not the distance, but the covering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The children of Israel were not in Egypt; they were at the foot of the mountain of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, because they were veiled, they were separated from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We also may be close to the Lord and may attend at least some of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the crucial question is, Where is our heart?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If our heart is indifferent and turned away from the Lord, our indifferent heart will be a veil separating us from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although we may be close to the Lord, our heart is indifferent and not turned to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Oh, may we all take this matter seriously before the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A SERIOUS WARNING</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Seeing this light concerning the veil over the glory of the ministry of condemnation and death, I am deeply concerned first for myself, then for those in the Lord s recovery, and then for Christians everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord is still speaking, but what is the condition of our heart, and where is our heart?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Is our heart turned toward the Lord or away from Him?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do we have a heart for the Lord, or is our heart cold and indifferent?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament, the crucial factor is our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not pay so much attention to objective, doctrinal teachings which say that the ministry of the law in the Old Testament was a ministry of condemnation, but the ministry in the New Testament is a ministry of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To be sure, we are living in the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But it is still possible to be like the Pharisees and not receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To many believers the Lord will say at His coming, I never knew you; depart from Me, workers of lawlessness Matt 7:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to emphasize again and again the fact that the principle is the same in both the Old Testament and in the New.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whether God s speaking is life or death to us depends on our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is an extremely serious matter to hear the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God is gracious, and in His graciousness He comes to speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if we are impolite to Him and insult Him with our indifference, His speaking will immediately become condemnation and death to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The same holds true in our reading of the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever God speaks to us, we need to turn our heart to Him and respond to Him in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Otherwise, even the New Testament ministry, the ministry of righteousness and of the Spirit, will become a ministry of condemnation and death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then instead of enjoying the blessing, we shall suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Such a warning is sounded throughout the New Testament, in the Gospels, in the Epistles, and in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Toward the end of Revelation the Lord Jesus says, Behold, I come quickly, and My reward is with Me to render to each one according to his work Rev 22:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The reward we receive on that day has much to do with our attitude today.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whether the Lord s ministry brings justification or condemnation, life or death, depends on our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all need to learn this very important lesson.</S>
