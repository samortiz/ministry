   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WAY OF CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Leviticus 8:14-28 speaks of a bull, two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The bull was for the sin offering; the first ram was for the burnt offering; and the second ram and the basket of unleavened bread were for the consecration offering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. The Sin Offering</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to receive the holy service before God, that is, in order to consecrate oneself to God, the first thing that has to be taken care of is the propitiation for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only a saved person, one who belongs to the Lord, can consecrate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The sin offering is the basis of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. The Burnt Offering</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Following this, we see two rams.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to study Leviticus 8:18-28 carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One ram was for the burnt offering; it was to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The other was for the offering of consecration; it enabled Aaron to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is a burnt offering?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A burnt offering is an offering which is burned completely.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The priest could not eat the flesh of the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the flesh of the burnt offering was burned completely.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The problem of our sin is settled by the sin offering, but the burnt offering makes us acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Jesus bore our sins on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This refers to His work as the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the same time, while the Lord Jesus was on the cross, the veil was rent from top to bottom, bringing us into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is His work as the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The sin offering and the burnt offering start at the same place, but they arrive at different destinations.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They start where the sinner is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The sin offering stops at the propitiation of sin, but the burnt offering brings the sinner further by making him acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The burnt offering is the offering which makes a sinner acceptable in the Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It goes further than the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The burnt offering is the sweet savor of the Lord Jesus before God that secures God s acceptance of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today when we offer Him to God, we are accepted by God as well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are not only forgiven through the sin offering but also accepted through the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>C. The Offering of Consecration 1.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Sprinkling of the Blood</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the first ram was slain, the second ram followed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What was done with the second ram after it was slain?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first thing that was done was the putting of blood upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron and his sons, upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the big toe of their right foot.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that since God has accepted us in Christ, we should acknowledge the blood s separation of our ears, hands, and feet fully unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should declare that our ears, hands, and feet are fully God s. Because of redemption, our ears, which were made for hearing, should now hear for God; our hands, which were made for working, should now work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our legs, which were made for walking, should now walk for God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We apply the blood upon the tip of our right ear, the thumb of our right hand, and the big toe of our right foot.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that our ears, hands, and feet have all been purchased by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should say to the Lord, Because of Your redemption, Lord, from this day forward, I will no longer consider my two ears to be my own, or my two hands and my two feet to be my own.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because You have redeemed me, Lord, my entire being will henceforth belong to You; it is no longer mine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Blood is the mark of possession.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is also the symbol of love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Both the price spoken of in 1 Corinthians 6 and the love spoken of in 2 Corinthians 5 refer to this blood.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because there is blood, love, and possession, our entire being is not our own.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord has shed His blood, and we must acknowledge the rightful claim of this blood upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because the Lord loves us, we will confess that our entire being belongs to Him alone.</S>
