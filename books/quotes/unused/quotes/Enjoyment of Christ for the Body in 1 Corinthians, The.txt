As the first of the New Testament Epistles, the book of Romans is a sketch of the Christian life and the church life
Knowing the hidden depths in 1 Corinthians can be compared to knowing the mystery of the universe and knowing the mystery within man
When we look at a person, we see his physical body, but the mystery within this physical body is the human spirit
Atheists say that there is no divine Spirit in the universe, and many people also say that there is no spirit within man
Without the divine Spirit, the universe would be a lifeless thing, and without the human spirit, the body would be a corpse
In the same way, it is easy to see many items in 1 Corinthians without touching the depths and the mysteries within this book
Corinthians speaks of many matters such as lawsuits among believers marriage life the Lords table head covering and speaking in tongues
When a member of our body keeps its appropriate size, it remains normal and performs its function for the benefit of the body
If a member is enlarged out of proportion, it becomes abnormal, it places a heavy burden on the body, and it loses its function
God's design of our body can never be improved upon; thus, every part should remain in its proper size and proportion
Speaking in tongues is mentioned in chapter 12, but it must be kept in its proper proportion, as Paul points out in chapter 14
It is easy to see the outward matters in 1 Corinthians, but it is difficult to find the depths, the mystery, in this book
To say that the church is heavenly is to speak in a doctrinal way, but to speak of the church in a certain locality is to be practical
In the same way, we, as Christians, cannot live without the church expressed in a practical way in our locality
Genesis begins with, 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth' , because this book goes on to speak of God's creation
In the same way, the beginning of 1 Corinthians tells us that it is a book that deals with calling on the name of the Lord
Many people have read studied and researched 1 Corinthians but their eyes were not open to see the matter of calling on the name of the Lord
Some have argued that this kind of shouting is not found in the Bible, but we have found that to shout to the Lord is very scriptural
When the religious Pharisees the chief priests and the scribes saw these things they were indignant and told the Lord Rebuke Your disciples
When we call, we are praying, but according to the meaning of the Greek word, to call is to shout, to cry loudly
If we are having a difficult time with our wife, for example, we should not pray that the Lord will change her
Corinthians 1:9 says, 'God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him, 'Teacher, we want to see a sign from You'
Verse 30 says, 'Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
He is God's power and God's wisdom as our righteousness for the past, our sanctification for the present, and our redemption for the future
God requires us to forsake our soul and turn to our spirit so that we may be spiritual men those who live walk and do things in their spirit
Without Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit, all that is taught in chapters 1 and 2 is mere doctrinal knowledge to us
We must realize that He is now the life-giving Spirit and apply Him in a practical way by calling, 'O Lord Jesus'
If Christ were not the life-giving Spirit but were only far away in the third heaven, we could not receive Him
If we need submission, when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, He comes as the life-giving Spirit to be our submission
The tragedy of today's Christianity is that people have many doctrinal teachings with little practical application
The Lord Jesus is always real, living, near, and available to us regardless of our sincerity in calling on Him
Many Christians dare not answer positively, supposing that since they have not spoken in tongues, they have not been baptized in the Spirit
According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, we believers are all in Christ, and according to 15:45, Christ is the life-giving Spirit
In Greek, were all baptizedin 12:13 is in the aorist tense, indicating that our baptism in the Spirit has been accomplished
He is the life-giving Spirit, and we have all been put into Him and have been positioned to drink of Him day by day
Someone might have said to him, 'Brother Paul, if you do not have the assurance that you have the Spirit, you should not say anything'
At the beginning of the Bible there is the tree of life for mans eating and there is also a river that signifies the river of water of life
In the second of the Epistles, the book of 1 Corinthians, there are a number of verses related to eating and drinking
Throughout the past centuries the matters of eating and drinking the Lord have never been as clear in this book as they are today
As we saw in the previous message, 1 Corinthians 1 tells us that the believers in Christ are those who call on the name of the Lord
Since our past was so miserable, we need the Lord Jesus to be our righteousness so that we may be justified by God
The best way to turn to our spirit to meet the divine Spirit as our portion for our enjoyment is to call, 'O Lord Jesus'!
In 1 Corinthians 3:2 Paul says, 'I gave you milk to drink,' and in verse 6 he says, 'I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth'
Some attend Sunday school every Sunday morning and remain under certain teachings for many years, but they do not have any growth
They not only put the blood on the doorposts, but they also ate the lamb with unleavened bread and bitter herbs
Certain hymns in Christianity refer to Christ being the rock mainly as the solid foundation for our redemption
We all need to eat the same spiritual food and drink the same spiritual drink by drinking of Christ as our rock
On His last night with the disciples, the Lord Jesus did not pick up the Scriptures and expound them, saying, 'This is My teaching
The best and unique way to remember the Lord Jesus is not to think, to meditate, or to recall but simply to eat and drink Him
The best way to remember the Lord Jesus is not to worship and adore Him as the One who is high above in the third heaven
Verse 17 says, 'Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread'
In chapter 15, verse 20 says, 'Now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep'
It is an inward change in which the supply of Christ as life brings a new element into us and discharges the old element
A few years ago we were 'muddy clay,' but today we can see a certain amount of the element of precious stone within us
Verses 11 and 12 say, 'Another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ
The foundation has already been laid and now we can build upon it not with wood grass or stubble but with gold silver and precious stones
Eating affords us the growth in life, growth brings in transformation, and transformation is for the building up of the church
He is removing the veils of religion, our old background, our old doctrines, and our old concepts that we may know His economy
As we saw in the previous message, the mystery and depths of 1 Corinthians are the two spirits, the divine Spirit and the human spirit
After all the teachings of the preceding chapters, verses 6 and 7 say, ''Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven'?
According to the Bible, there are three 'stories' in the universe-heaven, the earth, and the abyss, which is under the earth
Today we have not only the Christ who came down from heaven and came up from the abyss but also the Christ who is in our mouth
These verses do not tell us that Christ is rich to all who only study the Bible, pray all day, work for Him desperately, or fast regularly
Verse 2 of chapter 1 refers to 'all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours'
In Romans we have the key to partaking of Christ's riches, but we do not have any instructions on how to use the key
When we use the key to open all the doors in this Epistle, we find the riches of Christ in chapter after chapter
In chapter 2 Christ is the deep things of God -things which eye has not seen, ear has not heard, and which have not come up in man's heart
Christ is the Head of every man , the firstfruits , the second man , the last Adam, and the life-giving Spirit
According to the concept we received from Christianity, we consider that Christ is the Head and that the church is the Body
When we partake of the bread at the Lord's table, we are eating not only the individual Christ but also the corporate Christ
As we have seen, 1 Corinthians tells us that we need to enjoy and partake of all the riches of Christ by calling, 'O Lord Jesus'
The way to have the church life is not to receive doctrinal teachings and be corrected and adjusted in the way of organization
Whoever does this will not receive as much enjoyment of the Lord as he could receive in a meeting of the church
Regardless of how much we enjoy Jesus in our personal study of the Bible, we still cannot enjoy the corporate Christ in this way
To be given to drink is to be positioned to drink, which, according to the whole verse, is to be put into the Body
When one person says, 'O Lord,' another says, 'Hallelujah,' and a third person says, 'Amen,' we burn one another
In this way we enjoy not only the Head but the Head with the Body and not only the individual Christ but the corporate Christ the BodyChrist
Verse 13 begins with the word for, indicating that it is a continuation, definition, and explanation of the foregoing verse
All the members are one Body, and this Body is Christ, because in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body
In the same way, we as the many members of the Body of Christ are one because we have been baptized in the Spirit
To enjoy Christ as the power of God is wonderful, but it cannot compare with the enjoyment of Christ as the Body-Christ
To enjoy Christ as power is to enjoy Him in one aspect, but to enjoy Him as the Body-Christ is to enjoy Him in fullness
It is in the church that we are in the position to drink the Body-Christ, the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit in the Body
Even in the meetings of the local churches we do not enjoy Christ as much as we do in the conferences of the churches
In the Lord's recovery we do not stress theological knowledge; rather, we stress the enjoyment of the Lord by our eating Him
We may not know the elements in various kinds of foods, but we know that we can receive these elements by eating and drinking the food
After God created man, He did not set up a seminary and charge Adam and Eve to diligently study the doctrines related to God
Genesis 2:9 tells us that in the garden God caused to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food
Eventually, God Himself came in the flesh, presenting Himself to His creatures and saying, 'I am the bread of life'
The tree of life is simply Jesus, who is God Himself coming in the flesh to present Himself to man in the form of food
Even today God does not present Himself mainly as the almighty One, commanding us to prostrate before Him and worship
We also must see that when we eat the Triune God, there is a wonderful result, which is the church, the Body of Christ
The more we say, 'O Lord Jesus,' the more we take the Lord into us, and the more we take Him in, the more He becomes us and we become Him
Jesus told the devil, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God'
The old serpent has crept in deceitfully to deaden the living of the believers and cause divisions through differing teachings and opinions
Because of their degradation, however, some of them were carried away into Syria, some into Egypt, and some into Babylon
At first there were only a few large divisions, but after many left Babylon, they became many smaller divisions
Some, however, received the vision not only of leaving Babylon but of coming back to Jerusalem, and many eventually did come back
On the one hand, it is good not to call oneself a Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, Episcopalian, or Catholic
In this sense, we must be neither denominational nor nondenominational, because God's intention is to have the Body
By this we can see that there are two different kinds of oneness-the oneness in Babylon and the oneness in Jerusalem
They may love the Lord, love the Bible, and love people's souls, and they may do a certain amount of work for the Lord
As long as they keep their old position in Babylon or at a midway point, they miss the proper ground of the church
If we feel that some brothers are wrong and are even causing a loss to the Body, we should not go to them to deal with them
The circulation of blood carries nourishment, and within this nourishment are the elements that spontaneously kill and discharge the germs
Rather, we should pick up a burden for that brother and go to him with one or two others for the purpose of fellowship
The denominations in Christianity depend on one or a few pastors, but in the Lord's Body we do not need that kind of pastor
In this way we will remain on the proper ground of oneness with the necessary fellowship to enjoy the Body-Christ
