   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN PRACTICE Locality as the Church Ground of a Local Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Separating the Church in Existence</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>but Not Dividing the Church in Essence</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We also need to know the Body in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Locality as the church ground of a local church separates the church in existence but does not divide the church in essence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The existence of the churches is separated, but their essence is inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The saints who live in Atlanta and those who live in Anaheim cannot come together always as one church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For the sake of existence, the local churches are separate.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The saints who live in Atlanta have to be the church there, and the brothers and sisters in Anaheim have to be the church here.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a separation for the purpose of existence, but this has nothing to do with the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church in Atlanta, the church in Anaheim, and all the local churches are one Body in essence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Essentially, we are still just one Body on the entire globe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our thought needs to be revolutionized.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should consider our local church as a part of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Regions of the Work</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brother Nee taught about the regions of the work in his book Further Talks on the Church Life see chapter six entitled "The Way for the Work Hereafter" pp.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>153-170 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to realize that in the New Testament, for the apostles' work, there were only two regions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One was the Jewish world, and the other was the Gentile world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In these two regions, there were no sub-regions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Peter was working in the Jewish region, and that area was relatively small.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the Gentile world in which Paul worked was vast with different countries.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These different countries, such as Asia Minor, Greece, and Macedonia, were different geographical regions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rome with its surrounding areas could also be considered as a geographical region.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the New Testament does not have this kind of consideration concerning the work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Gentile world, there was only one region with one group of co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Did Paul, because of the vastness of his region, let some brothers take care of the work in Rome and another group take care of Greece with Macedonia?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There was not such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There were not different groups of workers under Paul taking care of specific regions or sub-regions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul and those with him were altogether just one group.</S>
