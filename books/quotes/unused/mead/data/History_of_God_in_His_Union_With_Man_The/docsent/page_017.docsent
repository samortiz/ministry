   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Daystar means morning star.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ezekiel 28:13-14 says that Satan was in Eden, the garden of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not the Eden in Genesis 2, which was the Eden on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Eden here is the garden of God upon the holy mountain in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, Satan was anointed by God to be the chief archangel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jude 9 also tells us that he was the chief archangel and was above all the angels.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>28:13b .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that he was a ruler, a king.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, in John 12:31 the Lord says that Satan is the ruler of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then in Luke 4:5-6 Satan himself indicated that he has authority over the world.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not the ark on the earth but the ark in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was the cherub upon the ark, covering it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was very close to God as the high priest serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, on the one hand he was a king, and on the other hand he was a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we have taken this position.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We were born priests, and we are going to be kings.</S>
