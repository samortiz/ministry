The reason for this is that we were not open to one another. This time, when over twenty brothers handed themselves over to us, I told them that now I am not afraid even to take off my hat to ask for money from others. When a man has handed himself over, his position is changed. There is the need for a certain degree of openness before there can be the capacity to receive a certain kind of words.</P><P>The first need today among the co-workers is to learn to be open. What we did last night (referring to the commenting on the co-workers, see preceding chapter) can only be done when there is openness. There are some things that we can say. There are other things that we cannot say. Here is a question of position. It is a question of whether or not a person has the position to say certain kinds of words. Here is also a question of motive and relationship. When you want to say something, you have to check if your motive is right. You also must ask what kind of relationship you have with your listener. Different relationships mean that our words have to be different. In addition, we have to speak in love. Without love, we cannot speak honest words.</P><P>We have been nodding our heads and patting each other on the back for over ten years. Yet there are still many things that we dare not open up to one another. We dare not speak about these things ourselves, and others dare not speak about them either. Outsiders may not know about these problems, but we ourselves have been clear about them for a long time. We know that there are some things that we cannot say or that are hard to say.</P><P>The problem today is that the members do not want to receive the supply from others. Once a member refuses to receive the supply, all ministries stop. When some people come across difficulties, they refuse to receive the supply from others. Instead, they will only accept exhortations and supplies that are three miles away from them. To have to say something under such circumstances does not touch even the surface of the issue; much less can there be any deep or open words. The need today is for us to put ourselves under the authority of the Head. If a man sees the Body, he will not be hurt or caused to stumble. What is needed among the brothers and sisters is not friendship, cordiality, or tactfulness. None of these things exists in the Body.</P><P>Among us in the past, we did have the supply. Yet, though the supply was there, it could not flow out. In the coming days, we do have to look to God for mercy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>UNDERSTANDING THE MINISTRY<br>AND THE MINISTRIES</H2><P>Specifically, every brother and sister must understand the need of authority in the local churches. Romans 12 speaks of the ministries, and Ephesians 4 speaks of the ministry. The ministry in these two places is different. The "ministry" in Ephesians 4 is singular; it is the same ministry as the apostles' ministry of the word and prayer as recorded in Acts 6. The ministry in Ephesians is "the ministry"; it is unique, and it refers to the ministry of the word, which includes the five kinds of gifts in that chapter. The ministries in Romans 12 are manifold; they are plural in number. Not everyone has a part in the ministry of the word. Only the apostles and the prophets have a part in this ministry. However, every child of God has a share in the ministries of Romans 12. In the local churches, all the brothers and sisters have a part in these ministries. Every member has to consider himself and to work according to his measure.</P><P>At the beginning of Romans 12, it mentions God's mercy. This mercy includes chapters one to eleven. Chapters one to eight cover sanctification, and chapters nine to eleven say that it is not of the one who wills nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy. Chapter twelve goes on to speak about God's mercy. This mercy produces a result, which is consecration. The goal of consecration is for the ministries, which is not to be a preacher, but to serve God. Service is ministry and ministry is service. The words service and ministry are the same word in Greek. This service is like the service of the priests in the Old Testament. There the ones who served at the altar partook of the food of the altar (1 Cor. 9:13).</P><P>A cook can prepare the food in the kitchen, but he does not serve the food himself. Rather, the waiter serves the food to the table. This is a picture of the ministry. A ministry is the work of bringing food from one place to another. Originally, the food was far away from you. But now the ministering one brings the food to you, and you can enjoy the food. Those who are serving receive the supply from the Head, on the one hand, and minister this supply to the brothers and sisters, on the other hand. A man receives his ministry from God. He receives such a ministry for the purpose of serving the brothers and sisters and the church. When the brothers and sisters serve together in a local church, everyone should put in his or her portion. This is a different kind of service. Such service cannot be replaced by the ministry. What Acts 6 talks about is a different matter.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_127.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_129.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 128</div><br></body></html>
