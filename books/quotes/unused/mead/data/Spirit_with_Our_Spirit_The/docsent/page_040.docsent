   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RANKED WITH THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the eyes of God, our human spirit is ranked with the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are two verses in the Bible concerning this one point Zechariah 12:1 and Isaiah 42:5.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Zechariah 12:1 says clearly that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The heavens are for the earth; the earth is for man; and man has a spirit to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can contact God only by using our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>IN OUR WORSHIPPING OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our human spirit is important in our contacting God, and our contacting God is our worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot contact God without worshipping Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is the object of human worship, and the human worship must be carried out by contacting God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we worship God, we contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can contact God by using our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus told us purposely in John 4:24 that God is Spirit and that we must worship Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We worship Him by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are going to live a meaningful life, we should contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is our source, and our spirit is our spiritual organ for us to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We live physically by exercising our body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But to merely live physically is no higher than the living of a beast.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we are going to live a super life, a higher life, we have to do it by exercising our spirit, which came from the origin of God's breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This spiritual organ within us is mainly for us to contact God, to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must be deeply impressed with this basic knowledge of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are being trained to be normal believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A normal believer's life implies the service, the worship, he should render to the Triune God, and in all of our service we must contact God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>IN CHRIST AND THE SPIRIT INDWELLING US, TAKING OUR SPIRIT AS GOD'S HABITATION</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our human spirit is important because it is in this spirit that Christ and the Spirit indwell us, taking our spirit as God's habitation 2 Tim 4:22a; Rom 8:11; Eph 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you do not have God in your spirit, your soul will also be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The soul was made to be a vessel to contain God as the contents.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Romans 9 tells us clearly that we human beings are vessels to God, containers to contain God as our contents vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today the Triune God is embodied in Christ and realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Both the embodiment and the realization of God indwell us, remaining within us to be our contents in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because of Their indwelling, we human beings become God's habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The contents of man should be the very creating God, the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He created us with an organ to receive Him, to take Him in, and to contain Him so that He can come into us to be our contents.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you have a house without a dweller, that is a pitiful house.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our dweller is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The New Testament says that God abides in us 1 John 4:16 , and it goes on to give us even more details.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To merely say that God dwells in us is still too general.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God has to be embodied, and God has to be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When God is embodied, He becomes Christ Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When God is realized, He becomes the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>So today we have Christ and the Spirit dwelling in us, taking us as Their habitation Eph 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How wonderful it is to have Christ living in me!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How sweet and how pleasant it is to have the life-giving Spirit dwelling in me!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should declare, "Christ lives in me, makes His home in me!"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eph 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"The Spirit dwells in me!"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since Christ and the Spirit indwell us, we become top beings in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our rank is now with God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We become on the level of God and are much higher than the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should be happy because we are the highest beings, ranked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to realize that we are on the same level with God because we have been born of God John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you are born of a cat, you become a cat.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One is the originator, and the others are the children.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The children are in the rank of the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the mother is a human being, surely all the children are human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are born of the great God, so we become God in His life and nature, but of course, not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are ranked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is our great Originator, and we are His children.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He became a God-man so that man can become a man-God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Eventually, He and we are in the same category, of the same kind, and on the same level.</S>
