   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH SALT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Every offering of your meal offering you shall season with salt; you shall not let the salt of the covenant of your God be lacking from your meal offering; with all your offerings you shall offer salt" v. 13 . The salt here is not common; it is the salt of the covenant of God, the covenant which is incorruptible and unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This salt seasons, kills germs, and preserves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the spiritual significance of the salt in the meal offering?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus far, in the meal offering we have seen the Spirit the oil , Christ's resurrection the frankincense , and Christ's humanity the fine flour , but we have not yet seen the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The death of Christ, the cross, is signified by the salt.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The salt in the meal offering therefore refers to the death of Christ, to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reason there is so much ambition and natural affection in the church is that there is too little salt.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are short of the cross of Christ, short of the application of Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we have adequate salt in the church, ambition and natural affection will be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As long as the cross is here, salt is here; and as long as salt is here, the germs will die.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As long as the cross is here, ambition and natural affection will be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I hope that this will be the experience of us all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not have ambition, and we should not have natural affection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should have only the crossing out of the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then we will have pure humility and pure love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We will be pure, and we will live a life like that of the Lord Jesus when He was on earth, a life without leaven and honey but full of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>XII.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>CAKES OF FINE FLOUR</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"When you bring a meal offering baked in an oven as an offering, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil" v. 4 . The cakes of fine flour signify Christ's humanity to be food for God and His serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whereas fine flour has no form, the cakes of fine flour are solid and have a definite form.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These cakes indicate a stronger experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may experience Christ as fine flour, as meal without a form.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may also experience Christ as the cakes, as something solid and with a definite form.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A. The Biggest Item of the Meal Offering</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The cakes of fine flour are the biggest item of the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, the cakes signify the biggest portion of Christ in our experience of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From this we see that the experience of the meal offering differs in degree.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You may have a portion of a certain size, and another saint may have a portion of a different size.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>B. Perforated, or Pierced</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The cakes of fine flour are perforated, or pierced.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This perforating, this piercing, signifies a kind of Christ's suffering in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Lord's human life there were many different kinds of sufferings, and the cakes' being perforated, or pierced, signifies one kind of Christ's sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>C. Unleavened</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The cakes of fine flour are unleavened.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Being unleavened signifies being without sin or any negative thing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>D. Mingled with Oil</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The cakes of fine flour are mingled with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Being mingled with oil signifies being mingled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ's humanity was always mingled with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In our experience and enjoyment today, the meal offering cannot be separated from God the Spirit.</S>
