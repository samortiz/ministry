   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LEARNING TO APPRECIATE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE VIRTUES OF THE OTHER PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once we are married, we have to learn to appreciate each other s virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In a family we need to learn to close our eyes to each other s faults and accommodate each other on the one hand, and we need to learn to appreciate each other s virtues on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that when the other person does something good, we must be sensitive to it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a husband does not know how to appreciate his wife or vice versa, he or she opens up a big gap in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This does not mean that the husband has to flatter the wife or that the wife has to do something special to please the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It means that both must learn to appreciate the other person s virtues, goodness, and beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I know a brother who is taking responsibility in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the brothers and sisters in that locality think that he is a very good brother.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if you ask his wife about him, she will tell you that he is hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The sister constantly criticizes her husband, saying that he is not qualified to be a responsible brother.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In that local church, all the brothers and sisters are submissive, with one exception his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You will find that this kind of family will not go on well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We also know of cases involving the opposite circumstance, in which everyone says that a certain sister is very good, but her husband does not.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One year I was in Peking talking to a few people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everyone there spoke highly of a certain sister.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Halfway through the conversation, her husband came in. As the conversation about the sister went on, her husband remained silent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He seemed to be saying, You do not know her.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have married the wrong person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The thought that one has married the wrong person has destroyed many families.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A husband must not be behind others in his appreciation of his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He may not need to excel above others in his appreciation, but he must not be behind others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You are not a proper spouse if your level of appreciation is less than that of others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you feel that your husband is wrong, why did you marry him in the first place?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This proves that you were firstly wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to have a good family, the husband must know how to appreciate the wife, and the wife must know how to appreciate the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One must not say something bad while others are saying something good about his or her spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You must discover his or her virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You must be sensitive to his or her merits.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever the opportunity arises, you must publicly acknowledge his or her virtues and speak your feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You are not telling lies.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You are telling facts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When you appreciate your husband or your wife, your family will become more united, and your relationship more solid.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you do not do this, you will bring many problems to the family.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many misunderstandings and problems in the family arise as a result of neglecting this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In England, a sister once married a brother, but the brother never said anything good about her all her life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This sister was always worried, saying, I have failed as a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have failed as a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She worried so much that she contracted tuberculosis and later died.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before she died, her husband said to her, If you die, I do not know what I will do because you have done so much for me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you pass away, what will happen to our family?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The wife asked, Why did you not say this earlier?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then she went on, I have always felt that I was not good, and I rebuked myself for it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You have never once said that I was good.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I was sad and worried and always thought that I was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That is why I became sick and am about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a true story.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The husband told her how he felt only on her deathbed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Please remember that there is always a place in the family for kind words.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should learn to speak more kind words.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should learn to appreciate our wives and our husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I know of some brothers who do not do well because their wives never appreciate them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The wives always think that their husbands are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They say to their husbands, Among all the brothers, you are the only useless one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These brothers become self-condemning.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They say, I cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>My wife says that I am no good.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The person who knows me the most says that I am no good.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As a result, they actually turn out to be no good.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whether or not one has a happy family life depends not only on closing our eyes to the others weaknesses, but also on finding out the other party s virtues and appreciating them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes we have to tell the other party about it or acknowledge it in public.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we do this, many problems in the family will disappear.</S>
