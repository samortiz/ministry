[1]  In Revelation 5:5-10 we see that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the Lion-Lamb.
[2]  From Revelation 5:1 through 6:1, we see the vision of Him as the Lion-Lamb in the midst of God s throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the twenty-four elders of the universe, opening the seven seals of God s universal administration.
[3]  For God s redemption, He is a Lamb; for God s kingdom, He is a fighting Lion, the Lion of the tribe of Judah.
[4]  In the Gospel of John we see that Christ came in the flesh as the Lamb of God mainly to take away the sin of the world, but in Revelation we see that Christ is the Lion-Lamb not only to take away sin but also to overcome and defeat His enemies.
[5]  2 Christ Typified by a Fighting Lion, a Resting Lion,
[6]  In Genesis 49:8-12, which records Jacob s blessing concerning Judah, there is a prophecy that Christ would come from the tribe of Judah to be a lion in order to defeat God s enemy.
[7]  People often consider that the Lord Jesus was gentle and mild.
[8]  As the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Christ overcame and defeated the rebellious Satan, the enemy of God, and as the redeeming Lamb, He took away the sin of fallen man.
[9]  When Christ ascended to the heavens, He took the scroll from God and opened the secret of the universe for the carrying out of God s administration.
[10]  In other words, as far as redemption is concerned, Christ sat down at the right hand of God in the heavens after His ascension Heb 1:3; 10:12 ; however, regarding the carrying out of God s administration, He is still standing in His ascension.
[11]  As the Lamb in His earthly ministry, Christ accomplished God s full redemption for us by being slain on the cross to die the all-inclusive death according to God s requirements of righteousness, holiness, and glory.
[12]  In Revelation 5:6 John says that the Lamb has seven horns.
[13]  Revelation 5:6 also says that the Lamb has seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
[14]  Christ as the redeeming Lamb has seven observing and searching eyes for executing God s judgment upon the universe to fulfill God s eternal purpose, which will consummate in the building up of the New Jerusalem.
[15]  Likewise, since the seven Spirits of God the Holy Spirit are the seven eyes of Christ the Son of God , the Spirit and the Son are distinct yet not separate from each other.
[16]  That Christ, the Son of God, cannot be separated from the seven Spirits of God, the Spirit, is indicated not only by the inseparability of the eyes of the Lamb from the Lamb in Revelation 5 but also by the inseparability of the living water signifying the Spirit from the smitten rock signifying the crucified Christ in Exodus 17, out of which the water flowed.
[17]  Revelation is a book of the seven Spirits, the seven eyes of Christ, whereby the redeeming, overcoming, and building Christ transfuses Himself into all His members.
[18]  While He is transfusing Himself into us, He is searching, enlightening, judging, purifying, and refining us.
[19]  Even now, Christ s burning eyes are flaming over us to enlighten, search, refine, and judge us, not that we might be condemned but that we might be purged, transformed, and conformed to His image for God s building v. 29; 12:4-5 . The Lord s judgment is motivated by love.
[20]  The Triune God is embodied in the Son and is realized and consummated in the all-inclusive Spirit, and as the seven Spirits, the intensification of the Triune God in the book of Revelation, He finalizes His New Testament economy.
[21]  On this throne there is the one God, and before this throne there are seven lamps, which are the seven eyes of God, the seven Spirits of God.
[22]  Wherever the seven Spirits look, there is blessing and there is the shining of God s lamps of fire, and wherever God s lamps of fire shine, there is the burning of the fire of God.
[23]  c The Seven Eyes of the Lamb Being Seven Lamps
[24]  The seven eyes of the Lamb as the Executor of God s New Testament economy are the seven lamps upheld by the seven lampstands, the seven churches, shining and enlightening as the testimony of Jesus Rev 1:9b, 11-12 .
[25]  In this message we will continue to consider our experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Lion-Lamb.
[26]  This scroll must be the new covenant, the grand title deed in the universe, enacted with the blood of the Lamb for God s redemption of the church, Israel, the world, and the universe.
[27]  2 Being Slain and Having Purchased for God by His Blood Men out of Every Tribe and Tongue and People and Nation and Having Made Them a Kingdom and Priests to God,
[28]  Christ s purchasing men out of these four sources indicates His purchasing them from the entire earth.
[29]  The apostle John, who wrote Revelation, was Jewish, but He confirms that Christ died on the cross to redeem men not just from the Jews but from different tribes, tongues, peoples, and nations.
[30]  In other words, the sacrifices, which are presented to God by the New Testament priests, are the Christ that is offered up, that is, the Christ experienced by us and offered up to God.
[31]  OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING,
[32]  Christ is called another Angel because He stands in the position of one who has been sent by God.
[33]  As the unique, special Angel, Christ is the One sent by God to carry out His economy.
[34]  Revelation indicates that as another Angel Christ cares for God s chosen people the Israelites , executes the prayer of the saints concerning God s economy, possesses the earth in the future, and appears in glory to make the whole earth the kingdom of God 7:2-8; 8:3-5; 10:1-5; 18:1; 11:15 .
[35]  As the Chief Shepherd 5:4 and the great Shepherd of God s flock Heb 13:20 , He will shepherd us for eternity as the Lamb of God and guide us to springs of waters of life so that we may have eternal satisfaction, without thirst or hunger Rev 7:16-17 .
[36]  In Revelation 8:3-5 Christ is presented as another Angel to execute God s administration over the earth in the way of ministering to God as the High Priest with the prayers of His saints.
[37]  Here Christ is revealed as another Angel who presents the prayers of the church to God and carries out the answers to these prayers.
[38]  The church s function is mainly to pray, call on the Lord s name, and cry out to the throne; Christ as another Angel offers all of the church s prayers to God and brings down the answer to these prayers.
[39]  Christ offers the saints prayers to God, adds Himself as the incense to the prayers, receives the answer from God, and pours the answer out upon the earth.
[40]  In the administration of God s judgment upon the earth, Christ is the Angel standing in the position of One who has been sent by God.
[41]  In the book of Revelation the incense altar is directly in front of the throne of God s authority.
[42]  According to Revelation 8, Christ as another Angel comes and adds His incense to the prayers of the saints.
[43]  This is a picture of the incense altar being the administrating throne of God for Him to execute His judgments in His administration.
[44]  It is important for us to see that the execution of God s administration is motivated by the prayers offered to Him from the incense altar.
[45]  On the other hand, with respect to God s dispensing, it is the throne of grace, the place where God dispenses His grace to people.
[46]  Following this, we have Christ in the Holy Place as the life supply, signified by the bread of the Presence; Christ as the light, signified by the lampstand; and Christ in the Holy of Holies as the embodiment of God, signified by the Ark. Finally, in the book of Revelation, a book of God s executing, we see that the divine administration, the divine executing, is always carried out by the incense altar.
[47]  In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as another Angel in Revelation 8.
[48]  Today, if we would be genuine priests, we must burn the incense.
[49]  A priest is a person who burns the incense inwardly to contact the Lord.
[50]  The proper way to pray is to apply Christ as all the offerings, to feed upon and take in Christ as our full nourishment, and then to utter something of Christ from deep within.
[51]  Sometimes we may enjoy Christ before God by reading His Word, and we may take Christ in by pray-reading the Word.
[52]  When we feed on Christ to enjoy Him and take Him in as nourishment, it is by this Christ with His redeeming blood that we can go into the presence of God.
[53]  For example, if we come together with some saints every day for half an hour to an hour to apply Christ, enjoy Christ, and express Christ corporately in our prayer to God, this will help the building up of the church very much.
[54]  Thunders, voices, lightings, and an earthquake imply the answer to the prayers of the saints, including the prayer mentioned in Luke 18:7-8.
[55]  The prayers of the saints in Revelation 8 must be for the judgment of the earth, which opposes God s economy.
[56]  To cast fire to the earth is to execute God s judgment upon the earth.
[57]  Although the sixth seal has been opened and the seven trumpets are ready to be sounded, nothing happens until Christ comes to offer the saints prayers to God with Himself as the incense.
[58]  This indicates that while God has the intention of executing His judgment upon the earth, there is still the need of the saints to cooperate with Him with their prayers.
[59]  If we read Luke 18, we will see that the Lord Jesus says that at a certain time the saints on earth will cry to God to come in to deal with the situation and to vindicate Himself.
[60]  At the end of this age, people will be so rebellious against God that some will even declare to the whole universe that they are God.
[61]  Revelation 11:15-18 and 12:10 indicate that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the eternal King.
[62]  Revelation 11:15 says, The seventh angel trumpeted; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever.
[63]  This verse indicates that after God s judgment upon the earth, the earth will be taken over by and returned to God so that Christ will reign in His kingdom on the earth forever and ever.
[64]  The kingdom of Christ will be everlasting in that it will last not only for a thousand years but for eternity without end. Therefore, the Lord s reigning forever and ever is the Lord s reigning in the millennial kingdom and in the new heaven and new earth for eternity 22:5 . He will reign as a king forever and ever.
[65]  When the kingdom of the world becomes the kingdom of Christ at His coming back Dan 7:13-14; 2:44-45 , the twenty-four elders will fall on their faces and worship God, saying, We thank You, Lord God the Almighty, He who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have reigned Rev 11:17 .
[66]  the Prophets, the Saints, and Those Who Fear His Name, the Small and the Great
[67]  In this verse the word Your refers to both Christ and God.
[68]  15, 17 ; 2 the judgment of the dead before the resurrection of the saints v. 18 ; and 3 the giving of the reward, at the judgment seat of Christ 2 Cor 5:10 , to the prophets and the saints after the resurrection and rapture of the saints 1 Cor 15:23, 52; 1 Thes 4:16-17 , and the giving of the reward, at the throne of God s glory Matt 25:31-34 , to those who fear God s name Rev 14:6-7 .
[69]  The Salvation, the Power, the Kingdom of Our God, and the Authority of Christ Having Come
[70]  In Revelation 12:5 there is the birth of the man-child.
[71]  Once he has been cast down, a loud voice will declare, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ v. 10 . Here Christ is spoken of as His Christ, the Christ of God.
[72]  To be a Christian is not only a matter of grace, enjoyment, life, and power; it is also a matter of allowing Christ to have the right to govern us, constitute us His kingdom, set up His throne, and carry out His will in us.
[73]  Then there is a loud voice in heaven saying, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ v. 10 . Hence, once God s people utter the real prayers, the result is always the ushering in of God s kingdom.
[74]  Along with our praying for the kingdom s coming, we need to fight for it.
[75]  The coming of the kingdom has two aspects: the reality of the kingdom Matt 5:3 , which is in the proper church life today Rom 14:17 , and the manifestation of the kingdom in the millennium, which will be brought in through the overcoming believers.
[76]  The phrase now has come...the kingdom of our God denotes the manifestation of the kingdom of God.
[77]  In the New Testament reality, the one hundred forty-four thousand overcomers will be the firstfruits in God s new creation offered to Him directly in the heavenly Holy of Holies for His satisfaction.
[78]  3 Having His Name and the Name of His Father
[79]  Revelation 14:1 indicates that the one hundred forty-four thousand have the name of the Lamb and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.
[80]  That these early overcomers have the name of the Lamb and the name of the Father written on their foreheads signifies that they are one with the Lamb and with the Father and that they belong to the Lamb and to the Father.
[81]  Likewise, the overcomers bearing the name of Christ, the Lamb, and His Father implies the union and mingling of the redeeming Triune God and His redeemed people.
[82]  Purchased from among men, the hundred and forty-four thousand are those who follow the Lamb absolutely and who have become the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.
[83]  In Revelation 12 the rapture of the man-child, who fights against God s enemy, is for a function before God.
[84]  God needs the man-child to be raptured to the heavens to fight the battle with His enemy so that the enemy might be defeated and cast down to the earth for the fulfillment of God s purpose.
[85]  On the one hand, the man-child fulfills God s purpose by defeating His enemy, and on the other hand, the firstfruits are for God s satisfaction.
[86]  In Revelation 14:14-16 we see that for our experience and enjoyment Christ is the Son of Man as the Reaper.
[87]  Christ will then come back with the overcomers and will reap the majority of the saints on earth as God s harvest.
[88]  The redemption was accomplished by Christ as the Lamb of God, and the wedding will take place when Christ as the coming Bridegroom takes His bride.
[89]  This corresponds to the Lord s prophecy in Matthew 26:29, which speaks of the kingdom of God the kingdom of Christ s Father in which Christ will drink with us after His coming back.
[90]  We need to pay attention to the phrase His wife has made herself ready.
[91]  In this parable the prudent virgins who took oil in their vessels who had the Spirit of God filling and saturating their souls were those who were ready and thus went in with the bridegroom to the wedding feast, into the enjoyment of the marriage dinner of the Lamb at His coming back v. 10 . This indicates that God s work throughout the generations is to build Himself into man.
[92]  The more we allow Him to work Himself into us, the more we will have the element of God and the element of heaven in us.
[93]  3 It Being Given to Her That She Should Be
[94]  Here the fine linen, which is the righteousnesses of the saints, refers to Christ lived out of us in our daily life.
[95]  This indicates that while the church is under great degradation, we should be the overcomers to live Christ and even live Him out as our subjective righteousness day by day.
[96]  In the eyes of God the fine linen is the Christ expressed in our daily life.
[97]  The righteousness we received for our salvation is objective and enables us to meet the requirement of the righteous God, whereas here the righteousnesses of the overcoming saints are subjective Phil 3:9 and enable us to meet the requirement of the overcoming Christ.
[98]  In Revelation 19:11-16 and 19-21, Christ is revealed as the Word of God King of kings and Lord of lords who returns to defeat and destroy Antichrist and the false prophet.
[99]  After His wedding feast, Christ will come as a fighting General with His bride, the overcoming believers who are His army, to fight Antichrist, the kings under him, and their armies at Armageddon.
[100]  His Eyes Being a Flame of Fire, on His Head
[101]  Revelation 19:12 goes on to say, His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems, and He has a name written which no one knows but Himself.
[102]  In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Word of God King of kings and Lord of lords.
[103]  According to Revelation 19, the church is both the bride who is presented to Christ and the warrior who fights with Him against God s enemy.
[104]  e. Out of His Mouth Proceeding a Sharp Sword,
[105]  Revelation 19:15 says, Out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword, that with it He might smite the nations; and He will shepherd them with an iron rod; and He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.
[106]  His Having on His Garment and on His Thigh
[107]  a Name Written, King of Kings and Lord of Lords
[108]  Revelation 19:16 goes on to say, He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.
[109]  After fighting all His enemies, Christ will establish the kingdom of God on the earth, the millennial kingdom, and reign with His overcoming believers for a thousand years.
[110]  Immediately after the rapture of the man-child, a loud voice in heaven says, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ 12:10 .
[111]  Revelation 20:4-6 reveals that Christ as the Establisher of the kingdom will reign with the overcoming saints.
[112]  Because the overcomers bring in the kingdom of Jesus Christ, the Lord will reign for a thousand years, and the overcomers will also reign with Christ for a thousand years.
[113]  Verse 4 also says, I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and of those who had not worshipped the beast nor his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
[114]  In Revelation 21:2 22:5 Christ is revealed as the universal and eternal Husband of the New Jerusalem, the universal and eternal wife.
[115]  The main content of the New Testament is that the Triune God has an eternal economy according to His good pleasure to dispense Himself in His life and nature into His chosen and redeemed people, thereby making them His duplication so that they may express Him; this corporate expression will consummate in the New Jerusalem Eph 3:9; 1:9-23 .
[116]  Eventually, the triune, eternal God becomes the New Jerusalem incorporated with all of us, and we also become the New Jerusalem through the process of God s organic salvation Rom 5:10 .
[117]  The ultimate consummation of God s organic salvation is the New Jerusalem the universal incorporation of the union and mingling of God with man, divinity with humanity the processed and consummated Triune God incorporated with His regenerated, renewed, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite elect.
[118]  God s New Testament economy is to make the believers God-men for the constitution of the Body of Christ so that the New Jerusalem may be consummated as the eternal enlargement and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God Gal 3:26; 4:7, 26, 31 .
[119]  The New Jerusalem is the God-men who have been transformed, glorified, and mingled with the processed and consummated Triune God John 17:22-23a; Eph 4:4-6 .
[120]  For us to be deified means that we are being constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God so that we may be made God in life and in nature to be His corporate expression for eternity Rev 21:11 .
[121]  According to its divinity, the New Jerusalem is the divine Husband the redeeming God in His consummated embodiment, Christ, with the human life and nature of God s redeemed elect.
[122]  The New Jerusalem as the bride of Christ needs to be not only consummated but also adorned v. 19 . Today we need to adorn and consummate the New Jerusalem with God the Father as its golden base, God the Son as its pearl gates, and God the Spirit as its wall of precious stones.
[123]  And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.
[124]  As the holy city of God, the New Jerusalem is sanctified, fully separated unto God, and thoroughly saturated with God s holy nature to be His habitation.
[125]  The title Jerusalem is composed of two Hebrew words Jeru meaning foundation, and Salem meaning peace.
[126]  Paul tells us in Hebrews 7 that the king of Salem is the king of peace v. 2 . Salem is peace, and Jeru is that which is founded, built, and laid as a foundation.
[127]  In the New Testament there are two titles the God of peace Phil 4:9; 1 Thes 5:23 and the peace of God Phil 4:7 .
[128]  John 1 tells us that when Peter first met the Lord Jesus, the Lord changed his name from Simon to Cephas, which means a stone v. 42 . After Peter received the revelation that the Lord was the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord said, I also say to you that you are a stone, and upon this rock I will build My church Matt 16:18, lit.
[129]  Revelation 21:9 speaks of the bride and the wife.
[130]  The bride is mainly for the wedding day, whereas the wife is for the entire life.
[131]  The New Jerusalem will be the bride in the millennium for one thousand years as one day 2 Pet 3:8 and the wife in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.
[132]  The bride in the kingdom age will include the overcomers Rev 3:12; 19:7-9 , but the wife in eternity will include all God s redeemed ones 21:9 .
[133]  Just as King Solomon became a country man to court a country girl in order to make her his queen, his duplication, God in Christ became a man to court man in order to make man God in life, nature, expression, and function but not in the Godhead, to be Christ s bride Matt 9:15; Rev 19:7; cf.
[134]  The Bible reveals that God became a man to court us and that now He wants us to court Him by our becoming divine for His expression through our personal, affectionate, private, and spiritual relationship with Him S. S. 1:1-8; 2 Cor 2:10; Exo 33:11; Rom 8:4, 6; 1 Cor 2:15 . The Shulammite is a figure of us as the reproduction of Christ, who is the embodiment of God.
[135]  In this message we will continue to consider Christ as the Husband of the New Jerusalem.
[136]  The apostles signify that the New Jerusalem, which is the building of God and the testimony of Jesus, is not of man but of God Gal 1:10-12 .
[137]  None of the apostles are of man; all are of God.
[138]  The foundation of the church life must be only of God.
[139]  If we were worthy of God s love and gift, we would qualify for God s grace.
[140]  The New Jerusalem is a city of foundations Heb 11:10 .
[141]  These are the twelve apostles of the Lamb Rev 21:14 , each of whom is signified by a precious stone.
[142]  Third, the wall of the city and its foundation are built of precious stones, signifying the Spirit s work of transforming the redeemed and regenerated saints into precious stones for the building of God s eternal habitation that they may express God corporately in His all-permeating glory.
[143]  Revelation 21:22 tells us that the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of the holy city.
[144]  The city is the aggregate of all the saints, and in the city Christ with the Lord God the Almighty will be the temple.
[145]  The Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb refers to the redeeming Triune God.
[146]  Revelation 3:12 says, He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.
[147]  The Triune God is our temple, and we are His tabernacle.
[148]  He dwells in us, and we dwell in Him, and this mutual dwelling is the New Jerusalem, which to God is the tabernacle and to us is the temple.
[149]  We enjoy a foretaste of this today when we abide in the Lord and the Lord abides in us John 15:5 .
[150]  This mutual abode will be enlarged in eternity to be the New Jerusalem where God will be our dwelling place, and we will be His dwelling place.
[151]  As believers in Christ and children of God, we human beings can dwell in a divine temple because, having the divine life and nature through regeneration, we have been made God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.
[152]  The tabernacle is built mostly with the humanity of God s people to be God s dwelling place, whereas the temple is built mostly of divinity to be the dwelling place of God s redeemed.
[153]  3 The Temple Being the House Palace of God the Father, the King of Kings, and His Many Sons, the Co-kings
[154]  These co-kings are also the priests who serve God v. 3b . Hence, they are the royal priesthood, the kingly priesthood 1 Pet 2:9 .
[155]  In Psalm 90:1 Moses says, O Lord, You have been our dwelling place / In all generations.
[156]  While Moses was traveling in the wilderness with the children of Israel for forty years, in his deep feeling he was dwelling in God.
[157]  Moses knew that God Himself is our eternal dwelling place, our eternal habitation.
[158]  When God in the Son went to the cross to die for our sins and to accomplish redemption, He was the Lamb of God taking away the sin of the world John 1:29 .
[159]  In John 4 the Lord told us that God is seeking the proper worshippers who worship Him in spirit v. 23 . In Revelation, however, John tells us that the temple in which we worship is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.
[160]  Through Him and in Him we can contact God, and in Him and through Him God can reveal Himself to us.
[161]  Outside of Christ, God s shining is a killing, but inside of Christ, God s shining is an illumining.
[162]  2 No Need for Natural Light or Man-made Light
[163]  Revelation 22:5 says, Night will be no more; and they have no need of the light of a lamp and of the light of the sun, for the Lord God will shine upon them.
[164]  The light of the holy city is the unique, eternal, divine light in which the redeemed elect live and move within the city 21:23, 25 .
[165]  First, there is the natural light, the sun and the moon, created by God.
[166]  In the new city there is no need of the sun, the natural light, or any man-made lamp because God Himself will be the light, and Christ will be the lamp, shining out God to enlighten the entire city.
[167]  God in Christ is the center of the New Jerusalem as the divine vessel.
[168]  In the picture of the New Jerusalem, the invisible God is likened to light that shines with glory Rev 21:11, 23; 22:5 .
[169]  On this throne God and the Lamb will not sit beside each other; instead, God in Christ will sit on the throne.
[170]  The fact that God in Christ is sitting on the throne means that God administrates the entire universe from within Christ and through Christ, just as the light shines from within the lamp and through the lamp.
[171]  2 The Throne Being the Center of the City
[172]  Every nation has a center, which is its capital, the place where the central government is located.
[173]  The New Jerusalem also has a center, which is the throne of God and of the Lamb Rev 22:1 , the throne of our redeeming God.
[174]  Today there are kings and queens on many thrones, but the day will come when in the entire universe there will be a central city, and the center of that central city will be the throne of God.
[175]  From the throne Christ, the redeeming God, will carry out His administration, based on His redemption, in the eternal kingdom in the new heaven and new earth.
[176]  The throne has a source, and the throne is the source; the throne has a goal, and the throne is the goal.
[177]  The throne for the accomplishment of God s eternal purpose is to flow out God Himself so that by this flow of life His purpose could be accomplished.
[178]  Although they all have God s life, the Lord Himself, and the Lord s throne, authority, and kingdom in them, many will not submit to the Lord s authority, allow the Lord to be seated on the throne within them, or allow Him to establish His kingdom and obtain His domain in their being.
[179]  Through His Son s dying for man, being raised from the dead, cleansing away man s sins with His blood, and regenerating man with His life, God brings His throne, His authority, and His kingdom into the saved ones so that they may have His authority in them and become His kingdom.
[180]  The throne of God in the center of the New Jerusalem is the unique source of the life supply.
[181]  It is by His administration that God dispenses Himself into us as life, as the life supply, and as the eternal, absolute, all-inclusive grace.
[182]  The divine authority in the church is for God to dispense Himself into us as life, as the life supply, and as the all-sufficient grace.
[183]  Revelation 22:1 says, He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.
[184]  Out of the throne of God and of the Lamb flows the river of water of life, and in this river the tree of life grows as a spreading vine.
[185]  In the flow of the living water grows the tree of life v. 2 . The tree of life fulfills, for eternity, what God intended from the beginning Gen 2:9 . The tree of life was closed to man due to his fall 3:22-24 , but it has been opened to believers by the redemption of Christ Heb 10:19-20 . Today the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life is the believers common portion John 6:35, 57 . In the millennial kingdom the overcoming believers will enjoy Christ, the tree of life, as their reward Rev 2:7 . Eventually, in the new heaven and new earth for eternity, all of God s redeemed will enjoy Christ, the tree of life, as their eternal portion 22:14, 19 .
[186]  2 The Tree of Life Being a Vine Tree
[187]  A pine grows by shooting upward into the heavens, but a vine grows by stretching forth to reach people.
[188]  Since Christ is a vine, everyone can partake of His fruit.
[189]  This vine comprises our God, our Lord, our Master, our Father, our Lord Jesus Christ, and us.
[190]  The Bible begins and ends with the tree of life as the center in order to carry out an organic union between God and us by our drinking of God as the water of life and our eating of Him as the tree of life.
[191]  Revelation 22:2 says that the tree of life produces twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month.
[192]  The fruits of the tree of life will be the food of God s redeemed for eternity.
[193]  This depicts that today our Triune God embodied in Christ is our enjoyment.
[194]  The number seven represents the church and signifies that God is added to His creature, man, in His present dispensation, whereas twelve is the number of the New Jerusalem, signifying that God is mingled with man in His eternal administration.
[195]  This is the Lord s declaration at the close of this book; it corresponds with what God declared in the opening of this book.
[196]  As the Alpha and the Omega, He is the start and the completion.
[197]  At the end of the Bible He declares Himself to be not only the Alpha but also the Omega, meaning that once He begins something, He will complete it regardless of all the frustrations.
[198]  to Render to Each One As His Work Is
[199]  In Revelation 22:12 the Lord says, My reward is with Me to render to each one as his work is.
[200]  At the Lord s coming, this reward will be rendered to each one of the believers after their rapture at the judgment seat of Christ 2 Cor 5:10; 1 Cor 4:5; Rom 14:10; Matt 16:27 .
[201]  AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION 33 B. Expressing Him
[202]  In Revelation 21 and 22 we see that we may express Christ as the lamp of the city, the light-bearer, with the glory of God as the light within Him, by which light the nations will walk.
[203]  Here we can see three layers: God is the light, Christ is the lamp, and the church the New Jerusalem is the lamp container.
[204]  This indicates that as a part of the coming New Jerusalem, we must be transformed into precious stones with God wrought into our being as the shining light so that we may be the light-bearer to shine as God s expression.
[205]  With the Glory of God as the Light within Him
[206]  In the future the unlimited glory of God will shine forth as light with Christ as the lamp in the New Jerusalem, signifying that Christ is the center of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth for all eternity.
[207]  Being illuminated by the Lord God is a blessing to God s redeemed in eternity.
[208]  God Himself will shine upon us, and we will live under His illumination.
[209]  In their relationship with God, the subjects will walk in the light of the New Jerusalem v. 24a . For their human affairs they will live under the light of the sun created by God and the lamp made by man, but in matters related to God the nations as the subjects will walk in the divine light.
