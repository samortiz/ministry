<h2 class="head2">C. Learning to Submit<br />to the Authority of the Church</h2><p>If you still feel that you are right after two or three brothers speak to you, Matthew 18 says that these brothers should take the matter to the church and let the whole church consider the matter before the Lord. If the whole church decides before God that you are wrong, what will you do? You may say, "Although the Body says I am wrong, the Head says that I am right. Though my parents forsake me, Jehovah will receive me. The brothers have rejected me, but the Lord will not reject me. I am bearing the cross." If you say this, it clearly shows that you are outside the church. You think that you are persecuted, martyred, and suffering under the hands of the brothers. But what you really have to do is learn to humble yourself and say, "If the church says so, that is it. There is no other judgment. All the brothers and sisters say that I am wrong. I am wrong even if I am right." While we are on earth today, we must learn to subject ourselves to the authority of the church.</p><p>The church on earth bears God's authority. You must never be hardened and say, "All the brothers say that I am wrong. But I insist that I am right." A proud person has no place in the church. Proud ones cannot be submissive. They do not know what the church is. When the whole church says that you are wrong, you must learn to be meek, humble, and submissive. You must acknowledge that you are wrong. Do not say that the church has no authority to do what it does. The church has the authority. God acknowledges the church's decision before Him. He also rejects what the church rejects. Do not be so obtuse as to say that you are right when all the brothers and sisters say that you are wrong. If the Lord allows them to pronounce in one accord that you are wrong, you are probably wrong.</p><p>Every child of God should learn to humble himself in the church. Sometimes one person can represent the church. Sometimes two or three can represent the church. You must learn to be meek and pliable before the Lord. Learn the lesson of submission. God's children should stand on the principle of submission. In the church we all must learn submission.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Being Subject to the Deputy Authorities<br />in the Church</h2><p>God's authority in the church is represented not only by one or two or three persons. Very often it takes the whole church to represent His authority.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Responsible Brothers Who Serve as Elders</h2><p>God shows us through the Bible that the brothers who are bearing responsibility before the Lord, who are called overseers, and who serve as the elders, are the ones who represent His authority in the church. The rest of the brothers must learn to take a submissive stand before God. God has established authorities in the church; their work is to oversee the church. All the brothers must learn to accept their judgments and submit to them.</p><p>Everywhere God's children are on earth, they should seek commandments to obey; they should seek the opportunity to submit. They should not just seek work. I often feel that many young people are of little use to the Lord, because even though they can work, they cannot submit. There are many people who cannot be submissive. If you ask how many years they have been working for the Lord, they can tell you that they have worked for ten years and have done many things. But if you ask to whom they have submitted, they may not be able to name one person. The basic principle of the church life is submission.</p><p>Everyone among us should learn submission. It is pitiful for a person to have never submitted to anyone his whole life. We must learn to submit to God, and not to Him only, but also to the authority God has appointed on earth&mdash;the church. We must submit to God's ordained authority in the church, that is, the responsible brothers. We can boast of the many years we have worked for the Lord, but we cannot boast of our obedience to the Lord. We have never been submissive to anyone. This is the basic problem and the basic challenge before us. If we consider this matter carefully before the Lord, we will realize that this kind of submission is mandatory in the church.</p>
