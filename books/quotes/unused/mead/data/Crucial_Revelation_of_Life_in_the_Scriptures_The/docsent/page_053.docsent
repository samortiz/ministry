   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN SAVED BY LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: Rom 5:10, 12, 17-19, 21; 6:4; Phil 3:10a SIN AND DEATH IN ADAM VERSUS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND LIFE IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 5 shows us two persons Adam and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The disobedience of one man is versus the obedience of the One v. 19 . Adam is the first man, and Christ is the second Man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Bible, God's desire is with the second Man, not the first man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Isaac's two sons were Esau and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God rejected Esau, the firstborn, and He loved Jacob, the second child Rom 9:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Also, the book of Exodus tells us that God's ultimate judgment on Egypt was for all the firstborn ones to be killed 11:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first represents the natural man, while the second represents the spiritual man 1 Cor 15:46-47 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We were in Adam, the first man, but now we are in Christ, the second Man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We were born in Adam, but we have been born the second time in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our first birth was of Adam, and our second birth was of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Anyone who has had only one birth has not been saved and is not of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because we have had our first birth in Adam and our second birth in Christ, we are of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to Romans 5 we inherited sin and death in Adam v. 12 . Sin brought us under God's condemnation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>16, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as we are sinful, we are condemned by God under His righteous judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Death brings us into a situation where we are absolutely unable to fulfill any of God's requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because we are dead, we do not have the ability to be humble or patient according to God's divine standard.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Romans 5 shows us that we were first under a situation in which we were condemned by God and we were also in a situation in which we were absolutely unable to fulfill God's requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thank God, however, that Christ died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His death has solved our first problem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our being under God's condemnation is now absolutely over.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But today we are still, in a sense, in the second situation of not being able to fulfill God's requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From Adam we inherited sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From Christ we received righteousness and life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>17-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Righteousness and life are the two main items we have received in and of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Righteousness is versus sin, and life is versus death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We inherited sin, but we have received righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Righteousness canceled sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We inherited death from Adam, but we have received life in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Life cancels and swallows up death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Righteousness in Christ is related to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Life in Christ is related to His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He died for our sin, and He was resurrected for us to have life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His death solves the problem of our sin, and His resurrection imparts to us His life in order to vanquish and to swallow up death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, we have been reconciled to God by His death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, we are now being saved in His life from death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Death is our problem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Having been reconciled, much more, we shall be saved in His life from death v. 10 , which is the inability and disability to fulfill God's requirements according to His divine standard.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>FREEDOM IN CHRIST VERSUS LOOSENESS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to apply this fellowship to our practical daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sloppiness, looseness, and carelessness are weaknesses, and weaknesses are different aspects of death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are sloppy, loose, and careless because we are weak, and all the weaknesses are aspects of death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may have the thought that if we could have more freedom, that would be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the kind of freedom that we desire may not actually be freedom but looseness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to differentiate freedom from looseness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Looseness is a condition of our daily life in which we cannot help ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may not be able to help ourselves get to bed at the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may not be able to help ourselves keep things in order.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we are strong and sober in our mentality, spontaneously we are not so loose.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the time comes that we need to smile, we should be able to smile.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the time comes that we need to weep, we should weep.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the time comes that we need to laugh, we should laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Looseness means that there is no control.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Looseness is death.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Freedom is not being under the bondage of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we are free, we do what we feel that we have to do.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Freedom is to laugh when we feel we have to laugh and to stop laughing when we feel that we need to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we are free, we are not under the bondage of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are able to regulate ourselves when we are enjoying real freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our being able to manage a car that we are driving means that we are driving the car in freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We can use the brakes when we have to, and we can step on the gas when we have to.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To drive in a condition of looseness would mean that the brake or the steering wheel on the car did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The real freedom in driving is that the car is absolutely under our control.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to live a sound, sober, and normal life, and that life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ is so sound, sober, normal, and strong.</S>
