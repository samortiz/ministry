   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD S RECOVERY TAKING THE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE ORGANIC BODY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christianity today is deformed and organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It forms committees to prepare budgets and raise funds to hire workers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If they cannot hire people who are trained, they send young people to seminaries for training and then assign work to them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We cannot take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord s recovery is to recover the Body of Christ; it is to recover an organism, not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have many co-workers and churches, and young people are being raised up to serve the Lord full time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have the resources, but we should not take the way of organization, that is, the way of a corporation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should take the organic way, the way of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we take the way of a corporation, we will become a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This crucial matter must be clearly presented to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must not go backward; we have only one way the way of the organic Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must advance boldly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Being organic depends mainly on the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The elders must forget that they are elders in their actions, intentions, and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The elders are not bureaucrats holding official posts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The elders exist because there is the need for arrangement in the church services to avoid confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The elders should not replace the prophets or the teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The eldership does not involve rank; it involves only responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we should not turn the function of an elder into a mere title.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>An elder is a steward who takes care of the affairs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, the elders make arrangements for different kinds of meetings, including schedules and how to lead the saints in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible clearly says that the elders should not lord it over others but should be patterns of the flock 1 Pet 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The elders should forget position and status.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They should not call themselves elders.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They should only be patterns of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way we will not repeat the mistakes of Christianity, nor will we take the way of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, we will let the Holy Spirit have the ground in us to raise up our organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In addition, the young full-timers should learn the proper way to coordinate in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their submission should involve an organic operation that is much more than their human submission to parents or teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is possible because the Triune God is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is our life and our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He can be our moment-by-moment, inward leading.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should exercise to live in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then instead of being in a religious organization, we will be living members of the living Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this way our actions will be organic functions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Otherwise, we will be merely organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should all be living members of an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All our walk and actions should issue from organic functions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>BEING ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>AND CARRYING OUT</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE ORGANIC FUNCTION OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 1 Corinthians 7:12 Paul said, To the rest I say, I, not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul boldly declared that his words in verse 12 were not the Lord s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Is his declaration organic or organizational?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to organizational thinking, the Corinthian believers could have told Paul not to speak until Christ, the Head, spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since our knowledge concerning service may not be thorough, we may have concepts that we think are spiritual but are actually organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, we may say that it is organizational to do something that the Lord has not told us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We often say that we should not take any action until we have prayed and fellowshipped thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, it seems that in 1 Corinthians 7 Paul had not prayed thoroughly, because it was he, not the Lord, who was speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Here, we have to change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul was not as spiritual as we are, nor did he pretend to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He clearly indicated that it was he, not the Lord, who was speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then in verse 25, concerning virgins, he said, I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who has been shown mercy by the Lord to be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our opinions are destructive, yet Paul gave his opinion without the Lord s commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If I said, Brothers, I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion, I am afraid that everyone would disagree with me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In 1 Corinthians 7:40 Paul said, According to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It does not seem logical that Paul could have the Spirit of God without the Lord speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, the significance of Paul s word is that we should not be organizational, nor should we say, I am doing this because the Lord said so.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Paul spoke, but not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Paul did not have the Lord s commandment, but he gave his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Paul could do this because he had the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As a person who was one spirit with the Lord, his walk was in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Since he walked in spirit, he disregarded organizational position and religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He was joined to the Lord as one, and his speaking and acting were organic functions of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Paul did not have any position, nor did he act according to religious teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Rather, he was joined to the Lord as one spirit and therefore had an organic function in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We need to have a deeper knowledge concerning spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Christianity teaches people merely to keep a position and obey orders; hence, it is organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When I speak, my whole body moves.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>No member of my body has the concept or thought of keeping a position or obeying commands.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The move of my body is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After this fellowship, we should be clear that our service is not a matter of keeping a position or obeying commands.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Our service is a matter of having the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Lord; this is to be like Paul, who said, I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we are one spirit with the Lord, instead of keeping a position or merely obeying commands, we will exercise our organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we are clear concerning this, we will be greatly blessed and not have any problems.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>At the same time, we will know our position in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We will know to whom we should listen; that is, we will listen to the organic function of the Body, and our living will be in the Body.</S>
