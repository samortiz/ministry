   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FULL-TIMERS AND PART-TIMERS BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FIRST TO OPEN THEIR HOMES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the full-timers and part-timers over thirty years old should take the lead to open their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since you serve full time, this is your occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This can be compared to owning a store; you cannot work only once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To open your store is to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the church assigns the older sisters who are full time to preach the gospel, they should first pray for people, then go and distribute tracts to their homes, and then visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In addition, they should open their own homes to preach the gospel to their neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At least four days a week we should work in our store.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not consider whether there are enough people for us to invite.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who begin a business are always full of confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Nee once told me that in order to open a store, one must have perseverance and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we can patiently persevere for three years, our store will succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we encourage all the full-timers and part-timers to open their stores and sell Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our merchandise is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are Christ stores, and we specialize in selling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should never say that we opened our store and no one came and that we should therefore close the store.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If something is being sold, there will be someone who is willing to buy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>DOING OUR BEST TO INVITE PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With regard to inviting people to our homes, we should invite whoever is available.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Luke 14:23 the Lord told us to go into the roads and hedges and compel people to come so that His house may be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that we need to go to every street and alley to compel people to come.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In America compelling is the method of a salesman.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He does not force you to buy his product.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He continues to talk until you can do nothing but buy the least expensive product so as to send him away.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a salesman is willing to do this for the sake of money, how about us who love the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Should we not be even more willing to compel others for the sake of the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should find ways to compel the people whom we invite until they have no alternative but to agree with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, we should not make them angry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we can all testify strongly for the Lord, we can bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In one year we will lead more than one person to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we labor and endeavor in this way, we will lead several people to salvation in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THOSE WHOM WE LEAD TO SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>BEING OUR JOY AND OUR CROWN</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The brothers and sisters should realize that we are in the noblest occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are giving the Lord of heaven and earth to people; we are bringing them salvation and grace, as well as life and light.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Initially, people may feel that we are bothersome, but after they believe into the Lord, they will appreciate us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only so, we should believe in the Lord s word, which says that all those whom we lead to salvation will be our crown Phil 4:1; 1 Thes 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In that day when the righteous receive a reward, many people will welcome them into the kingdom in joy Luke 16:9; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>14:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, if we never lead even one person to salvation, when the Lord comes back, no one will greet us, but others will have a group of believers, saying, We were led to salvation by this one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How shameful that will be!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some may say that it is blessed to have children, but those who have children know that our children often provoke us to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Chinese the phrase fu-chi blessed is composed of two words: fu blessing and chi anger .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we lead people to salvation, these spiritual children give us only fu blessing and no chi anger .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our children in the flesh give us both blessing and anger, but our spiritual children give us only blessing, not anger.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I rejoice that I have received the Lord s mercy to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now on all five continents there are brothers and sisters who were saved because of me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are truly my joy, and they do not provoke me to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If all the older brothers and sisters could preach the gospel full time after their retirement, they would save at least three to five people in one year.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Is such a thought not enough to make all the older brothers and sisters happy?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am very happy to see three generations of the same family in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When I was preaching the gospel in Taipei, there was a brother who was in his twenties.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When I was preaching the gospel in America, I saw him with his son, daughter-in-law, and his grandson; three generations in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Two years ago we had a big reunion in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many families of three generations attended the gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When I led them to salvation, they were still single, but now three generations are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>My heart was full of joy when I saw them, because they are blessed by the gospel I preached.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I have traveled to more than thirty countries ever since I began serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In every place I saw Chinese people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One person said he was baptized in Chefoo, and another person said he was saved through a message I gave in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Bible says, He who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together John 4:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul also says, My brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown Phil 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Those whom we lead to salvation are our joy today, and when the Lord returns, they will be our crown.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The children who are saved through us are more precious and valuable than the children of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, I encourage all the saints to bear the responsibility of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even though you do not serve full time or part time, you should try your best to preach the gospel to your acquaintances and your fellow workers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must all rise up to be active and preach the gospel in the community.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the way that we can double our number every year.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>May we all call on the Lord and pray.</S>
