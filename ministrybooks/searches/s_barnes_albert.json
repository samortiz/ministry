While writing a book on Revelation, Mr. Barnes asked a person from Rome what its most striking color was. The answer was scarlet. \u201cScarlet\u201d is the particular color of the Pope and the bishops, and among the bishops there are the cardinals. Their garments, hats, socks, chariots, etc., are all scarlet. As for the Pope, even his undergarments, vessels, and the clothing of his bodyguards are all scarlet. Whenever the Pope comes out to visit the people, they welcome him by decorating the streets with scarlet. [157] "}]}
