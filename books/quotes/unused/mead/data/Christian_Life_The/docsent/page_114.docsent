   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>AS THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT IN THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this message we want to see that the Christian life is the living of the processed Triune God as the consummated Spirit in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we know God only in an objective way, we will not know that God is the processed Triune God as the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if we have the subjective experience of God as the Spirit, we know that today God is the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may have the assurance that God is our Father and that the Spirit indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But how can the Triune God be our Father and how can the Spirit indwell us?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today we Christians have God as our Father and the indwelling Spirit because of the processes through which the Triune God passed in order to be dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit passed through the processes of incarnation and human living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order for God to be our Father and for the Spirit to be the indwelling Spirit, the Triune God needed to be incarnated and live on this earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then He had to pass through death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If He had not died for our sins on the cross, how could God be our Father and how could the Spirit come to dwell in us?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There would be no possibility of this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord went further to pass through the fourth process, the process of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the morning of His resurrection, He told one of His lovers, "Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After Christ's resurrection His Father became the Father of us, the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the evening of the day of His resurrection, He breathed into the believers and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit" John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He dispensed Himself as the Spirit into them after being processed through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through Christ's resurrection God is now our Father, and the Spirit is indwelling us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our Father is the processed Triune God, and the indwelling Spirit is the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John 7:39 says that the Spirit was not yet because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before Jesus' glorification in His resurrection Luke 24:26 , the Spirit was not yet, that is, He was not yet consummated, not yet completed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For the Spirit of the Triune God to come into us, there was the need of a consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He needed to be consummated to become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , that is, the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then this pneumatic Christ, this life-giving Spirit, could become the indwelling Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Christian life is to live the processed God as the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is according to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is the difference between us and the unbelievers?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The difference is that we, the believers, have Someone within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who is this One within us?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is the processed Triune God as the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Triune God has been processed to be the consummated Spirit to live in us, the believers in Christ.</S>
