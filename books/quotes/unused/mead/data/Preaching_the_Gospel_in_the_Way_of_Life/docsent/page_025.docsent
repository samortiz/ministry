   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX BASIC PRACTICES FOR OUR SALVATION Scripture Reading: Acts 20:21; 1 John 1:9; 3:4; 5:17a; Rom 10:9; Acts 2:38</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous message we saw that in order to receive Christ as the Savior, a person must first realize who Christ is; that is, he has to know the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Second, he needs to know the work of Christ, what Christ has done for him and for what purpose Christ died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The death of the cross is the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then he must know the salvation prepared by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Within this salvation, there are the remission of sins and the imparting of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to receive Christ as the Savior, a person also has to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not dealing with a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are not dealing with doctrines or learning teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, we are dealing with the living One who is just like the air.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to breathe Him in. We have to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Fifth, in order to contact and receive Him, we have to open ourselves to the Lord, not merely outwardly but inwardly, from the deepest part of our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may compare this to opening a window to the fresh air.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we close the window, we close off the fresh air.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to receive fresh air into a room, we have to open the window widely and thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the Spirit, just like the fresh air.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are going to enjoy Him and receive Him into us, we must open ourselves, the more the better and the deeper the better.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to realize and be clear about these five items.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are also five things that a person must practice in the process of receiving Christ as the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To receive Christ is mainly to believe in Him, but this believing includes several matters, so we may say that there is a process of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A process is one thing that includes several steps, or several points.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many Christians are short of some of these five items.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They may not be short of all five, but they may be short of one or two of them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A THOROUGH REPENTANCE TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first thing we must practice is a thorough repentance to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Repentance is the first step of our real believing, our prevailing faith in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not have a real repentance, that means our believing is not so real.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to have a real believing, a true faith in Christ, we must have a real and thorough repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The order in the Scriptures is repent and believe.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Repentance must go ahead of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Acts 20:21 says, "Solemnly testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance unto God and faith in our Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Repentance is unto God, and faith is in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Repentance unto God and living faith in the Lord Jesus are the testimony of the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Greek word for repent means a change of mind, or a turn of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Repentance is a turning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to turn, because we are away from God, and we have gone astray from God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is in one direction, but our whole life and living are in another direction.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are not toward God but against God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our whole living first includes our thinking, our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our way of thinking is not toward God; it is away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is also true of our behavior, our conduct, and our family life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is even true of our schooling, our business, and our friendships.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even our clothing and our driving are not toward God but against God, away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In almost everything of our human life we are away from God; we are not toward God but against God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The gospel of God demands that we repent, that is, that we have a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not only a left turn or right turn, but it is a U-turn.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to turn back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must point not our back but our face toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God is in one direction, but we are living and walking in another.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everything related to us is toward the wrong direction, so the more we live, the more we are away from God and the further we go astray from God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now God demands that we repent.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that we have to turn back toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is repentance toward God.</S>
