 <h2 class="head2">In the Time from the Initiation<br />
of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery among Us until Now</h2>
<p>The interpretation of the Bible advanced even more from the initiation of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery among us until now. Once Brother Nee told me that because Europe and America had been spoiled for the Lord&rsquo;s move, that forced the Lord to go to China. Brother Nee said that China at that time was &ldquo;virgin soil&rdquo; for the truth. However, the missionaries who had gone to China never helped the people there to be clear about the assurance of salvation. The assurance of salvation is clearly revealed in the New Testament, but because most of the missionaries did not know this truth, they had no way of teaching it. The Lord gave Brother Watchman Nee a clear vision of the assurance of salvation, and many were revived by his messages on this truth. The assurance of salvation was then made very clear to the Chinese believers.</p>
<p>In 1935 Brother Nee held a conference in my hometown, Chefoo, to cover the victorious, overcoming life of Christ. Before that time we were not so clear about this truth. In 1940 Brother Nee opened up the truth concerning the Body of Christ and the practical life of the church. He called this the blueprint of the practicality of the local church. I brought that blueprint back with me to northern China. As a result, there was a great revival in the church in Chefoo at the end of 1942.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Interpretation Which Began<br />
from the Trinity and Christology<br />
and Has Been Continuing until It Has Now<br />
Reached the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>In about the last thirty years, what the Lord has mainly shown to us is God&rsquo;s economy and God&rsquo;s dispensing, which consummate in the New Jerusalem. It is difficult to find anything in Christian bookstores on the truth concerning the New Jerusalem. Some wrongly believe that the New Jerusalem is a material city with real golden streets. It is difficult to find some who have a biblical view of the holy city as the wife of Christ, as the mingling of the processed Triune God with the transformed tripartite man. Many years ago, Tersteegen, a German writer, wrote something about the New Jerusalem in a proper way. About sixty years ago, Brother T. Austin-Sparks wrote something concerning the New Jerusalem. Beginning from about thirty years ago, we began to see more and more concerning the holy city.</p>
<p>We have published many messages concerning the New Jerusalem. In these messages we cover many detailed points concerning the holy city as the consummation of the divine economy and the divine dispensing. I have to give the credit to Brother Nee for what has been revealed to us. I heard him say that the New Jerusalem will be the consummation of the church. This gave me the basis for understanding the New Jerusalem. When the church is completely perfected and established, that will be the New Jerusalem. It will first appear in the thousand-year kingdom on a small scale. Then it will appear in the new heaven and new earth on the fullest scale as the consummation of God&rsquo;s saved people.</p>
<p>The interpretation of the Bible has been built up by the entire Body of Christ through the past nineteen centuries. We inherit all the interpretation of the past centuries and stand on the shoulders of the foregoing teachers. We have to thank the Lord for this. Furthermore, we have to thank the Lord that He has shown us more in the last few decades, such as the practical church life, the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound Spirit, even the seven Spirits, God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s dispensing, and the ultimate consummation of the church, that is, the New Jerusalem, the mingling of the processed Triune God with the transformed tripartite man for God&rsquo;s eternal manifestation and expression.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF THE SPREADING<br />
OF THE UNDERSTOOD DIVINE TRUTHS<br />
FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY AND RESTORATION</h2>
<p>Today there is the need of the spreading of the understood divine truths for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and restoration. We can borrow Romans 10:14-15 and say, &ldquo;How shall people hear without one who spreads? How beautiful are the feet of those who spread the interpreted and understood divine truths!&rdquo; If we have a burden to go to Europe, we must spend day and night to study the truths we have published. Then we will know what the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is, and we will have a real burden to go to Europe to teach people. The Lord charges us in Matthew 28:19 to go and disciple the nations. The Lord&rsquo;s word here shows us that we should be burdened to go and teach all the nations.</p>
<p>There is the need of the spreading of the translated, interpreted, and understood truths for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and restoration. The Lord does everything by speaking. If there is no speaking of the Lord, there is no work of the Lord. There cannot be a recovery in Europe if there is not the speaking of the divine truths. Most of the millions of people in Europe are void of the knowledge of these divine truths.</p>
<p>The spreading of the divine truths will bring in the Lord&rsquo;s restoration. According to Isaiah 11, the restoration will come because &ldquo;the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, / As the waters cover the sea&rdquo; (v. 9). We have to speak for the Lord to bring in this restoration. How shall people hear without one who spreads the divine truths? How beautiful are the feet of those who spread the interpreted and understood divine truths!</p>
<p>This is why we have to study these truths. Otherwise, we are not qualified to go to Europe. We should not go to speak to people in a superficial way. We may be able to speak John 3:16 to people: &ldquo;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.&rdquo; However, if someone asks us what eternal life is, we may not be able to tell them. It is possible to give fifteen messages on John 3:16. The first message can be concerning who God is, the second message can be on love, and the third message can be on the world. Then we can tell people how God gave His Son. God did not drop His Son down from the heavens to the earth. He gave His Son through incarnation. Then another message can be given on the only begotten Son. More can be said about what it means to perish and what it is to have eternal life. Message after message can be given on John 3:16.</p>
<p>We are not going there to preach to people in the traditional way, but to talk to them about all the divine truths. Through our speaking, some will be solidly saved. If we speak the deeper truths in John 3:16 to them, they will never forget this verse. May the Lord burden us to learn the divine truths and to spread them everywhere for His recovery and restoration.</p>
