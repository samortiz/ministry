   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECOND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 15:47 says, The second man is the Lord from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here we see that Christ is the second man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the eyes of God there are just two men: the first man, Adam, and the second man, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no third man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a man, Christ came to be the second man so that there could be a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first man was rejected by God, but the second man is acceptable to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although we were born into the first man, we have been reborn into the second man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Naturally, we were born in Adam, but spiritually we were reborn in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hallelujah, we are no longer in Adam, the first man, but in Christ, the second man!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE LAST ADAM</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Corinthians 15:45 says that Christ is the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that He is the last One and that no one succeeds Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is not only the second man, but also the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the second man it may seem that there could be a third man or a fourth man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But because Christ is also the last Adam, we know that no one will come after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is also our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to John 4:42, He is spoken of as the Savior of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our Savior is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is also a man by the name of Jesus Matt 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was a Nazarene, and He grew up in the home of a carpenter Matt 2:23; 13:55 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When He was full-grown, He Himself also worked as a carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is also the Christ, God s anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As Jesus, He is our Savior, and as Christ, God s anointed One, He accomplishes God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is both Jesus and the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The man Jesus is also the Lord Acts 2:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many Christians are not clear concerning the two aspects of Christ as the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because Christ is God, the Creator, He was the Lord before He came as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day, He was born as a man named Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How could this man, a Nazarene, be the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Acts 2:36 says that after Jesus was resurrected and ascended, God made Him the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As God, Christ was the Lord already; but as a man He still needed to be made the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, after Jesus ascended into the heavens, God appointed Him to be the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now the Lord is not only God, but also a man, the man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Peter s word in Acts 2:36 was spoken to the opposing Jews, the very ones who had crucified Jesus on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although they had crucified Him, God resurrected Him from the dead, placed Him on the throne, and proclaimed to the whole universe that He, the man Jesus, is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today a man is on the throne to be the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE PROPHET</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Acts 3:22 reveals that Christ is a Prophet, One who speaks for God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was typified by Moses, who spoke to the children of Israel for God Deut 18:15, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ spoke to His disciples for God when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today He still speaks within us for God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE APOSTLE</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ is also the Apostle.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE PRIEST</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hebrews 3:1 also indicates that Christ is the Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As the Apostle, Christ comes from God to us, and as the Priest, He goes from us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hallelujah, Christ is both the coming One and the going One!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He comes with God to us, and He goes with us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>THE KING</S>

   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This should not merely be doctrine; every item must be our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Have you ever experienced Christ as your Prophet, Apostle, Priest, and King?</S>
