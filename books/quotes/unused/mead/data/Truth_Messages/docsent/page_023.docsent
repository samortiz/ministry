   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCEPT THE ENTHRONEMENT OF SELF-EXALTATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our concept is the expression and enthronement of our self-exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concept is the enthronement of the self exalted as a little king.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should never regard a concept as an insignificant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even the sisters of high school age enthrone themselves as queens whenever they express their concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To kill our concepts therefore is to dethrone the self.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The whole world is divided by concepts; hence, concepts are the factors of division.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Self-exaltation comes from ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all are ambitious and self-exalting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The only difference among us in this matter is degree.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ambition is in our very blood.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Self-exaltation issues from our ambition and is embodied in our concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When our concepts are expressed, the result is division.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the evil in John 17.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The evil is the world with its ambition, self-exaltation, and concepts, all of which produce division.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>WHAT THE WORLD REALLY IS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We Christians often talk about the world, but we may not always realize what we are talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Worldliness does not only involve superficial matters such as buying a certain style of clothing at a department store.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This understanding of the world is very shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The world is constituted of ambition, self-exaltation, and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When these three things result in division, the world becomes the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps you have never before realized that the world includes your ambition, your self-exaltation, and your concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In his translation of the New Testament, Wuest uses the term Pernicious One with respect to Satan, denoting that which is poisonous and damaging.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The entire world, including Christianity, is pernicious; it is full of the poison of ambition, self-exaltation, and concepts and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Throughout the centuries, Christians have been divided by concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These concepts come from self-exaltation, which in turn issues from ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the eyes of God the world is constituted of ambition, self-exaltation, and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to delve into John 17 to find out what the world really is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The world is not merely certain modern fashions; it is ambition producing the self-exaltation that culminates in concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This brings about division, which is the evil, the pernicious thing on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>NO AMBITION IN THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because this pernicious poison is still in us, we need to see how to extract it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the previous message we saw that we need to move out of ourselves and into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to be one, we need to be saved from worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No matter how gentle or meek we may be, in ourselves we are still ambitious.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when we move out of ourselves and into the Triune God, into the Us John 17:21 , our ambition is swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Triune God there is no room for ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the universe there is just one place where there is no ambition, and that place is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To the Triune God, ambition is a foreign element.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to my experience, I can testify that the only way to be free from ambition is to move out of ourselves and into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord s word in verse 21 implies dealing with ambition by being in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>During the past several months, I have been very exercised regarding the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I began to research the Word again concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first thing I saw was the matter of worldliness in John 17:14-19.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then I realized that ambition is implied in verse 21, in the Lord s word about being in Us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I saw that we need to move out of ourselves and into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here in the Triune God there is room for us, but there is no room for our ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>NO SELF-EXALTATION IN THE FATHER S GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>John 17:22 says, And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The glory in this verse refers to the expression of the Father, to the sonship with the Father s life and nature to express the Father in His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This glory is not only for the future; it is with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we express the Father in His life and nature with all His fullness, we are in the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this glory there is no possibility of self-exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Self-exaltation is versus the Father s glory, the Father s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we express the Father, we do not exalt ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Self-exaltation and the glory of the Father are in two different realms.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Self-exaltation is in the realm of the self, and the expression of the Father is in the realm of His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the Father s kingdom there is no self-exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today s Christianity is filled with human exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As a result, there is none of the divine glory, no expression of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to pray, Lord, have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Your church we cannot tolerate self-exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Lord, we want to express You, not ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the church we want to see the expression of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We don t want any man to be exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Just as verse 21 implies the matter of ambition, verse 22 implies the matter of self-exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Self-exaltation is like a ferocious beast that is crouching as it awaits an opportunity to attack us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In recent years there has been such a crouching self-exaltation among us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This self-exaltation has caused division.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Wherever a certain self-exalting one went, there was no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The peace in many local churches was shattered by this self-exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This even divided elders in some churches from each other so that a certain one alone could be exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the opposite of the oneness in John 17, a oneness that is versus evil.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Praise the Lord for clearing up the situation!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now we can proclaim that we are no longer in the evil, but we are in the pure and genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are in the Triune God, where there is no ambition; and we are in the glorious expression of the Father, where there is no self-exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Now only one person the Lord Jesus is on the throne to express the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although we reject self-exaltation, we believe in our co-enthronement with our King to express our Father in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Here we enjoy the sonship in the Father s life and nature with His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>What an enjoyment we have!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There is no need for us to strive, endeavor, maneuver, or manipulate.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We are not wolves or donkeys ; we are lambs and doves who enjoy being in the Triune God and in the glory of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Because there are no wolves or donkeys among us, we can have the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Whenever someone exalts himself, his wolf nature is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Self-exaltation has nothing to do with the nature of a lamb or a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Praise the Lord that we are lambs and doves !</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In these days I am very happy to be a little one.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>How sweet it is to be small!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We all need to have a new appreciation for smallness.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Are you willing to be small for the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In our smallness there is the expression of the Father s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>NO OPINIONS WHEN CHRIST LIVES IN US</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Verse 23 says, I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This verse refers to Christ living in us Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When Christ lives in us, we have no concepts or opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Ambition is implied in verse 21; self-exaltation, in verse 22; and concepts and opinions, in verse 23.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In ourselves it is impossible for us to be free from concepts and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The source of friction in married life is our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If a married sister would not express her opinion to her husband, there would be no arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Separations and divorces are caused by opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Likewise, Christians are divided today because of concepts and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Only when Christ lives in us is it possible for us to have no opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>When Christ lives in us, our opinions and concepts are put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In the Triune God there is no ambition, in the glory of the Father there is no self-exaltation, and in the place where Christ lives and reigns there are no opinions and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In this realm ambition is swallowed up, self-exaltation disappears, and concepts and opinions are killed.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Here there is no evil; instead, there is the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Now we can see that the genuine oneness is versus evil.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We need a oneness that is so genuine, real, and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>EXPERIENCING THE GENUINE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In order to have this oneness, we need to move out of ourselves and into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We also need to express the Father s glory and allow Christ to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Then we shall have the genuine oneness which is versus evil.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>But if we remain in ourselves, we shall have the ambition that issues in the self-exaltation which is enthroned in our concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The result is division.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Where there is such division, the church becomes the world.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>When the evil is present, we can scarcely see the church.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>What we see is mainly the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>This is why we have recently been saying that we must purge out the leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The leprosy is this evil constituted of ambition, self-exaltation, and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>If we would purge out the evil, the leprosy, we must do more than repent.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Repentance is good, but as far as this evil is concerned, it is too superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>In addition to repentance, we need to move out of ourselves and into the Triune God and remain in Him for the expression of the Father s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We need to allow this glory to swallow up our self-exaltation so that Christ can live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>When Christ lives in us, all our concepts will be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Then, instead of evil, we shall have the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>This oneness is what the Lord desires; it is the well-pleasing will of God Rom 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>It is also the real building.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>The building is possible only in the Triune God, and it is prevailing only when Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Hallelujah, now we are in the Triune God, and we are allowing Christ to live in us!</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Now we can express the glory of the Father and experience the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>May we all bring this word to the Lord in prayer.</S>
