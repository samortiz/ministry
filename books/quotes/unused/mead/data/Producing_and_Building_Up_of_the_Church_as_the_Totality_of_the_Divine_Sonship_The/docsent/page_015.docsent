   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING NOURISHED WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR OUR ORGANIC, METABOLIC TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will consider the crucial transforming work of the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some of the great Christian teachers of the past spoke concerning the indwelling of Christ, but very few touched the matter of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is regrettable that the King James Version renders the Greek word in 2 Corinthians 3:18 as changed rather than as transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Transformation includes change, but it is not merely a change.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse says, We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The same Greek word is used in Romans 12:2, which says, Be transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Transformation is an inward metabolism that produces an organic change by the addition of another element.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may illustrate this by considering a person s complexion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A mortician may apply a cosmetic to the face of a dead person to improve his appearance, but this produces only an outward change, not an inward organic metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Attempting to change people by giving them religious and ethical teachings is like the work of a mortician in his attempt to beautify corpses.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Teaching husbands to love their wives and wives to submit to their husbands in an ethical way is like adding color to a dead person s face.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It does not produce transformation by an inward metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The way of metabolism is to supply a sick or weak person with an organic, nourishing element.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The work of a mortician can be accomplished quickly, but the metabolic way requires at least three meals a day for a certain amount of time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Cantonese, for example, eat seven times a day, taking smaller portions in a greater number of meals.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we feed a sick person healthy food, after a certain amount of time a metabolic change will take place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The sick person will have rosy cheeks, not through an outward work of beautification but by an inward work of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Adding a nourishing element to a dead person will not cause a metabolic change to take place, but when we, as organic, living persons, receive a nourishing element into our body, there is an organic reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This causes a change not from the outside but from within.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This organic change is a picture of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word that the apostle Paul used transformed indicates that the indwelling Christ is the nourishing element that is being added into us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever we say, O Lord Jesus, Christ is added into our being, even if we do not realize it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To call on the Lord in this way is like breathing the air, which causes the element of oxygen to be added to our physical body to make us living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The genuine experience of transformation is not a superstition; it is very real because Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is real, living, and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is difficult to speak these things in Christianity because of the situation there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once I was invited to speak to some Brethren assemblies in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I told them that what we need is not teaching but the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Regardless of how much knowledge we have concerning Christ, it cannot save us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Merely gaining knowledge is like studying a recipe or a menu without eating anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In my speaking I was telling the believers in those assemblies to put away the recipes and the menus and take some healthy food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, those who heard this kind of word were offended, and they opposed my teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To merely learn something is the way of religion, which is composed of teachings with forms, rituals, and practices.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we speak against the traditional way of religion, we are condemned for teaching heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Throughout the past centuries many Christians have come to the so-called Sunday morning service simply to sit in pews silently and in a good order.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the way of dead religion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We do not need to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, we need to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should begin the meetings while we are still at home, and while we are on the way to a meeting, we can say, Praise the Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hallelujah, Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we arrive at the meeting, we can continue to sing and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not need to wait for the scheduled meeting time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As soon as we arrive, we should join the other saints in praising the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more we sit passively and wait for the scheduled meeting time, the more we will be deadened, but the more we come to the meetings in the way of shouting, praising, and saying Hallelujah, the more we will be nourished with the living oxygen.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not a matter of religion; it is a matter of eating and drinking to take the living Jesus into us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the past the singing, praising, and shouting in our meetings began an hour before the scheduled meeting time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even without hearing a message, everyone was nourished by eating, drinking, and breathing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After every meeting we returned home nourished and filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We do not need anyone to remind the husbands in a religious way to love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we have the living Jesus within us, He will overflow His love not only to our wife but also to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We will be full of love.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are short of love, someone may charge us to love our wife, but the more we exercise to try to love, the more we will not have love.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Eventually, we may even become angry with our wife.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, after attending one meeting, we will be filled with love.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then everyone will be lovable to us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Transformation spontaneously takes place by the element of Christ being added and wrought into our organic being.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many brothers and sisters in the church have received a certain amount of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At first some of the relatives of the saints opposed the church, but eventually they turned this way because they saw the transformation in their family members.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ as the indwelling One adds and imparts Himself into us when we open to Him by praising Him and calling, O Lord Jesus, praise You!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Opening to the Lord to take Him into us is like opening ourselves to the fresh air for all the riches in the air to come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We all, especially the young people, should be beside ourselves to call on the Lord and to sing, praise, and shout Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the earlier days of the church, when we first began to call on the name of the Lord, some were opposed to this way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Gradually, however, the husbands began to say, Hallelujah, the wives followed the husbands, and the children followed to say, Praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This added more of the element of Christ into the members of those families, and eventually they all received a certain amount of organic transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Something of life was added into their being, causing an organic change in them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the way that Christ works Himself into our being through His indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I was born into Christianity, and I passed through formal, fundamental, inner-life, and even Pentecostal Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Through all my experiences I can say that the simplest way is to forget all the wrong things we picked up in religion.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Those ways do not work.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We simply need to turn to the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must all realize that the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ is in us; hence, He is now the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Everything is in Him as the all-inclusive dose.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we need the killing element, it is in Him, and if we need the nourishing and equipping element, it is also in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Every element is in the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We do not need to understand everything.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We may not understand oxygen, but we do not need to know much about oxygen.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We simply know that as human beings, we need oxygen, and because of this we breathe it in. Christ is richer, more living, and more real than oxygen.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We cannot understand Christ thoroughly, but we do know that He is in us, and we know that He is rich and real to us whenever we say, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Praise You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You are so good.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>To say Praise You, Lord a few times is better than to be taught in a religious way many times.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is what we mean when we say that Christians do not need mere doctrinal teachings; rather, they need to eat, drink, and breathe Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Eating, drinking, and breathing Jesus, the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and indwelling One, is the way to be transformed.</S>
