   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH IN SMYRNA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second epistle is to the church in Smyrna, the church under the suffering of persecution 2:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word Smyrna in Greek means myrrh, and myrrh in figure signifies suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This church represents the second stage of the course of the church from the latter part of the first century to the time that Constantine became emperor.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>History tells us that during this period the Roman Empire persecuted the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Fox s Book of Martyrs contains many stories of their suffering under persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I encourage the young brothers and sisters to read it; the accounts in it are very inspiring and very strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One account is the story of Polycarp, an elderly brother.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When arrested by the authorities and urged to renounce Christ, he answered, Eighty and six years have I served Him, and He never once wronged me; how then shall I blaspheme my King, who has saved me?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The persecution by the Roman Empire reached such an extent that the authority of the city of Rome asked the Caesar not to kill any more Christians lest all the citizens of that city be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By this he meant that the more they killed the Christians, the more others were becoming Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church in Smyrna received no rebuke from the Lord, only encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord told this church that He is the First and the Last, who became dead and lived again v. 8 . He is the One who was put to death by persecution but now is living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The suffering church must know the Lord as the resurrection and the resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nothing can hold the resurrection life, not even death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This resurrection life is within the suffering church, so the church must experience Christ as resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The reward to the church in Smyrna is the crown of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not only the tree of life but the crown of life will be a reward to the suffering church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This period in the history of the church has now been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE CHURCH IN PERGAMOS A Union with the World</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The third epistle is to the church in Pergamos 2:12-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this epistle we can see a great change in the nature and form of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to history, Pergamos represents the stage of the church beginning at the time that Constantine made Christianity the state religion and encouraged people to become professing Christians, causing the church to change its nature and form.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word Pergamos in Greek has two meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first is marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A marriage is a union.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At this time the church became united with the world, becoming a worldly church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church married the world and joined to it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The second meaning of Pergamos is fortified tower.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At that time the church became something high on the earth, a high tower, not something low.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Constantine came into Christianity, made it the state religion, and encouraged people to come into it, he made it something great.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was the fulfillment of the parable of the mustard seed in Matthew 13:31-32, in which a little herb became a big tree, like a high tower.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Teaching of Balaam</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the church in Pergamos there were two things which are evil before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First there was the teaching of Balaam Rev 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Balaam was a Gentile prophet who taught Balak the king to cause the people of God to commit fornication and worship idols Num 22:4-6; 25:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The time that Constantine came into Christianity was the start of the teaching of the heathen prophet, the teaching of heathenism.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This caused the church to commit spiritual fornication by joining to the world and to worship idols.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was evil to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Teaching of the Nicolaitans</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The second evil matter in Pergamos was the teaching of the Nicolaitans Rev 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the initial stage, the church in Ephesus had only the works, the activities, of the Nicolaitans v. 6 , not yet the teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, by the third stage of the church the works of the Nicolaitans had become the teaching of Nicolaitanism.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By a thorough study of history we can realize that the teaching of the Nicolaitans is the teaching of the clergy-laity system, the teaching of the hierarchy, the holy order.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Greek word for Nicolaitans means subduing the common people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The so-called clergy, the hierarchy, subdues the other people in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the ancient time, after the people of Israel were delivered out of Egypt, God declared that they were a kingdom of priests Exo 19:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, due to the failure of the people of Israel in worshipping the golden calf at Sinai, only one tribe out of the twelve tribes became priests.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Originally, God ordained that the whole nation of Israel would be a kingdom of priests, but due to that failure only one tribe became the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These priests became an intermediary class between God and the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This became the system of the priesthood in Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The New Testament, however, tells us clearly that all the believers are priests of God 1 Pet 2:5, 9; Rev 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the genuine believers, who have been redeemed by the blood of Christ, are priests.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is no intermediary class between the believers and God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the believers are on the same level, have the same rank, and are in the same class.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is no clergy, no laity, no hierarchy, and no intermediary class.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nevertheless, at the end of the time of the apostles some rose up to be the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The epistle to the Ephesians says that the church there hated the works of the Nicolaitans 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although by that time those practices had already begun, it was not yet a teaching, but in the third stage of the church those works became a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This was completely fulfilled in the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After Constantine made Christianity the state religion, thousands of unregenerate people were baptized into Christianity as members.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They were not regenerated; they did not have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They did not have the Holy Spirit, and they were not the living members of Christ s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, they did not know how to function, and they were not able to function, so some began to teach that certain persons should be trained to be the clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A small number were trained to be the priests, the clergy, while the vast majority of the nominal Christians took care of their worldly living.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It was in this way that the intermediary class of the clergy came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is something very evil in the Lord s eyes, and it must be overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Today we must recover the universal priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Every Christian must be a functioning member and a serving priest.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the church there must be no class, or we may say, there must be only one class not clergyman or layman but brother.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some people today speak of a lay ministry or lay preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, we are neither clergymen nor laymen; we are the priests and the members.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are all members of the Body of Christ, and we are all priests of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Enjoying Christ in a Hidden Way</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the epistle to the church in Pergamos the Lord promises to give the hidden manna to the one who overcomes v. 17 . This corresponds with the parables in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Pergamos was a fortified tower, like the great tree in Matthew 13:31-32, in which everything was exposed for outward show.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In principle, however, the precious things are hidden v. 44 . In this age Christ is the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Therefore, we must be the hidden church.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must learn to be hidden and not exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should not advertise ourselves in a worldly way.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>To do so is to be married to the world and commit spiritual fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is not only to have idol worship but to become an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must learn to be hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Since this is the age for Christ to be hidden, we as His Body must also be hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Then we will enjoy Him as the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The more we are hidden, the more we will experience Christ as the hidden One and experience the white stone Rev 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>White in Revelation signifies being justified, approved, and accepted by the Lord 3:4-5, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should not try to be accepted or admired by people.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must not be afraid to be criticized and persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Rather, we should try to be justified and accepted by the hidden Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When we become the hidden ones, we sense the Lord s hidden approval.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Upon the white stone is a name which the Lord gives.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This name is known only by us and the Lord; no one else knows it because it is a secret.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We need to have secret, hidden experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Then there will be something secret between us and Him.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>While the entire Christianity is married to the world and has become a great tree, a high tower, we must be hidden hidden from the great tree, hidden from the high tower, hidden from spiritual fornication, and hidden from idol worship.</S>
