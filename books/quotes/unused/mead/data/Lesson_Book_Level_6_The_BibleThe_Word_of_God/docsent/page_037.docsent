   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Text</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the next four lessons, we will talk about fourteen key topics of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because the Bible is so long, it is helpful to know the key topics of the Bible in order to better understand what you are reading.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some of these topics were covered in earlier lesson books.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The topics addressed in these lessons are not covered in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you wish to know more about salvation, God, Christ, the Spirit, the human spirit, eternal life, and the church, you may study the previous lesson books in this series.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I. GOD</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is the foremost item revealed in the Bible because He is the beginning of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everything in the universe originated from Him and began with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is also the main content of the Bible from its first book to the last.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He created us and regenerated us and has everything to do with our life and our being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, we should know Him first.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A. The Unique True God</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Scriptures in many instances and in many ways tell us that God is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Both in the Old Testament and in the New, there are many passages which clearly and definitely tell us that God is only one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First Corinthians 8:4 says, There is no God but one, and Isaiah 45:5 says, I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God besides Me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>B. Elohim the Faithful Mighty One</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Genesis 1:1 says, In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here in Hebrew, the word for God is Elohim.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the first divine title used in the Bible to reveal God, and it means the faithful mighty One.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It shows that the true God, whom we worship according to the Bible, is not only mighty but also faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is the mighty One; so He could create the heavens, the earth, all things, and mankind, calling what is not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is faithful; therefore, He is dependable, ever unchanging, and immovable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His works according to His faithfulness are as enduring as the sun and as established as the moon Psa 89:33-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>C. Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>the Self-existing and Ever-existing I Am</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Exodus 3:14, God said that He is the I Am that I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here God told Moses in plain words that His name is Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The name Jehovah is the second main divine title used by the Bible in revealing God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It means the self-existing and ever-existing I Am, the I Am who was, who is and who is to come.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It indicates that He is the I Am, and besides Him nothing is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only He is, and He is the self-existing and ever-existing I Am, who was, who is, and who is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, everything in the entire universe is vain and is not; only He is, only He exists forever, and only He is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is everything to the people whom He created and who belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whatever they need, He is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>D. The Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible reveals that God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a revelation of great importance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is uniquely one, and His name is Jehovah; yet this God is also triune He is the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a mystery; in fact, it is a mystery of mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Matter of</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>the Father, the Son, and the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord says in Matthew 28:19, Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord here clearly speaks of Three the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But when He speaks here of the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit, the name which is used is in the singular number in the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that though the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three, yet the name is one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is really mysterious one name for Three.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This, of course, is what is meant by the expression three-one or triune.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All Being God</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Father is God 1 Pet 1:2; Eph 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Son is God Heb 1:8; John 1:1; Rom 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Spirit is God Acts 5:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Scriptures clearly reveal to us that all Three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This does not mean, however, that they are three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have already seen that the Scriptures tell us clearly and definitely that God is only one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although there are three the Father, Son, and Spirit yet the Three are not three Gods, but one.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is really a mystery!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is unsearchable!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But praise the Lord, we can simply receive and enjoy this mysterious One according to what the Scriptures have said!"</S>
