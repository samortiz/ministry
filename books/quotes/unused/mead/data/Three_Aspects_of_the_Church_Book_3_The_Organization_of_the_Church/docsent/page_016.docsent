   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE PRACTICE OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH 3 Proving an Apostle</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The most difficult matter in regard to the organization of the church is the offices.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For the past two thousand years, there have not been many problems in regard to the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because gifts are spiritual abilities, it is easy to tell whether or not someone has them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is little ground for dispute.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Consequently, most of the disputes are concerning offices.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Offices are a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be an apostle, an elder, or a deacon is a matter of appointment, that is, a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the appointment of apostles is very different from the appointment of elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whereas the appointment of apostles does not involve human hands, the appointment of elders and deacons passes through human hands and thus involves the element of man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Bible there is no record of people questioning the authority of elders and deacons, but there is a record of them questioning the authority of apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no need to try, or prove, the office of the elders and deacons; however, there is a need to try the apostles Rev 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not difficult to prove the office of the elders and deacons, but it is difficult to prove the office of apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Over the past two centuries some in the church have said that since there is no way to confirm the apostles, there is also no way to confirm the elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If it were not possible to prove the office of the apostles, they felt that they had sufficient grounds to say that neither can the office of the elders and deacons appointed by apostles be confirmed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They felt that there should be no elders and deacons but only responsible brothers, since apostles are no longer with us and the apostolic age is over.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Consequently, they called the elders responsible brothers and the deacons serving brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that the source of the problem lies with the office of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since the appointment of apostles is entirely of God and does not pass through human hands, it is invisible and difficult for man to perceive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even until today, we must confess that the confirmation of apostles is still a problem; however, if we were not so influenced by the background of degraded Christianity, this matter would not be difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I hope that we can empty ourselves of the influence of this background and return to the Bible to consider the matter of apostleship with a simple mind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Apostles Having the Authority of God</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First Corinthians 12:28 says, God has placed some in the church: first apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not think of an apostle as being an extraordinary person, or that only people like Paul, Peter, and Timothy are worthy to be called apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a concept is inaccurate.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Apostles are not extraordinary people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are merely people whom God has sent and to whom He has given authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Of course, a person cannot send another to do something for him unless he gives the person he is sending a certain amount of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even if the sender sends him to do a very small thing, the sender must at least give him a small amount of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a person goes out to work for the Lord and his going is truly of the Lord, he will have the Lord s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, if he is sent out by men, not by the Lord, and if his going out is of himself, he will not have the Lord s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whether a worker is an apostle and has the Lord s authority are not matters which can be determined outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before the Lord, a worker must ask, Am I sent by the Lord to do the work, or am I sent by men?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Is my work based on the Lord s desire or on my own preference?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These questions must be answered before the Lord in a person s inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Likewise, we must use our spirit to discern whether or not another person is an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Inwardly we must ask, Does this one who serves the Lord come from the Lord or does he come of himself?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Is he doing the work according to the Lord s desire or according to his own zeal?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must use our spirit to answer these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we acknowledge that a worker is from the Lord and that the Lord desires that he do the work, we must also acknowledge that he has authority.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we acknowledge that he is a worker sent by the Lord, that he is of the Lord, and that his work is according to the Lord s desire, we cannot deny that he has authority.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not possible to determine a person s apostleship merely according to outward factors.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul said to the Corinthians, If to others I am not an apostle, yet surely I am to you 9:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The principle in this verse is that Paul was an apostle to a certain group of believers, the Corinthians, but not necessarily to believers among whom he had not labored.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the Lord did not send him to work among a particular group, he would not have had the Lord s authority among them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For instance, although I am master of my house, I am not master of another person s house.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In other words, although I may be an apostle in a certain place, when I go to another place, I may merely be a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am not an apostle to a certain place, nor do I have authority in that place if the Lord has not sent me to work there.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I dare not assert that Paul was not an apostle to the churches in Judea, but I am sure that in the Gentile churches he had authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He may not have had authority in the churches in Judea, because the Lord had not sent him to work among the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, the Gentile churches accepted Paul as an apostle because God had sent him to work among the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, for a person to determine whether or not he is an apostle, he must examine himself by asking, Am I doing this work out of myself, or have I been sent by God?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Likewise, regarding whether a person is an apostle to us, we must ask ourselves, Am I under the work that he has been sent by God to do?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we are under this work, we must receive the authority of the one sent to carry out the work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot accept only the work and not the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For example, when I am enrolled in a certain school, I have to accept the authority of the school.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In a sense, the matter of the apostleship is not too difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>An apostle is not an extraordinary person in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is only one great and extraordinary person in the church; He is our Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Besides Him, there is no other great or extraordinary person.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All men are from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If there is a work that enables us to know the Lord, we have to humble ourselves and say, The Lord s authority is here.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We cannot accept a work yet reject the authority of the worker.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is not a single work that is without an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is true not only in regard to the work of the Lord but also in regard to the work of men.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If I were to ask a cook to buy some food, I would have to give him some authority.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Without authority, he would not be able to do the work.</S>
