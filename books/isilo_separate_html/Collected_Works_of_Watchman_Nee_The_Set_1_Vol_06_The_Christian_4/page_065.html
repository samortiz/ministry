They are all looking for help. We also see many brothers and sisters who trust in God for their living. Although they are never starved, they are often in danger of having an empty balance in their account. In addition, there are brothers who desire to live by faith. However, the absence of proper means discourages them from living this kind of life. Does the Word of God tell us of any way in which God's children can free themselves from want? The answer is "yes."</P><P>The reason believers are in want is that many times they have too much in excess and forget to give to others. As a result, no one gives to them. The greatest reason, though I dare not say the unique reason, for want among the believers is their refusal to give. The principle taught in the Bible is, "Give, and it will be given to you" (Luke 6:38). It is not only to receive, but to first give and then receive. When we are in want, we hope to receive from man or God. But God's command is to "give." We should not only give when we are rich or when we have a surplus, but at the very time when we need others to give to us. The more we are in want, the more we should give. The more we hope to receive help from others, the more we should render help to others. If we truly walk according to the promise of this verse, we will truly see God's promise fulfilled in us. During the past few years while I have been serving the Lord, He constantly reminded me of this verse. "Give" to others, and it will be given to me. This is my principle of financial planning. This is my theory of economics. When I had the most need and could not make ends meet, I remembered the teaching in this verse. I came before the Lord and asked what I should give to others. As soon as He gave the word, I obeyed. Soon I found Him meeting my needs through men's hands. Today, in retrospect, I can truly say that this verse can be fully trusted. The strange thing is that the time I offered the most was actually the time when I was most in want. Yet God always returned to me tenfold and a hundredfold what I put out. Every time I put out something, I would reckon at the end of the month what God gave to me. The marvelous thing was that He always gave and gave to my abundance. I can testify that whenever I practiced Luke 6:38, God never once wronged me.</P><P>Some wonder how I could have so much money to give to others. They wonder if the Lord has special grace for me. They do not realize that the times when I gave the most away were actually the times when I was the most in want. Some may think that I am very rich. Actually I am poorer than most people; but the Lord's power is great. Although some think this way, this has not hindered God from supplying my need. I have a friend who also experienced this. Once she spent her last dollar for the Lord. In a few days, she needed a hundred dollars to pay the wages of her workers. She sat quietly before the Lord and began to praise Him. She wrote a hymn in English (being an English woman). The message of the hymn is one verse in Psalm 23 which says that the Lord's cup of blessing runs over. She believed that everything, including silver and gold, would run over for her. But while she wrote this, she was actually penniless! When her friend in England saw the hymn, she wrote back and said, "Thank the Lord that He has been so rich to you!" It was true that she was not poor. When the time came to make her payments, the Lord prompted her former pastor in England to wire her a hundred dollars.</P><P>The secret to receiving is giving. The more you will not give, the more you will not have. Many times, we consider that our source is becoming dry and that it will dry up sooner if we give to others. But God says, "Give, and it will be given to you." You can exercise your faith. You can pray. But you will not receive if you do not give. God's eyes are on the little that you have left. You may say to God, "Father, all I have is this little." God would say, "Do you still have that much?" Since you have so little, you have a goal to save the little that you have to sustain your living. But God cannot give you anything because of the remainder that you still have. He says, "Give, and it will be given to you."</P><P>The little handful of meal and oil that the Zarephath woman had was only enough for her to make a cake. It was only enough to satisfy her hunger for an hour or two. But she needed to give. She needed to give the cake first to Elijah the prophet. Afterwards, God sustained her and her child for three and a half years. If God has not led you to do anything, nothing more can be said. But if He has led you to give, you have to give. However, do not be afraid of God's leading.</P><P>God's principle is for you to give first, and then it will be given to you. Our principle is to ask God to give first, then when we have a surplus we will give to others. Mr. Muller who supported the China Inland Mission was a person greatly used by the Lord. He gave his life to the Lord's work. He fully understood the principle of first giving and then being given to. He seldom stored up food at home. Once his wife told him that the food they had would only last until Sunday. They had no money, and it was not right for believers to borrow money. What should they do? He told his wife that there must be an overabundance of something in the house which was not distributed to others that had caused God to stop the supply. The couple began to search through the household items, the children's closets, and everything in the house to see if there were any excessive items. They found none. Everything seemed to be exactly what they needed. Suddenly they remembered that someone had sent them a big case of butter a few days before which they had not touched at all and which was too much for them. The couple then diligently cut the butter into a few hundred pieces and wrapped them up in white papers to be ready to give to others. The next day was Sunday. Mr Muller calmly sent all the butter to the church. He preached as usual, and after his message he asked the poor believers to stay behind and gave them each a packet of butter. The people wondered how their pastor had such a fortune to buy so much butter to give to others! They did not realize that their pastor was suffering from a famine in his own house! One of the poor believers had a sick wife at home. Every day there was only bread and water. Many times the sick wife said, "How good it would be if we could have a little butter on our bread." When the husband came home from the church and showed the butter to the wife, they were very grateful. The child of God then knelt in her bed and prayed in tears, "O Lord, please bless our pastor! He has supplied our needs. Now please supply his needs." God heard her prayer, and the next day someone suddenly sent the pastor some money. "Give, and it will be given to you."</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> </body></html>
