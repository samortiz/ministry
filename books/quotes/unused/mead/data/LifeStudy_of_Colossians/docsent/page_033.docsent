   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE STEWARD S SUFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1:24 Paul says, Now I rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The afflictions of Christ are of two categories: those for accomplishing redemption, which have been completed by Christ Himself; and those for producing and building the church, which need to be filled up by the apostles and the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The fact that Paul mentions the afflictions of Christ in connection with the stewardship of God indicates that the stewardship can be carried out only through suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we desire to share in the stewardship of God, we must be prepared to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All those who participate in the service of the church or in the ministry must be ready to partake of the afflictions of a steward.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that we must be willing to pay whatever price is necessary to fulfill our stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have pointed out that when we give or receive hospitality, we need to carry out our stewardship by dispensing the riches of Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, to provide hospitality may involve a kind of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In like manner, to be the guest in someone s home also may be a cause of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have been a guest in the homes of many saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The hosts have invariably taken care of me in a marvelous way, doing everything necessary to meet my needs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, I suffered simply because I was not in my own home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No matter how adequate the hospitality may be, I am always glad to be back home.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, I am happy to testify that many have spoken of the nourishment, edification, and strengthening they have received through sharing in hospitality, as either a host or a guest.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that to carry out the stewardship of God by dispensing the riches of Christ into the members of God s royal family is worth any kind of suffering, great or small.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we shall point out in the following message, the sufferings in which we share are for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are in no way related to the accomplishment of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE STEWARD BEING A MINISTER A. Of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Speaking of the Body of Christ, the church, Paul says in 1:25, Of which I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here Paul says that, as a steward, he became a minister of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>B. To Complete the Word of God</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 1:25 Paul also speaks of completing the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word of God is the divine revelation, which was not completed until the New Testament was written.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the New Testament the apostles, especially the Apostle Paul, completed the word of God in the mystery of God, which is Christ, and in the mystery of Christ, which is the church, to give us a full revelation of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to 1:26, the word of God is the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations, but now has been manifested to His saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This hidden mystery is related to Christ and the church, the Head and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The unveiling of this mystery through the Apostle Paul is a major part of the completion of the word of God as the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From the ages means from eternity, and from the generations means from the times.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The mystery concerning Christ and the church was hidden from eternity and from all the times until the New Testament age, when it is being manifested to the saints, including all of us, the believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Prior to the time of Paul, the divine revelation had not been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before Paul came forth to minister, God s revelation had already been given in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, God had revealed Himself through the events recorded in the Gospels and in part of the Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, it was necessary for Paul to write a number of Epistles concerning Christ as the mystery of God and concerning the church as the mystery of Christ in order for the divine revelation to be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This completion of the divine revelation is seen especially in four of his Epistles: Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although the divine revelation was completed through the apostles, especially through Paul, in a practical sense it also needs to be completed through us today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that as we contact people, we must progressively, continually, and gradually preach the word in full.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To preach the word in full, or to fully preach the word, is to complete the word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Among so many Christians today there is surely a great need for such a completing of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Recently, a magazine stated that in the United States there are fifty million regenerated Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How many of them know God s purpose in saving them?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Very few.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Christianity the word of God has been preached, but it has not been preached in full.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The preaching of today s Christianity has not completed the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, there is an urgent need for this completion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have pointed out that the word of God which needs completion is the mystery spoken of in 1:26.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many Christians preach the word of God, but very few tell people what God s mystery is.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The word of God preached in the full gospel is not related to escaping hell and going to heaven; neither is it related to peace, joy, and a happy life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The word that needs to be completed is the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This mystery is concealed, hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If it were not hidden, it would no longer be a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The mystery concealed from ages and generations is the word of God that must now be completed through the preaching of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This concealed mystery, which has been made manifest to God s saints, is Christ in you, the hope of glory v. 27 . Although I have heard the preaching of the gospel for years, I have rarely heard a message saying that when someone believes in Jesus Christ, Christ will not only save him, but also come into his spirit and remain there as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Most of the preaching in today s Christianity is not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, there is the need for the completion of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we do not minister the riches of Christ to others, their knowledge of the divine revelation will be lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As far as the revelation itself is concerned, there is no lack.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Everything was completed centuries ago.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, in practice, there may still be a lack, especially if we do not fulfill our part of the stewardship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all need to fulfill our responsibility to complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The new ones in the Lord s recovery need the completion of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For example, a new one may firmly believe that Christ is God and the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, he may not realize the all-inclusiveness of Christ and experience Him as such an all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He may not realize that, as a man, Christ is also a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When he hears about this aspect of Christ, he may be troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This indicates that someone needs to complete the word of God to him in this matter and point out that, although Christ is God, He is still a man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In 1 Timothy 2:5 Paul speaks of the man Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Furthermore, after the ascension of Christ, Stephen saw the Son of Man in the heavens Acts 7:56 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Surely a man is a creature with flesh and bones.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After His resurrection, the Lord showed His disciples that He had a body of flesh and bones Luke 24:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Since the resurrected Christ is still a man with such a body, it is correct to say that He is a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Nevertheless, due to the influence of religious tradition, many believers may be reluctant to make such a statement about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To them, such a teaching may be heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We need to help them take the pure Word of God and believe whatever it says.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This means that we need to help them have the completion of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the Lord s recovery we need more stewards who are able to complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We all must bear the burden for this.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We need to spend more time in the Lord s presence so that He may become our portion for our enjoyment and so that we may have the riches of Christ to minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In this way we shall become those who complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then through our ministry other believers will be nourished, strengthened, confirmed, and built up.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Body is built up as all the members carry out the stewardship of ministering the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>May there be such a mutual stewardship among us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You minister the riches of Christ to others, and they minister Christ to you.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If this is our situation, we all shall be nourished and enjoy Christ more than ever.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then through the stewardship of dispensing the riches of Christ, the church will be built up in a practical way.</S>
