<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>When the descendants of Noah violated the covenant that God had made with Noah, forming nations to oppose God and eventually falling into idolatry at Babel, God came to call Abraham as the head of a new race and to make a covenant with him, the fourth covenant that God made with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE ONE WHO MADE THE COVENANT&mdash;JEHOVAH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah</h2>
<p>We have said that in making the first covenant Jehovah is the One who was, who is, and who will be. He always is and never changes, and He always exists and never passes away; He is the self-existing and ever-existing One (Exo. 3:14-15; Rev. 1:8). He is the &ldquo;I Am,&rdquo; who is well able to meet all the needs of the called one and to be the attraction, encouragement, strength, guidance, support, supply, protection, and care to him in his journey. It was this One who always is who came to make a covenant with the called one.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The God of Glory</h2>
<p>Jehovah, the One who made this covenant, is the God of glory. Acts 7:2 says, &ldquo;The God of glory appeared to...Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran.&rdquo; The glory here might have been visible glory, as when the cloud and the fire appeared to Israel (Exo. 16:10; 24:16-17; Lev. 9:23; Num. 14:10; 16:19; 20:6; Deut. 5:24) and filled the tabernacle and temple (Exo. 40:35; 1 Kings 8:11). God&rsquo;s glory was a great attraction to Abraham. It separated him from the world unto God (Exo. 29:43), and was a great encouragement and strength which enabled him to follow God (Gen. 12:1, 4). It was the God of such glory who appeared to Abraham to make a covenant with him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE ONE WITH WHOM THE COVENANT<br />
WAS MADE&mdash;ABRAHAM (ABRAM)</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. His Background</h2>
<p>Abraham was formerly called Abram. When God appeared to him to make a covenant with him, he was in a situation with the darkest background. At that time the human race had fallen to the uttermost. Man abused the God-given authority to form nations, built a city for himself to have a man-made, godless life, built a tower for self-exaltation to oppose God, and fell into a situation of idolatry. Even Abram&rsquo;s father was there serving idols (Josh. 24:2). No one was concerned for God&rsquo;s interest, and no one cared for God&rsquo;s purpose. When Abram was called by God, he was in such a situation with a dark background.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
