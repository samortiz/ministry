   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>COORDINATING TO CALL THE PROPER HYMNS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We may illustrate the way to begin a meeting with playing basketball.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All basketball players know that they need a good start.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If they start wrongly, they will lose the game; it is very hard to adjust a wrong start.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the start of a meeting, someone may call Hymn #127 in Hymns, that starts, Hark! ten thousand voices crying.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This hymn may be too high, so to adjust the meeting to a lower level, another brother may call Hymn #510, that begins, I ve found the One of peerless worth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These two hymns are two different balls.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One hymn is about the air force, and the other is about the marines ; after being in the air, we immediately dive under the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is disgusting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hymn #127, written by J. N. Darby, is the highest of all hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot find another hymn with such a high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, unless a meeting immediately starts in the third heaven, we should not use this hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only once in my life, in 1943, have I been in a meeting that began in such a high way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I can never forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the meeting started, it was very high.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All of a sudden we began to sing, Hark! ten thousand voices crying.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Usually, however, we need to learn not to choose such a high hymn to start the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we start the meeting with such a high hymn, we will be frustrated; we will not know what to do next.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This hymn is good for when the meeting has been going on and on.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the meeting comes to a climax, we can use this hymn; at that time it fits.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A brother may realize that a hymn is too high, so he may have the intention to adjust the meeting and have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, he may adjust the meeting from the air all the way down to the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we intend to adjust a hymn with too high a standard, we should not come down too quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to keep the meeting going in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After singing a hymn, the best way is to continue by reading, praising, and praying with paraphrases of the verses in order to digest the hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To have a proper meeting is a matter of teamwork.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A certain brother may know how to adjust the meeting, but he should not do too much.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If he does, he will be the clergy, and the others will become the laity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>LEARNING TO COORDINATE WITH OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we have seen, in a meeting we all need to learn to coordinate with others, like a team playing ball.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to realize that we are on a team; we are not playing by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should learn to follow others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should always consider how the meeting has gone on; then we can simply continue on the same line.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not always easy; it requires exercise and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If others are praising the Lord, we need to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This will protect us from practicing wrongly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some prayers are truly good, but they are given at the wrong time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not think that to have a good prayer means we are right.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may have a good prayer but offer it in a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At certain stages of a meeting we have to follow others to pray in certain ways.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Again, this is like playing ball.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may play ball very well, but it may not be the right time to play in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all have to learn this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have had much improvement in our Lord s table meeting, but we still need to improve more.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We still need to learn more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>OUR PRACTICE IN THE LORD S TABLE MEETING Serving Our Dish at the Right Time</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Lord s table meeting, in the section for the remembrance of the Lord, a brother may offer a prayer of praise to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all realize that this is not fitting and needs to be adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Another brother may offer a prayer, saying, Grant us Your blessing and anointing for the time to come.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This prayer indicates that the time of worship is closed and it is now time for fellowship or other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After this prayer, however, three more persons may continue with worship.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This indicates that the brother served dessert before the other dishes were finished; while dessert was being served, three more dishes came.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the one hand, it is good for the first brother to wait a little.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the other hand, however, the three brothers should not have hesitated; they should have served their dishes more quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we do not serve our dish quickly before dessert comes, we had better forget our dish.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If there is a hesitation, people will think that all the dishes have been served.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all must learn to do the right thing at the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Offering Hymns and Prayers</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That Fit the Feeling of the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hymn #495 in Hymns says, Christ is God s centrality / And His universality; / He is God s delight and joy / Throughout all eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is a good hymn in itself, but the Lord s table is a weekly remembrance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, all the hymns and prayers offered must keep the thought of the enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A hymn on Christ as God s centrality and universality may be for our understanding and not for enjoyment, so it is better to use it for a message or testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we read Hymn #495, we can see that there is no thought or sense of enjoyment, and without the sense of enjoyment we do not have the realization that we are remembering the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>According to the understanding, it is good, but according to the sense, it does not fit the atmosphere of the Lord s table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have many good, spiritual hymns, but they do not fit the Lord s table meeting because they do not give the sense of the remembrance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After a while we will graduate from our study of the meetings, but after that we must go on to graduate school and even get a Ph.D. We must continue to learn.</S>
