   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE SEEKING OF THE SONS OF KORAH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The subject of Psalm 85 is the seeking of the sons of Korah for the restoration of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 4 the psalmist prays, "Restore us, O God of our salvation,/And cause Your indignation toward us to cease."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 6 he goes on to ask, "Will You not again revive us,/That Your people may rejoice in You?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verses 8 through 11 the psalmist writes about Jehovah's speaking peace to His people, about His salvation being near to those who fear Him, and about glory, lovingkindness, truth, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verses 12 and 13 conclude, "Indeed Jehovah will give what is good,/And our land will give its increase./Righteousness will go before Him/And make His footsteps a way to walk in."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This seeking for the restoration of Israel was based upon God's promise to Israel's forefathers to give land, peace, and many other good things to their descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, however, the sons of Korah experienced God's punishment and the desolation and degradation of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, in their seeking as recorded in this psalm they prayed for restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Surely this was good and also important, but we need to see what God would say about it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE SEEKING OF DAVID</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>FOR HIS PERSONAL SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Psalm 86 is concerned with the seeking of David for his personal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we read this psalm we need to pay special attention to verses 2, 11-13, and 15-16.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 2 David prayed, "Keep my soul; for I am godly;/Save Your servant who trusts in You, O You who are my God."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 16 he said, "Turn to me and be gracious to me;/Give Your strength to Your servant,/And save the son of Your maidservant."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>David's seeking for his personal salvation was important; however, it was important not for itself but for something else.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may use eating as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eating is important not for its own sake but for something else.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Likewise, it is important to be saved, but salvation is for something else, not for itself.</S>
