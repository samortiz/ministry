   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A Shadow of the Church a. Resurrected with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What do we find after the resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We see a new living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Noah and the seven other people had a new living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I would also like to call your attention to the fact that the number of people in the ark was eight.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The number eight means resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A week has seven days, and the beginning of a new week is the eighth day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ was resurrected on the first day of the week, that is, on the eighth day John 20:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So, the number eight signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this new living, the people were in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whatever they did was in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not many Christians realize the true significance of the type in this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should understand this portion of the Word in the way of typology.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All Christians agree that the ark was a type of Christ, and 1 Peter 3:20-21 tells us clearly that the passing through the flood was a prefigure of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Based upon these two facts, we must realize that everything related to Noah and to the seven people that were with him after the flood must also be a part of the complete type, forming a full picture of the type.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not stop with saying that the passing through the flood was a type of baptism and that the ark resting on the mountain was a type of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What about the life of the eight persons after the flood?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, what about the living of the people after the resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What does the living of those eight people after the flood signify?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It signifies the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The living of the resurrected people after the resurrection was the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is absolutely logical.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The eight persons in the ark signify us, the New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I would like to say a word to the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I was a young Christian, I exercised my mentality very much about the statements in the Bible that say that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I tried to figure out how we could be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I could neither see the reality of this nor understand its significance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One day, as I was considering what Noah's ark passed through, the Lord showed me that the eight persons in the ark were a picture showing us how it is that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those eight persons were in the ark when the ark passed through the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, they also passed through the flood in the ark, but they themselves did not touch the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was the ark that withstood the flood waters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This answers the questions of how Christ's crucifixion can be ours and how we were crucified in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the ark came out of the flood, the eight people in it also came out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the ark rested upon the mountaintop, the eight persons also were resurrected and rested on the mountaintop in the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ephesians 2:6 says that we were raised up together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before we were born, we were resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Christ was resurrected out from the death waters, we were in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, in the church we are resurrected people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we look at the picture of the type, we shall see that the church is another community; it is not the old society.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The old community and society have been buried.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we were baptized, we buried the old community and society.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The flood came and buried Noah's old society, and only eight persons were resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now the living of those eight persons on the new line must be a type of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are the church people, and the church people are a resurrected people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are another community, another society.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church life is a new community.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After the flood, the eight persons saved through the ark began to have a new living.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before the flood, they saw many evil and ungodly things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But they were saved, separated, resurrected, and ushered into a new living.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That new living was a type of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In addition to all the other seeds sown in the book of Genesis, the seed of the church life is also sown there.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every part of the living of the eight people was a prefigure of a part of the church life.</S>
