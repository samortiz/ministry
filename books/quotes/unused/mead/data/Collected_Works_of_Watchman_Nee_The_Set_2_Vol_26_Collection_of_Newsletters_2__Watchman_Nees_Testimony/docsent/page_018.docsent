   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>COLLECTION OF NEWS FROM TAI SHUN,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHEKIANG PROVINCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Tai Shun is one of the five counties in Wenchow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>P'ing Yang is its neighbor on the east.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is bordered on the south by Fu Ting T'ung Shan , Fukien province, and it is joined to Shou Ning on the west.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It touches Jui An.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Its topography is very mountainous.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The standard of living of the people is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Transportation is not very convenient, so the gospel has not been preached as quickly as it was in P'ing Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The region is divided into two townships.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To the north is Yi Yu Township; the denominations were established there a long time ago.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To the south is Kuei Jen Township; it has twenty-four meeting places in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, of these twenty-four, ten used to be with the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The other fourteen left the denominations and then separated or were established after the brothers preached the gospel and brought people to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I will now describe how and why they left the denominations so that the brothers and sisters who are members together with us can know.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Lai was the first one enlightened by the Lord to see that the denominational system was not according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, he did not do anything immediately because he was the only one standing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was led by the Lord to attend the first conference in Shanghai, and he received great help from the brothers during this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When he returned home, he boldly testified for the Lord in the two places of Chi Tan and Hu Wei in Ya Yang name of the area .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some of the listeners at that time were surprised, and some opposed, secretly resisted, or spread rumors behind his back.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They suffered all kinds of misunderstandings, criticisms, and difficulties and were even called "The Little Flock," "Watchman Nee's Group," or "Spiritual Group" along with some other names.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But thank the Lord, praise God that in this situation the Lord still used His love and powerful arm to snatch a few sticks out of the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They were Chang Yung Chiu, Lee Pang Ch'uan, Wang Piao Chiu, Wu Hsien Ch'uan, and Ho Teng K'ai.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because they had just come out, they had difficulty finding a meeting place for rent on such short notice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They temporarily borrowed the upstairs of Brother Lai's old house.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although the room was small and there weren't many people, the Lord was with them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They were very joyful in the deepest part of their spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From that time on the Lord graced them often.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Later the Lord did some work through this small number of brothers and also worked in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord gradually opened their eyes and resolved their misunderstandings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was not long before all the brothers and sisters in the churches in Ya Yang were like hibernating creatures who awake after a thunderclap in the spring.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They had been shaken, and there was a strong revival.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, they publicly announced to the denominations that they were leaving.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The rest of the places were still in the realm of and under the control of the China Inland Mission: Nan Hsi Sze Hsi , Ke Ling, Ts'ai Chai, Hsiu Hsi, Hsiu Hsi Pien, Ying Pien.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was the first church in Kuei Jen Township to leave the denominations, and it was the principal cause in the raising up of meetings in this region.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 1925 The Christian was published.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through the light in The Christian, the Lord opened the eyes of the brothers in Hsiu Hsi, T'o Ti, Ying Pien, Ts'ai Chai, and other places.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They too saw that in too many matters the denominations did not match the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, they were not completely clear about the truth of the church at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, they hoped to do an improving work from within.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although Brother Chen Ch'ing Fa was among them at the time and helped them quite a bit with his work, the time was not ripe, and the co-workers were not one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There were also people who were doing a damaging work among them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those in the group who were for keeping the denominations rose to oppose.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Later Brother Chen moved back to his home town, but he was alone and brave in leaving!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He alone resigned from his position with the denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was the first person to formally leave the China Inland Mission in P'ing Yang, and he was also our pioneer in obeying the Lord by leaving the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Later, there was a meeting in Ch'iao Tun Men.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God came in from another angle by leading old Mr. Ts'ai Chi Ch'ing and Brother Mao Ch'ing Shih of Hsiu Hsi to attend some meetings there.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Through Brother Wang Yu T'ing's messages, they were touched.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although they had a doubting, questioning attitude during the first few days, by the end, their problems completely melted away and they obeyed happily.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When they went home, they encouraged the brothers in Hsiu Hsi, T'o Ti, and other places to leave the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This was the second principal cause in the meetings being raised up in the region.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to the regulations of the China Inland Mission in P'ing Yang and Tai Shun, there were four meetings for teachers every year.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There was also one large general meeting and one small general meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the teacher's meeting, the teachers were divided into four levels, A through D. P'ing Yang and Tai Shun had their own small general meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The small general meeting for Tai Shun alternated between Yi Yu Township and Kuei Jen Township.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The methods were full of man's will.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is difficult to describe in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the large general meeting, P'ing Yang and Tai Shun joined together, but the location was in P'ing Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every year at the time of the large general meeting, the local meetings had to select representatives to go to it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once there, they had to select the meeting chairman, the assistant chairman, the general treasurer, the secretary, and other positions.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They also had to decide on the tenets of the faith and many other bothersome matters.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There were also many things passed at the large general meeting which the representatives from each locality had to be responsible for, such as the cost and the service.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some of the brothers had already received the Lord's enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When they attended this meeting, they went in happiness and returned in sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They passed through the bitterness of grieving the Holy Spirit for several years.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In 1928, in the second month of the lunar calendar, it was time for the large general meeting again.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The brothers from the churches in Kuei Jen Township, Nan Hsi, Ke Ling, Ts'ai Chai, Ying Pien, etc., all went to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Brother Pao Tze Ching of Nan Hsi got up boldly in the meeting and testified for the Lord, saying that denominations were wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He also said that if the error was not rectified, we would not return to a meeting of that nature.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When the leaders of the meeting saw the troublesome situation, they realized that there was a danger of division if they acted with a one-track mind without calling for a change.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They used trickery and changed the outward appearance without changing the inward substance to bring the brothers back and mollify them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They said that in the large and small general meetings changes could be made for the better.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They concluded that only the matters of administrating the teachers and the work, testing the faith of the candidates for baptism, and doing the actual baptizing had to be done by the pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Most of the brothers there were confused about the truth concerning the church, so they agreed to this method.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Later, the leaders sent Mr. Chen Fang to Nan Hsi Sze Hsi . In this way, we had partially left the denominations and were partially going along in the Lord's way for another two years.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Nevertheless, thank God and praise the Lord because God's work is immeasurably marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although Mr. Chen Fang was sent by the denomination to Nan Hsi, he not only refused to preserve the denomination by being their faithful servant, but he humbly received the truth as soon as he arrived in Nan Hsi.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Day by day he obeyed more and more until he finally completely obeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He was like this with respect to the truth and with respect to his needs.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He did not look to the mission board but completely relied on Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When it was time for the large and small general meetings, he did not take part in them, nor did he attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Therefore, in 1930, all the meeting places in the church in Kuei Jen Township completely left the denominations and broke off their relationship with them, with the exception of a few who wanted to preserve the denominations they do not meet any longer .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Later Mr. Chen Fang escaped to his home town because a gang went on a wild rampage and began to cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This was the third principal cause of the brothers in Tai Shun turning from the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I have just described the three major factors.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The other factors are very complicated, so I will stop here but will bring them out as I describe the condition of each meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Now I will describe the condition of the meetings that left the old denominations and how they erroneously divided, even though they did.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I will also tell about their weak condition and how the Lord preached the gospel through the brothers, how people believed, and the condition of the newly established meetings in each locality.</S>
