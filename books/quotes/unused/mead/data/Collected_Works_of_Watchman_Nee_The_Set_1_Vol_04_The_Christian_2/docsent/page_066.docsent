   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse Fifteen</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 15: "In the same way you also have some who hold in like manner the teaching of the Nicolaitans."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After reading the Lord's letter to the Ephesians, we should realize what the works of the Nicolaitans are.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we want to consider in detail the meaning of this word "Nicolaitans."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the beginning, there were only the works of the Nicolaitans, and the church in Ephesus was still opposed to this kind of works.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, now it is no longer a work but has become a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sinful works are done only in private.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But when a new teaching is invented to support this kind of works, man becomes bold and open to commit those sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church in Pergamos was not as that in Ephesus, hating this kind of "works."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the contrary, she was holding this kind of "teaching."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who were the Nicolaitans?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although many theories exist, some considering that there was such a person as Nicoli who was the originator of the evil teaching, all of these theories remain only theories.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All writers throughout the ages have had much doubt concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No one can prove that a man called Nicoli existed in history and no one can identify the sin of the doctrine he taught.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But one thing we know: the Bible never tells us to read church history or to expound the Scripture with other histories.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word of God explains itself, and there is no need of outside help.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Otherwise, only the wise and the knowledgeable would be able to understand God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Scripture is revealed to babes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If it were not, only a few would need to study and to expound it, while the majority would only need to follow their decision.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, we should not care for what history says.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since the Lord Jesus mentioned this group of people twice, and we know that His word does not fail, the people of this group must be of much significance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the principle of all the other names of people and places recorded in Revelation 2 and 3, no name is without meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus there must be the Lord's intention in using this name.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word "Nicolaitans" is composed of two words in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first word, "Nico," means to conquer and to subdue.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second word, "laitan," means the people or the common man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The two words are combined to form "Nicolaitans," which means those who conquer the people or those who subdue the common man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the Nicolaitans are none other than those who oppress, control, and subdue other brothers in the church because they are found in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The teaching of the Nicolaitans says that there should be hierarchy in the church and there should be a distinction between the rank of the clergy and the laity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As far as the meaning of the word goes, there is another significance which is very obvious: the Lord Jesus mentioned the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans together.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Balaam is a Hebrew word, while Nicolaitans is a Greek word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have seen that in Greek, the word "Nicolaitans" has the sense of subduing the people, but in Hebrew, the word "Balaam" also has a similar meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word "Balaam" means "those who devour the people"!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As Balaam taught Balak to induce the Israelites to join themselves to the world, the Nicolaitans in the same way turned the church organization into a worldly community.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have covered the teaching of Balaam already.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now we want to concentrate on the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the beginning, they were only engaged in the works of subduing others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was not yet official and legal.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now this work has evolved into a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is a difference between "teaching" and "work."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"Teaching" can be translated as "doctrine."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, these ones had made their work of a hierarchical distinction a doctrine in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>With this teaching they made their acquired position fully legal.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now with such a doctrine that teaches a hierarchical distinction, they were able to protect their works.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What we want to ask is how this happened between the time when there were only the works and when the teaching was there.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In other words, for what reason was this work turned into a teaching?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Why is it that in Ephesus there were only the works, but in Pergamos it had turned into a legal, acceptable doctrine?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have said something concerning this already.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Between Ephesus and Pergamos there was the age of Smyrna.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the church in Smyrna, we saw the development of the Judaistic teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have also pointed out what the Judaistic teaching was and how it had turned the church into a hierarchical organization.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, the work of the Nicolaitans in Ephesus, through the cultivation of the Judaistic teachings in Smyrna, became the teaching of the Nicolaitans in Pergamos.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have seen that the Judaistic teachings are only a kind of measurement.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They measure to see if man has achieved righteousness or not.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>While God is measuring man, man cannot draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Judaistic teaching puts everybody under the same category.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, no one can be separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All those who were born of the flesh were able to join the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now we have to consider how this Judaistic teaching helped the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If the church becomes a Jewish "synagogue," then naturally Christians will become "Jews."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Jews were not able to draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even the High Priest, who was a type of Christ, could only enter the Holy of Holies once.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>While he was in it, he still needed the incense to cover the mercy-seat in order for him not to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It was out of the question for the other priests.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They could only enter the Holy Place; the Holy of Holies was forbidden to them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For the common citizens, even the Holy Place was unapproachable.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Because of the Israelites' failure, they could not draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God's original intention was that the whole nation would be priests Exo 19:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Yet they became fallen and broke the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As a result, God established a family as priests, to take the place of a whole nation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>From this we can see that the characteristic of Judaism is a separate and intermediate priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God was in obscurity; man could not approach Him directly.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As a result, God revealed Himself through a special group of people, and man approached God through this special group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Between the two, there was no direct fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is Judaism.</S>
