<h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
A SERVING ONE AND HIS FELLOW WORKERS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>A person who serves the Lord has a relationship not only with his community and with the church but also with his fellow workers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAINTAINING A PROPER RELATIONSHIP<br />
WITH FELLOW WORKERS</h2>
<p>Just as one person cannot play ball alone but must play with others as a team, so a person cannot serve the Lord alone; he must have co-workers. It is not enough for one who serves the Lord to have a proper relationship only with the community and the church. There is still another relationship that is more direct than the relationship with the community and with the church. That relationship is the relationship among the co-workers. This is the most difficult relationship because the sphere of the work of the co-workers is the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is universal, whereas the local churches are local. A full-time serving one in the college work in Taipei is in direct coordination with the brothers and sisters in Taipei who take part in the college work, and he must maintain a proper relationship with them. However, he must also maintain a proper relationship with the other full-time serving ones who are in coordination in the college work in other localities. If this relationship is not proper, the work will be hindered. In addition to the college work, there are co-workers serving in junior high schools, in high schools, in the community, with the small groups, and in the children&rsquo;s work. He must also maintain a proper relationship with all these serving ones.</p>
<p>Our view must be broadened. Not only should the co-workers in the smaller sphere of the church in Taipei have a proper relationship among themselves, but the co-workers in all the churches in Taiwan should also maintain a good relationship. This can be compared to the members in our physical body. All the members, whether big or small, must maintain a good relationship with the entire body. Once there is a problem in a part of the body, the whole body suffers. We should not think that having a problem with those who coordinate with us is only a personal matter that will not affect others. Any such problem will affect the whole Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COORDINATION BEING<br />
IN THE PRINCIPLE OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s sovereignty, His move is matched by the developments in the world. The developments in communication and transportation have made the earth smaller. Events that take place in one part of the earth are immediately known in other places. The Lord has had mercy on His recovery. Even though the total number of saints in the recovery is not large, in the past twenty years this testimony has spread to all continents&mdash;Australia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Asia. Hence, we are serving as co-workers not only in Taiwan but also in all the continents. There is a coordination among the co-workers. This coordination, which is similar to the coordination of our physical body, is universal. This is the Lord&rsquo;s doing. The Lord has given us a picture in the physical realm and the reality in the spiritual realm. Therefore, once we enter into the coordination of co-workers, our relationship becomes broader. We are serving in Taipei, but we are also related to those who are serving in New Zealand, because whatever we do will affect them either directly or indirectly. For this reason, we must broaden our view.</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago a group of brothers who were in their thirties were affected by negative things, and as a result, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery suffered a big loss. Eventually, they went out from among us. This is a warning, and we must learn from it. If they had stayed, they would be middle-aged by now and would be very useful. They would have gone to either Europe, Africa, South America, or Australia. That would have been glorious! Regrettably, they left the work. The Lord has measured a glorious work to us. These brothers are not ignorant of, nor can they deny, the fact that Christ has only one Body. However, since they are unable to do the work of the Body, what they can do is very limited.</p>
<p>When we enter into this work, we must see that we are not individual Christians. We are related to our community and the church, and we have entered into the coordination of the workers. Such a coordination is in the principle of the Body. There are many serving ones whom we have not met, and what we do is directly or indirectly related to them. If we have truly received and learned something from the Lord, others will be willing to receive the supply from us, wherever we are.</p>
<p> The relationship among the serving ones begins locally and then spreads. The Body of Christ is universal. The work is also universal. We must learn this lesson from the beginning of our service. We should never have problems with our fellow workers. When we have a problem with a co-worker, we have a problem with all the co-workers. If we have a problem with a worker who is beside us, we have a problem with all the co-workers in Taipei. If we have a problem with the co-workers in Taipei, we have a problem with all the co-workers in Taiwan. We must pay attention to this matter. It is very serious.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> </body></html>
