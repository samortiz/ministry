   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>25 Guarding Their Hearts and Thoughts in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Philippians 4:7 says, "The peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This guarding of our hearts and thoughts is a matter of the Father's intimate dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through the divine dispensing the peace of God guards our hearts and thoughts in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The peace of God is actually God Himself as peace v. 9 , infused into us through our fellowship with Him by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This peace is the counterpoise of troubles and the antidote to anxiety John 16:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Bad news or difficult situations may cause us to worry or to be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We find the antidote to this anxiety when we pray, practice communion with God, and enjoy the Father's dispensing in His love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then spontaneously, even unconsciously, the peace of God is transfused into our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This transfused peace becomes the counterpoise of trouble and becomes the antidote to anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From experience we know that through prayer we receive the antidote to anxiety when the peace of God is infused into us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Having the peace of God as the counterpoise to our troubles does not mean that the troubles will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The troubles remain, but we have a counterpoise.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, the poison of anxiety is still within us, but we have an antidote the peace of God transfused into our being through our fellowship with God in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we enjoy God as our peace, we are made calm within.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Philippians 4:7 Paul says that the peace of God will guard our hearts and our thoughts in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Greek word rendered "guard" may also be translated "mount guard over."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The God of peace patrols or stands guard before our hearts and thoughts in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The heart is the source, and the thoughts are the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The peace of God guards both our hearts and our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that in Christ Jesus the peace of God patrols as a guard who goes back and forth before our hearts and our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The peace of God which patrols within our inner being in such a way keeps us calm and tranquil.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even though we may have many troubles and much anxiety, nothing will disturb us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From experience we know that the peace of God infused into us through His dispensing keeps us calm.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is truly an experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in His love.</S>
