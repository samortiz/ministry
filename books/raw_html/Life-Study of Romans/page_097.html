<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">TRANSFORMATION:<br />IN PRACTICING THE BODY LIFE (3)<br />AND<br />IN SUBJECTION, LOVE, AND WARFARE</h1><h2 class="head1">V. BY THE LIVING OF A NORMAL LIFE</h2><p>We have seen the definition of transformation and three points relating to transformation in practicing the Body life: the presenting of our bodies, the renewing of our minds, and the exercising of our gifts. Now we come to a further point, the living of a normal life (12:9-21).</p><h2 class="head2">A. Toward Others</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Loving</h2><p>In living a normal life, we firstly should have love toward others. In verse 9 Paul says, &ldquo;Let love be without hypocrisy,&rdquo; and in verse 10 he says, &ldquo;Love one another warmly in brotherly love.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head3">2. Showing Honor</h2><p>Verse 10 also speaks of &ldquo;vying with one another in showing honor.&rdquo; In the matter of showing honor we must move quickly and be the first one to show honor to others.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Communicating and Showing Hospitality</h2><p>Furthermore, we need to communicate to the needs of the saints and to pursue hospitality (v. 13).</p><h2 class="head3">4. Rejoicing with Those Who Rejoice<br />and Weeping with Those Who Weep</h2><p>In verse 15 Paul says, &ldquo;Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.&rdquo; We must be transformed before we can rejoice and weep with others. Some people were born in such a way that they are unable to weep or to rejoice. Regardless of how happy or joyful you are, they remain expressionless, resembling the statue of Mary at the entrance of a Catholic church, which never changes its expression. Some brothers and sisters are like this. They do not know how to rejoice or to weep with others; they seem to be stones without human affection. However, the church life needs emotional people. We all must be properly emotional and full of expression. I would like to have a face that can express all my emotions properly and adequately. We cannot put together people with stone faces and call it the church life; we must be living stones, stones full of affection. We must learn to rejoice and to weep with others.</p><h2 class="head3">5. Being of the Same Mind</h2><p>Then Paul admonishes us saying, &ldquo;Be of the same mind toward one another, not minding high things, but being led away to the lowly. Do not be wise in yourselves&rdquo; (v. 16). Paul was practical. When he tells us to be led away to lowly things, he includes everything. We should try to be led away to whatever is lowly. Do not be so high, but be led away to lowly things.</p>
