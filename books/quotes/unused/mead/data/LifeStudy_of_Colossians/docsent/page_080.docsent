   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN GOD AND AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verses 1 and 3 we have a matter that deserves our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 1 we are told that Christ is at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But according to verse 3, Christ is in God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Where then is Christ, at the right hand of God or in God?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I wonder how those who specialize in analytical theology would answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No matter how much we may try to analyze this, our minds are too limited to comprehend it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Triune God is unlimited, far beyond our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do not try to understand Him with your limited mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the same time, Christ is both at the right hand of God and in God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, according to our limited mentality, we cannot reconcile these statements.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Regarding matters such as this, we do not follow the traditional teachings of the so-called historic church; we follow the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many believers claim to know the Bible, whereas actually their understanding of the Scriptures has been blinded by traditional teachings embodied in creeds such as the Nicene Creed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, as we have pointed out, we follow the pure and complete Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the Bible, Christ is at the right hand of God and also hidden within God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may not be able to reconcile these statements, but we believe them because of what the Bible tells us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>HIDDEN WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>AND MANIFESTED WITH HIM</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I appreciate the word hidden in 3:3.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today our life is hidden with Christ in God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But one day Christ will appear, and we shall be manifested with Him in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although we shall be manifested with Christ in the future, now is the time for us to be hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this reason, we should not advertise ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The importance of a hidden life was impressed upon me afresh in my work on the biography of Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although this book has been completed, I am still seeking the Lord s mind whether or not it should be published.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The reason for my hesitation is that it is difficult to print a biography of someone without exposing that person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is somewhat opposed to the principle of a hidden life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The life of a Christian today should be a hidden life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At present, even Christ is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Think of how much He is criticized, opposed, and attacked.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>People rebel against Him to such an extent that it almost seems as if He does not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although Christ is suffering from this attack and rebellion, He continues to be silent and hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In contrast to the practice of Christianity, our life should not be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should do many things that are not known by others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our Christian life should be a hidden life, a life hidden with Christ in God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our church life should also be hidden in God and in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The practice of today s Christianity is to promote people and their work by advertising them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such a practice is Babylonian, to say the least.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church life is a life hidden with Christ in God and in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As long as we are hidden, we are with Christ in God, in the heavens, and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when we advertise and promote ourselves, we are outside of Christ and are not with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Christ appears, we shall appear with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That will be the time of our manifestation with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But now is our time to be hidden and to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Romans 8, we shall one day be glorified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Romans 8:19 we are told that the creation eagerly expects the revelation of the sons of God, at which time it will be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God v. 21 . What a wonderful day it will be when we appear with our Christ in glory! At that time, even our vile body will be transfigured into a glorious body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But as we await that wonderful day, we must remain hidden with Christ in God, in the heavens, and in the church.</S>
