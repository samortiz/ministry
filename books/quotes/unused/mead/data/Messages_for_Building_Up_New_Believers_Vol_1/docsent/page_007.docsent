   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE BAPTISM Scripture Reading: Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; 22:16; 1 Pet 3:20-21; Rom 6:3-4; Col 2:12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Baptism is a great subject in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to be clear about two aspects concerning baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, before we are baptized, we need to be clear as to what baptism can do for us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, after we are baptized, we need to look backward and ask, What is the significance of baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the first case, the baptism pool and the water are before us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we are going to be baptized, we should ask ourselves, What can baptism do for me?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After our baptism, we need to ask, What is the meaning of my baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One is a question posed in foresight, and the other is a question posed in hindsight.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The former touches one s knowledge prior to baptism, and the latter, one s understanding after baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I. WHAT BAPTISM DOES FOR A PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned Mark 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This verse shows what baptism does for a person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A. Baptism Saving Man from the World</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I suppose that all Protestants are a little afraid of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, they dare not read it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever they read this verse, they change it to, He who believes and is saved shall be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the Lord s Word does not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to avoid the error of Catholicism, the Protestants deliberately go around God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, as they evade the error of Catholicism, they fall into another error.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord s Word is clear: He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Man has no authority to change it to, He who believes and is saved shall be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Salvation Being a Deliverance from the World</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let us now pay attention to the meaning of the word salvation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is a person being saved from?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the Bible, a man is saved from the world, not hell.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The opposite of eternal life is perdition, but the Bible does not regard salvation as the opposite of perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible shows us that salvation is one s deliverance from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as a person is in the world, he is already in perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us consider man s condition before God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today man does not have to do anything to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I will not perish because I have killed someone, and I will not be saved from perdition because I have not killed someone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The fact is that the whole world is perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From among the perishing ones, God has pulled us out and saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The whole world is perishing corporately, but God is saving men one by one, individually.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God does not catch all the fish from the sea and then separate the good from the bad, assigning some to salvation while destining others to perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the fish in the sea are perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those which are caught by God are saved; the rest remain in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, the matter of salvation and perdition has nothing to do with whether or not you have believed or how good your conduct is; it has to do with your location.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you are in the boat, you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you are still in the sea, you are perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You may not have done anything, but as long as you are in the world, that is enough for you to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It does not matter whether you are good or bad, a gentleman or a villain.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It does not matter whether or not you live by your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as you are in the world, you are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you have not left that place, you are condemned by God.</S>
