   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CHURCH IN SMYRNA</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>REVELATION 2:8-11</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church in Smyrna typifies the condition of the church during the time from about one hundred years after Christ to A.D. 313.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church in Ephesus was cold in her love; the church in Smyrna suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This has a great significance because many times the Lord causes a cold and loose believer to suffer in order to revive him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. Revelation 2:8</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"And to the messenger of the church in Smyrna write: These things says the First and the Last, who became dead and lived again."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Smyrna" means "suffering," but it can also be taken to mean "myrrh."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Myrrh is precious; thus, this suffering is a precious suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All sufferings for the Lord are precious.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"The First and the Last" indicates that the Lord is the forever unchanging God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What a comfort this was to the church in Smyrna!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"These things says..., who became dead and lived again."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Becoming dead yet living again was, of course, the Lord's experience and work when He was on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, this word could also give the believers in Smyrna the greatest comfort, encouragement, and help:</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>1 First, this leaves us a pattern to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the Lord received death while on the earth, even more, should not we also?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2 Since He suffered unto death, He can sympathize with us Heb 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3 To accomplish God's will and overcome the enemy, the Lord had to die.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We want to accomplish the same; hence, we also must die.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>4 Although the Lord died, He resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, if we suffer or forsake our life for the Lord, we will have the hope of resurrection; our suffering will not be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>B. Revelation 2:9</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"I know your tribulation and poverty but you are rich and the slander from those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"I Know"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>a The Lord knows all of our sufferings!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, our hearts should be content.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>b Since the Lord knows our sufferings yet still does not remove them, such sufferings must be profitable to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>c Since the Lord knows our sufferings, He must also know how to reward us in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Their Sufferings</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The sufferings of the church in Smyrna at that time were of three kinds: 1 tribulation, 2 poverty, and 3 slanderings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>a. Tribulation</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is tribulation?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Tribulation is an outward persecution from the environment, such as opposition, attack, exile, oppression, beating, robbing, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Poverty</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the monetary supply during tribulation is sufficient, you do not feel the suffering that much because, relatively speaking, being rich makes it easier for you to get by.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if you are in poverty in the midst of tribulation, the situation becomes even more hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although this was the situation, the Lord added a most precious word: "But you are rich."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At that time the faith of the church in Smyrna was rich James 2:5 and her love was full 1 Thes 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Otherwise, who would not fall when placed under such circumstances?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church in Smyrna and the church in Laodicea stand in stark contrast to each other Rev 3:17 ; it is impossible for a person to be in Smyrna, before the Lord, yet at the same time be in Laodicea, before the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Slanderings</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Slander damages our reputation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some can endure physical sufferings under tribulation and poverty, yet few can tolerate damage to their reputation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"The slander from those who call themselves Jews."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Slandering began with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When our Lord was on the earth, He was slandered by them; much more, should not we also be slandered?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What was their actual word of slander?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was slander against the truth of salvation Acts 13:45; 18:6; 19:9; 28:22; Rom 3:8 , yet the Lord said that we are blessed if we are reviled Matt 5:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is one more point to be noted that is, concerning "those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Who actually were these people?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Before we talk about this group of people, we should first find out who the real Jews are.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>From Romans 2:28-29, John 8:39-47, and Romans 4:11-12, we understand that whoever sincerely believes in the Lord Jesus is a real Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since these ones were not Jews but called themselves such, they must surely refer to a group of Jews in the flesh and a group of Judaistic followers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These people had an organization, and one might say that they were the Judaistic church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Their teachings were also Judaistic, being half of the law and half of grace, half of faith and half of works.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Their system followed the law; they had a priestly order.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There were a great number of these people, even at Paul's time.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, by the time of this writing, they had become more developed and more organized.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They "are a synagogue of Satan."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>These people were used by Satan to preach a seemingly true, but actually false, gospel.</S>
