<h2 class="head1">THEIR EARNEST CARE MANIFESTED TO THEM</h2><p>In verse 12 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;So then, even if I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of him who did the wrong, nor for the sake of him who was wronged, but for the sake of manifesting to you your earnestness on our behalf before God.&rdquo; Here Paul says that he wrote to the Corinthians not for the sake of the brother who had committed incest (1 Cor. 5:1), the one who did the wrong, nor for the sake of that brother&rsquo;s father, the one who was wronged. Why then did Paul write? He wrote them for the purpose of manifesting to them their earnestness on the apostles&rsquo; behalf. The Corinthian believers did love the apostles and had earnest care toward them, but they had been turned aside by false teachers. Hence, the apostle wrote the first Epistle to bring them back, that their love and earnest care toward the apostles might be made manifest to them (2 Cor. 7:7). Who would have imagined that this was Paul&rsquo;s reason for writing to the Corinthians? He wrote for the purpose of manifesting to them their earnestness for the apostles. What wisdom Paul displays in his writing! Here Paul seems to be saying, &ldquo;Corinthian believers, there was in you an earnestness for us. But it was buried and thus was not manifested. I wrote the first Epistle in order to manifest to you the earnest care which you have for us.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">ENCOURAGED AND REJOICING ABUNDANTLY</h2><p>Verse 13 continues, &ldquo;Therefore we have been encouraged. And in our encouragement we rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.&rdquo; Darby says that here it is impossible to render the Greek idiom exactly into English. Paul&rsquo;s saying that he rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus indicates that he was very human and emotional in his ministering of life. This major section, from 2:12 through 7:16, concerning the apostles&rsquo; ministry of the new covenant and themselves as the ministers of the new covenant, begins with the apostle&rsquo;s being anxious to meet Titus because of his loving concern for the Corinthian believers (2:13) and ends with his being encouraged by the coming of Titus with positive news concerning them.</p><p>In verse 13 Paul says that the spirit of Titus had been refreshed by all the Corinthians. This indicates that even though the apostles were human and emotional, they still remained in their spirit in their ministering of life.</p><p>In verse 14 Paul says, &ldquo;Because if I have boasted anything to him on your behalf, I was not put to shame; but as we spoke all things in truth to you, so also our boasting before Titus turned out to be truth.&rdquo; It is certain that Paul had boasted to Titus concerning the Corinthians. Now Paul says that his boasting before Titus turned out to be truth.</p><p>Verse 15 says, &ldquo;And his affections are abundantly toward you, remembering the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;affections&rdquo; here literally means bowels; it is the same word rendered &ldquo;inward parts&rdquo; in 6:12.</p><p>In verse 16 Paul concludes, &ldquo;I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you.&rdquo; The Greek words translated &ldquo;of good courage concerning you&rdquo; can also be rendered &ldquo;confident in you.&rdquo; The apostle was encouraged by the Corinthian believers and could now have confidence in them. What a deep, intimate concern Paul had for them!</p>
