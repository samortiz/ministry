Saying That They Have Waited for Their God</H2><P>According to 25:9, in that day Israel will say, "Behold, this is our God;/We have waited that He may save us./This is Jehovah, for whom we have waited;/Let us be glad and rejoice in His salvation."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Waiting for Jehovah<br>in the Path of His Judgments</H2><P>"Indeed, in the path of Your judgments,/O Jehovah, we have waited for You" (26:8a). This indicates that while the Lord is judging, we should wait for Him in the path of His judging. While the Lord is chastening us, we need to learn something of Him and find out the lesson that the Lord would give us. However, some saints, after being chastened by the Lord, seem to learn nothing. They waste both their time and the Lord's chastening. Whenever we are chastened by the Lord, we need to learn something of Him. This is to wait for Him in the path of His judgment.</P><P>Verses 8b and 9 continue, "Your name, that is, Your memorial,/Is the desire of our soul./My soul desires You in the night;/Indeed, my spirit within me seeks You at the dawn;/For when Your judgments are in the earth,/The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness." God's judgment always teaches us lessons in righteousness.</P><P>Verse 10 says, "Though the wicked is shown grace,/He does not learn righteousness;/In the land of the straight-forwardness he deals unjustly/And does not perceive the majesty of Jehovah." Sometimes when God shows grace to us, we do not learn any lessons. So at times He has to be severe with us and chastise us that we may learn something of Him and perceive His majesty.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Saying That Jehovah's Hand Is Lifted Up</H2><P>In 26:11 Jehovah's hand is lifted up, but they do not see it. Instead, they will see Jehovah's zeal for the people and will be put to shame. Fire will devour His adversaries. In verses 12 and 13 Israel continues to pray, saying, "O Jehovah, You will ordain peace for us,/For You have also performed all our works for us./O Jehovah our God, other lords besides You have been master to us,/But through You alone do we mention Your name." Even though others would be lords over them, they do not mention their name. Rather, they mention only the name of Jehovah, recognizing that He alone is their Master.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Lifting Up Their Voice, Giving a Ringing Shout</H2><P>Finally, in turning to Jehovah, Israel will lift up their voice; they will give a ringing shout (24:14a). Because of the majesty of Jehovah, they will cry out from the west, from the sea (v. 14b). Verses 15 and 16 go on to say, "Therefore in the east glorify Jehovah,/Even the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the coastlands of the sea./From the ends of the earth we hear songs:/Glory to the righteous One!"</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_071.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_073.html">Next</a> </body></html>
