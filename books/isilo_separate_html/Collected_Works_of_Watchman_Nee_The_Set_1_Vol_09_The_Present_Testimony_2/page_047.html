They were David and Jonathan. David acted according to his covenant with Jonathan. When he found Jonathan's young son, Mephibosheth, among the descendants of Saul, David brought him to his table so that he could eat with him. Mephibosheth thought his life was over and his ancestor's inheritance was lost. When David sent men to look for him, Mephibosheth was trembling in fear. But after David expressed his good intention to him, Mephibosheth realized that his life was no longer in peril. If just his life was preserved, however, he would have regained only the first half of what he had lost. So David called in Ziba and ordered that Saul's possessions be returned to Mephibosheth. In this way Mephibosheth's inheritance was also recovered.</P><P>God wants to give us life, and we have received it. But God also wants to give us our lost inheritance. The shedding of the Lord's blood is not only for the forgiveness of sins. This, by itself, is glorious enough and should be known by all who feel shameful and who hate and abhor their sins. Thank God that more than the problems of death and sin have been solved. The blood of the Lord Jesus has not only dealt with condemnation but has recovered our lost inheritance. The blood has done a wonderful thing: it has added God to us. The blood of the Lord Jesus not only saves us from the recompense of sin; it has redeemed all the inheritance that we have lost in Eden. "The new covenant established in My blood" (Luke 22:20). On the one hand, the Lord's blood was shed for redemption and, on the negative side, removed all the things that harmed us. On the other hand, the blood was shed for the enactment of the new covenant and, on the positive side, bought back our lost inheritance. His blood is not just to redeem, but to buy something back for us. He did not merely redeem us to take care of the problem of sin. He has shed His blood for the purpose of buying back everything that was lost through Adam.</P><P>What is the new covenant? It is an absolutely legal document, established fully according to God's righteous procedures. The new covenant is not God's empty words; it is a document proving that God has bought many things for us through the blood of Jesus Christ.</P><P>Out of concern that you would not understand this, let me bring up one question related to the gospel: what part of our salvation was accomplished through God's righteousness and what part through God's grace? Before the Lord was crucified, everything was done through God's grace. But after the Lord was crucified, everything is done through God's righteousness. What does this mean? It does not mean that there is no grace after the cross. Grace is like the tap water and righteousness is like the water pipe. Grace flows to us through the channel of righteousness; it never flows to us by itself. Concerning this, look at Romans 5:21, "In order that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Grace reigns through righteousness. God does not give grace to man independently; He gives His grace to man through righteousness. God is merciful to us and does not want us to die. This is why He sent the Lord Jesus to die for us. This is grace. If God did not love us and had not bestowed grace on us, the Lord Jesus would not have come to accomplish redemption for us. But the Lord has died and redemption has been accomplished. When we believe in the Lord for our salvation, is it God's grace or His righteousness that saves us? God's righteousness saves us. The Lord Jesus has died and we have been redeemed; we are no longer condemned. The Lord's death has become our death, and God has accepted the sacrifice we offered in Christ. What we have obtained today is what we should rightfully have. If God does not save us, He would be unrighteous. Before the cross, we could not say that God was unrighteous if He did not save us; all we could say was that God did not love us. But after the Lord Jesus died and redemption was accomplished, if God does not save us, it would not be a matter of God's not loving or giving grace to us but a matter of His being unrighteous and unfaithful.</P><P>Suppose someone owes me fifty dollars and has written a credit note. If he does not pay back his debt, I can force him to pay me back. Even if I have to sue him to get back my money, I cannot be considered unrighteous; I can only be considered as lacking in mercy and love. However, if I give him fifty dollars, and he pays back his debt, I will be unrighteous if I do not tear up the credit note when I receive the money. If I asked him for more money, I would be unrighteous. What is unrighteousness? It is to demand a second payment after a full payment has been made. It is all right if I do not give anything to him. But if I have given him the money, and he has paid the debt, I have to tear up the credit note.</P><P>We cannot say that God does not have grace. If God did not have grace, there would be no new covenant. But if everything that God has given us were based on grace, our faith would not be strong because grace is not very trustworthy. Man often doubts the good intentions of others. However, God does not just have grace; He has manifested His grace in a covenant. In order to give us grace, He bound Himself to a covenant. Grace is expressed in the form of righteousness so that our faith can be strengthened. It is easier to believe in God's righteousness than it is to believe in God's grace and kindness. Consider, for example, the matter of forgiveness. How do we know that our sins are forgiven? The covenant and Word that God has given provides us the assurance. If we see this, we will have more boldness to come to God. We will not ask Him hesitantly like beggars. We have to realize that when we come to God, we can fellowship with Him according to righteousness. Righteousness does not annul grace. On the contrary, it is the highest expression of God's grace. Now, we can boldly take hold of His covenant and ask of Him. He cannot refuse us.</P><P>Do you remember the story of the woman who wiped the feet of Jesus with her hair as she wept continually? The Lord told Simon, "You did not give Me water for My feet, but she, with her tears, has wet My feet...Her sins which are many are forgiven, because she loved much" (Luke 7:44, 47). The Lord's word referred to the forgiveness of the woman's sins. Yet He said this word to Simon and not to the woman directly. While He was saying this, the woman's sins were forgiven. Although the woman heard it, the Lord realized that this was not enough. Her sins were forgiven. But a person's faith may be strong at one time and weak at another time, or he may wonder if his sins are forgiven and doubt his salvation. For this reason, the Lord purposely and explicitly told her, "Your faith has saved you" (v. 50), even though in reality she was already saved. This did not mean that the woman was only saved at the instant of His word. The Lord said this purposely to give her a "handle" to grasp onto. It is not enough to have the fact of salvation; there must also be the word of salvation. Although she was saved, when she received this word, she received the strength to deal with everything, whether Satan's temptations, man's mockings, or her own doubts. She could lay hold of the Lord's word and say to all these things, "The Lord has said that my faith has saved me."</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> </body></html>
