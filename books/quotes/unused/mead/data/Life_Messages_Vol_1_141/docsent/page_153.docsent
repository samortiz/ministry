   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SHORTCOMING OF THE SPIRITUAL BOOKS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What I am sharing with you is the fruit of what I have learned and experienced these many years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As I have said, in the early years we collected many spiritual books on the way to have a holy, victorious life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We read them and attempted to practice what they taught.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Actually those books did not help us very much.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the matter of overcoming sin, for example, most writers referred us to Romans 6.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You must die, they said, because once you die you are free from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we tried to practice this, however, we could not find the way to die.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually we concluded that reckoning was the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As A. B. Simpson's hymn says,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There's a little word that the Lord has giv'n</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For our help in the hour of need:</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us reckon ourselves to be dead to sin,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be dead and dead indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us reckon, rather than feel;</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us be true to the reck'ning,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And He will make it real.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hymns, #692</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I did a lot of reckoning and discovered that if I did not reckon, sin was somewhat dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more I reckoned, however, the more alive sin became in me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That way did not work, nor did most of the other ways recommended by the Christian writers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually we discovered that the way is Christ John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The way to overcome sin is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The way to die is Christ; when you take Him, you die.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The way to holiness is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The way to pray is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way to study the Bible is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The way to love your wife or submit to your husband is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>JOINED TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we are saved, we are joined to Christ 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Salvation is not merely to be rescued from hell; it is primarily to be joined to the Lord as one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Consequently, His life becomes our life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ today is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He does not live Himself out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No one on the whole earth can see Him directly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Where is He?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ has two concealments, one in heaven and the other on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are His earthly concealment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Christ was on earth, the Father was hidden; the Son lived the Father out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today the principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Son is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are charged to live Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The life is the Son's, and the living is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To realize this is a help when you touch the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Give up your concept that Christ wants to teach you and correct you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The central thought in the Bible is that Christ must be your life and you must live Him out as your living.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You may ask, "Don't I have my own life?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yes, you do, but that life is not the real life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is a life of form, not of reality; it is a container, not the content.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Your life is a container to hold Christ as your life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He wants to be the content of your life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the concept you must bring to your reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you come to the Word for teaching, you are behaving like a disciple of Confucius, not like a believer in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Come to the Bible for more supply of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every morning, when you turn to the Bible, do not look for teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This natural concept is in our blood.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we read other books, we are looking for knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Drop this thought when you turn to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You are coming to it for nourishment, not for instruction.</S>
