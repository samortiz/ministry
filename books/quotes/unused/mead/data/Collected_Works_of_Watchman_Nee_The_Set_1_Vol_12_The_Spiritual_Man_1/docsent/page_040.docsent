   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXHORTATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we let the Spirit do a deeper work by the cross, then the circumcision which we have received will become more real day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh" Phil 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The trust in the flesh has been lost due to the receiving of the circumcision not done by man's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here the apostle makes the boasting in Christ Jesus the center of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He clearly points out to us the danger on the one hand and the security on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To have confidence in the flesh is very damaging to the boasting in Christ Jesus, but to worship in Spirit affords us the blessed joy of life and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Holy Spirit exalts the Lord Jesus, but He abases the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we truly want to boast in Christ and let Him boast in us, and want always to truly glory in Christ Jesus alone in our experience, then, on the one hand, we must have the circumcision of the cross, and on the other hand, we must learn to worship in Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not to strive, because striving is the work of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no need of using methods because only when they have the help of the flesh can they be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is to absolutely distrust the flesh, however good or capable it may be.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only trust the Holy Spirit and obey Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With this kind of trust and obedience, the flesh will be abased and kept in its position of curse and will lose its power.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>May the Lord grant us grace that we may increasingly despise ourselves, regard ourselves as undependable, and realize how useless we are absolutely not trusting our own flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the real death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without death, this is not possible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Only do not turn this freedom into an opportunity for the flesh" Gal 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Death is the flesh's position.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have already obtained freedom in the Lord, but let us not give any opportunity to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must not again unconsciously regard the work of the Spirit as our own.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should always be watchful and not allow the flesh to be rekindled from the ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must not give the glory of the victory to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Otherwise, the flesh will have the opportunity to work again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After you have gained a victory, do not consider that you are now safe, lest you give opportunity to the flesh and your fall become imminent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since the flesh has long lost its power, do not consider that you have now learned everything and that you now have the strength to fight with the flesh and will always be able to win.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you entertain this kind of self-strength and lose your heart of utter dependence, the flesh has already gained the opportunity and will bring you again into a distressing experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The attitude of helplessness should be guarded with holy diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the place where the flesh will attack.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just having a little intention of utilizing the self is an occasion for the flesh to gain an opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not be afraid to lose face before man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Right after the teaching of the crucifixion of the flesh and of walking in the Spirit, the apostle says, "Let us not become vainglorious" v. 26 . If we know how useless we are before God, we must not boast before man either.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we cover the weakness of the flesh before man because we want to receive glory, we will give the flesh an opportunity to work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Holy Spirit can help us and strengthen us, but He cannot replace us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We ourselves must steadfastly maintain an attitude of not giving any occasion to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Make no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts" Rom 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The work of the flesh always has its forerunner.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, we must never leave any ground for it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should always be watchful to see whether the flesh is placed in the position of being cursed and should also examine whether any provision has been made for it in our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A little thought of our own goodness can give the flesh the opportunity to work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The thought is very essential here.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The reason is that, although one may only make provision for the flesh in his thoughts, the secret thought will come forth openly in words and deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The flesh must not have any ground.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In conversing with people, we must also be careful lest, when words are many, the flesh will do its work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although there is much that you love to talk about, if you are not depending on the Spirit in speaking, you should not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Otherwise, you will make provision for the flesh to work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is more so in our deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The flesh has many plans, expectations, and methods.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The flesh has its own opinion, strength, and capability.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All these may be excellent before man as well as in your own eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, never be lenient; never retain even the best and consequently transgress the commandment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should put to death what we think to be the best without any consideration, not for any other reason than because it is of ourselves the flesh .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The righteousness as well as the sins of the flesh should be equally hated.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A good deed done by the flesh should be repented of just as much as a great sin committed by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must always maintain God's view towards the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If, unfortunately, one fails, he must examine himself, confess his sin, and ask for the cleansing of the precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"Let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh" 2 Cor 7:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Never be lenient, concerned, or reluctant to cut off what you love lest you fall more deeply into the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The teaching of the apostles is that we "cleanse ourselves."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is not the work of the Holy Spirit alone nor that of the precious blood alone, but you yourselves also must do the work of cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You search out all the filthinesses of the flesh and commit them to the cross of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although what you have done may not be sinful according to man's view, if it is done by yourself, even the best is also filthy in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>"That which is born of the flesh is flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whether people or things, it is all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God does not care for whatever shell or covering it has.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is the source that God takes heed to.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, one should not only cleanse himself from his sinfulness but also cleanse himself from all the deeds of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"Beloved, I entreat you as strangers and sojourners to abstain from fleshly lusts" 1 Pet 2:11 .</S>
