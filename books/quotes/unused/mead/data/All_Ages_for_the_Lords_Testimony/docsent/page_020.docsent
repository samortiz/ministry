   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONSOLING THE LITTLE-SOULED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Thessalonians 5:14 also speaks of the fainthearted or little-souled Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>. Because some were born with a small soul, they are easily offended, disappointed, or discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Others, on the contrary, were born with a large soul and can withstand a great deal of ill treatment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those with a small soul can bear hardly anything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sooner or later in the church life, you will meet some brothers and sisters who have little souls.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If there were not this kind of person in the church, the Bible would not speak of consoling or comforting the little-souled ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What will you do with them?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You cannot neglect them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you try to avoid them, the Lord will add many more like them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The little-souled ones are needed by the stronger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because the little-souled brothers and sisters cannot withstand hardship, we need to comfort them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to speak to them in a very kind way to keep from offending them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a brother comes to you troubled because his wife is upset, do not say much to him and do not argue with him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, tell him that you will pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead of reasoning with the little-souled ones, you should comfort them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Reasoning will only hurt them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our ability to comfort such a one depends altogether on how much we have experienced of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you have experienced Christ as the incense altar, you will be able to tell a little-souled brother that today Christ, our High Priest, is interceding for him and his problems.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way, you minister Christ to him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not try to comfort the little-souled with mere human words, but comfort him with the Christ you have experienced in various aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a little-souled one is nourished with Christ, he will be comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us learn to comfort the little-souled ones with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>UPHOLDING THE WEAK</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1 Thessalonians 5:14 Paul also tells us to "uphold the weak."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to uphold the weak, or the infirm, we need to experience Christ as the boards, the pillars, and the sockets in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because the weak ones are not steady, they need Christ to be their board, pillar, or socket.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such a Christ will make them strong in standing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>LONGSUFFERING WITH ALL</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Finally, in this verse Paul tells us to be longsuffering with all men.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Admonishing the disorderly, comforting the little-souled, and upholding the weak require patience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The disorderly, the little-souled, and the weak exhaust our natural patience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, to shepherd such saints we need Christ as our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>INCITING, EXHORTING, AND RESTORING</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hebrews 10:24 says, "Let us consider one another for inciting to love and good works."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to this verse, we should consider not only ourselves, but one another.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Consider those who are discouraged and not coming to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you consider them by visiting them or by at least calling them on the telephone, you will incite them to love and good works.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such inciting will increase the mutual love among us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hebrews 10:25 says, "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This verse indicates that none of us should form the habit of staying away from the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, as we see the day approaching, we need to exhort one another.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Galatians 6:1 says that if someone is overtaken in a fault, we need to restore him with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This type of shepherding should be done not only by the elders, but by all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we all do this, the church will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The middle-aged ones care for the church as the Lord's testimony directly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By shepherding, fellowshipping, teaching, comforting, and upholding others, they will bear the burden for the Lord's recovery today.</S>
