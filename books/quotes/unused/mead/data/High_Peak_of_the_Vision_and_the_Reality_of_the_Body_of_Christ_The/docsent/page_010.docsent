   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD BECOMING MAN GOING THROUGH THE CREATION OF MAN AND HIS COMING PERSONALLY TO BECOME MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Tonight I would like to spend some time to speak on how God became man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For God to become man, first He had to create man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God created man according to His image and likeness; this is the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although what God created was man, this man whom He created had the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the first step.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the next step, God personally came to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How did He come to be a man?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He did this by entering into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Physically, this means that He entered into a human virgin to be conceived in her.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Matthew 1 says that God was begotten in Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the law in God's creation, He was conceived in Mary's womb and remained there for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then after He stayed in humanity for nine months, He was born out of humanity with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The man who was born was One who is God yet man and who is also man yet God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christianity has Christmas, Christianity has the manger, and Christianity has the angels announcing the good news.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But concerning what I have just presented to you in a simple way, Christianity does not have a clear seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As such a God-man He passed through human living on the earth and lived a human life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How did He live such a life?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did it by depending on His divine life within and by rejecting His human life without and thus living the life of a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The inner reality of such a God-man living was the divine attributes, and the outward living that was lived out of such a God-man living was the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By thus living the life of a God-man He became a typical example.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, it is not enough for God to have just one man as a typical example, a model.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God needs a mass manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, eventually, He went to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When He went to the cross, He brought with Him the man whom He had become; that is, He put on this man and thus crucified this man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This death of His was an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This death of His was the death of a fallen man, a sinful man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When He became a man, He did not become a God-created man or a holy man; rather, He became a God-created yet fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His flesh was the flesh of sin, except there was no poison of sin, no substance of sin, within it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was merely in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, Romans 8:3 says that He came in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was such a man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, what He brought to the cross to be crucified there was also such a man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through crucifixion He terminated the man of the old creation on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The man of the old creation involves all created things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, His death also terminated everything of the old creation on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The man of the old creation also had sin, so His death on the cross also took away sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, Satan was hidden in the flesh of this sinful man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, Christ's death on the cross not only crucified the flesh but also destroyed Satan Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, His crucifixion was not the end; rather, He was resurrected from death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How was He resurrected?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was resurrected through the power of His divine life with the humanity that He had put on, the part created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In His resurrection He brought humanity into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through His incarnation God brought divinity into humanity, and through His resurrection He brought humanity into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Incarnation is the crucial step He took to bring divinity into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then, later, in His resurrection He brought the humanity which He had put on into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, the God-created human nature was uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Originally, God was not in the human nature which He created.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But now He was resurrected, and all the God-chosen people were resurrected in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His resurrection was to bring the God-created humanity into divinity to be resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is why we say that the human nature was uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Andrew Murray said the same thing, except that the wording he used is different from ours and not as thorough as ours.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this resurrection He brought the humanity which He had put on into divinity and thus became God's firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His becoming the Firstborn was His birth in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is why, concerning Christ's resurrection, Acts 13:33 says, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was already the Son of God, except that He did not have the human nature in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When He became the firstborn Son, He not only had divinity as His life, but He also had the uplifted humanity added to His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is in the mingling of the two natures that He became God's firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus, He was begotten to be God's firstborn Son, and at the same time He regenerated all the God-chosen people 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To use our ordinary language, we may say that we and the Lord as God's firstborn Son were born in the same delivery.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all were born together in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This birth of His was the first step as a foundation for man to become God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now in His resurrection, we as God's chosen ones have been brought into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thus, through regeneration we have received another life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Not only so, He as the last Adam, who in His resurrection brought humanity into divinity, became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Who is this life-giving Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is just like brewing a cup of tea.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When you brew a cup of tea, first you need to have some water, then you put the tea in, and finally you add some lemon and maybe some sugar.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At this point, the tea has been consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christ as God's only begotten Son may be likened to plain water.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At a certain time human nature was added to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then, when He was put to death on the cross, the element of the effectiveness of His death was also added.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Furthermore, He entered into resurrection, so the element of resurrection with its power was also added.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now, as God's only begotten Son He has become God's firstborn Son, and the many sons of God were born together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Besides the element of His divinity, Christ had the elements of His humanity, His experience of human living, and His death and resurrection added into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Thus, He became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This Spirit is also the pneumatic Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hence, this Spirit is the very Christ, the very Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Eventually, our God has become such a One.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>From the day of His resurrection to eternity He will be like this eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When we believe in the Lord, the One whom we receive is such a One, not a shallow Christ as people commonly preach.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Christ whom we know is so profound and so high.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This One is our Redeemer and our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He is not only Jesus Christ but also the One who became the life-giving Spirit, the consummation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is this One who went through all these processes to accomplish the step for Him to become man that He might make man God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>MAN BECOMING GOD GOING THROUGH REGENERATION, SANCTIFICATION, RENEWING, TRANSFORMATION, CONFORMATION, AND GLORIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Then how does God make man God?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>After God regenerates us with Himself as life, He continues to carry out the work of sanctification, renewing, and transformation in us by His Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>God became man through incarnation; man becomes God through transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When the Lord Jesus lived as a man on this earth, once He went up on the mountain and was transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>That transfiguration was a sudden occurrence.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Our transformation into God, however, is not something that happens unexpectedly.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Rather, it is a lifetime transformation until we are conformed to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Eventually, we will enter with Him into glory; that is, we will be redeemed in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>That will be the final step of the redemption of our whole being that brings us into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Therefore, it is through regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification that we may become God.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When we reach this point, 1 John 3:2 says that when "He is manifested, we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is."</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The issue of this process is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This organism is God joining and mingling Himself with man to make God man and also to make man God.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Among the Divine Trinity, as far as the Father is concerned, this organism is the house of the Father, the house of God; as far as the Son is concerned, it is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The house is for God to have a dwelling place, whereas the Body is for God to have an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The ultimate issue is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This shows us how God became man and how afterward He makes man God that man may live a God-man life.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The God-man life that we live today is the model life that Jesus Christ lived on earth by going through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In the Gospel of John the human life of Jesus Christ on earth was a life before death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>In the Epistles the Christian life, the life of a God-man, that we live is a life after death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>In resurrection we are being transformed daily.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Even among us, very few have entered deeply into these mysteries of the Divine Trinity as life.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>I hope that through this word of fellowship we all may be able to see this vision and pursue to enter into the reality of this vision.</S>
