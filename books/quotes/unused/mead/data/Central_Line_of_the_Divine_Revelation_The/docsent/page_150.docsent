   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Neither Circumcision nor Uncircumcision</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>but a New Creation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Galatians 6:15 says, "For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The term circumcision refers to being religious, and uncircumcision refers to being unreligious.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Neither of these means anything as far as the new creation is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only the new creation is what matters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God has no intention of gaining a group of circumcised people or a group of uncircumcised people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He desires to gain a group of regenerated people as His new creation created by Him with His divine life embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We were a part of the old creation, but through regeneration we have become a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although we are a new creation, we are still old in our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We still love and hate in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we need to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our entire being, including our physical body, needs to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The redemption of our body 1 Cor 1:30; Rom 8:23 is the renewing of every part of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This will be the consummation of the renewing of our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are tripartite men composed of spirit, soul, and body 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the time of our regeneration, God entered into our spirit, and immediately our spirit was renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now our soul also needs to be renewed in every part.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Titus 3:5 says, "Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through regeneration our spirit was renewed, but our soul was not renewed by regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, after regeneration the Spirit continues to renew us by saturating our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to Ephesians 1:13, we were sealed with the Holy Spirit as the sealing ink.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a seal that is wet with ink is placed on a piece of paper, the wet ink saturates the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the same way the Holy Spirit as the sealing ink saturates and permeates our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To saturate is to fill or soak deeply, and to permeate is to spread throughout a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Saturation is vertical, and permeation is horizontal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From the day we were regenerated God imparted Himself into us as life embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the same time, He put His Spirit within us as a living seal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From that day the sealing Spirit has been saturating and permeating.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, the Spirit saturates and permeates our soul, including our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, this saturating Spirit of life will reach our mortal body that our body may have life Rom 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This saturation and permeation will continue within us "unto the redemption of the acquired possession" Eph 1:14 , that is, until the redemption of our body Rom 8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The sealing of the Spirit first enters into us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From there it spreads by saturating vertically and permeating horizontally through every part of our soul to reach our body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then it goes on to saturate and permeate our body until one day our body will be fully saturated and permeated, that is, fully redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our body will be redeemed not by the blood of Christ but by the indwelling Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, Paul said that Christ within us is our life today Col 3:4 and our hope of glory in the future 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The redemption of our body is the glorification of our body Rom 8:30; Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When our body is redeemed, we will be wholly, entirely, and completely in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that time we will be thoroughly permeated and saturated with the spreading and permeating Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The foregoing aspects of regeneration, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification are the totality of the process of renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A white cotton ball that becomes saturated with red ink is an example of the process of renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If I inject red ink into the center of a cotton ball for a period of time, the entire cotton ball will become red.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the injection is slow, it may take a longer period of time for the ball to become red.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But eventually, the cotton ball will be completely red.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That is the "glorification" of the cotton ball.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today we are in the process of being renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Through many years of experience I have learned that the things that happen to me are all part of the renewing process.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At first I did not understand why certain things happened to me; but after considering these things for some time, my eyes were opened to see that they were all part of the process of renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Second Corinthians 4:16 says, "Though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>An alternate rendering of this verse is, "Though our outer man is being consumed..."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Day by day we are being renewed by being consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The reason certain things happen to us is that we need to be consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we are consumed, we are renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Through the consuming of our environment, we are renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our relatives are a part of this consuming environment.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our being married or being single also is a part of God's environment to consume us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we were soft like a cotton ball, we could easily receive the injection of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But because we may be hard like marble, the "ink" of the Spirit may be unable to penetrate us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, we need the hammering and grinding of our environment in order to soften us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God may first hammer us and then grind us to powder.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Once we have become powder, we can easily receive the injection of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Actually, we all are somewhat hard.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some of us are like soft stones, while others are harder than steel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whether we are hard or soft, the Lord has a way to work on us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He may use hammers, grinding stones, water, or fire to deal with us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord uses different means in our environment to consume us so that we can be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No matter who we are, the Lord has a way to renew us through the consuming of our environment.</S>
