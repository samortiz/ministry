<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Allowing Everyone to Have<br>the Full Opportunity to Serve the Lord</H2><P>One responsible brother once assigned some sisters to make some tablecloths. After the sisters tried for a few times, the brother was still not satisfied. In the end, when he asked other sisters to help, no one dared to try it anymore. Yet this brother could not do the work himself. His disposition was too strong, and he had frightened others away. If he would repent of his way, he may be able to gain one or two hundred brothers and sisters. The Lord has been very much restricted by us. We have offended the Lord within us. We should afford all the brothers and sisters full opportunity to serve the Lord, to offer up their possessions, and to give up everything they have for the Lord. Everything should be consecrated, whether it is the person or the things. If we do this, the church will become the Lord's blessing to others.</P><P>If you assign a brother to do something, you have to first pray and consider much. Moreover, when you speak concerning it, your words have to be accurate. The matter should first be discussed among a few people, and then presented to the brothers. In helping a brother, you should try your best to utilize his strong points. To perfect a person, we have to do it slowly.</P><P>Hong Kong is a gold mine, not in the literal sense, but as far as talents are concerned. If someone would work there diligently, it would affect the whole of southern China. We should pray that the Lord would use us. Shanghai is the center of the whole of China. Swatow is the center for Singapore and Ceylon. Hong Kong is the international center. Our work today cannot be like that of traditional Christianity; we cannot have a pastor to take over everything any longer. Instead, we should have every brother and sister rising up to work and to preach the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Perfecting Men for the Migration</H2><P>Concerning migration, the brothers and sisters in Hong Kong can migrate to Southeast Asia. In the church in Chefoo, once over sixty people migrated west from Chefoo to Inner Mongolia and the Ningsia regions. Their traveling expenses were all taken care of by the church. May the Lord change our view so that we can see clearly the things of God. At the same time, if we are not proper ourselves, there is no way that we can perfect others. If some have passed through some serious dealings in the basic matters, the work ahead will have a free course. Some works experience periodic revivals. But after the revivals, everything subsides again. Time and time again there are consecrations, but no essential personnel are produced. If we do not produce fresh recruits, mere revivals are useless. From this, you can see the crucial need of perfecting others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD THE DENOMINATIONS</H2><P>We left the denominations not only because they are wrong, but because they have not come up to God's standard. If there were the possibility of joining or uniting with them, there would not have been the need for another group. There is an absolute difference, rather than a relative difference, between them and us. Some have asked if we can help the denominations. My answer is that we are like a shopkeeper. If others ask the shopkeeper for help, he would say that he does not have the time. He works every day from eight in the morning until night. Brothers and sisters, we do not need to ask how the elders should deal with the denominations. Those who help others to work do so because they have no work of their own. Our work today is not a scattered work. The question is not whether or not we can cooperate with others or help others. The question is whether or not we know what we are doing. A person who does a scattered work is one who does not know what kind of ground he stands on or what work he is doing. Those who are engaged in serious work will not walk into another's office asking for help, for they know that others are busy also.</P><P>You may say that the work of sweeping the streets and hauling fertilizer is low, but some people are doing this work also. I would not criticize others' work, nor would I oppose others' labor. However, I know what my own responsibility is. There are always people who will sweep the streets, and there are always people who will pick up the trash. Today I cannot do something merely because it is a good thing to do. Others may say that this is good and that is good. It is true that street-sweeping is good and that hauling fertilizer is not bad. There is the need for both. But the question is this: what does God want you to do? Already I do not have enough time to speak what the Lord wants me to speak. How can I find the time to oppose others' work? It is not a question of opposing or cooperating, but a question of what we are doing here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING THE APPOINTING OF ELDERS</H2><P>The elders are produced mainly not through appointment but through manifestation. It is a matter of the growth in life. If a person can do many things only after he has been appointed to be an elder and will not do anything if he is not appointed, something is wrong. Can I appoint Mrs. Chow to be the mother of her four sons? And can I remove her from being a mother after a while? If you appoint her, she is a mother. If you do not appoint her, she is still a mother. Her being a mother is not due to your appointment, but to her relationship in life. Who is an elderly person? This is something relative. If a certain brother is the most elderly among us and another person comes along who is thirteen years older than this one, naturally this second one is the more elderly one. There is no question about this. The same is true with respect to spiritual maturity. If you have maturity, you have it, and maturity will manifest itself. It is best for the work of appointing the elders to be done by the co-workers. The same is true with the appointment of the deacons. To serve the Lord is not a question of a profession. The main thing is that we put ourselves in the church. The most necessary thing for a servant of the Lord to have is absoluteness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ON BEING A GENUINE PERSON<br>IN ORDER TO SERVE THE LORD</H2><P>I know people in the same way that Brother Cheng knows his trade&#151;silk embroidery. The minute he touches a fabric, he knows what kind of material it is made of. We have to be a genuine person. You may have a hot temper, or a bad disposition. But even if you oppose and criticize, you have to be genuine. We must be a genuine person if we are to serve the Lord.</P>
