   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE FORTY-TWO THE MINISTRY OF THE MAN-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS HUMAN VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH HIS DIVINE ATTRIBUTES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FROM GALILEE TO JERUSALEM 20 Scripture Reading: Luke 18:31 19:10</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we shall cover 18:31 19:10.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These verses cover three matters: the Lord s unveiling of His death and resurrection the third time vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>31-34 ; His healing a blind man near Jericho vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>35-43 ; and His saving Zaccheus in Jericho 19:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>UNVEILING HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE THIRD TIME</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While the Man-Savior was making the long journey from Galilee to Jerusalem, He spoke to His disciples about many things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 18:31 He took the twelve aside in order to speak a private word to them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This word spoken privately to the disciples concerned His going to Jerusalem to die.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verses 31 through 33 this word is recorded in some detail: Behold we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things will be accomplished which have been written through the prophets regarding the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For He will be delivered up to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and outrageously treated and spit upon; and when they have scourged Him, they will kill Him; and on the third day He will rise.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is significant that in verse 31 the Lord does not say, Behold I am going up to Jerusalem ; instead, He says, Behold we are going up to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was the third time the Lord Jesus revealed His death to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first was in Caesarea Philippi, before His transfiguration 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The second was in Galilee, after His transfiguration 9:44-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This time, the third time, was on the way to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This revelation was a prophecy, altogether strange to the natural concept of the disciples, yet fulfilled literally in every detail.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have seen that the Man-Savior had predicted His death and resurrection twice already.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since the time for His death had come, He was going to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was His obedience to God unto death Phil 2:8 , according to the counsel of God Acts 2:23 , for the fulfillment of His redemptive plan Isa 53:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He knew that through His death He would be glorified in resurrection Luke 24:25-26 and that His divine life would be released to produce many brothers for His expression John 12:23-24; Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For the joy set before Him, He despised the shame Heb 12:2 and volunteered to be delivered to the Satan-usurped leaders of the Jews and condemned by them to death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this God exalted Him to the heavens, seated Him at His right hand Mark 16:19; Acts 2:33-35 , gave Him the name which is above every name Phil 2:9-10 , made Him both Lord and Christ Acts 2:36 , and crowned Him with glory and honor Heb 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Luke 18:34 says, And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know what was being said.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may compare the Man-Savior s word to His disciples concerning His death to beautiful music played to those who do not appreciate such music.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The disciples were not able to appreciate the music played to them by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They did not understand anything the Lord said.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although He used simple words, they could not comprehend what He was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why were the disciples not able to grasp the Lord s word concerning His death and resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The reason for their inability to understand was that they were altogether in another kingdom, in their own kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because they were in their own kingdom, they did not have a heart for the things of the kingdom of God.</S>
