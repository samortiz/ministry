[1]  If you want to do this work, you must like the young people, care for them, and be concerned about their affairs.
[2]  Furthermore, nearly every work that the young people were called by God to do was a work that turned the age.
[3]  I would like to tell you, brothers and sisters, that because we saw this, we have been paying much attention to the young people's work for nearly twenty years.
[4]  It is a universally accepted fact that a person receives education for twenty-five years, gains experience for another twenty-five years, and then becomes truly useful in the final twenty-five years.
[5]  I hope all our young people will live for seventy-five years twenty-five years to receive spiritual education, another twenty-five years to gain spiritual experience, and the final twenty-five years to be used by God.
[6]  However, brothers and sisters, please consider: Unless there is a group of young people who are saved to receive proper spiritual help today, how can they gain the experience and be used by the Lord in the future?
[7]  If there are young brothers and sisters raised up by the Lord, and if we are preserved to give them an absolutely positive leading instead of erroneous limitations, then there is no need to wait until the Lord takes us away; even today they can become useful in the Lord's hands.
[8]  In the same manner, when you visit a church, if you see throngs of young people there, then you should praise the Lord that the church has a future.
[9]  First of all, I have already said this earlier, but now I want to say it again: If you want to help the young people, you must have an interest in them.
[10]  Helping the young brothers and sisters depends not on your ability to give them messages but on your regular, frequent contacts with them.
[11]  When you contact the young brothers and sisters, do not begin by asking, "How many chapters of the Bible have you read today?
[12]  The reason you refrain from mentioning the Lord Jesus is that as you maintain contact with him, seemingly you are retreating, yet actually you are advancing.
[13]  Fifth, all those who have a desire to do the young people's work need to learn how to match and adapt to the young people.
[14]  We who do the young people's work should be like glue, so that it does not matter if a young person is soft or hard or if he is three-dimensional, flat, or a surface with bumps and dents; we still need to stick to him.
[15]  Sixth, all those who care for the work among the young people must pay attention to doing a personal work.
[16]  When you have personal contact with young people, on the one hand, you need to have broad contact with them, treating every one of them equally; on the other hand, you need to have specific contact.
[17]  Therefore, in doing the work among the young people, on the one hand, you need to have broad contact with them, dealing with them in a general way; on the other hand, you need to have specific contact, helping the ones who can take the lead and influence others.
