   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE REVELATION OF THE PSALMS BEGINNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE PSALMIST STRESSING THE LAW AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH THE SPIRIT TURNING THE PSALMIST TO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The revelation of the Psalms begins with the psalmist stressing the law and with the Spirit turning the psalmist to Christ Psa 1 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the psalmist began in Psalm 1 by stressing the law, he was going in the wrong direction.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the first psalm, the psalmist seeking after God was driving on the wrong highway, so the Spirit came in to turn him to the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Psalm 2 the psalmist began to enjoy Christ to take refuge in this Christ and to kiss this Christ v. 12 . The highest and best enjoyment of human life is kissing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When a child is born, the parents and grandparents enjoy kissing this child.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a person had no one whom he could kiss, he would surely be one of the most miserable people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Psalm 2:12 commands us to "kiss the Son."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Kissing Christ is the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some may wonder where the word enjoyment is in the Bible concerning our relationship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although this word is not in the Bible, the fact of the enjoyment of Christ is there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is the same with the words trinity and triune.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although these words are not in the Bible, the early church fathers discovered the fact in the Bible that our God is triune, that He is the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In like manner, the word enjoyment is not found in the Scriptures, but the fact is there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Psalm 2 we are told to kiss the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Son is a pleasant title.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Kissing the Son is enjoying the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The enjoyment of Christ in the Psalms begins with kissing the Son in Psalm 2.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This enjoyment continues in Psalm 8, in which the psalmist declares, "How excellent is Your name/In all the earth!" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>1, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Psalm 16 is also full of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 11 of this psalm says, "You will make known to Me the path of life;/In Your presence is fullness of joy;/In Your right hand there are pleasures forever."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Psalm 22 gives us a very vivid picture of Christ's death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It also shows us His church-producing resurrection v. 22 . In Christ's resurrection His God is our God, His Father is our Father John 20:17 , and we are His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The apostle Paul quoted Psalm 22:22 in Hebrews 2:12, pointing out that the Lord's brothers are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Psalm 23 is full of the enjoyment of Christ as our Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many Christians love Psalm 23, but not many have the realization that in this psalm they need to kiss Christ as the Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We saw in the previous message that Christ as the Shepherd leads us through five stages of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first stage is that of the green pastures and the waters of rest v. 2 . The second stage is the paths of righteousness v. 3 , and the third stage is the experience of Christ's presence through the valley of the shadow of death v. 4 . The fourth stage is the deeper and higher enjoyment of the resurrected Christ, in which we enjoy the Lord's table in the presence of our adversaries v. 5 . This implies that we are enjoying the Lord on the battlefield.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fifth and final stage is the lifelong enjoyment of the divine goodness and kindness in the house of Jehovah v. 6 . Psalm 24 goes on to show that the victorious Christ as the King of glory is coming to reign as the King in God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All these points in the Psalms indicate that Christ is enjoyable.</S>
