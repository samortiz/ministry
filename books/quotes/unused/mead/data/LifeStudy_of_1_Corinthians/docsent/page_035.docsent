   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWELVE PARTAKING OF CHRIST AS OUR PORTION Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:2, 9; 6:17; 10:16-17 IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our Christ is the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As God incarnate, He lived as a man on earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through His death on the cross, He crucified the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In so doing, He brought creation back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now that Christ has terminated us on the cross, what He has terminated He is replacing with Himself in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, the life-giving Spirit is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, resurrection is not merely a thing or a matter it is a living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today the wonderful Person of Christ, the One through whom all things were created, the One who has passed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This Spirit is the ultimate and consummate expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If someone asks us where we are today, we should say that we are in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Resurrection is the life-giving Spirit, the life-giving Spirit is Christ, and Christ is the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the book of 1 Corinthians Paul deals with eleven problems.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Six of these problems are covered in the first ten chapters, and five are covered in the last six chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first six problems are division, lawsuits, incest, the abuse of freedom in eating and in marriage, the question of marriage itself, and the eating of sacrifices to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All these problems are related to humanity, to human life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The second group of problems involves the realm of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These five problems involve headship, the Lord s table, spiritual gifts, resurrection, and the gift of material things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In dealing with the problem of resurrection Paul utters a wonderful word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 15:45 he says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Christ was simply the last Adam, He was not yet in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, He was in the flesh, in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But through death He entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now in resurrection He is no longer in the flesh, for He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This life-giving Spirit is the reality of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we are in the spirit, we are in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Resurrection is life which overcomes death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are truly in resurrection experientially, we are fresh and living, with life bubbling up from within.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In such a case, we can be compared to a green plant.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A living plant may be used as an illustration of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a plant is flourishing and blossoming, we may say that it is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if the plant is withering and dying, we cannot say that it is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Likewise, if we are living and fresh, we are truly in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if we sit in the meetings in a formal, religious way, we certainly are not in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the contrary, for the most part, we are still in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>PAUL S WAYS OF DEALING WITH PROBLEMS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have pointed out that the first six problems covered in 1 Corinthians are related to human living.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul s way of dealing with these problems is very different from the way practiced by today s ministers and pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, if a married couple has a problem and consults their pastor, he will deal with their problem either in a religious way or in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul s way is profound and very difficult to describe.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His way of dealing with problems is gradually revealed in the first ten chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul s way is spiritual and uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may liken his way to a chain which has many parts linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The first chapter of this Epistle begins with one part of the chain, and the last chapter ends with another part.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul begins with the word in 1:2 concerning Christ being theirs and ours.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The problems among the believers at Corinth were all due to the fact that they were neglecting Christ as their unique portion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Their portion was not Greek philosophy or worldly wisdom; it was the all-inclusive Christ ministered by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This all-inclusive Christ is both theirs and ours.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that He is our unique portion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a couple having problems in married life were to contact Paul, he would not help them in a religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He would not charge the husband to love his wife or the wife to submit to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This, however, is the way practiced by pastors today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul s way of dealing with human problems is very different.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even his word in 1:2 concerning the called saints, those sanctified in Christ Jesus, and those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours, is a word related to the problems covered in this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although this verse does not appear to be part of Paul s way of approaching human problems, it actually contains the spiritual riches used by Paul to solve the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>According to this verse, we Christians must realize that the all-inclusive Christ is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Furthermore, we are called saints, those who have been called by God to call upon the dear and precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If a married sister calls on the name of the all-inclusive Christ, she will be truly submissive to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The reason wives are not submissive is that they are short of the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sisters, when you have trouble being submissive to your husbands, simply call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I assure you that after calling a few times, the Lord will touch you and supply you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Spontaneously you will become a very submissive wife.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the result of enjoying Christ as your portion.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Over the years sisters have often come to me with problems concerning married life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In many cases I not only sympathized with the sisters, but also agreed with them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the early years of my ministry I behaved in the same way many pastors do.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I encouraged the sisters to read Ephesians 5 and also to pray, even with fasting if necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Many times a sister would return to say that what I had suggested did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All I could do then was tell the sister to be comforted and that I would try to help her.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Actually, I was not any help whatever.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Gradually I learned that problems in married life are not solved simply by praying and reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Nourishment and life supply are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We cannot receive the nourishment we need simply from the Bible in black and white letters, for what we need is the living Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>By pray-reading the Word and by calling on the name of the Lord, we receive the needed nourishment and supply.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When a sister is supplied in this way, she can find the solution to the problem she faces with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Sometimes when I call on the name of the Lord Jesus, I am deeply touched by Him and even weep.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This touch then becomes my nourishment, supply, and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Moreover, I have realized that by calling on the name of the Lord, I can do things which I am not able to do in my own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is the enjoyment of Christ according to 1:2.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we call on the name of the Lord Jesus in every place, we shall know that Christ is ours, and we shall enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>First Corinthians 1:9 says, God is faithful, through Whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We have been called into the fellowship of the all-inclusive Christ as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This fellowship is nothing less than the living Person of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This means that we have been called into this Person and into His fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>God has called us into Christ for our co-participation and enjoyment.</S>
