   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A THOROUGH CONFESSION OF SINS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following repentance, you need to make a confession of your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You have to confess all your sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This forgiving, this cleansing, depends on our confession.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to make a thorough confession.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Someone may ask what sins are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a real problem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How can we define sins?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 4 of chapter three says, "Everyone who practices sin practices lawlessness also, and sin is lawlessness."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sin is to transgress the law, to break the law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Any kind of transgression of the law is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Scriptures there is the law, which includes not only the Ten Commandments but many bylaws and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Ten Commandments do not tell us to love our neighbor as ourselves, but this is an item of the regulations with the law; it is a part of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you do not love others, you are breaking the law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Any kind of transgression of the law is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Ten Commandments there is a commandment that says we must honor our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Have you always honored your parents?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not think that as an old person I am condemning the young generation, but I do realize that today's generation is wrong in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes teenage children tell their parents, "You are too old.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You do not know what is right; I do."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To take this kind of attitude toward your parents is sin, because it is a transgression of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Ten Commandments there is another commandment that tells us we should not steal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Someone may say that he never steals from others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not believe you have never stolen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In actuality, you have stolen many times.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many students steal answers in order to pass their examinations.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some children even steal from their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no need for me to go into detail.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You know all the stories better than I do.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All those are sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Any kind of transgression of the law is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First John 5:17a says, "All unrighteousness is sin."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Unrighteousness and injustice are sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you are not righteous and just, that is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this country, in the Far East, and in Europe, many people are not just and righteous when they go to the market.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They try to get more than what they pay for.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I present this simple definition to you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sin is the transgression of law.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sin is unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Anything unjust and unrighteous is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to be a proper believer in Christ, you have to confess all your sins; you must make a thorough confession.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You may not consider that you are sinful, but if you desire to take care of this need, go to spend some time with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You now proclaim that you believe in Jesus, and you have made the decision for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That is good.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since this is so, spend some time with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Consider all your relationships with your parents, your wife, your husband, your children, and your schoolmates, roommates, friends, and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>While you are considering all these relationships, the Holy Spirit may come to you and say, "You are wrong with your parents in a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Ten years ago you were wrong in certain things with your father.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You are wrong with your schoolmates, wrong with your neighbors, wrong with this man, and wrong with that man."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In addition, when many Christians check all the material things in their possession, they will find out how many sinful things they have.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In order to be a living, proper believer in Christ, you need to have such a dealing, such a confession to confess all your sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we go to help others, we have to pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We ourselves first have to be cleansed by confession.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then we will have the ground and will be in the atmosphere to help people to realize their need for cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By the grace and the anointing of the Holy Spirit, we will be able to help people to realize that they need this kind of confession.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Why are so many Christians dead?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is because they have so many old sins.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The old sins still remain within them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They have to confess all those things away.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Every believer needs a confession of all his sinful things before God and a clearance of his whole life.</S>
