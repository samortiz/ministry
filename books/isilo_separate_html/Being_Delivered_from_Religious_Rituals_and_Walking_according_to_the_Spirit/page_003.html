<p>Matthew 3:16 says, &ldquo;Having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him.&rdquo; When the Lord was about thirty years of age, He began to minister. Although He was filled with the Spirit inwardly, He still needed to have the Spirit upon Him. The Lord went to John to be baptized. After His baptism, when He came out of the water, the heavens opened, and the Spirit descended upon Him. By being conceived of the Holy Spirit, the Lord was filled with the Holy Spirit. In His baptism the Spirit was poured upon Him. Hence, He was filled within with the Spirit and clothed without with the Spirit. The Lord was saturated with the Spirit within and engulfed by the Spirit without. This was the preparation for the Lord Jesus to begin His ministry.</p>
<p>However, this is not emphasized in Christianity. If someone in Christianity desires to be a preacher, he does not need to be filled with the Spirit, nor does he need the outpouring of the Spirit. Rather, he must study theology and preferably obtain a Doctorate of Divinity. May the Lord grant us mercy to see that serving the Lord is not a matter of education, talent, or knowledge; it is a matter of the Spirit. All that matters is the Spirit. We need the Spirit within and the Spirit without, the Spirit&rsquo;s infilling and the Spirit&rsquo;s outpouring. We need the Spirit within and without.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST LIVING THE HUMAN LIFE<br />
ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Matthew 4:1 says, &ldquo;Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil.&rdquo; In the previous section, we saw that the Lord Jesus had the Spirit within and without; however, He was still a man. As such, His actions were those of a man. However, His actions were also led by the Holy Spirit. He went wherever the Spirit led Him. He was a person who lived in the Spirit; that is, He was a person who walked according to the Spirit.</p>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s purpose in tempting the Lord was to cause the Lord to leave His standing as a man. Satan tempted Him and said, &ldquo;If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread&rdquo; (v. 3). Satan wanted the Lord to take His position as the Son of God rather than as a man. However, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone&rdquo; (v. 4). The Lord remained in His position as a man. Although the Lord was a man, He was led by the Holy Spirit. The Lord was a man, but He lived in the Spirit.</p>
<p>Suppose a sister says that since she is filled with the Holy Spirit, she no longer wants to be a wife, or suppose a brother says that he has been a husband for many years, bearing the burden of his family, just like a cow dragging a cart, but now that he is filled with the Spirit, he no longer wants to be a husband. Such statements are not of the Spirit. A husband should still be a husband, but with the Spirit he can be a better and more proper husband. Formerly, he was a husband according to his ideas. After being filled with the Spirit, he is a husband according to the Spirit. A wife cannot resign from being a wife after being filled with the Spirit. Formerly, she was a wife in herself, but after being filled with the Spirit, she can be a wife in the Spirit. Formerly, she was a wife without the Spirit, but now she is a wife filled with the Spirit, clothed with the Spirit, and according to the Spirit. In this situation Satan has no way to deal with her.</p>
<p>It is a failure to be a wife without the Spirit, and it is also a failure to have the Spirit and not want to be a wife. Satan&rsquo;s way is to push us to either extreme, that is, either to be a wife without the Spirit or to be full of the Spirit but not a wife. A sister may say that instead of cooking and taking care of her home, she will go out to preach the gospel because it is right to listen to God rather than man. Another sister may say that she will take care of her home and be a good wife whether or not she is filled with the Spirit. Both situations are not according to the Spirit.</p>
<p>Similarly, the young saints are children to their parents. They cannot resign and say that they will no longer be children. This is what God has arranged for them. When we were born, we were assigned the role of being children. We cannot stop being children, but we should not be children without the Spirit. The young saints should be filled with the Spirit within and without. They should be first-class children, excellent children, children in the Spirit.</p>
<p>We should never think that the Holy Spirit always leads us to a good place. The Holy Spirit led the Lord Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan. After being filled with the Spirit, a young brother may say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Since the Lord cares for me and I am filled with the Spirit, my father will receive me.&rdquo; If his father opposes him and his mother is unhappy with him, he might say, &ldquo;I quit! My father is unreasonable, and my mother is unsuitable to be a mother. I will forget about them and follow the Spirit. I will go to the church and follow Jesus.&rdquo; If he wants to follow Jesus, he should go home. His home is his &ldquo;wilderness.&rdquo; He should never say that his father is unreasonable. His father is a good father, and his mother is a good mother. He must learn to be a son in the Spirit.</p>
<p>Christianity has lost its power because it has lost the Spirit. The churches in the recovery also lack power because the churches also need more of the Spirit. May the Lord enlighten us to see our need to live in the Holy Spirit. This does not mean that we should only care for our families or do housework, but those who live in the Spirit are more diligent in their housework, and they are more thorough in the Spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
