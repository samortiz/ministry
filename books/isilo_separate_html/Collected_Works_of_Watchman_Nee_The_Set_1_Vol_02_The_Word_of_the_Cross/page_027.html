The size, height, and dimensions must first be drawn out in detail. Only then can he carry out his plan according to his design. Most modern buildings are designed in this way before they are built.</P><P>The Israelites in the wilderness also had a design for the tabernacle before it was built. They did not build the tabernacle carelessly according to their imagination. Rather, Moses received instructions from Jehovah, who showed him the pattern on the mount and then revealed the items of the tabernacle to him one by one. After this, Moses built accordingly. The building of the tabernacle was according to a plan and carried out according to the plan. Even the smallest detail of the tabernacle was specified by God. An object as small as a needle had to be made with material specified by the Lord. Moses had no freedom to design even the smallest object of the tabernacle. The entire tabernacle, including its many parts, was designed absolutely by God, and the chosen people were only asked to make them accordingly.</P><P>Man's life and daily work are planned by God. God has a plan for the life and daily activities of every believer. He has His good will concerning everyone who is redeemed by the blood. God has a plan concerning every move and act of a regenerated child of His. Since the Father has His plans, He desires that a Christian walk according to these plans.</P><P>If an ignorant builder disregards the careful plans of an architect and builds according to his own way, he will surely fail. If the Israelites did not build the tabernacle according to Jehovah's instructions, how could their work be accepted? In the same way, if a Christian does not walk according to God's plan for him, he will surely fall. The reason believers fail is because they disobey God's will. Here a question arises: "How can we know God's will?" Many believers think that they have not rejected God's will because they say that they love God's will. But they do not do God's will because they do not know God's will. We do not need to consider those who have no heart to carry out God's will. But whoever has their heart set on doing God's will must confront a big problem: "How can we know God's will?" Many brothers and sisters in the Lord have this problem. They have consecrated themselves to the Lord and desire to please the Lord. They love to do God's will, but they do not know God's will concerning their life and work. They do not know God's will concerning many matters. They grope in darkness and easily fall into errors. God's children have shed many tears and endured many heartbreaks because of this. Even though this is a painful matter, we should realize the following points:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IT IS GOD'S RESPONSIBILITY TO REVEAL HIS WILL</H2><P>It is easy to understand God's will. If God wants us to do His will, He will surely make His will known to us. He cannot expect us to walk according to His will if He does not tell us His will. If He does not reveal His will to us, He will have to bear the responsibility of our mistakes when we err. It is God's responsibility to reveal and make known to us His will. Suppose a father wants a son to do a certain thing on a certain day, yet does not tell the son. If the son does what he normally does on the specified day and does not do what his father desires, whose responsibility is this? Is it the son's responsibility? No, it is the father's responsibility. If a father does not tell him his will, and the son fails to do the father's will through ignorance, the blame should not be on the son. If a father wants his son to do anything, he has to tell him. Our Father surely cares for us. If He desires that we walk in His will, He must first tell us His will. In our beloved Lord's parable of the two sons, the father wanted his sons to work in the vineyard and told them his intention. The son who followed his instructions was obedient, while the one who did not follow his instructions was disobedient. Thank God the Father! He will reveal His secret plans to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IT IS OUR FAULT IF WE DO NOT KNOW GOD'S WILL</H2><P>We know that God will tell us what He requires and make us clear concerning His will. But in our experience, is it not also true that even if we want to know God's will, there are many times when we do not know His will? Why is this? God desires that we know His will. Why do we not know His will? If we do not know His will, there must be something wrong on our side because, on His side, it is necessary for us to know His will. There must be some kind of hindrance on our side if we do not know God's will. Abraham was always obedient before God. When God intended to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, the Bible says, "And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?" (Gen. 18:17). There must be no barrier between God and us so He can reveal His will to us. Otherwise, even if God wants to reveal His will to us, we will not have an open heart to receive it, and we will not be able to see, hear, or understand it. Harmony with God is an important condition for knowing His will.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> </body></html>
