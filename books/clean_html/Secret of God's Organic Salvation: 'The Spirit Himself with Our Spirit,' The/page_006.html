<h2 class="head2">G. By Exercising the Spirit</h2><p>The experiences of the foregoing points (A through F) are all by exercising the spirit of a repentant and saved sinner through prayer to call on the name of the Lord (Eph. 6:18; Rom. 10:13). Just as we exercise our feet by walking, so we exercise our spirit by praying. According to Ephesians 6:18 every time we pray we should exercise our spirit. Furthermore, to pray is mainly to call on the name of the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">H. Receiving the Word of God</h2><p>The experiences of the foregoing points are also by receiving the living and abiding word of God (the word of the Spirit of life&mdash;John 6:63; 1 Pet. 1:23). First we need to exercise our spirit to contact the living Spirit, and then we need to receive the living and abiding word of God, the word of the Spirit of life.</p><h2 class="head2">I. Receiving the Spirit of Sonship</h2><p>A saved one receives the Spirit of sonship in his spirit (Gal. 4:5-6; Rom. 8:15). The Spirit we have received is the Spirit of sonship, and this Spirit makes us a son of God.</p><h2 class="head2">J. The Witnessing of the Spirit of God<br />with Our Spirit</h2><p>The Spirit of God with our spirit witnesses that we, the regenerated believers, are the children of God (Rom. 8:16). First, the Spirit regenerates us in our spirit, and then He witnesses with our spirit that we, the regenerated ones, are the children of God.</p><h2 class="head2">K. The Sons of God</h2><p>Romans 8:14 says, &ldquo;As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.&rdquo; When we follow the leading of the Spirit in our daily living, this is an evidence that we are a son of God.</p><h2 class="head2">L. A Part of the Bride as the Increase of Christ</h2><p>A regenerated believer in Christ is a part of the bride as the increase of Christ the Bridegroom (John 3:3, 5-6, 29-30). The regenerated believers in Christ are not part of a company going to heaven; they are a part of the bride of Christ. Many preach the gospel by quoting the word in John 3 about being born again, but not many connect the word concerning regeneration in the first part of John 3 with the word concerning the bride in the last part of this chapter. John 3:29a says, &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom,&rdquo; and verse 30a says, &ldquo;He must increase.&rdquo; The increase in verse 30 is the bride in verse 29, and the bride is a composition of all the regenerated believers. According to the context, therefore, all the regenerated persons are parts of the bride, and the bride is the increase of the Bridegroom, just as Eve was the increase of Adam.</p><h2 class="head2">M. Learning to Worship God</h2><p>Every child of God should learn to worship God, who is Spirit, with his regenerated spirit mingled with God&rsquo;s Spirit as one spirit (John 4:24; 1 Cor. 6:17).</p><h2 class="head2">N. Needing to Serve God</h2><p>A child of God should also serve God with his spirit in the gospel (Rom. 1:9; 12:11). We should both worship God and serve God in our regenerated spirit.</p>
