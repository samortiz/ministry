   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Though two people are involved, the wife's living is her husband's. When there are two livings in married life, the result is separation and divorce.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Too many Christians study the black and white instructions in Ephesians 5 without ever getting the secret of such a wonderful life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When a couple has only one life and one living, that is heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps I may illustrate with my own marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Most of the time there is harmony in our home, with one life and one living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes, however, my wife lives her life and I live mine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One cause of trouble between us is her concern for my health.</S>
