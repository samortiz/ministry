   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FIFTY LIVING IN LOVE AND LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to 5:1-14.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This portion of Ephesians covers the matter of living in love and light, the fourth item of a walk worthy of God s calling.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. AS BELOVED CHILDREN,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>BECOMING IMITATORS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 1 says, Become therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul s word here is an imperative, a command.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He commands us to become imitators of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What a glorious fact that since we are His beloved children, we can be imitators of God!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the children of God, we have His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We imitate God, not by our natural life, but by His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is by our Father s life that we, His children, can be perfect as He is Matt 5:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the New Testament, the believers in Christ are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As God s children, we have God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John 1:13 says that we have been born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To be born of God is to have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, 2 Peter 1:4 says that we are partakers of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because we have the divine life and the divine nature, we can be imitators of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Imitating God in this way is much different from training a monkey to imitate a man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A monkey does not have human life or human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But we have the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we can be imitators of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>WALKING IN LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 2 Paul issues another commandment: Walk in love.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As grace and truth are the basic elements in 4:17-32, so love 5:2, 25 and light 5:8, 9, 13 are the basic elements in the apostle s exhortation in 5:1-33.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Grace is the expression of love, and love is the source of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Truth is the revelation of light, and light is the origin of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is love and light 1 John 4:8; 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When God is expressed and revealed in the Lord Jesus, His love becomes grace and His light becomes truth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After we have, in the Lord Jesus, received God as grace and realized Him as truth, we come to Him and enjoy His love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Love and light are deeper than grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, the apostle firstly takes grace and truth as the basic elements for exhortation and then love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This implies that he wants our daily life to grow deeper, from the outward elements to the inward.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Love is the substance of God within, whereas light is the element of God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is possible to sense the love of God inwardly, and it is possible to see the light of God shining out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our walk in love should be constituted of both the loving substance and the shining element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This should be the inner source of our walk.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is deeper than grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul commands us to walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 4:32 the apostle presents God as the pattern for our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here he sets forth Christ as the example for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There it is God in Christ as our pattern since, in that section, God s grace and truth expressed in the life of Jesus are taken as the basic elements.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to 4:32, we are to forgive others as God in Christ has forgiven us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that God is the pattern of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But in chapter five Christ Himself is our example since, in this section, love expressed by Christ to us vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>2, 25 and light shined by Christ upon us v. 14 are taken as the basic elements.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here Christ, who loved us and gave Himself up for us, is the example of walking in love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul says that Christ gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the Bible there is a difference between an offering and a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>An offering is for fellowship with God, whereas a sacrifice is for redemption from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ gave Himself up for us both as an offering to have fellowship with God and as a sacrifice to redeem us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In loving us Christ gave Himself up for us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was for us, but it was a sweet-smelling savor to God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In following His example, our walk in love should not only be something for others, but also a sweet-smelling savor to God.</S>
