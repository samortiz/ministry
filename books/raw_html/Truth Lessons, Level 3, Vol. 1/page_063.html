<h2 class="head3">1. Christ&rsquo;s Death on the Cross<br />Healing Our Sicknesses</h2><p>Since Christ bore up our sins on the cross, He also bore up our sicknesses, which come from sin (Isa. 53:4-5). Hence, whenever we have sickness, we should take the cross on which Christ suffered the bitterness of death on our behalf and apply it to every aspect of our being. Then the resurrection life of Christ becomes our healing power, and He becomes our Healer.</p><h2 class="head3">2. If We Diligently Keep God&rsquo;s Word,<br />We Will Be Spared the Diseases<br />of the Worldly People</h2><p>Because the worldly people generally despise and disobey God&rsquo;s word, they are plagued by sicknesses. If, contrary to what they do, we give heed to God&rsquo;s word in the resurrection life, God will become our healing and spare us from the diseases and plagues inflicted upon the worldly people.</p><h2 class="head1">II. TWELVE SPRINGS OF WATER</h2><p>At Marah God made the bitter waters sweet with a tree; at Elim God gave them twelve springs of water (Exo. 15:27a) to fully meet the need of the thirst of the children of Israel.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Twelve</h2><p>The number twelve signifies completeness, fullness, and perfection in God&rsquo;s eternal administration. According to the Bible, twelve is composed of four times three. Three signifies the Triune God, and four signifies the creatures, especially man. Hence, twelve also signifies the mingling of the Triune God with man. The twelve springs of water indicate that the full supply given by God here to the children of Israel in their need for water was for the mingling of God with man and according to God&rsquo;s eternal administration. Hence, it is complete, full, and perfect.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Springs of Water</h2><p>Here it is not merely water but springs of water which issued from the fountainhead, flowing forth to supply the need of God&rsquo;s chosen people. Twelve springs of water signify the resurrection life, which is the Spirit, flowing out from God into us for the mingling of divinity with humanity. This mingling will carry out God&rsquo;s eternal economy and reach the full extent of God&rsquo;s administration.</p><h2 class="head1">III. SEVENTY PALM TREES</h2><p>At Elim, God prepared for the children of Israel not only twelve springs of water but also seventy palm trees (Exo. 15:27b). The springs of water are for the quenching of thirst, whereas the palm trees are for a shade, a shelter from heat.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Seventy</h2><p>The number seven signifies the completeness of God&rsquo;s dispensing in time. The book of Revelation speaks of seven churches, seven golden lampstands, seven Spirits, seven lamps of fire, seven eyes, seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls. All these sevens are related to God&rsquo;s dispensing in time. The number ten signifies perfection, fullness. Hence, seventy signifies absolute completeness in time for God&rsquo;s dispensing in full.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Palm Trees</h2><p>Palm trees have deep roots that reach far to the source of the water under the earth. Hence, they can survive under the scorching sun and bring forth an abundance of leaves as a shelter from heat, a place for cooling. In the Bible palm trees signify life that is flourishing (Psa. 92:12), rejoicing in life&rsquo;s satisfaction (Lev. 23:40; Neh. 8:15), and victory (John 12:13; Rev. 7:9). This life carries out God&rsquo;s ministry dispensationally in time. This refers to the supply of Christ in resurrection.</p>
