<h2 class="head2">Huangtze Town (Dongshiang, Sheng County, Chekiang Province)</h2><p>We, the meeting at Huangtze Town, have never belonged to any denomination, nor do we have much fellowship with brothers and sisters of other groups. Therefore, our spiritual life is very immature. Thank God for having mercy on us, His ignorant sheep, and for constantly giving us grace. We began to have His table in April of this year with a total of fifty-five people breaking bread together. Praise the Lord! Another thirteen brothers and sisters were baptized into the Lord recently...</p><p>Wu Huan-deh, Shen Jien-ding<br />August</p><h2 class="head2">Prayer and Consecration (Manila)</h2><p>When I heard that the brothers and sisters in China were in a condition of serious poverty, my heart suffered greatly. The wisdom, skill, and money of the brothers and sisters from each locality should be combined to find ways for everybody to survive by establishing small industries. Those with skills should teach others. It would be good if classes to train people in the trades could be set up in a number of places. They could teach weaving, dying, chemistry, pharmacology, and even short-term training in medicine. Perhaps the training at Kuling could have a class in trade skills. I really hope this could happen.</p><p>I am praying about my future on the one hand and offering myself into the hands of the co-workers on the other hand. I am willing to submit to the decision of the co-workers concerning the aspect of the work that is most appropriate for me in order to serve God. I hope you will give me some directions.</p><p>May the Lord be with you, brothers!<br />Stephen Kaung<br />February 9</p><p>(Brother Kaung is in the process of applying to return to China. We hope we will be able to publish the fourth issue of The Gospel when he arrives in Shanghai.&mdash;Editor)</p><h2 class="head2">Longing and Hoping (Manila)</h2><p>Although I have not written for a long time, I long for you in my heart and remember you often in my prayers. I have heard that the work of the gospel in China has been blessed by the Lord and that the number of saved ones has increased greatly. I really thank the Lord! I hope Brother Witness Lee will be able to come here soon to work. The application for entry into the Philippines is very strict, and it requires much prayer. May God have mercy on us believers here.</p><p>We really thank the Lord that Brother Stephen Kaung and his wife have come here. Brother Kaung helped the young brothers and sisters very much. It is now summer vacation, and he leads the young people in studying the Bible for one hour every morning. This is a great benefit to the young brothers and sisters.</p><p>Your sister in the Lord,<br />Lin Xue Yu-giang<br />April 16, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: Mrs. Lin Yu-giang, 737 Reina Regente Street, Manila, P.I.</p><h2 class="head2">The Capital of Thailand</h2><p>The church now has a home prayer meeting in the Tong-Ren Hospital every Saturday evening at 7:30 in addition to the prayer meeting at 10:00 on the Lord's Day morning. There are no other meetings. Since I came here, the brothers and sisters want me to take the opportunity to preach at the time of the prayer meeting. I just stand in my position as a brother and gradually speak what I have seen of the truth every Saturday and Lord's Day. The number in the meetings has increased from three to more than twenty. Two have signed up to be baptized. We are now looking to the Lord to see how He will work. We dare not run in front of Him, but only want to follow Him so that His will may be carried out. I deeply know that I am weak and cannot bear much. For the Lord's sake, please lead and instruct me so that I would not veer to the right or the left, but may be able to go on the straight way.</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Wu Chiu-jiang<br />October 31, 1949</p><p>Mailing Address: 279 Chang Fang Bridge, opposite the Central Post Office at Suriwong Road intersection, Bangkok, Thailand</p><h2 class="head2">Ceylon (Territory of India)</h2><p>Brother Faithful Luk recently came from Singapore through India to Ceylon and stayed for three weeks. He labored diligently among the brothers and sisters, especially among the Chinese brothers and sisters. We were all greatly helped. Several men and women believed and were baptized as a result of his work. It really is a cause for rejoicing. Yesterday, Brother Luk took the Swiss ship Sumatra back to Singapore. Although we did not want him to leave us, his move was completely of God, and we dared not interfere.</p><p>Hsu Yun-ting<br />June 28, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: 109 Chatham Street, Colombo, Ceylon</p>
