[1]  OF THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19; John 15:16; 1 Cor 14:3-4, 24b-25, 31, 39; Acts 6:4; 2:42
[2]  After four years and four months of study and learning concerning the practice of the new way, we have now reached a conclusion.
[3]  All these four steps have their theoretical basis in the Scripture, and they are a conclusion we have drawn through our experience of nearly seventy years in the Lord s recovery, plus a summary of the materials that we have collected through our research.
[4]  The Lord said, I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain John 15:16 .
[5]  You need to be a living person, and your prophesying needs to be living.
[6]  In short, you must be a person who seeks after the Lord and loves Him.
[7]  If you will spend six days a week to learn the Lord s word this way and will be a praying person, living Christ, and bringing everything into fellowship, when you stand up to speak, your speaking will surely be living and organic.
[8]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You from the depths of our being.
[9]  After all the study and investigation, we have to admit that the four major steps in this way are all revealed in the Bible and are ordained by God, that is, 1 the begetting of people through the preaching of the gospel, 2 the nourishing of people through the home meetings, 3 the perfecting of people through the small group meetings, and 4 the building up through the prophesying in the big meetings.
[10]  There He says, You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit v. 16 . The word appointed here has the sense of commissioning, just like an ambassador being commissioned by a government.
[11]  The Lord says in Acts 1:8 that You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.
[12]  When they know that you are a Jesus-fanatic, and that the more you speak about Jesus, the more people change, they will begin to trust in you and will gradually believe in what you preach.
[13]  As soon as a person rises up from baptism, you need to have a long time of fellowship with him.
[14]  I suggest that you talk to him about the Lord being the life-giving Spirit and being one spirit with us.
[15]  Not only do you have to feed a newly baptized one, but you must bring him to a nearby small group meeting as well.
[16]  However, by bringing him to the small group meeting, you should not let the others take over your job; you have to continue feeding and caring for him.
[17]  Concerning the small group meetings, I would first beg you to drop the all too legal practice that you have had before.
[18]  CHAPTER THREE THE ORGANIC PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 9:22-23; 1 Thes 2:7; Eph 4:11-12; 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24, 31, 39 OUTLINE Begetting 1 Cor 9:22-23.
[19]  After the small groups are established, the brothers and sisters have to start meeting in the small group meetings.
[20]  The first thing to do in the small group meeting is to see whether or not everyone is revived.
[21]  This revival is a morning-by-morning revival, a day-by-day overcoming, a life that lives Christ, that speaks Christ, and that attends every meeting there is.
[22]  The revival that we talk about in the Lord s recovery is easier than all the revivals that Christians have sought after throughout the previous centuries.
[23]  All we need to do is go to the Lord every morning when we wake up and pour out everything we have in us in a genuine way from the depth of our being.
[24]  In this way, we will be cleansed and will be enlightened by the Lord s word.
[25]  When we go to the home meetings, we have to lead the new ones to attend the small group meetings and the Lord s Day district meetings.
[26]  Following this, we have to go on to consider how the small group meetings should be conducted.
[27]  According to the organic practice of the new way, the small group meetings must be organic.
[28]  In order to show you what is organic, I must first show you another blueprint of what it is to be non-organic.
[29]  If you do not understand what an organic small group is, just look at what the Lord Jesus did with the disciples during the three and a half years and you will understand.
[30]  When we have the begetting, the nourishing, and the teaching, we still need the building.
[31]  From these verses, we see that the most important thing with our meeting is the prophesying, which is to speak for the Lord, to speak Him forth, and to speak the Lord into people.
[32]  When you read them, you should allow the Lord s word to saturate, fill, and penetrate your whole being, so that in the end, the words become your constitution.
[33]  When you study the word of God this way, with the experience of life, the inspiration of the Spirit, plus the spiritual light and view, it will be easy for you to prophesy for the Lord.
[34]  I hope that you will practice these five points: fellowshipping with the Lord to be one with Him, being saturated with the Lord s word and being constituted by it, being living in the spirit to receive constant inspiration, being without self prejudice but with God s view, and learning to speak with revelation using the fresh feelings and expressions.
[35]  I hope that in the future we will see more of the prophesying in our meetings, even to the point that it will be more than the teaching.
[36]  If we live this way, spontaneously, we will be able to speak for God, to speak forth God, and to speak God into others.
[37]  CHAPTER FOUR A BELIEVER S LIFE OF MORNING REVIVAL
[38]  When you call on the Lord Jesus and say to Him that you would love Him more and would live to Him, this is a prayer that stirs up your spirit.
[39]  THE SECOND STEP IN THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT
[40]  Not only do the New Testament saints call on the name of the Lord.
[41]  When you take in the grace of the Lord, you are breathing in. We breathe out carbon dioxide, and we breathe in the oxygen from God.
[42]  In hoping in the Lord s word, it is better that we do not speak, lest we interrupt the Lord s speaking.
[43]  David said again, Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word v. 148 . This shows us that in the experience of the Old Testament saints, there was the prayer, the hoping in the Lord s word, and the meditation on the Lord s word.
[44]  Today, for us, the New Testament believers, the quickest way to receive the Lord s word is not to meditate on His word; rather it is to pray-read His word.
[45]  But in pray-reading the Lord s word, there is the crying and the calling, and it will be spontaneous and natural to turn the Lord s word into prayer.
[46]  When you have thoroughly pray-read the Lord s word in the morning, during the day this word will speak and work within you, and your spirit will spontaneously be strengthened.
[47]  Paul said in Titus 3 that our salvation today is through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit v. 5 . The salvation here does not refer to salvation from hell.
[48]  Fifty years ago, I read the verse in Judges 5 that says that those who love the Lord are as the sun that goes forth in its might, and I told the Lord, O God, I love You.
[49]  When you nourish the new ones in this way once or twice a week, week after week, in half a year the new ones will be greatly helped by you, and they will be established.
[50]  By that time, you can tell them that the life of a Christian is a communal one.
[51]  In our daily lives, we have the gospel preaching, the home meetings, the small group meetings, and the Lord s Day morning meetings.
[52]  If we would live this way every day, going out to visit people, bringing others to salvation, attending the small group meetings, enlightening others, and functioning in the Lord s Day meeting by presenting the riches, the church will be built up.
[53]  CHAPTER FIVE THE SECRET OF THE NEW WAY 1 Scripture Reading: Rom 1:16; 2 Tim 1:8, 11-12; John 21:15; 1 Thes 2:7; Heb 10:24-25; 1 Thes 2:11; Eph 4:11-12 OUTLINE Concerning the gospel Rom 1:16; 2 Tim 1:8, 11-12.
[54]  Lord, how we thank You that in this end time, You have come to us in many ways and have spoken to us with words of love, light, and revelation.
[55]  When the Lord Jesus was thirty years of age, He came out to fulfill His preaching ministry.
[56]  The Lord told Peter to go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel; take that and give it to them for Me and you Matt 17:27 .
[57]  If we have this thought, even if we say that we are taking the new way, in reality we are not in the new way, because everything we do is in the old creation.
[58]  THE SECRET OF THE NEW WAY Concerning Visiting People
[59]  When we visit people for the preaching of the gospel, we will encounter all kinds of difficulties.
[60]  Second Timothy 1:8 says, Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner; but suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God.
[61]  Since the gospel is persecuted and put under a hard trial, we the gospel preachers, as the companions of the gospel, must suffer evil and be persecuted along with the gospel.
[62]  This is why, when the Lord sent us out to preach the gospel, He gave us first Himself.
[63]  We must have this kind of faith, realizing that we are one with the Lord, that we are joined with Him as one spirit, that our going is His going, and that He is going with us.
[64]  Although the Lord is with you, although His power is your power and His authority is your authority, and you can even heal sickness, cast out demons, and work wonders and miracles, all of this does not mean that you will not encounter difficulties.
[65]  We are a failure if we go to the home meetings today in a way that is like the preachers or pastors going to a worship service; we should not wait for an appointed time and then go to the brothers and sisters home in that way to lead them in singing the songs and reading the Scriptures.
[66]  Concerning the Small Group Meeting Everyone Leading, with No One Behaving
[67]  In the church life, if the small group meeting is not strong, the church life will not be strong.
[68]  Furthermore, if there are those who have physical illness, they can share that matter briefly in the small group meetings.
[69]  CHAPTER SIX THE SECRET OF THE NEW WAY 2 Scripture Reading: Heb 10:24-25; 1 Thes 2:11; Eph 4:11-12; Acts 20:20, 27, 31; 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24, 31, 39 OUTLINE Concerning the small group meeting Heb 10:24-25; 1 Thes 2:11; Eph 4:11-12; Acts 20:20, 27, 31.
[70]  If you are not saved, regenerated, or you do not have the life of God, you would not have any spiritual gift.
[71]  At the same time, we have to see that among all the spiritual gifts, the most excellent and outstanding one is prophesying 1 Cor 14:1 .
[72]  Now I desire that you all speak in tongues, but rather that you may prophesy; now greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, that the church may receive building up vv.
[73]  If such a one has some secrets of the heart, such as refusal to confess or hatred for others, he will be convicted and judged when he comes to such a meeting where everyone prophesies one by one to speak forth God and to speak God into others.
[74]  THE SECRET OF THE NEW WAY Concerning Prophesying The Need for the Spirit, Light, and Revelation
[75]  Today the Lord needs to recover this matter of prophesying.
[76]  This shows us that if we desire to prophesy, not only do we need to be moved by God, but we must also cooperate with God to read His word and get it into us, so that His word becomes our constitution.
