   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE ENJOYMENT OF THE RICHES OF CHRIST ISSUING IN THE CORPORATE CHRIST,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BODY-CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 11:3a; 15:23, 47b, 45b; 12:11-14; 10:16b-17; 11:29; Eph 4:4a CALLING ON THE LORD BEING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE KEY TO THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Apparently, the first two of the Epistles, Romans and 1 Corinthians, are not closely related.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, if we get into the kernel, depth, and mystery of these two books, we will see that they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans is rich in doctrinal teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every chapter of that Epistle contains a basic doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The key to the book of Romans, however, is in chapter 10.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After all the teachings of the preceding chapters, verses 6 and 7 say, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down; or, Who will descend into the abyss? that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ has already come down from heaven in incarnation, and He has come up from the abyss in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may ask, since Christ has come down from heaven and come up from the abyss, where is He?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the Bible, there are three stories in the universe heaven, the earth, and the abyss, which is under the earth Phil 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Heaven is the highest story, the abyss is the lowest, and the earth is between these two.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since Christ has come down from heaven and come up from the abyss, we may say that Christ today is on the earth, but this is not specific enough.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today Christ is not only on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the living Word, He is also in our mouth Rom 10:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today we have not only the Christ who came down from heaven and came up from the abyss but also the Christ who is in our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 10 goes on to tell us the way to participate in Christ s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verses 12 and 13 say, There is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him; for whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These verses do not tell us that Christ is rich to all who only study the Bible, pray all day, work for Him desperately, or fast regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, Christ is rich to all who call upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no more prevailing way to participate in and partake of His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are not able to participate in the riches of Christ merely by studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This can be compared to studying a recipe or a menu without eating the food itself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The way to partake of the riches of food is to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Likewise, the way to partake of the riches of Christ is to call on Him, saying, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A husband and wife may decide to read John 1 together.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 1 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After they read this verse, the husband may ask, What is the beginning, and how could the Word be with God and also be God?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then the wife may reply that it is too puzzling to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the way of traditional Bible studies, from which those who participate receive little more than vain, empty knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To study the Bible in a traditional way is like studying a menu without eating the food.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The proper way to partake of the riches of Christ in John 1:1 is not to study this verse in a traditional way but to pray over, that is, to pray-read, this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may pray-read John 1:1 by saying, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>O Lord, in the beginning was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Amen, Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Reading and praying in this way makes a great difference.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is because the Lord is rich to all who call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we pray-read John 1:1 for five minutes, we will be on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We will be nourished, watered, and even flooded with the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The way to enjoy Christ s riches is to call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord is rich to all who call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the key to Romans, the first Epistle in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The opening words of 1 Corinthians continue the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 2 of chapter 1 refers to all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Romans we have the key to partaking of Christ s riches, but we do not have any instructions on how to use the key.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The instructions are in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we use the key to open all the doors in this Epistle, we find the riches of Christ in chapter after chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>CHRIST BEING THE POWER OF GOD,</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>THE WISDOM OF GOD, AND OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS, SANCTIFICATION, AND REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have already seen a number of items of the riches of Christ in this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Chapter 1 contains five items: Christ as the power of God, the wisdom of God, righteousness for the past, sanctification for the present, and redemption for the future vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>24, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As human beings, we all have the three stages of the past, the present, and the future.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We always need Christ as our righteousness for the past.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even for yesterday, we need Christ as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Likewise, in every today we need Him as our sanctification, and we need Him as our redemption for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christ s riches are in three aspects for each of the three stages of our existence.</S>
