   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONSISTENT VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eventually, some of her admirers ask her to return: "Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What will ye see in the Shulamite?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As it were the dance of two armies" 6:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is at this time that her name is called "Shulamite."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the feminine form of Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So now she simply becomes Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They ask, "What can you see in this feminine Solomon?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The answer is that this female Solomon is just like the dance of two armies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Exodus 15:20 and 1 Samuel 18:6 tell us that dances among the Lord's people were a celebration of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When they defeated the enemy, they danced to celebrate their victory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This poetic expression shows us that this seeking one has victory all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is never any defeat, but always the celebration of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before I came to the church, I was with a group of believers who were seeking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They were good teachers of the Scriptures, but they were never victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever I met with them, there was always a kind of sighing and confessing of their defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I never heard a praise of victory among them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That was surely not the Shulamite.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But after I came into the church life, there was always the "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jesus is Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was really the Shulamite in the dance of two armies to celebrate the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I was a young Christian, I was bothered by my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But now in the church life I realize that Christ is much bigger than my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I just say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I'm in the corporate Shulamite, where there is always the victory!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some people ask, "What is there to see in the local church?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can only reply, "The dance of two armies!"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This does not mean I am encouraging you to dance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What I mean is that the real dance is the celebrating of our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the local church we are always enjoying the victory over the enemy!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She is not only the city, but also two armies.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She is also the dawn, the moon, and the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord has used so many figures in describing her.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He has used the animals, the plants, the things on the earth, and the things in the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All these figures are used by the Lord to describe such a wonderful one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She must include all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all must be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some of us are still horses, some have doves' eyes, some are lilies, and some are little doves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moreover, some are the pillars of smoke, the couch, the palanquin, and the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And, praise the Lord, some are the garden and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the local church!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are all-inclusively these figures under the Lord's transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Transformation can only be accomplished by enjoying the Lord Himself, step by step, in all the deeper experiences of His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the real Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church is a real song to Christ, and Christ is the real Song of Songs to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ will make His seeking lover</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Pillar, couch, and palanquin,</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>E'en a crown, His boast and glory;</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He will do it all!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>His beloved how He loves her,</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>So attractive, His delight.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is captivated wholly;</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>She is comely in His sight.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But there still remains a shadow;</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christ is still not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He must have a growing garden</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To become His loving Bride!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Paradise of pomegranates,</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Pleasant fruits, and henna flowers,</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Spikenard, saffron, myrrh, and aloes:</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>His enjoyment now not ours.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He has come into His garden,</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Gathered myrrh and spices there,</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Eaten honeycomb and honey;</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Wine and milk He'll drink fore'er.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>From the garden comes the city,</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>All materials thus supplied;</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God is satisfied completely,</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>And the foe is terrified.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>"Thou art fair, my love, as Tirzah,</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Comely as Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>O Lord Jesus, Hallelujah,</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Thou wilt do it all!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Tune: Hymns, #246 or #268</S>
