<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Lampstands&#151;the Embodiment of Christ<br>and the Reproduction of the Spirit</H2><P>In Revelation 1 the churches are seen as the seven golden lampstands. (See also Lessons 7 and 12 of the Triune God lesson book.)</P><P>[Christ is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is expressed as the churches. The shining Spirit is the reality of the shining Christ, and the shining churches are the reproduction and the expression of the shining Spirit to accomplish God's eternal purpose that the New Jerusalem as the shining city may be consummated. Christ, the Spirit, and the churches are all of the same divine nature.]</P><P>[The churches are the lampstands, and the lamps are the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God as the expression of Christ. This light is shining brighter and brighter, and the vision is becoming clearer every day.</P><P>The local churches as the golden lampstands shine with such a Spirit in the dark age of today. In today's dark age, the church really needs the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God to shine forth the testimony of Jesus.</P><P>The church is the embodiment of Christ and the reproduction of the Spirit. The Spirit is the reality of Christ (John 14:17-20; 16:13-15), and the church is the reproduction of the Spirit (Rev. 22:17a). The church with the Spirit is the embodiment of Christ, the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 1:2, 9; 19:10). Therefore, the more Spirit, the more church and the more testimony of Jesus.]</P><P>[The church is the embodiment of the Triune God dispensed into us and blended within us. It is the Triune God dispensed into humanity and blended in humanity as one single entity (Rev. 22:17a). There is no separation. This is the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God, reaching His redeemed, and this is the consummation of the divine dispensing in this age.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE NEW JERUSALEM&#151;<br>THE SPIRIT BEING ONE WITH THE BRIDE</H2><P>[Eventually this consummation will come to the ultimate stage, the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is a single entity which is considered the wife of the Lamb, the bride (Rev. 22:17).]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Universal Marriage</H2><P>[The consummation of the divine dispensing will be a universal marriage (Rev. 19:7-9; 21:2, 9). The Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God dispensed into His redeemed people will be there as the Bridegroom; and God's redeemed people as the consummation of the redeemed, regenerated, and transformed humanity will be there as the bride. We know this because Revelation 22:17 reads, "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!" In this verse the Spirit and the bride together as a couple say "come." The husband is the Spirit, and the wife is the bride.]</P>
