The entire Scripture composed of sixty-six books concludes with two things: the overcomers and the New Jerusalem
If we read Revelation thoroughly under the heavenly light, we can see that the New Jerusalem is the totality of the overcomers
After the thousand years, the Lord will clear up the entire universe through His judgment at the great white throne
They will enjoy their victory, but the defeated ones who were not ready will have nothing to enjoy as their reward
When we are victorious in the Lord, we enjoy our victory every day, but when we are defeated, the enjoyment of the Lord is gone
Because many Bible teachers do not understand the book of Revelation, they basically avoid it in their teaching
In his Gospel, John opens in a simple way by saying, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
One category of overcomers is the martyrs of the Old Testament and the New Testament up to the time before the great tribulation
The third category of overcomers is the hundred and forty-four thousand living overcomers, the firstfruits, in Revelation 14:1-5
These four categories of overcomers constitute the fifth category, which is the prepared bride in Revelation 19:7-9
That will be the totality of all the believers throughout all the generations of the Old Testament and the New Testament
The Old Testament is the history of God with man, and the New Testament is the history of God in continuation within man
Medical doctors have been studying the human body for many years, but they still cannot fully comprehend all of its mysteries
God made us with a spirit to receive Him, with a mind to understand Him, with a heart to love Him, and with a body to express Him
We have an organ to receive God, an organ to understand Him, an organ to love Him, and an organ, an outer vessel, to express Him
We believers as the followers of Jesus are also men living God, expressing God, and letting God live out through us in our humanity
It does not have God's life or God's nature, but the new creation, constituted of the believers, who are born again of God, does
The believers are a new creation , not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life
Before we were regenerated, we were the old creation without God in us, but today we are happy because we have God within us
God's eternal economy is for Him to be one with man, making man His organism so that He can have a new creation out of the old creation
According to the Bible there are four ages in the old creationthe age before law the age of law the age of grace and the age of the kingdom
God chose us before the foundation of the world and called us in time to carry out His eternal economy to have a new creation
God will take at least seven thousand years to finish His project of gaining the new creation out of the old creation
God created Adam, which means that He chose Adam with his descendants to be the very means for Him to bring forth the new creation
They become defeated in the enjoyment of the processed Triune God and corrupted by Satan through sin self the world and the religious world
He is calling us, the believers, the heavenly stars and the heavenly descendants of Abraham, to be the overcomers
In the seven epistles to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3, there is not much concerning the overcoming of sin, self, and the world
Throughout human history and even until today there have been three main religions, three 'isms'-Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism
Jerusalem was the spot where the temple was built but the Roman prince Titus destroyed that temple not leaving one stone upon another stone
Apparently those in the synagogue were worshipping God, yet the Lord Jesus said that the synagogues were not of God but of Satan
Judaism has been greatly usurped and utilized by Satan to damage God's interest on this earth and to persecute and martyr many faithful ones
In the seven epistles to the seven churches, what the Lord charges us to overcome is mainly these three 'isms'
God sent the Babylonians to come to devastate Jerusalem and the temple and carry the people away into captivity in 606 B
Of course, God brought a remnant of them back after seventy years to rebuild the temple , but that recovery did not last too long
The Lord said that from that day the temple, which was the house of God, would no longer be the house of God, but 'your house'
When the disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the temple, He said to them, 'Do you not see all these things?
The Lord was predicting that the temple with the city of Jerusalem would be devastated, not leaving one stone upon another stone
Josephus, the Jewish historian, spoke of the cruelty and slaughter inflicted upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem by the Roman army
According to history, this period of two thousand years should begin from Titus' destruction of Jerusalem in A
The Jewish people invented their way of synagogues to worship God, but the Lord referred to the synagogue as a synagogue of Satan
Later, the church came into existence, but it was not too long before the church became worldly, married to the world
They do not know that the Lord Jesus sounded the trumpet seven times in Revelation for us to overcome, nor do they know what to overcome
They will hate the Roman Catholic Church and make her desolate and naked and will eat her flesh and will burn her utterly with fire
The Lord will tolerate this up to the beginning of the great tribulation when the Roman Catholic Church will be terminated by Antichrist
The most significant thing in the Protestant churches is that they are full of nominal Christians, false Christians
Many in the Protestant churches today, however, are not genuine believers in Christ; instead, they are tares, false Christians
The Lord will send the angels to bind all the false Christians into bundles, and they will be cast into the lake of fire
At the beginning of the great tribulation, Antichrist with the ten kings will devastate and burn the Roman Catholic Church
Catholicism will be ended by Antichrist in the middle of the last seven years of this age, at the beginning of the great tribulation
We preach only a living person, and this living person is Christ as the very God who became a man and died on the cross for us
One will be burned by fire on this earth, and the 'tares' of the other will be burned by fire in the lake of fire
Of course, there are a good number of saved, genuine believers in both the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches
Today the people of God need to overcome the three 'isms' and come back to a unique, living, divine and human Person
The Lord charges us to overcome all kinds of religion, and in these seven epistles He also charges us to overcome some other matters
They have Christ in name, but they do not have any personal affection or loving element within them toward Christ
If the sisters give Christ the preeminence in the way that they style their hair, this means that they are taking Him as their first love
Some think that the first love was our love for the Lord at the beginning of our Christian life when we were saved
When He comes back, the first thing He will do is to send angels to bind up the tares in bundles and throw them into the lake of fire
We also need to overcome in the kind of ties we wear, in the way that we style our hair, and in all of the small things
The leaving of the first love is the source of and main reason for the failure of the church throughout the ages
In such a good, orderly, and formal church like the church in Ephesus, we need to first overcome the loss of the first love
The Lord Jesus charged us to overcome the leaving of the first love and to maintain the eating of Christ as the tree of life
If we give the preeminence to Christ in everything and enjoy Him as the tree of life every day, we will be marvelous, overcoming Christians
If you do not give the preeminence to the Lord or enjoy the Lord, even for a month, the church life may become an unpleasant place to you
Of course, you might not say this, but deep within you would think that there is not much good in the church life
Of course, the Paradise of God in Revelation 2:7 actually refers to the New Jerusalem in the thousand-year kingdom
The light of the lampstand, the church, shines forth corporately versus individualistically in the dark night of the church age
If we are enjoying Christ as our love, life, and light, we will keep the testimony of Jesus as the shining of the lampstand in our locality
If we do not live Christ and behave in Christ in the church life, there will be nothing as a reward to us in the church life
There are four main points in the Lord's epistle to the church in Ephesus-love, life, light, and the lampstand
The Lord said in John 8:12 that He was the light of the world and that whoever followed Him would have the light of life
The Lord's calling in Revelation is not for being saved but for becoming an overcomer, a precious stone for God's building
Through the centuries, in the period of time from Revelation 4-20, the Lord has gained and is gaining a number of overcomers
They were together for awhile, but after the conference in Jerusalem in Acts 15, there was a great split between Barnabas and Paul
We can see that between Paul and Barnabas, there was the lack of building, and between Paul and Apollos there was also the lack of building
To have the first love is to give the preeminence, the first place, to the Lord Jesus in everything, even in all of the small things
When the Saturday edition of the newspaper comes out, some sisters like to read it to find all of the sales in the department stores
When he began to love the Lord by giving Him the preeminence in everything, his wife noticed that he was different
Because this brother had such a positive change toward the Lord, he wanted to invite some brothers to his home for fellowship
Of being affected by the situation, however, we all partook of the food set before us in a joyful way in support of our brother
At the Lord's time and at the early apostles' time, the synagogues of the Jews had become in the eyes of God the synagogue of Satan
We may feel that unlike the saints in Smyrna we have a good government today, but persecution can come to us from many other directions
Many of us, however, may not suffer a physical martyrdom, but a psychological martyrdom or a spiritual martyrdom
When the apostle Paul asked the Lord three times to remove the thorn from him, the Lord's response was, 'My grace is sufficient for you'
The Lord allowed the thorn to remain with Paul so that Paul would be able to enjoy the Lord as his all-sufficient grace
After we have stayed in the church life for a number of years, we realize that the Lord uses nearly all of the saints to deal with us
When the people of Israel were wandering in the wilderness, God fed them for forty years every morning with manna in a public way
The Lord also promised the faithful ones at Pergamos that He would give them a white stone on which a new name is written
There are millions of Christians today, but it is difficult to see any one of them built up together with others
God's intention is to have us All conformed to His dear Son; Thus a work of transformation By the Spirit must be done
Lord, transform us to Thine image In emotion, mind, and will; Saturate us with Thy Spirit, All our being wholly fill
God hath us regenerated In our spirit with His life; But He must transform us further- In our soul by His own life
Spreading outward from our spirit Doth the Lord transform our soul, By the inward parts renewing, Till within His full control
He transforms, all sanctifying, Till like Him we are matured; He transforms, our soul possessing, Till His stature is secured
The Lord said that those in Sardis had a name that they were living, but in actuality they were not living; they were dead and dying
About two years ago, a number of leading ones in the denominations in the United States considered a proposal to evangelize the entire world
Even though the Protestant churches have sixty-five million Christians, they said that they did not have enough manpower
They have been busy with their occupations all week, so on the weekend they like to come to the Lord's Day morning service to rest
All of them are accustomed to coming on the Lord's Day to hear a knowledgeable, eloquent, and attractive speaker
According to God's ordination, the practice of the church life is not with one man speaking and the rest listening
Today's practice of one man speaking and the rest listening makes the church not only dormant but also dead and dying
We all have to pursue love; we all have to desire earnestly spiritual gifts; and we all have to especially desire to prophesy
If we do not speak for the Lord, this is a loss to ourselves, to the church, and to the Lord's interest on this earth
If we are waiting for the leading ones to begin the meeting, this shows that the church is dormant, dead, and dying
As we are driving to the meeting, we should continue to exercise our spirit to sing to the Lord, pray to Him, and praise Him
We are not dead, but we are in resurrection, speaking for the Lord in a living way to build up His organic Body
Today there are four major religions Judaism Catholicism Protestantism and Mohammedanism which may be considered as a false copy of Judaism
In Revelation 2:9b the Lord refers to 'the slander from those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan'
The Jewish religion has mis-positioned the law given by God as a side line to Christ as the main line in His economy
There are five million members of Judaism in the United States today, and all of them have been distracted from Christ
We need to realize, however, that God's ordination concerning the keeping of the Sabbath was a dispensational ordination
In order to keep His chosen people a particular people, different from the Gentiles, God ordained that they practice circumcision
Many Jewish believers insisted that unless people were circumcised according to the custom of Moses, they could not be saved
Circumcision was a shadow of the crucifixion of Christ in its putting off of the flesh, as signified in baptism
In Leviticus 11 God charged His chosen people, Israel, to take care of their eating in a particular way, not following the Gentiles
The diet revealed in Leviticus is a very healthy diet, but we need to see that these dietary ordinances were also dispensational
The Jews missed all these prophecies and types because they regarded only the law and disregarded Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God
The Jews think that they are worshipping God, Elohim, Jehovah, but they do not realize that Jehovah Elohim is embodied in Christ
They did not realize that this Christ as the embodiment of God was ordained by God to be the centrality and universality of His economy
These substantial things were the tabernacle and the corporate priesthood daily serving God in the tabernacle with all the offerings
They had the substantial types, but they did not understand their significance, so they spontaneously disregarded Christ
We can see that they disregarded Christ, annulled all the spiritual things, and contended against the gospel of Christ
The way to overcome such a satanic religion is by holding to the teaching of the apostles through the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
Purgatory in Roman Catholicism is a place where those who have died go to be purged of their sins through suffering
Even the architecture of the Catholic cathedrals with their stained-glass windows and high ceilings makes them very dark
The Catholic Church does not keep the pure truth but has leavened the truths of the Bible with evil, heretical, and pagan things
The way to overcome the Catholic heretical religion is by our faith in two things: the person of Christ and the work of Christ
We say a strong 'amen' to the New Testament teaching that Jesus is both God, the complete God, and man, the perfect man
Because we have studied all these things with all their significances, such a deceiving church can never deceive us
Throughout the years, we did not find a way to replace the system of one man speaking with all of the saints prophesying
Today many of the local churches are practicing the prophesying of all of the saints instead of the Lords Day message meeting by one speaker
In Revelation 2:6 the Lord Jesus says clearly that He hates the works of the Nicolaitans, the clergy-laity system
Balaam was a Gentile prophet who spoke and taught the word of God for base gain, enticing God's people into fornication and idolatry
Protestantism also holds the teaching of the Nicolaitans to build up hierarchy and practice the system of clergy
In today's Protestant churches there is hardly any teaching concerning the Body of Christ and concerning Christ as the Head of the Body
In our teachings throughout the years, we have strongly stressed the building up of the Body of Christ and the headship of Christ
They feel that having one man speaking keeps the meeting in a good order and ensures that a good word will be spoken to the attendants
By reading 1 Corinthians 14 we can see that Paul anticipated that the practice of all prophesying would not be so easy
Corinthians 15:45b says Christ as the last Adam in the flesh became a life-giving Spirit through His resurrection
By Christ as the pneumatic One and by the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, we can overcome today's Protestantism
They began to meet in their homes, and they were together to continue in the fellowship and the teaching of the apostles
That was wonderful, but since that day this kind of diligent, strict keeping of the word of God has become loose
Jezebel, typifying today's Catholic Church, is the woman mentioned in Matthew 13:33 who leavened the entire teaching concerning Christ
The Lord commended the church in Philadelphia by saying that they kept His word even with the little power that they had
Today on this earth it is difficult to meet one who is faithful to the word of God every day and even every moment
We need to return in a full way to the Lord's word, and keep the word absolutely by the Lord as our all-sufficient grace
The church is a chaste virgin espoused to Christ, so the church is the wife of Christ, and Christ is the Husband
When we were raised up by the Lord in China, we realized that we should not denominate ourselves with any name
The divisions can be eliminated and terminated only by taking Christ as the unique center among all the believers
We must overcome to tear down all the fences so that we can have the fellowship of the Body of Christ in oneness
To take another name besides that of Christ is abominable in the eyes of God because it is spiritual fornication
The Lord Jesus promised the Philadelphian overcomers that before the tribulation begins, He will take them away
The pillar in the temple of God will bear the name of God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and also the new name of Christ
The overcomers will be the possession of God, the possession of Christ, and the possession of the New Jerusalem
If we would make up our minds to take the overcoming way, we will experience Christ in a new way, and Christ will become new to us
If we make the decision to be an overcomer in this age, we will have the sense that Christ is so fresh and new
We may have been in the recovery for a number of years, and during this time we may think that we have accumulated many truths
According to Revelation 3:17, the condition of those in Laodicea was wretched , miserable , poor , blind , and naked
The degraded recovered church must pay a price for gold, white garments, and eyesalve, which she desperately needs
We also need to buy white garments, signifying Christ lived out of us as our subjective righteousness to cover our nakedness
How much do we have Christ as our subjective righteousness, which is Christ Himself living out from within us?
All of us need to pay the price for these three things: the refined gold, the white garments, and the eyesalve
In order to overcome lukewarmness, we need to open ourselves to the Lord, who is shut outside the door of the lukewarm church
We should have the assurance that every morning our door is wide open to the Lord so that He can come in to dine with us, to feast with us
We have to overcome big things like the three deformed religions and small things like our attitude and the way that we dress
When a husband loses his temper with his wife, at that moment he is no longer an overcomer but a failure in his daily life
We should say 'no' to the denominations, to the exalting of all the names other than the unique name of Christ
We must overcome the trend of not keeping the Lord's word, the tide of denying the Lord's name, and the lukewarmness in the Lord's testimony
If we read the Bible thoroughly, we can see that the overcomers are the life-line, the pulse, of the entire Bible
The New Jerusalem is the ending, the conclusion, and the totality of the divine revelation in the sixty-six books of the Bible
The crucial items in Revelation 21 and 22 concerning the New Jerusalem were already mentioned previously in the Bible
The most striking point in the New Jerusalem is the tree of life, which was mentioned at the beginning of the Bible
The Holy of Holies in both the tabernacle and the temple was a cube, being equal in length, breadth, and height
If we want to eat the tree of life, we do not need a 'ladder,' because this tree is a vine tree so available for us to eat
The tree of life grows in and alongside the river of water of life, which spirals down the mountain to reach all twelve gates of the city
The divine revelation in the Bible, beginning from God's creation in Genesis 1, concludes with two long chapters, Revelation 21-22
In Genesis 2 we see the tree of life, and after all the ages the tree of life is still present in the New Jerusalem
In Genesis 2 the material was just lying there, but at the end of the Bible the gold, pearls, and precious stones are built into a city
The entire Bible is a revelation and a record of God's economy, and God's economy is consummated in the New Jerusalem
In Anaheim we were able to acquire two and a half acres of land to build a meeting hall according to my dream in Chefoo many years earlier
God also had a dream, and that dream was to have the New Jerusalem, a built up city, as the consummation of His economy
At the end of the Bible, we also see the tree of life, a flowing river, and precious materials built into a city according to God's economy
He has gone through a process, and through His process He has been consummated to be the processed and consummated Triune God
Revelation 1:1 says that the revelation of this book is made known by signs, symbols with spiritual significance
When we heard the gospel, repented of our sins, and believed into Christ, we were not conscious that God came inside of us
From that time onward, He has been sanctifying us, renewing us, transforming us, and conforming us to the image of the firstborn Son of God
When He glorifies us, He will bring our entire being into His glory to make us absolutely the same as He is in every way
When an oyster is wounded by a grain of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the grain of sand, making it into a precious pearl
In the whole universe, there will be a big cube, the New Jerusalem, which is the mingling of divinity with humanity
In the Old Testament times, there were a number of martyrs who sacrificed themselves to die for the Lord's interest
The man-child comprises the martyrs who cry at the fifth seal and the additional martyrs before the great tribulation
The man-child will be resurrected and raptured to the throne of God before the three and a half years of the great tribulation
The man-child will be the dead, martyred overcomers who will be resurrected and raptured to the throne before the great tribulation
These are the late overcomers who will pass through the great tribulation and overcome Antichrist and the worshipping of Antichrist
They will be martyred under the persecution of Antichrist and then resurrected to reign with Christ in the millennium
The resurrection and rapture of the majority of the saints will be very close to the end of the great tribulation
The believers either will be rewarded with the kingdom for one thousand years or will enter into outer darkness to suffer some discipline
He was working one day when the Boxers were parading on the street with their long swords in a threatening way
When this man saw her, he was shocked and said to himself that there must be something special about being a Christian
Because of this, he sought to find out what this 'foreign religion' of being a Christian was, and he was saved by the Lord
Today in this age before the rapture we have to learn the lesson of how to be one and of how to coordinate with one another with no opinion
We should reject our opinion and care only for our growth in Christ, transformation in Christ, and building up in Christ
When we are right in an overcoming situation, we love everything and everyone, and every situation is no problem to us
After our rapture, we will be ready to go along with one another, and we will be one entity as Christ's bride and Christ's army
Christ will judge His believers not concerning their eternal salvation but concerning their dispensational reward
The overcomers will also be priests of God and of Christ in the millennium to enjoy the ruling authority over the nations
Eventually, all the overcomers will be the New Jerusalem, as the bride of Christ for one thousand years, in its initial and fresh stage
The overcomers will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father in the heavenly part of the millennium
Besides the overcomers there will be a great number of immature saints but after the thousandyear kingdom all the believers will be matured
Eventually, all of the believers will join the overcomers to make the New Jerusalem larger than it was in the thousand-year kingdom
On the wedding day, the wife is the bride, but after the wedding day she is no longer the bride but simply the wife
The overcomers will consummate finally the Triune God's eternal economy in Christ through the consummated Spirit
After the one thousand years, all the believers will be matured to be included with the overcomers as the New Jerusalem for eternity
Our 'dream' is to become the New Jerusalem as the final consummation of the overcomers and the consummation of God's economy
There are millions of other lifeless and organic things, which may be considered as a decoration to God's universe
Genesis 1 says that God created man, and Malachi 4 says that God will come to man as the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings
The history of the entire universe is a history of God with man in the Old Testament, but this is not the ultimate consummation
How could these two lives be together as one, and how could there be a living of these two lives as one living?
He lived on this earth, and He died a wonderful, vicarious, all-inclusive death to terminate every negative thing in the universe
When He entered into us, the complete God and the perfect man entered with His human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
In the same principle, when we were regenerated, when God came into us, we did not realize that many wonderful things came into us
In God's economy there are three crucial factors-God and man plus the Bible, which reveals the history of God in His union with man
The result, the coming out, is the Triune God wrought into and mingled with our tripartite being to make us one person, one entity
At the conclusion of the divine revelation, all of God's chosen and redeemed people will be absolutely one in the Triune God
