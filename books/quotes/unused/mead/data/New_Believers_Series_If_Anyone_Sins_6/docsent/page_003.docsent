   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After the red heifer was killed, it was burned.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The skin, the flesh, the blood, and the dung were all burned.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The whole red heifer was burned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As it was being burned, the priest cast cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet into the midst of the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What do cedar wood and hyssop signify?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Kings 4:33 said that Solomon discoursed about trees, from the cedar to the hyssop.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Cedar wood and hyssop therefore signify all the trees.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In other words, they signify the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What does scarlet signify?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This word is also translated scarlet in Isaiah 1:18, which says, "Though your sins are like scarlet, /They will be as white as snow."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Scarlet, therefore, signifies our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For the cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet to be burned together means that the sins of the whole world were gathered together with the red heifer when it was offered up to God; they were all burned together.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here, we see a picture of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus offered Himself up to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He embraced all our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The gross sins were there as well as the lesser sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The sins of the past, the present, and the future were also there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The sins for which man feels the need of forgiveness, as well as the sins for which man does not feel the need of forgiveness, were there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All sins were upon the heifer, and they were all burned with it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After they were burned, what was done next?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Numbers 19:9 says, "A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and place them outside the camp in a clean place; and they shall be kept for the assembly of the sons of Israel for the water for impurity; it is a purification of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is what makes the red heifer so distinct.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet were burned with the heifer, the ashes were gathered up and kept in a clean place.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thereafter, if any of the Israelites touched something unclean and became unclean before God, another clean person could mix the water for impurity with the ashes and sprinkle it on the unclean person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This would remove the person's uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, the ashes were used to remove uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They were prepared for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They would be used when uncleanness was detected at a later time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Old Testament, sinners needed to offer up sacrifices to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a person had offered up a sacrifice and then touched something unclean, he would become unclean again before God and could no longer fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What did he have to do?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Another person would take some ashes of the red heifer on this person's behalf, put them in a vessel, pour in living water, mix it into the water for impurity, and sprinkle it on his body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The man's uncleanness would then be removed and his sin forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When an Israelite brought a bull or a lamb to the Lord and offered it up as a sin offering, he did it because of some known sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the red heifer was related to another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The burning of the red heifer was not for known sins which had been committed in the past, but for future uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The burning of the red heifer was not for past sins but for future transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This shows us another aspect of the Lord Jesus' work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One aspect of the Lord's work is like that of the ashes of the red heifer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The efficacy of redemption is signified by the ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The sins of the whole world are in it, and the blood is also in it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever a man becomes unclean or has touched some unclean things, he does not need to kill another red heifer and offer it to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He only needs to take the ashes of the red heifer that was offered once and mix them with water and sprinkle them on the body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, there is no need for the Lord to do anything a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His redemption accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He made provision for all of our future uncleanness and future sins.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Everything has been fully accomplished by His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What do the ashes signify?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the Bible, ashes signify something in its final form.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whether a bull or a lamb, its final form after being burned is ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Ashes are very stable; they do not corrupt into something else.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We cannot corrupt or destroy ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Ashes signify something in its final form.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The ashes of the red heifer signify the eternal and unchanging efficacy of the Lord's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The redemption which our Lord accomplished for us is most stable.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not think that rocks on mountains are stable.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even rocks can be burned into ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Ashes are more stable than rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The ashes of the red heifer signify the Lord's redemption which He has prepared for us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is forever unchanging and incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We may apply it any time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If a Christian touches something unclean by accident and there is uncleanness in him, he does not have to ask the Lord to die for him again.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He only needs to trust in the eternal and incorruptible efficacy of the ashes and to sprinkle his body with the water of life, and he will be clean.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In other words, the ashes of the red heifer tell us that the past work of the cross is applicable for our use today.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We also can say that the effectiveness of the cross covers all the needs we will ever have in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These ashes are specifically for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only one red heifer needs to be burned, and it only needs to be burned once.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Its ashes are enough to cover one's whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Thank the Lord that His redemption is sufficient for our whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>His death has taken away all our sins.</S>
