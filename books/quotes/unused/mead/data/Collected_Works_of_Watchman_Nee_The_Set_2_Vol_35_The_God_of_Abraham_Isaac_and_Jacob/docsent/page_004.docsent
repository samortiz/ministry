   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION Scripture Reading: Exo 3:6, 15-16; Matt 22:31-32 ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 10:11 says, "Now these things happened to them as an example..."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible records the history of the Israelites as an example to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is for the purpose of our edification.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although there is an outward difference between God's work in the Old Testament and His work in the New Testament, they are the same in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The principle of God's work is the same today as it was in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God chose the Israelites to be His people, and He also chose men from among the Gentiles to be His people Acts 15:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible says that we are fellow citizens and members of the household of God Eph 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It also says that we are the true Jews Rom 2:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the history of the Israelites is a pattern to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this book we will consider the way God deals with His people; in other words, the way God edifies His people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Putting it another way, this book will show the kind of experience we must acquire before we can become the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We will discuss this subject through a consideration of the history of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob because each of these three persons occupies a particular place in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible shows us that God's people had two beginnings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first beginning was with Abraham because God's selection and calling began with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The other beginning was with the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God told the Israelites that they would be a people to Him among all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They would be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation Exo 19:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, Abraham was a definite beginning for God's people, and the nation of Israel was also a definite beginning for God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In between these two beginnings, God gained three persons, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First there was Abraham, then there was Isaac, then Jacob, and then the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From that point on, the nation of Israel became the people of God, and God had a people of His own.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, we can say that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are the foundations of the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, there would not be the nation of Israel, and without Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, there would not be a people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's people became His people through the experience of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is interesting to note that God said, "I am...the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" Exo 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He said this in the Old Testament, and the Lord Jesus quoted it in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob" is quoted in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke Matt 22:32; Mark 12:26; Luke 20:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, the Lord Jesus said that we would see "Abraham and Isaac and Jacob...in the kingdom of God" Luke 13:28 , and that "many will come from the east and the west and will recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens" Matt 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here, He does not mention anyone else's names, only the names of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This shows that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob each occupy a special place in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why do Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob occupy such a special place in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is because God wants to select a group of people to come under His name and to make them His people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Beginning with Abraham, God began to gain a people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God had a spiritual beginning with Abraham, and He did something in Abraham for the purpose of showing us the necessary experience that God's people have to go through.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All of God's people have to go through the same kind of experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He did something in Abraham first, giving him some particular experiences, and through him He conveyed these experiences to all of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The nation of Israel is founded upon Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, God has worked not only in Abraham, but also in Isaac, giving him some particular experiences, and through him He conveyed these experiences to all of His people as well.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Similarly, God did some work in Jacob, giving him some particular experiences, and through him He conveyed these experiences to all of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The dealings which these three received before God and the experiences they went through culminated in a people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, the total experiences of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are the experiences that all of God's people should have.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The attainments of these three should be the attainments of all the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not enough to make us God's people if we merely have Abraham's experience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not enough to make us God's people if we merely have Isaac's experience, and it is not enough to make us God's people if we merely have Jacob's experience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must have the attainments of Abraham plus Isaac plus Jacob before we can become God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God told Isaac, "I am the God of Abraham thy father...I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake" Gen 26:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He told Jacob, "I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed" 28:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He also told the Israelites, "I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage" Exo 6:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This shows us that the Israelites entered into the inheritance of the three men, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They did not have any inheritance of their own.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Instead, they entered into the inheritance of the three men, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Each of these men occupies a particular position before God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Their different spiritual experiences typify three different kinds of spiritual principles.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In other words, all the people of God should have the element of Abraham, the element of Isaac, and the element of Jacob in them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Without these elements, we cannot become God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God's people must have the element of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All true Israelites and all genuine people of God must say that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are their ancestors.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To say that Abraham is our ancestor is not enough, because Ishmael and his descendants can also say that their ancestor is Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Neither is it enough to say that both Abraham and Isaac are our ancestors, because Esau and his descendents can say the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God's people must say that their ancestors are Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Jacob must be included for complete qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All three must be together before we can justifiably be a people of God.</S>
