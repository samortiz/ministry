<h2 class="head1">GOING OUT WITH LIFE AND TRUTH TO SPREAD<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>A brother recently encouraged us with a report that in his city the saints had visited over two thousand five hundred homes within the past month. Among these two thousand five hundred homes, one hundred home meetings were established! In one out of twenty-five homes the saints were able to set up a meeting. Now I have the assurance to say that one saint, who really has the heart to go out for the Lord and knock on doors, will get one home within one month&mdash;one saint, one home, one month. Go out on the weekend or on the Lord&rsquo;s day. Every Lord&rsquo;s day, every weekend, you could knock on six doors. In a month you will knock on about twenty-five doors and according to the rate of one out of twenty-five doors, you will gain one home. Therefore, year round, each person will get twelve homes.</p>
<p>Around the globe in different countries, there are more than six hundred churches comprising over one hundred and twenty thousand saints. If the Lord is really merciful to all of us and we are faithful to receive His grace, out of this number perhaps sixty thousand around the globe will go out. In one year&rsquo;s time we can get seven hundred and twenty thousand homes around the globe. These homes will be our mission field. We do not need to go out to a mission field to be missionaries. Let us just be &ldquo;home missionaries.&rdquo; From each of these seven hundred and twenty thousand homes, we will get two persons each year. If we would be faithful, we could have an increase of up to one and a half million a year. This rate is for the regular saints, not the full-timers.</p>
<p>We have fellowshipped in the past that out of twenty saints there should be one full-timer (see p. 75 of <em>The Way to Practice the Lord&rsquo;s Present Move</em>). Out of one hundred and twenty thousand saints, there should be six thousand full-timers going out to knock on doors. Could not each full-timer under a strict training baptize one a week? Thus, one full-timer should get fifty-two a year. Six thousand times fifty-two would yield another three hundred and twelve thousand. Therefore, it is not too much to say that with sixty thousand saints and six thousand full-timers, we could get about two million a year. This is glad tidings!</p>
<p>I have participated in the carrying out of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for over fifty-four years, and I am full of thanks to the Lord that I am still here. Recently I began to consider how merciful the Lord has been to me. I am now over eighty. In Psalm 90:10 the Bible says that a man&rsquo;s life or age can only reach eighty &ldquo;by reason of strength.&rdquo; If I were not here, it would be hard for anyone to change the practice of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. But, from October 1984 in Taiwan, I began to see the glad tidings that the only way for the Lord to build up His church is by the homes and the home meetings.</p>
<p>The elders should take the lead as the head sheep (1 Pet. 5:3) to go out and should not merely sit in the church service office. Go out! You have to take the lead to go out to knock on the doors, not only on Saturday or the Lord&rsquo;s day but every day. Go out both in the morning and the evening. In the evenings, you would meet the gentlemen and in the mornings you would meet the ladies, especially the elderly ladies. If you go, the elderly ladies will welcome you. You will gain many of them and much prayer will be offered by these ladies for their sons, grandsons, and relatives. May all the elders rise up to go out every day, morning and evening, with prayer in the afternoon, to knock on doors, teach the truth, and set up home meetings.</p>
<p>No other Christian body can imitate us because of two main reasons. The Lord started His recovery with two things&mdash;life and truth. In church history, it is hard to find any organization, any group of Christians, that has been raised up, established, and built up with life and truth. Regardless of how short a time you have been in the recovery, you should have realized that the main item is life. I do not mean that each one of the saints is in life all the time. But in a general way most of the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are for life. With life there is also the truth.</p>
<p>The Lord has also blessed us with the truth. Now we can go out by life with the truth. We have the life within which is our very fiber, our very element, our very essence. We go out with this life essence within and with the truth in our hand&mdash;life within and the truth without. We have the Recovery Version of the New Testament, <em>The Mystery of Human Life,</em> the rainbow booklets, the Life-study Messages, and all the books in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>Two heretical groups, the Mormons and the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses, knock on people&rsquo;s doors very much. They bring heretical teachings to people, but we bring the divine life and the divine truth. We have the mingling of the divine life with the human life within and the truth in our hands without. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to the United States in 1962, yet even by 1970 the time was not yet ripe for us to go out in a full-scale way because not much of the ministry had been published. Now, however, we have Life-study Messages on the entire New Testament and a Recovery Version of the New Testament. Furthermore, most of the churches, especially those in Taiwan and in the United States, have been fully and strongly established. Hence, now is the time for all the saints to go out. We have the life with the truth in the established churches.</p>
