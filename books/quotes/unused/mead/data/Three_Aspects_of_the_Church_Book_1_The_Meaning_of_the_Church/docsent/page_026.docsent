   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And he has given all that he has to him v. 36 . This signifies the Holy Spirit testifying of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Holy Spirit calls man, He enables man to know that Christ is the Son of God and that God has given everything in the universe to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everything includes all matters and all things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Everything of God and everything He has accomplished, have been given to His Son as the Heir Heb 1:2 .</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Pledge of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After we have the sealing and the testimony of the Holy Spirit, the pledge of the Holy Spirit is added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ephesians 1:14 and 2 Corinthians 1:22 both speak of a pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A pledge is similar to a pawn.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I take my clothes to a pawnshop, the pawnshop gives me a sum of money.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Japanese call their pawnshops pledge houses.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A pledge is similar to something that has been pawned; thus, the thing that is pawned may also be called a pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word pledge also has the meaning of a security.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we seek a loan from the bank, we must present a lien on our house to the bank as a security.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our house becomes the collateral.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Holy Spirit enters into us, He is not only the seal but also the pledge, the pawn, the security.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This security is the guarantee that God has given us, guaranteeing that everything in the heavens is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the servant met Rebekah, his first action was to give her a golden ring and bracelets.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After obtaining the consent of Rebekah and her family, the old servant immediately brought forth gold jewelry, silver jewelry, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother Gen 24:53 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The gold jewelry, silver jewelry, and clothing that the servant gave her were not a seal but a pledge, a security, which is something more than a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ephesians 1:14 says that the Holy Spirit is the pledge of our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Greek word for pledge has the meaning of a sample.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the selling of land in ancient times, the seller was required to give the purchaser a sample of soil from the land to confirm that the land being sold contained that soil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Similarly, the gold jewelry, silver jewelry, and clothing that the old servant gave to Rebekah were samples of the wealth of Isaac s house.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The servant took a portion of Isaac s riches and gave it to Rebekah in order to show her the wealth of the one she was to marry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the things were a pledge, guaranteeing that what was not yet in her hands would also be her portion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Previously, Abraham had given everything to Isaac; thus, if Rebekah married Isaac, all that he had would become hers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because she had not yet seen or enjoyed the riches of Isaac, the servant gave a portion to her as a foretaste for her enjoyment, guaranteeing that the rest would come later.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The servant gave Rebekah gold jewelry, silver jewelry, and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In typology, gold signifies the life of God, silver signifies the Lord s redemption, and clothing signifies the righteousnesses of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, the salvation that the Lord gives us is pledged by the Holy Spirit who works the Lord s redemption on the cross into us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is in the Holy Spirit that God accepts and justifies us, and it is also because of the Holy Spirit that our behavior is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These things issue from the pledging of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our receiving the pledge of the Holy Spirit includes our obtaining the life of God, the application of the Lord s redemption on the cross, our experience of being justified and reconciled by God, and a change in our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is in the Holy Spirit that we taste God s life, enjoy the element of Christ s redemption, and experience being justified by God, which causes us to be accepted by God, have peace with God, be reconciled to God, and have a genuine change in our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All that we receive in the Holy Spirit works out the completion of God s salvation in us, causing us to be fully saved.</S>
