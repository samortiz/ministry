   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In God's thought man was not only to be the instrument of the eternal purpose, but was also the vessel for His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The eternal purpose was to be secured through man, but it was also to be secured for man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man was to undo the enemy's work, and he was also to reap the benefit of that undoing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is like sending a person for something, and then telling him that the thing for which he was sent also belongs to him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's eternal purpose concerned Christ Jesus, but it also concerned man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the reason we were chosen by God before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many theologians miss this point.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They try to relate predestination with redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually predestination is related to God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In God's original purpose He did not elect all mankind to be the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He elected some to have the characteristics of His Son, while He predestinated others to be His very sons in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In eternity past God foreordained His Son to be Head of all angelic beings Eph 1:20-21 and also to be Head of the church, that is, the Head of man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was understood by the Son that He should take on a human form and become a real man with a physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This individual Man, Christ Jesus, was to become the Head of the corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He in Himself is the personal Christ; He plus the church is the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man was created innocent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was perfect but not per- fected.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God intended him to be in union with His Son, having the life of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man was placed in the garden of Eden, in which were two trees: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since man had a free will, he could choose according to his will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The tree of life is God Himself, who is the source of all life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fruit of the tree of life is the tree of life in edible form, which is our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In John 6:54 the Lord said, "He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eating of the fruit of the tree of life would result in union with Christ in eternal life, whereas taking of the other tree would result in having independent judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Adam knew there was only One in the universe who could discern between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He knew that unless he ate of the forbidden tree, he would have to refer to God's judgment in all questions; he would have to rely on God in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you saw a man with no knowledge of good and evil, you would say he was an undeveloped man, and Adam was undeveloped, even though he was perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By taking the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he developed his manhood, developed himself independently of God; he became a full-grown man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We hear preaching such as this: "You have sinned; therefore, you need the life of God in order to be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Quite apart from sin we need the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Adam, even before the fall, needed the fruit of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Apart from committing any specific sin, as long as man develops through his own natural resources, he needs salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If man only perfects himself as man, he cannot still dwell with God, because he does not have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just being a man is the same as being lost to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not necessary to sin in order to need the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you miss the tree of life, you can have no inward union with God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life" 1 John 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's purpose was that man should destroy the rebellious will by linking his will with the divine will, and man needed the life of God to fulfill the purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Alas, instead of linking his will with God's, man became Satan's ally so that both created wills were united against the uncreated will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How could God deal with such a situation?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Man had failed God, but God's purpose could not be frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He made another Man, the Man Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First, He is a typical man, a real man in every sense, yet with God's life as the mainspring, just as Adam would have been had he eaten the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He came not as the Son of God but as the Son of Man, as God's model man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Second, He fully answered to God's will for man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God's purpose was that man should be both an instrument and a vessel for His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ was both.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the earth there was one will and only one, which was perfectly linked with the will in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more we appreciate the situation God sought to meet through Christ, the more we can appreciate what He has done.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First, there was a rebellious will to be cast down.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Second, there was the matter of sin to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Third, there was life to be given.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the death of Christ all these things were accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ's propitiation was remedial, but His death was not just for propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was necessary, apart from redemption, for the fulfillment of God's original purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His death was necessary that He might become the fruit of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He had to release His life through death John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>John 12 does not speak of propitiation, nor is it spoken of in Luke 12:49-50.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Both speak of death and resurrection, not of atonement.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Luke 12:50 says that He was "pressed," and He longed for His life to be released through baptism, which is death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Ephesians 5:25 says, "Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those in view here are not "sinners" as such, but the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this verse there is no mention of the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is entirely a matter of flesh and bone, not of blood v. 30 . In verse 31 we see that the illustration is taken from the garden of Eden and is used in connection with Christ and the church v. 32 .</S>
