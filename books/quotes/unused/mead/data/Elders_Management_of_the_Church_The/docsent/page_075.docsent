   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ELDERS AND THE DEACONS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The elders in the church are the ones who conduct the administration of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are the ones who govern, rule, administer, and conduct affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The function of the deacons in the church is in the nature of service.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Their work is much like what is commonly spoken of as business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everything in the church should be proposed and decided by the elders, and all the business affairs in the church should be carried out and executed by the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The boundary between these two things should be very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Otherwise, sometimes the elders will be doing the work of the deacons, and the deacons will be doing the work of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Certain things that should be done by the deacons are done by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the elders have overstepped the functions of the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Take, for instance, the matter of arranging the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How should the hall be arranged?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When should it be arranged?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Proposals and decisions in these matters are for the elders to make.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when the hall is actually being arranged, the matter should be handed over to the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the elders have to be involved directly with this kind of arranging work, the elders have done the work of the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, such a thing puts the deacons out of a job.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the other hand, the more important works that the elders should have done are left undone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, we see that this kind of practice is entirely a damage to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the other hand, the affairs of the church should be conducted and decided by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But suppose the elders neglect their duties and leave it to the deacons to make decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The deacons do not represent the authority and do not know the condition of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When they make proposals regarding the church, this will affect the atmosphere of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reason these abnormalities occur is that the elders are not clear about the matter of boundaries.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, all proposals in the church must definitely be initiated by the elders, and as much as possible all services in the church must be handed over to the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The elders must stay within their own boundaries.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They must only do the things that are within their boundaries and must let the deacons do the things that should be done by the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a difficult thing for the elders to do, because the elders will then have to be responsible to bring in some deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many are of the disposition that since they can take care of the matters by themselves, it would be more convenient to do the things by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In that way, they could do things the way they want.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It would be very inconvenient to bring along someone else in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only will they be restricted, but they will have to learn to be humble and to accept the dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is why many times the elders simply take the shortcut and do the work themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When they do this once, twice, three times, four times, on and on, it becomes impossible for the deacons to be perfected.</S>
