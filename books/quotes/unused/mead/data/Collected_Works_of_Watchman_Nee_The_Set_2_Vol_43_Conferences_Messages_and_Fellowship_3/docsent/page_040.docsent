   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTY-SIX GOD'S WAY OF ACCOMPLISHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HIS PURPOSE 1 Date: August 6, 1937</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Singapore</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading: Gen 2:21; 3:21; Luke 12:49-50; John 12:24; 20:17; 1 Cor 12:12 EARNESTLY SEEKING AFTER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE RICHES IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the past few days we have seen our position in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to receive the riches in Christ, a person has to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But only those who are hungry can believe and receive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Please remember that being hungry does not mean being dissatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many people are dissatisfied with their life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They think that this is being hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today there are many other people who are not satisfied with their life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They realize that they are not living in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But they do not have any hunger at all; they do not have a seeking heart before the Lord on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Being dissatisfied is something negative; being hungry is something positive.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Dissatisfaction is merely a reaction toward one's present condition, whereas hunger is one's aspiration and pursuit for what is ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, only those who are truly seeking can be considered as the hungry ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I must warn you that those who are not satisfied with their present living can only understand the doctrines of the Bible; they cannot have any spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you do not experience anything, you cannot blame anyone else; you are the one who is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who are not hungry before God can only understand doctrines; they cannot experience the reality that is behind the doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I must say emphatically that a person who is not seeking will leave here in the same condition in which he came.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The truth has no effect on such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>May the Lord grant us mercy to have a living faith through a seeking heart so that we can be those who truly live in Christ and inherit all the promises that are prepared for us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>OF THE WORK OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today let us continue to consider the four aspects of the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, there is the blood from His death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The blood takes away our sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is something objective.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ died for us and shed His blood for us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, we receive life before God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second, man sins because the old man lives in him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The old man is attracted to sin, and then the flesh performs acts of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to save us to the uttermost, God has to remove our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, the Bible shows us the matter of crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Crucifixion removes the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After the old man is removed, a new man lives within.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible tells us that if we are conformed to Him in the likeness of His death, we will also be conformed to Christ in the likeness of His resurrection Rom 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we die with Christ, we shall also be raised together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ died and shed His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the third day He rose as proof of the accomplishment of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have the crucifixion and the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Crucifixion removes the old man; this is something on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the positive side, we have the new man living within.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The blood and crucifixion deal with Adam's fall on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If Adam had not fallen, Christ would not have needed to shed His blood, and there would not have been the need to crucify the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, Christ had to die on the cross because Adam fell.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have seen the two negative aspects during the previous few evenings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now let us go on to see how God accomplishes His purpose.</S>
