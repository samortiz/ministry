The reason is that the length of time between the sixty-two weeks and the last week is a mystery. The interval between the sixty-two weeks and the last week is the age of grace. This age lasts from the calves, which are below the knees, to the toes of the great human image. This period of time is difficult to calculate. Concerning the head, the breast and the arms, the abdomen and the thighs, and the two legs of the great human image, history has already demonstrated clearly that they refer to the four empires-Babylon, Medo-Persia, Macedonia-Greece, and Rome. In particular, the two legs refer to the Roman Empire. In the Bible iron signifies authority (Rev. 12:5) and denotes dictatorship or autocracy. After iron ended, clay has been rising gradually. Clay signifies democracy and the rights of the people, because man was created by God with the dust of the earth. For people to have rights is related to clay. Up to the present, the presidents of the United States have strongly advocated human rights. This means that they preferred to have a great amount of clay. However, the communist countries prefer to have a great amount of iron, so they are countries with &#8220;iron curtains.&#8221; This is the mixture of partly iron and partly clay, yet the two &#8220;will not cleave to one another&#8221; (Dan. 2:43). Not only is it hard to calculate the years in this period, but this period itself is even a mystery.<h2 class=head2>The Four Dispensations in God&#8217;s Economy</h2><p>The four dispensations in God&#8217;s eternal economy-the dispensation of the patriarchs, the dispensation of law, the dispensation of grace, and the dispensation of righteousness-in their practical carrying out are actually four periods. Hence, the word dispensation is really hard to understand according to its literal meaning, and it is even more difficult to understand when used in theology. Therefore, practically it is best to use the word age. Accordingly, the dispensation of the patriarchs is the age of the patriarchs, the dispensation of law is the age of law, the dispensation of grace is the age of grace, and the dispensation of righteousness is the age of righteousness, the age of the kingdom.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S ECONOMY BEING GOD&#8217;S HOUSEHOLD ADMINISTRATION</h2><p>From the preceding paragraphs we can understand that oikonomia is God&#8217;s household administration. In brief, it is God&#8217;s administration. Ephesians 1:10 says, &#8220;Unto the economy of the fullness of the times&#8221;; this means &#8220;unto the administration, the household administration of God, of the fullness of the ages.&#8221; God&#8217;s administration or household administration is an arrangement in God&#8217;s house. From this we see that it is best to translate this word into economy, the anglicized form of the Greek word oikonomia.<p>The cultural history of the whole world can be said to have been recorded in the Bible, because everything was created, arranged, and ordained by God. For example, we can see from the feet that are &#8220;partly of iron and partly of clay&#8221; that a long time ago the Bible referred to democracy. This helps us to understand the meaning of the Chinese term ching lun. When we describe someone who is full of plans, intentions, and arrangements, we say that such a one is &#8220;filled with ching lun.&#8221; Regrettably, such an expression does not exist in the English language. Hence, in the English Recovery Version we use the word economy. Other English versions use dispenation instead of economy. For instance, the American Standard Version uses dispensation in Ephesians 1:10 and 3:9. Such a rendering does not clearly express the original meaning of the word and makes it hard for people to understand.<p>After a thorough study of human history, culture, and language with its usage, Webster&#8217;s Dictionary was compiled. In this dictionary there are many definitions for the word dispensation. One of the definitions says that this word refers to &#8220;a divine ordering and administration of worldly affairs,&#8221; and another definition says that it refers to &#8220;a period of history during which a particular divine revelation has predominated in the affairs of mankind.&#8221; This means that there is an administration in every age or period, and the age itself can be referred to by the administration in that age. Therefore, in God&#8217;s economy there are the dispensations, or arrangements, of the age of the patriarchs, the age of law, the age of grace, and the age of righteousness.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
