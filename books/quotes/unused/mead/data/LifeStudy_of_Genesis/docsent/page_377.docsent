   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 Isaac's Enjoyment of the Inheritance</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For his completion, Abraham also needed Isaac's enjoyment of the inheritance 24:36; 25:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From the day Abraham was called by God, God began to rob him of things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Firstly, God took away his brother and then his father.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Later, God rejected Eliezer, commanded Abraham to cast out Ishmael, and told him to offer Isaac on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After Isaac had been returned, Sarah died.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Abraham's life was not a life of enjoyment; it was a life of being robbed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Isaac's life, on the contrary, was a life full of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Isaac did not do anything; he simply inherited all his father had.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In our Christian life we have the experiences of both Abraham and Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On one hand we are always being robbed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God rejects whatever we have.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He seems to say, "You like it, but I don't like it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You want to give it, but I won't take it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You want to preserve it, but I reject it."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In a very good sense, God always acts contrary to our wishes and intentions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Abraham wanted to take his father with him, but the father was taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He wanted to have Lot, but Lot separated from him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He wanted Eliezer to be his heir, but Eliezer was rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He wanted to keep Ishmael, but God commanded him to cast out the son of the bondwoman.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Abraham loved his son Isaac, but God required that he be offered to Him upon the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A while later, Sarah, Abraham's dear wife, was taken.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I doubt that Abraham had much time for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But there is another side to our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While we are suffering the robbing, we are enjoying our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why the records of Abraham and Isaac overlap, whereas the records of those who preceded them, such as Abel, Enoch, and Noah, do not.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The record of Isaac is mixed together with that of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While Abraham was suffering, Isaac was enjoying.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While Abraham was weeping, Isaac was rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that our Christian life is a life of night and morning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Night is at our left hand and morning is at our right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Christian life, night and morning go together.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times I have been unable to determine whether I was in the night or in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While I was in the morning I was in the night, and while I was in the night, I was in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, I was Abraham being robbed of everything, and on the other hand, I was Isaac enjoying the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all have been selected with Jacob and have been called and have believed with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we have been robbed with Abraham and have been enjoying with Isaac, one day we all shall be matured with Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not say that a certain brother is a Jacob or Abraham or Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should call him a Jacob-Abraham-Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is Jacob at the beginning and at the ending, and he is Abraham with Isaac in the middle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These three are one complete person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As we have seen, the maturity in life is neither with Abraham nor Isaac but with Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The sign of the maturity of life is blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have seen thousands of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Nearly every one has been either supplanting or complaining.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some saints complain about the elders, the brothers, and all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It seems that the only church they like is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Complaining is a sign of immaturity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When you have matured, you will not complain; you will bless, saying, "O God, bless all the brothers and all the churches."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For the one who is matured in life, the supplanting hand has become the blessing hand.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more mature you are, the more you will bless others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You will not only bless the good ones, but the bad ones and even the worst ones.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Abraham's life was wonderful and has been appreciated by Christians throughout the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But, as we have seen, he was not mature in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our God is not only God the Father, but also God the Son and God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is not only the God of Abraham, but also the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May we all see that we need all three aspects, the life of Abraham plus the lives of Isaac and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Triune God is working within us as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit to make us the full expression of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is the Triune God, and we must be a person of three aspects in the spiritual experiences of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to be transformed in full.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we have been fully transformed, God will have the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
