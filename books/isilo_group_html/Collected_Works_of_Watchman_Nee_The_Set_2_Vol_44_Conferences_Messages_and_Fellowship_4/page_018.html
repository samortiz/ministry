They also show us that Satan has his authority and deceptions. Many believers fail because they are ignorant of the enemy's deceptions. Colossians 1:13 and Acts 26:18 clearly show that Satan has a kingdom and authority. When the Lord talks about a kingdom divided against itself in Matthew 12, He is talking about the kingdom of Satan. The Lord knows that Satan has a kingdom. Today we want to see the organization of Satan's kingdom, the goal of his kingdom, and the methods he employs to reach his goal.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ORGANIZATION OF SATAN'S KINGDOM</h2><p>There are two sides to the organization of Satan's kingdom&mdash;the spiritual side and the physical side. He uses spiritual materials as well as physical materials to build up his kingdom. On the spiritual side, there are corrupted angels and unclean demons, that is, evil spirits. On the physical side, there is man.</p><h2 class="head2">Spiritual Materials</h2><h2 class="head3">Satan Himself&mdash;Revelation 12:9</h2><p>The Hebrew word for Satan is used thirty-five times in the Old Testament. Its Greek equivalent is used thirty-eight times in the New Testament. In the Bible, several names are associated with Satan:</p><p>(1) The dragon (Rev. 12:3-4, 9). The dragon is the one who deceives the whole world. He is referred to in 1 Thessalonians 3:5 as "the tempter." He has seven heads and ten horns and is very powerful.</p><p>(2) The serpent (Gen. 3:1-15). The serpent is most beguiling in seducing men to sin and become fallen.</p><p>(3) The devil (Rev. 12:9). The meaning of the word devil is "the accuser" or "the slanderer." He accuses us before God and slanders us before men.</p><p>(4) Satan (Rev. 12:9). The meaning of the word Satan is "the adversary." He is God's adversary, opposing and rebelling against God.</p><p>(5) Apollyon (Rev. 9:11). The meaning of the word Apollyon is "the destroyer." He is a cruel and treacherous enemy.</p><p>(6) Beelzebul (Matt. 12:24). The meaning of Beelzebul is "the lord of the dunghill." This means he nags and annoys.</p><h2 class="head3">The Corrupted Angels&mdash;Matthew 25:41</h2><p>Revelation 12:4 tells us that one-third of the angels fell and followed Satan when he rebelled against God. With them Satan organized a kingdom of darkness. The "world-rulers of this darkness" in Ephesians 6:12 and the "rulers and authorities" in Colossians 2:15 refer to them.</p><p>Psalm 82 also speaks concerning them. In verse 1 "the congregation of God" and "the gods" refer to these angels. They have been sent by Satan to rule over this world and to deal cruelly with men. In verses 1 through 4 God rebuked their unrighteousness and exhorted them. In verse 5 we are told that they did not take heed to His rebuke and exhortation. Verses 6 and 7 speak of God's judgment and punishment concerning them, and verse 8 is a prayer of the psalmist.</p><p>Daniel 10:13-21 mentions two princes, who are evil, ruling angels, that is, the rulers and authorities under Satan's hand. This passage of the Scriptures shows that behind every nation there is an evil angel sent from Satan, who manipulates its politics behind the scenes.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 44: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (4) &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
