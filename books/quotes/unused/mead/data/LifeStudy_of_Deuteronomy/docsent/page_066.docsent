   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"When you vow a vow to Jehovah your God, you shall not delay in paying it; for Jehovah your God would certainly require it of you and it will become sin in you" v. 21 . To vow a vow to God and then not fulfill it, not carry it out, is sin.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some of the saints may want to make a vow to the Lord to serve Him full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, God is "hungry" and "thirsty" for us to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He wants people to be for Him and to serve Him full-time.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are busy in the world taking care of themselves and their own interests, leaving God hungry and thirsty, with hardly anyone willing to serve Him full-time.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that He does not compel us to offer ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is thirsty for full-timers, but promising to serve Him in this way is a matter of our free will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do not make such a vow, God will not count it as sin that we do not vow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if we vow a vow to the Lord, we must fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Otherwise, the failure to fulfill the vow will be counted as sin.</S>

Those who made a vow voluntarily, promising God to do a certain thing, were required to keep and do what proceeded out of their lips.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today, those who promise to serve the Lord full-time should keep their promise and fulfill their vow.</S>
