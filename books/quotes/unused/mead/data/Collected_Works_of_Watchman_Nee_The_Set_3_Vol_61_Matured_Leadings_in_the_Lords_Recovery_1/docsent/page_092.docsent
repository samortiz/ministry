   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DEACONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Tonight we will consider the responsibilities and services of the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The work of the deacons is absolutely different from that of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The elders oversee with the eyes; their main responsibility does not lie in doing the work themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the deacons have to work with their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They also must involve the brothers and sisters in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word deacon is diakonos in Greek; it means a serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In English it is translated as servant, minister, or deacon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A deacon does not propose any plans to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The elders do the planning, while the deacons work together to carry out the assignment by taking the lead among the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a church is strong, the elders take care of the overseeing and the deacons take care of the execution.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The deacons should work more than the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The basic principle of service for the elders is oversight, while the basic principle of service for the deacons is implementation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the deacons have to understand the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In other words, they have to understand God's will through the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The biblical principle is not to do anything rashly or impulsively; we have to make good arrangements ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the deacons encounter something, they should not tackle it right away.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead, they should first think and consider carefully before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In carrying out the task, they should not work alone but should ask the brothers and sisters to watch them and learn from them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In distributing the bread to the five thousand, the Lord asked the disciples to sit the crowd down in groups of fifties and hundreds.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At that time no one knew the reason for doing this, but at Pentecost three thousand people were saved, and had to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the disciples had not been trained by the Lord to face such a large crowd, they would not have known what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If they did not know what to do with a hundred and fifty-three fish John 21:6, 11 , how could they know what to do with three thousand people?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is harder to deal with men than with fish.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When a man believes in the Lord, we do not consider our job to be finished and then ask him to go home.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Gospels the Lord trained the disciples to take care of practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He fed a multitude twice, one of five thousand people and another of four thousand Mark 6:30-44; 8:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In both cases he asked the crowd to first sit down.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The crowds were divided into groups of fifties and hundreds.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If they remained standing, they would bump into each other easily; fifty can easily become seventy-five, and a hundred can easily become seventy-five.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Human beings move around, and when their legs are free they do not tend to remain still, but once they sit down, they are not mobile and do not move easily.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Perhaps the disciples divided the three thousand into thirty groups.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This would be much easier to handle than a mob of three thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whether it was the feeding of the multitude or baptism, arrangements brought in order and avoided confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE PROPER WAY FOR THE DEACONS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>TO CONDUCT BUSINESS Actual Practice Sessions</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can identify three basic steps or principles for management from the way the Lord trained the disciples to conduct business.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, we should provide sessions for the brothers and sisters to have a chance to do some actual practice.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord believed in practice sessions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the reason He took the lead to train the disciples this way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Acts we see that all the believers had everything in common.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They distributed to each according to the need.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Actually, the Lord had trained the disciples to do this already.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was the reason the disciples were able to carry this out later.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The deacons should never be afraid of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They should take the lead to show the brothers and sisters how to do things first.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Consider how we set up our chairs in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes some saints set up the chairs in such a way that no one can sit down.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The chairs must be spaced far enough apart, and there must be enough chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are skills to doing the work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One does not pick up such a skill the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The deacons have to provide opportunity for the brothers and sisters to have actual practice.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I always attach one condition to officiating a marriage ceremony: The involved parties have to come together the day before the marriage and make a trial run to get things right.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Otherwise, they can ask someone else to officiate the ceremony; I will have no part in it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We will know how to act only by having a trial run.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Otherwise, the wedding procession music may play five times and the bride still may not be ready.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Gentiles will think that we are too sloppy, and they will laugh at us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once a sister, Miss Kingston, observed the order in our wedding meeting and remarked, "It's too bad that I am so old.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Otherwise, I would surely be married at Wen-teh Lane and let you officiate my wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Your way is right.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we do not have proper order, we will not glorify the Lord."</S>
