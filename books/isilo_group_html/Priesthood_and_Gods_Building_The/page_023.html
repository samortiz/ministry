for Dispensing Grace</h2>
<p>Let us consider the second point of explanation. Some people understand the throne in Revelation 22 to be a throne for ruling. They do not consider it to be a throne for dispensing grace. God has only one throne; He does not have two thrones. The throne from which He rules is the throne from which He imparts grace. On the one hand, the throne is for ruling; on the other hand, it is for imparting grace (20:4; Heb. 4:16).</p>
<p>The throne being for ruling is related to kingship, but the throne being for dispensing grace is related to the priesthood. The believers are royal priests. We are God&rsquo;s commonwealth, His kingdom, and His kings. In this respect, God&rsquo;s throne is for Him to reign. We are also His priests. In this respect, the throne of God is for dispensing grace. The book of Hebrews is mainly concerning the priesthood. Therefore, it says that the throne of God is a throne of grace: &ldquo;Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help&rdquo; (v. 16). The throne of God that the priests touch has the aspect of dispensing grace, not the aspect of ruling.</p>
<p>Revelation 1:6 and 5:10 say that, on the one hand, we are priests to God and that, on the other hand, we are His kingdom. At the end of the Bible, these two aspects are consummated in the throne of God. As God&rsquo;s redeemed ones, when we touch God according to our royal status, we touch the throne for ruling, and when we touch Him according to our status as priests, we touch the throne that dispenses grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TREE OF LIFE AND THE WATER OF LIFE<br />
BEING TWO STEPS OF GOD&rsquo;S FLOWING OUT</h2>
<p>The river of water of life and the tree of life are God&rsquo;s flowing out. God is no longer hidden. He no longer dwells only in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16). God has come forth in the way of flowing out.</p>
<p>There are numerous cases in the Bible that portray God flowing out. Some examples include the water flowing out of the smitten rock (Exo. 17:6), the blood and water flowing out of the pierced side of the Lord Jesus on the cross (John 19:34), and the river flowing out of the house of God (Ezek. 47:1-12). These examples speak of God flowing out.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s coming forth, His flowing out, is so that He may be man&rsquo;s life. He becomes man&rsquo;s life by being man&rsquo;s food and drink. If we read the Bible thoroughly, we will see that God&rsquo;s coming forth is for Him to be among men and that He is received into man to be man&rsquo;s life by being food and drink.</p>
<p>The tree of life denotes Christ, the Son of God. The first step of God&rsquo;s flowing out was His incarnation as the Son to be God&rsquo;s expression. God the Son is the expression of God the Father (John 1:18). God the Son came to be among men as the man Jesus Christ. He said that He came that men may have life (10:10). He also said that He is life and that He is the bread of life that came down from heaven for man to eat (11:25; 6:33, 35, 50). How marvelous it is that He is not only the bread of life but also a vine tree and that those who eat Him are His branches (15:5)! By putting these verses together, we can see that the tree of life denotes the first step of God&rsquo;s flowing out to be man&rsquo;s food, making Him edible.</p>
<p>When Christ was on the earth, He was the bread of life that came down from heaven. Those who eat Him do not hunger but live because of Him (6:35, 57). He was also living water for people to drink (4:14). Chapter 7 says that this living water is the Holy Spirit, who flows out as rivers from those who drink Him (vv. 38-39). This corresponds to Revelation 22:1. The river of water of life is the Holy Spirit who flows into man and is received by man.</p>
<p>The tree of life and the river of water of life reveal the two steps of God&rsquo;s flowing out (vv. 1-2). The first step of God&rsquo;s flowing out is in His Son to be the bread of life for man to eat. The second step of God&rsquo;s flowing out is in the Spirit to be the water of life for man to drink. Hence, the river of water of life with the tree of life growing on both sides of the river is a portrait of Christ as the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). God flowed out to be the bread of life as well as the water of life. God is in the Son as the bread of life, and He is the Spirit as the water of life. Moreover, the bread of life and the water of life are together. It is with the Spirit and as the Spirit that Christ can be enjoyed by man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW JERUSALEM NOT BEING A PLACE</h2>
<p>We should not consider the tree of life and the river of water of life to be related to a geographical location. Many of us still have the natural concept that believers have a place that they will go to in the future. However, the New Testament does not speak of a place where the believers will be forevermore. Gospel preachers like to speak about an eternal home. But the New Testament does not speak of a place that is the eternal home of the believers. The destination of the believers is the mingling of God with man.</p>
<p>We cannot comprehend fully the mingling of God with man, just as we cannot understand how the Lord Jesus, after His resurrection, was able to enter a room that had shut doors (John 20:19-20). We cannot understand the things of God merely with our mind. Likewise, what we see with our eyes is not always accurate. An object that appears to be blue may not actually be blue. We cannot use our limited view or impression to define the glorious situation in the future. It is foolishness to use our limited ability of understanding to define the things of God.</p>
<p>Our concepts have bound our comprehension of our glory in the future to a place. Therefore, we think of going to heaven in the future, that is, of going to a bright and beautiful place. However, we should not have so much consideration about a place. Place is not an issue to a baby who is at his mother&rsquo;s bosom. As long as the baby has milk to drink, whether he is in a palace or in a cottage makes no difference to him. God&rsquo;s salvation does not save us to a place that is outside of God. His salvation saves us into Himself. Therefore, we should not understand the New Jerusalem to be a place in the future, such as a heavenly mansion.</p>
<p>According to the last two chapters of Revelation, John did not see people dwelling in the New Jerusalem. Neither the twelve apostles nor the twelve tribes of Israel were dwelling there. On the contrary, the twelve apostles are the foundations, and the twelve tribes of Israel are the gates. This picture is full of meaning. Suppose there is a picture of a stone with a person&rsquo;s name written on it. This would indicate that the stone refers to that person. Therefore, according to the description in the Bible, the New Jerusalem is not a place where people will dwell. Rather, the constituents of the New Jerusalem are those who will participate in the holy city.</p>
<p>We are not saying that there will not be a New Jerusalem. Indeed, there will be a New Jerusalem. However, the New Jerusalem will not be merely a place, as taught in the traditional beliefs of Christianity. If we understand the New Jerusalem merely as a place, we will have problems in understanding the Bible. Our understanding concerning the New Jerusalem must be delivered from the concept of a place. Then we will see that the New Jerusalem is a mystical mingling of God with man.</p>
<p>Some may say that the mingling of God with man is the spiritual meaning of the New Jerusalem but that the New Jerusalem will also have a physical aspect. This kind of understanding is the result of being bound by one&rsquo;s concept. Such a concept will vanish on the day that the New Jerusalem comes down out of heaven from God. Even though we cannot understand how the Lord was able to enter a room with shut doors, this will no longer be a question after our rapture. Today there is such a question because we are still in the old creation, in which our concepts are still bound by the realm of time and space. After our rapture and the transfiguration of our body, such questions will no longer exist.</p>
<p>After our rapture and the transfiguration of our body, we will have a change in our concept. This may be likened to a caterpillar being transformed from a pupa to a butterfly and to a chick breaking out of an egg; both are completely transformed. We are still in our physical body, which is fallen, so it is impossible for us to break away from the concept of physical things. After our rapture and the transfiguration of our body, however, we will not consider the New Jerusalem to be a place for us to dwell in. We will be a part of the New Jerusalem at its manifestation.</p>
<p>Without this explanation, the saints will not have a proper understanding concerning the New Jerusalem. The Bible clearly indicates that the tree of life is Christ and the river of life is the Spirit. Those who insist on considering the New Jerusalem as a physical location will have a difficult time understanding these matters. We must understand that the emphasis of the New Jerusalem is not on its being a place but on the redeeming God, in His reigning and imparting of grace, flowing out to be man&rsquo;s bread of life and water of life. God&rsquo;s throne involves not only His ruling but also His dispensing of grace. God flows out by His ruling and by His dispensing of grace to be the bread of life and the water of life for man to partake of.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
