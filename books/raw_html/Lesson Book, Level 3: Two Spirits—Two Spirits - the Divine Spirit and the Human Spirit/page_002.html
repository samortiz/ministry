They are important verses that you should memorize. They are John 3:6, John 4:24, and Romans 8:16.</P><P>[In John 3:6 we read: "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit." This verse speaks of two distinct "spirits": one is capitalized and the other is not. The first occurrence of the word refers to the Holy Spirit of God, and the second to the human spirit of man. That which is born of the Holy Spirit is the human spirit. Another verse showing these two "spirits" is John 4:24: "God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality." Again, the first "Spirit" is capitalized and the second is not. We must worship God, who is the Spirit, in our human spirit. Romans 8:16 further confirms the existence of two spirits: "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God." The pronoun "our" definitely designates the human spirit and removes any ground to doubt the reality of both the divine Spirit and the human spirit.]</P><P>Many who have been Christians for years have never seen the two spirits in these verses. Yet, this is a crucial truth concerning God, His purpose, and our Christian experience.</P>
