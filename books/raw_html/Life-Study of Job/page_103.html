<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JOB</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CENTRAL POINT OF GOD'S APPEARING TO JOB</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Job 42:1-6; 40:10-14; Col. 2:2b; Eph. 3:4</H1><P>As we study the book of Job, we need to realize that to understand this book, we need the entire Bible. Therefore, in this life-study of Job, my principle has been to study Job in relation to the divine revelation in the Bible as a whole. We need to keep this in mind as we consider in this message the central point of God's appearing to Job.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JOB NOT KNOWING<br>THAT GOD IS UNLIMITED AND UNSEARCHABLE<br>AND NOT UNDERSTANDING<br>HOW MUCH GOD COULD BE TO HIM</H2><P>After all the speaking of Job, his three friends, and Elihu, we have God's appearing to Job with the divine unveilings (38:4&#151;41:34). This is followed by a word concerning Job's gaining God in his personal experience and his abhorring of himself (42:1-6). I am concerned that, by paying attention to so many other things, you may not see the central point of God's appearing to Job. This central point concerns what God intended to do to Job by His appearing to him.</P><P>God appeared to Job in order to help him to realize that God is unlimited, unsearchable, and untraceable. God asked Job many questions about the universe and about the animals to impress him with the fact that He is unlimited. God seemed to be saying to him, "Job, you actually do not know who I am. You do not realize that I am unlimited. Also, you cannot imagine what I intend to give you. Job, I intend to give you Myself, making Myself your enjoyment so that you can became a part of Me. I am not satisfied that you have your own integrity, perfection, and uprightness. I want you to have Me. My intention is to give you nothing other than Myself."</P>
