   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TWO TESTIMONIES CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FINANCIAL STEWARDSHIP A. Handley Moule's Story</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Handley C. G. Moule of England was the chief editor of the magazine Life and Faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was a great man before the Lord in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One of his outstanding achievements was his knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He trusted in the Lord for his living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Throughout his life, he experienced wants and trials many times, but because he knew Luke 6:38, he would tell his wife whenever he was in need, "There must be something wrong with our giving lately."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He did not speak of the need in his house.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, his thoughts were on his giving.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once his house was almost empty of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not even have flour, the main staple of the English diet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He waited for two days, but no one brought him anything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He then told his wife, "There must be something in our house that we do not need."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He did not ask the Lord for flour.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead he said, "There must be something excessive in our house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why the Lord does not give."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They knelt and prayed and asked the Lord to show them any excess they had in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After praying, they looked through every item.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They began with the attic, checking to see whether or not a particular item was redundant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They even went through their children's belongings and found that they had just enough of what they needed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Mr. Moule then told the Lord, "There is truly nothing excessive in this house.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Lord, You have made a mistake in not supplying us with what we need."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After a brief pause, he told his wife, "The Lord never makes mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There has to be some excess in our house."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They checked again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When they came to the cellar, they saw a carton of butter, which had been given to them many days earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Mr. Moule was happy when he saw the carton.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He told his wife, "This must be the excess."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both of them were rather elderly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They had for many years learned the lesson of giving.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They knew the Lord's words: "Give, and it will be given to you."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They were anxious to give away the carton of butter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But who should they give it to?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mr. Moule was a responsible brother in his church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After looking down the list of brothers and sisters who were poor, he decided to give every one of them a piece.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The old couple cut the carton of butter into small pieces, wrapped them up, and sent them to these brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After sending out all the packets, he told his wife, "Now, we have cleared up this matter."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They then knelt down and prayed, "Lord, may we remind You of what You have said: Give, and it will be given to you.'</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please remember that we have no more flour."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That was perhaps a Saturday.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Among those who had received the butter, there was a very poor sister who had been paralyzed and bed-ridden for years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For days, she had been eating her bread without butter and had been praying, "Lord, have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Give me a little butter."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Soon after this prayer, Mr. Moule came with the butter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She immediately thanked the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A while later, she lifted up her head and prayed again, "Lord, although Brother Moule lacks nothing and has given me this butter, hear his prayer if he has any lack."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Brother Moule had not told anyone about his lack, and no one knew about it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some even rumored that Moule was a very rich brother, that he always gave things away, and that he had bought all that butter purposely to distribute to others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But this sister prayed, "If he has any lack, please answer his prayer."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On that same day, probably within two or three hours, Mr. Moule received two sacks of flour.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His problem was solved.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to believe in every word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Most people have difficulty taking God's Word as God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Mr. Moule believed God's Word to be God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you do not give, you definitely will not receive.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you give to others, others will surely give to you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is why we need to learn to give.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Giving is not the end; it enables God to give to us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the principle of Christian financial stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do not expect God to supply you with anything if there is excess in your house.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A co-worker once told me, "During the past twenty years, every time money has remained in my hand, there has always been a problem."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If there is a problem in giving, there will be a problem in receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The more you want to keep, the less you will have.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The more you want to give, the more you will have.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Most people hold on tightly to all that they have, and so God lets them hold on to that little amount.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They have not learned to give.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If the grace of giving is not in you, the grace of God will not be upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you do not have grace for others, you will have little of God's grace for yourself.</S>
