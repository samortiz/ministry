[3]  OF THE TRIUNE GOD Scripture Reading: Gen 2:9; Psa 36:9; John 1:4; 11:25; 14:6; 1 John 1:2; 5:12; Col 3:4; John 4:10, 14; 7:38-39; Rom 8:2, 6; Rev 22:1-2
[4]  We also need to see that the church is not an organization but an organism.
[5]  OF THE THRONE OF GOD AND OF THE LAMB
[6]  Now He is flowing in resurrection, and the way to receive Him is to drink Him in spirit by calling on His name "O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus."
[7]  CHAPTER TWO GROWTH IN LIFE BY THE SOUL-LIFE BEING DEALT WITH Scripture Reading: John 10:10; 3:5-6, 14-15, 29-30; 6:44-45; 7:17; 14:21, 23; 21:15-19; 12:25 THE LORD COMING THAT WE MAY HAVE LIFE
[8]  We may know this verse and may even have some experience of it, but we need to ask, "Why did the Lord come that we may have life?"
[9]  John 3 goes on to tell us that Jesus would be lifted up just as the bronze serpent was lifted up by Moses in the wilderness v.
[10]  He was lifted up on the cross as the Lamb of God to take away our sin, and He was lifted up in the form of the serpent to deal with Satan, the old serpent, so that we might have the divine, eternal life v. 15 .
[11]  Now I want to point out another side of the growth in life.
[12]  Although we have been born of the Spirit, we still have the flesh with us.
[13]  The growth in life is Christ increasing within you and you decreasing all the time.
[14]  If Christ is going to increase in you and you are going to decrease, you need a change of mind in your concept and you need a submissive will.
[15]  The more we are changed in our mind and subdued in our will, the more Christ will be increased within us.
[16]  Instead the Lord said, "When you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go" v. 18 . This shows the ripening of life, the maturity in life, not merely the growth in life.
[17]  The Lord predicted that one day Peter would be a submissive person, not only submissive to God's will, God's hand, but also submissive to all of his environment without any resistance.
[18]  If we have the maturity in life, we can say, "No matter what happens to me, no matter what betides, I will not resist."
[19]  In the last two chapters of the Bible, the tree of life appears again, and it appears in a river, the river of water of life Rev 22:1 .
[20]  This river is flowing in a city built of gold, pearls, and precious stones 21:18-21 .
[21]  My intention in sharing this is that we would have a full scope of the revelation in God's writings.
[22]  Life is God Himself flowing out in Christ as the Spirit.
[23]  Life is God Himself in His Divine Trinity dispensing Himself into us in the person of the Father as the source, in the person of the Son as the course, and in the person of the Spirit as the flow.
[24]  In the following portion of John 14, the Lord went on to say that another Comforter would come to abide within the disciples.
[25]  This chapter reveals that the second One, the Son, is one with the first One, the Father, and the third One, the Spirit, is one with the second One, the Son.
[26]  In verse 17 the Lord said to the disciples that "He the Spirit of reality abides with you and shall be in you."
[27]  God the Father is in Christ the Son, Christ the Son is realized as God the Spirit, and God the Spirit is within us.
[28]  Many of you have been faithful to the church life and are sincere to practice the church life.
[29]  This is why I have the burden to share with you that the proper way to practice the church life is not by doctrines, forms, or gifts.
[30]  The more He flows within us and through us, the more we will be transformed in our nature, our disposition, our very being, and the more we will be built up.
[31]  CHAPTER FOUR GOD'S GROWTH IN US FOR THE BUILDING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:6-12; Eph 2:21; 4:15-16; Col 2:19; 1 Pet 2:2-5
[32]  In the verses referred to in the Scripture reading there are two main concepts the growth in life and the building up of the Body.
[33]  First Corinthians is a precious book which follows the book of Romans in God's sovereign arrangement of the books of the Bible.
[34]  Romans starts with the condemnation of sins and then goes on to justification, identification with Christ, the walk and life in the Spirit, and the Body life.
[35]  In this building no human hand can avail, because this growth is not in our hand.
[36]  Ephesians 4 says that we need to hold Christ as the reality that we may grow up in all things into Christ as the Head v. 15 . First, we grow into Christ.
[37]  CHAPTER FIVE BEING SPIRITUAL FOR THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:2, 10-13; 2:14-16; 3:1-4, 16, 21-23; 6:13b, 15a, 17, 19-20; 12:12; 14:5, 12, 37; 16:18 SPECIAL ITEMS IN FIRST CORINTHIANS Christ as God's Power
[38]  All things are yours, and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's. This means that all things are for the church, the church is for Christ, and Christ is for God.
[39]  Absent in the Body, yet Present in the Spirit
[40]  Verse 4 says, "In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you and my spirit have been assembled, with the power of our Lord Jesus."
[41]  This corresponds with Romans 12, which says that if we are going to have the Body life, the church life, we must present our physical body to the Lord v. 1 . We may say that we love the Lord with our heart and serve the Lord in our spirit, but what about our body? We cannot say that we love the Lord and leave our body at home away from the church meetings.
[42]  Paul told us here that he did not have the commandment of the Lord, but he expressed his opinion v. 25 . Whatever he expressed as his opinion, we have to take as the word of God.
[43]  He expressed his opinion but he also said, "I think that I also have the Spirit of God" v. 40 . When we feel that we do not have the Lord's commandment, yet we express our opinion and this is of the Lord, this is the highest point of spirituality.
[44]  Tongues will cease, prophecies and knowledge will be rendered useless, but Christ as love never falls away v. 8 . He never fails, fades out, or comes to an end.
[45]  Paul goes on in 1 Corinthians 15 to say that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit v. 45b . In incarnation Christ became flesh for redemption John 1:14, 29 . Then in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit for the impartation of life John 10:10b .
[46]  In 1:10 Paul said, "Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion."
[47]  In chapter two Paul reveals that to have Christ, to realize Christ, to experience Christ, and to partake of Christ, we need to be spiritual not soulish.
[48]  Then the church can be built up as the temple of God, and we can glorify God in our body in a corporate way v. 20 . We will be the living members of the Body of Christ in our bodies with our spirit strengthened and all the parts of our soul saturated with the Spirit.
[49]  CHAPTER SIX FOUR LINES IN FIRST CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:5, 7; 2:14-15; 3:1, 3; 4:21; 8:1b; 12:31 --13:1, 3, 8; 14:1, 37; 16:18, 24
[50]  If we are going to experience the things mentioned in 1 Corinthians, we have to see that in this book, four lines are presented to us: the line of Christ, the line of the gifts, the line of the spirit, and the line of the church.
[51]  Chapter one says that God has called us into the fellowship, the participation, the enjoyment, of Christ v. 9 . God's intention is that we all may share Christ, partake of Christ, and enjoy Christ as everything to us.
[52]  In chapter two Christ is the Lord of glory v. 8 and the depths of God v. 10 . In chapter three He is the foundation v. 11 . In chapter five He is the Passover v. 7 and the unleavened bread v. 8 . In chapter ten He is the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, and the spiritual rock vv.
[53]  Then Paul said, "And moreover I show to you a most excellent way" 12:31b .
[54]  The fourth line in 1 Corinthians is the line of the church.
[55]  In 2 Corinthians 3:3 Paul said, "Since you are being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh."
[56]  Christ has to be written into us, to be wrought into us, to make us the living letters of Christ.
[57]  We may preach about Christ, but how much of Christ can people read on us?
[58]  In 2 Corinthians 5 Paul spoke of the love of Christ constraining us to live to Christ.
[59]  Verses 14 and 15 say, "For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised."
[60]  In 11:10 Paul said that the truthfulness of Christ was in him.
[61]  Because Paul lived by Christ, whatever Christ is became his virtue in his behavior.
[62]  Now that we have seen the verses related to Christ in 2 Corinthians, we can realize that every aspect in this Epistle is absolutely a matter of experience.
[63]  We have seen that there are four lines in 1 Corinthians: the line of Christ, the line of the gifts, the line of the spirit including the Holy Spirit , and the line of the church.
[64]  In chapter two Paul said he made the decision not to know anything except Christ and Christ crucified v. 2 . Then in the following chapters, he went on to reveal more aspects of Christ in a doctrinal way.
[65]  In 1 Corinthians 2 Paul told us that the Spirit reveals the deep things of God to us v. 10 . Then chapter three says that the Spirit dwells within us v. 16 . Chapter twelve speaks of the gifts of the Spirit vv.
[66]  First, He is the writing Spirit v. 3 ; then He is the life-giving Spirit v. 6 . He is also the ministering Spirit, who always ministers something of Christ into us v. 8 . He is the liberating Spirit v. 17 to liberate us from all the things that bind us.
[67]  Second Corinthians 1:21 says, "But the One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God."
[68]  Since we have been attached by God to Christ, the anointed One, we are spontaneously anointed with Him by God.
[69]  In the previous verses, Paul said that the very Christ whom he ministered to the saints is not yes and no. The Christ he ministered is always yes.
[70]  We have pointed out that in 1 Corinthians there is mostly the doctrine concerning Christ, but in the second Epistle there is the experience and enjoyment of Christ.
[71]  Following this the Spirit becomes the pledge, the foretaste, the earnest, the down payment, the first installment, the sample, for us to taste v.
[72]  Many times when you try to study the Bible, you are deadened because you get a lot of doctrinal knowledge without life.
[73]  We need to study and read the Bible prayerfully with the exercise of our spirit.
[74]  The Lord of v. 16, is the Spirit...which giveth life, v. 6: meaning, "the Lord," as here spoken of, "Christ," "is the Spirit," is identical with the Holy Spirit...Christ, here, is the Spirit of Christ.
[75]  The Bible says that Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, that the Lord is the Spirit who gives life, and that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .
[76]  The Old Testament gives us the pictures, whereas the New Testament gives us the definition and description of these pictures.
[77]  The dimensions of the tabernacle are also full of the numbers three and five.
[78]  As an example of this, Exodus 27:1 speaks of the dimensions of its altar: "And thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits."
[79]  And just so the Spirit of God as poured out at Pentecost was indeed something new....When poured out at Pentecost, He came as the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, the Spirit of the Incarnate, crucified, and exalted Christ, the bearer and communicator to us, not of the life of God as such, but of that life as it had been interwoven into human nature in the person of Christ Jesus.
[80]  ...From His nature, as it was glorified in the resurrection and ascension, His Spirit came forth as the Spirit of His human life, glorified into the union with the Divine, to make us partakers of all that He had personally wrought out and acquired, of Himself and His glorified life....And in virtue of His having perfected in Himself a new holy human nature on our behalf, He could now communicate what previously had no existence a life at once human and Divine.
[81]  All of the priests as well as the entire tabernacle with all of its parts were under the anointing of the compound ointment.
[82]  Without this anointing, none of them could have been holy, that is, none of them could have been attached to God, joined to God.
[83]  This means that under the anointing of the compound Spirit, there is the dwelling place of God, the church life, the priesthood, and the real serving body.
[84]  We have to see that the Spirit is no longer the Spirit of God possessing merely divinity; the Spirit today is the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment.
[85]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE ANOINTING FOR TRANSFORMATION Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:21-22; 3:3, 6, 8, 17-18
[86]  Thus far, we have seen that there are four lines in both 1 and 2 Corinthians.
[87]  The four lines in 1 Corinthians are the lines of Christ, the spirit, the church, and the gifts.
[88]  He is the anointing Spirit, the sealing Spirit, the pledging Spirit, the writing Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, the ministering Spirit, the liberating Spirit, the transforming Spirit, and the transmitting Spirit.
[89]  In between the anointing and the transforming, there are another six aspects of the Spirit: the sealing, the pledging, the writing, the life-giving, the Christ-ministering, and the liberating.
[90]  The anointing becomes the sealing within us 2 Cor 1:22 , giving us the mark and the impression of the image of God to show that we belong to God.
[91]  The seal of the Spirit, which is constituted with the elements brought in by the anointing, becomes the pledge, the guarantee, the down payment, the foretaste, of the Spirit v. 22 . This means that we have the Spirit for our taste, our enjoyment.
[92]  In 2 Corinthians 1:21 the apostle Paul said that God was the One who "firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us."
[93]  We need to consider why the apostle Paul said this.
[94]  Some even claimed that he was an insincere, fickle person, a man of yes and no. This is why he told them that the Christ he preached to them was always yes 1:19-20 . Then he told the Corinthians that he was a real priest in the priesthood who had been anointed by God.
[95]  Paul went on to tell the Corinthians that they were the letters of Christ who had been inscribed by the apostles with the Spirit of the living God as the divine, heavenly ink 3:3 .
[96]  The Spirit is neither the writer nor the pen but the writing ink to write Christ into our being.
[97]  Eventually, this all-inclusive Spirit is the transforming Spirit v. 18 . He transforms us, not by correcting or adjusting us, but by putting more and more of the life essence of Christ into us.
[98]  In a sense this is a difficult walk, but it is a closer walk in the Lord.
[99]  It is a walk of intimacy with the Lord.
[100]  In 2 Corinthians 4:13 Paul said, "And having the same spirit of faith according to that which is written, 'I believed, therefore I spoke,' we also believe, therefore we also speak."
[101]  In 2 Corinthians 7:13 Paul said, "We rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you."
[102]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE CHURCHES IN SECOND CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:1; 6:16; 8:1, 18-19, 23-24; 11:8, 28
[103]  As we have pointed out, 2 Corinthians is an improvement over the first book in the experience of Christ, in the spirit, and in the church.
[104]  We cannot find one instance of the word church in 2 Corinthians in the sense of the universal church.
[105]  The book of 1 Corinthians tells us something about the local church, but it is not very extensive, and it is mostly in the way of teaching.
[106]  In 2 Corinthians, however, we do not have the teaching of the church, but the real practice of the church.
[107]  In 8:23 some brothers are spoken of as the apostles of the churches.
[108]  This means that they are the ones sent by the churches, and they are the glory of Christ.
[109]  It is not just a matter between you and the Lord, nor between you and your local church, but between you and the local churches.
[110]  First Corinthians opens in its first chapter by saying that Christ is both theirs and ours v. 2 and that God has called us into the fellowship of this Christ v. 9 . He is the power of God and the wisdom of God v. 24 . Christ is our righteousness for the past, our sanctification for the present, and our redemption for the future v. 30 . These points concerning Christ are presented mostly in a doctrinal way.
[111]  I do not want to disappoint or discourage the young people, but I must say that with the young ones it is hard to have a ministry.
[112]  Many of you young brothers and sisters love the Lord, but be assured that the way you are taking is the way of suffering.
[113]  Since you love the Lord so much, you are on the way of sufferings all the time.
[114]  Praise the Lord for the enjoyment of Christ that comes through the sufferings.
