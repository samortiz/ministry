   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD NOT BEING OUT OF TOUCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When a minister of the word opens his mouth, he may have four or five passages he wants to cover.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He may have four or five verses he wants to speak or four or five things he wants to say.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The order of the verses matters a great deal in the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit may want to place a passage at the end of his speaking, while he may put it at the beginning of his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In such a case the spirit will not be released.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One problem in our speaking is that our words frequently lose touch with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some words should be spoken at the beginning, but we speak them at the end. Some words should be spoken at the end, but we speak them at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When this happens, the words are released without the spirit; the spirit is set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Words go forth, yet the spirit does not go along.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In our speaking, there are times when our words should make a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The subject should be changed from one to another; the thoughts should be turned from one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not uncommon that a man blunders at such turns.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the turn is made, the words and the spirit become separated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word turns, but the spirit does not follow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word has made the turn, but the spirit remains in the original place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word and the spirit become separated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word has gone on to the next point, but the spirit remains in the same place and has not moved forward.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, when the speaking turns from one passage of the Scripture to another, we must exercise care not to make any mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once we make a mistake, the word and the spirit will lose contact with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a certain passage of the Scripture should be used, yet we miss it, the spirit is unable to make the turn, and it loses touch with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word and the spirit are separated; they are not joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a serious problem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who are less experienced before God are stumbled mainly by injuries in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who are more experienced before God are stumbled mainly by the dislocation between the word and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the beginning of one's training, the problem is mainly with the injured spirit; the cause of bondage in the spirit is injury in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a man becomes more advanced in the Lord, his problem no longer relates to injury in the spirit but to the separation between the word and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not an easy thing to keep the spirit and the word together.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A speaker often has a bad beginning, and the spirit and the word are separated from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In speaking, one has to know which word comes first and which word comes next.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If he reverses the order, the words may come out without the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The easiest place for the word to lose the spirit is at the turning points.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we make a turn with the word, our thoughts and feelings may not be agile and rich enough to follow the turn.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a result the word goes on, but the spirit lags behind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The words may be released smoothly, yet the spirit is left behind; it cannot follow the word and loses contact with it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we speak, we have to learn to release both the word and the spirit so that the two do not lose touch with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As soon as we find that something has gone wrong, we have to turn our words back to the point of departure.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The spirit is very sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes when we return to the point of departure, the spirit still will not come back.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Having cast it aside once, it is not only out of touch with the word; it is injured as well.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There may be nothing wrong with the words in our mouth, but the spirit is not present.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The sense of the spirit is very fine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must exercise care, not speaking rashly or negligently.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to look to God for mercy that our words make the right turns and that they do not lose contact with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever we speak to the brothers and sisters, we have to turn with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whenever we make a wrong or improper turn from one subject to another, we fail to keep our whole message in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, as soon as we learn about the mistake, we have to turn our words back.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sometimes the more we try to turn the words back, the harder it gets.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes it is better to just cut off an entire portion of the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After a while we may find the direction again.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may find the anointing and the utterance again.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then when we speak in that direction, the spirit is released once again.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whether or not a minister of the word can make the right turn in his speaking depends more on the Lord's mercy than on man's planning.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is difficult for us to dictate how strong our words will be or how much we can keep our entire message in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Most of the time, however, it is God's mercy that we make the right turn.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We do not make a right turn because we have knowledge or experience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We may not know when we have made the right turn, but we surely know when we have made the wrong turn.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once we make the wrong turn, we know within two or three minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As soon as we know that we are wrong, we have to stop immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should never try to save our message.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are ministers of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we feel that our words have gone off on a tangent, we have to turn back.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whenever we are wrong, we can sense it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But when we are on the right track, we may not realize it until much later or when we step off the platform.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Sometimes we are at a crossroad; we do not know if we are right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It takes a while for us to know whether we are right.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After a while, we know whether we are right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we go on for a few minutes more, we know that something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We realize that the word and the spirit are two different things; they are separate.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Words are going forth, but the spirit is not following.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The spirit is very delicate.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As soon as something is wrong, it stops.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Even if we can find the spirit, we are not able to release it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We feel a great resistance in pushing out the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We realize that we only have the word; we do not have the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As soon as we find out our mistake, we should turn back.</S>
