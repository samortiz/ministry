        <h2 class="head1">GIFTS BEING LIMITED IN BENEFIT</h2>
<p>In addition to vision and revelation, service also involves gifts. Gifts follow vision. Vision involves seeing the Lord and seeing the content of His service. In order for vision to result in ministry, there is a need for gifts. For example, I can buy a fish and bring it home to eat, but I still need to know how to cook it. If I do not have the gift of cooking a fish, I will not be able to feed anyone. Thus, even if we have been called and have received a vision, we will not be able to carry out this vision without gifts. Gifts speak of the spiritual capacity that is needed in order to carry out spiritual matters. Hence, in learning to serve the Lord, we must seek and exercise our gifts so that we may have the spiritual capacity to carry out spiritual matters.</p>
<p>Gifts, however, have only a temporary benefit in the service. Consider a locality that has brothers and sisters who have been saved for a short period of time and saints who have been saved longer but do not have much spiritual knowledge. After the Lord raises them up to meet, there is a need for speaking in the meetings, so the burdened brothers pray, &ldquo;Lord, raise up some among us to speak!&rdquo; When a brother gets up to speak and sounds quite good the first time, even better the second time, and nearly perfect the third time, it seems as if their prayer has been answered. Then everyone rejoices, thinking that God has raised up Brother So-and-so as a gift to speak.</p>
<p>This brother then begins to read the Bible even more, and he also reads and considers spiritual books. When he speaks, many are moved, and he can speak on anything, including loving the Lord, consecration, being broken, being dealt with, taking the way of the cross, Christ living in us, and our living in the Lord. It even seems as if Paul could not speak as well as this brother if he were among us today. We need to realize, however, that the speaking of this brother comes out of his gift, not necessarily his constitution. He may be able to speak about the breaking of the cross and about living in the Lord, but whether or not he has been broken by the cross and lives in the Lord is another matter.</p>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;Does this mean that the brother has done something that he should not have done?&rdquo; No, his speaking is not a problem, because it has been useful in the meetings. However, when a person who has been raised up by the Lord has only gifts, it can become a problem if he serves the Lord merely according to his gift for an extended period of time. The gift of a serving one must become a ministry so that the church can be built up.</p>
<p>Consider the matter of the breaking of the cross. This brother may have spoken twenty or thirty times on the breaking of the cross, yet he may not manifest a life that has been broken by the cross. Messages on the breaking of the cross may come forth from his gifted mouth, but a life that issues from the breaking of the cross may not be evident within him. Such a constitution cannot be obtained after a few days of prayer; the constitution of ministry cannot be obtained merely by prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GIFTS NEEDING TO BECOME MINISTRY</h2>
<p>In order for this brother to be constituted with a ministry, he must be subdued in the light of the breaking of the cross and accept the breaking of the cross. He needs to be broken until his very person speaks of the breaking of the cross because the breaking of the cross has been constituted into him. Then the breaking of the cross will not simply be a message, a doctrine, or a speaking in him; the cross will be his constitution, his life.</p>
<p>The church needs ministry as well as gifts. However, we should not expect ministry to be manifested in a church that has been raised up for only a few years. The producing of ministry takes five, ten, or even twenty years. If a brother cooperates with the Holy Spirit, and God&rsquo;s life is allowed to operate, the Holy Spirit will be able to constitute him with the breaking of the cross. Then when this brother speaks on the breaking of the cross, he will not need to read the Bible or reference books, for he himself will be a testimony of the breaking of the cross. After years of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s work and constitution, the matter of the breaking of the cross will become more than just a message in his mouth; it will become his very being.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians Paul deals with the matter of gifts, but in 2 Corinthians he speaks about the matter of ministry. The Corinthians emphasized gifts very much; Paul even says, &ldquo;You do not lack in any gift&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:7), and in chapters 12 and 14 he lists various gifts. Nevertheless, these gifted persons were quite childish, and the local church of these gifted ones was quite chaotic. The church in Corinth seemingly lacked nothing in the way of gifts, but it was a mess and full of divisions, factions, fornication, and chaos.</p>
<p>Thus, Paul deals with gifts in his first Epistle to the church. He shows the Corinthians that gifts alone could not meet the need nor solve the problems of the church. He says, &ldquo;I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified&rdquo; (2:2). He shows them that only the crucified Christ can solve the problems of the church. Gifts can meet some&mdash;but not all&mdash;the needs of the church. Gifts can help the church, but only the crucified Christ can solve the problems of the church.</p>
<p>Paul does not mention gifts in his second Epistle. Instead, he demonstrates the living of the crucified Christ. Chapter by chapter he shows that he had a ministry, not just gifts. Paul not only preached the cross but let the Lord&rsquo;s death operate in him so that the cross was manifested in him. As a result, he became the ministry. Paul&rsquo;s speaking concerning the crucified Christ was not a message but a living. Gifts are related to a message, but ministry is related to a living. Ministry involves more than giving a message; it involves a person living the message.</p>
<p>It is possible for a newly raised up church to have gifts but not ministry. Even if the seed of ministry has been sown, it will take time for this seed to take form and bear fruit. Eventually, the ministry will be constituted into those who have gifts. Gifts speak of a spiritual capacity given by the Spirit to enable one to function in unique and needed ways. Ministry speaks of living according to the Spirit and of letting the Holy Spirit constitute into us the light that we see and the message that we give to the point that we become the message, and we become the ministry of the message.</p>
<p>It is not easy to speak merely according to gift, because such speaking requires much reading of the Bible and reference books and extensive preparation. A speaker who is speaking merely according to his preparation is also in fear and trembling, because he is concerned that he will cover points at the beginning and the end but forget points in the middle. After speaking, he usually has some regret over failing to mention some inspiring words. This is common when one speaks merely by gift. However, when gift becomes ministry, the words that need to be spoken will be spoken because the message that he is will be the message that is spoken. This is not a speaking according to gift but a testifying through ministry.</p>
<p>It is not enough for the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones to have merely gifts; gifts must become ministry. In the past I encouraged the brothers and sisters to desire gifts because gifts are needed when we first start to serve the Lord. Now I would like to say that merely having gifts is not worth much; we must be stripped and broken in the Lord&rsquo;s hand so that the messages we give will be constituted into us and become our ministry.</p>
<p>I have seen some young brothers who are very gifted in preaching the gospel. When some of them preach, nearly everyone is moved or convicted. Nevertheless, when they leave the podium, they are indifferent toward those who are unsaved. Thus, they have a gift related to preaching the gospel but not to the ministry of the gospel. Their words related to the gospel are eloquent, but these brothers seem to have the spirit of the gospel only when they are preaching publicly, not when they contact unbelievers personally.</p>
<p>I know of a Western missionary who lived in Foochow for over a decade and then in Shanghai into her old age. At first glance, she did not seem to have any gift related to the gospel, yet after spending time with her, I had the feeling that she was the gospel. The gospel was constituted into her for over fifty to sixty years, and her living became the ministry of the gospel. She could preach the gospel without preaching the gospel. Everyone she touched was moved because the gospel had been constituted into her to such an extent that it became a ministry in her.</p>
<p>The difference between gift and constitution can be seen in relation to language. From an early age I have been learning English, but my English is still poor. In contrast, I have no difficulty speaking Chinese. According to this illustration, my speaking Chinese is a ministry, because I can speak Chinese without any effort. The Chinese language has been constituted into me and has become me. If I want to give a message in English, however, I need much preparation, including reading reference books. The words that come out of my speaking of English are related to gift, but the words that come out of my speaking of Chinese are related to ministry. We use gifts provisionally in our living, not normally. Ministry is what we are normally.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:9 says that there is glory with the ministry. In verse 18 Paul says, &ldquo;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; Paul beheld and reflected the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face, and he was transformed into the same image from glory to glory. There was glory with Paul&rsquo;s ministry.</p>
<p>In 4:7-8 Paul says, &ldquo;We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us. We are pressed on every side but not constricted.&rdquo; From the day that this treasure entered into us, we began to be pressed. There is a treasure within, but there is pressing without. This pressing is needed in order for the treasure to grow day by day. When death operates in us, the life of the Lord operates in us as well (v. 12). This life cannot be conveyed merely through the words of a message but through the living of a ministry.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
