   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Receiving the Burden to Speak God s Word</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Ministry of the Word</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Isaiah 13:1 the Chinese Union Version says that the prophets received inspiration when they spoke for God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Hebrew word for inspiration, however, means burden.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man needs to receive a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We cannot neglect this responsibility and think that God has not given us a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Epistles of Paul clearly show that he received burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When someone in the church in Corinth committed the sin of fornication, Paul did not simply condemn the sin or stop praying for the one who sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He received a burden from God to bear a responsibility and commission for the church 1 Cor 5:1-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul did not preach doctrines in his Epistles; instead, he was burdened to fellowship concerning certain matters, so he was able to touch people s feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is a danger that the ministry of the word in the church in Taipei may become the same as the preaching of sermons in Sunday services.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we minister the word of God, our concern should be whether we have God s speaking, not the topic of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to have God s speaking, the one who ministers the word must have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>People may have a negative reaction or be stirred up when they hear a message that is spoken with a burden, but they cannot deny that it is God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This kind of message can help people and solve their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A message that sounds nice but is void of God s speaking cannot touch people, turn them inwardly, or satisfy those who are hungry and thirsty, because they are not the words that God wants to speak even if they are from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, speaking should not be easy or cheap.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot speak simply because we have prepared a message.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One who ministers the word should bear people s condition before God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He bears the responsibility of knowing their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He needs to sense their condition and know what God wants to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The help we have received from training cannot replace the burden that is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The danger is that the burden has been replaced so that we are short of revelation and spiritual burden.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Being Desperate for People s Situation</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>to Preach the Effective Word</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Fifty-two weeks a year there is a message meeting in the church in Taipei on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do the brothers who minister the word fast and pray before ministering the word?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Of course, there is no regulation that requires the brothers to fast and pray, as this would be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The brothers need to understand that bearing the word of God is equal to bearing the souls of man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The saints come to the meetings week after week to listen to our speaking, so we must bear them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If there is no change in them after three months, we should not be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This can be compared to a merchant who is unable to sleep peacefully when he has no business for two weeks and who is unable to eat when there is no profit after three months.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He will be full of sorrow and concern.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many brothers and sisters with businesses come to me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although they simply sit without opening their mouths, I can sense the heavy burden within them and realize that they have encountered difficulties in their business.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Are the brothers who speak sorrowful for the souls who have not changed in three months?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A store owner who has no customers would be unable to continue working, considering everything to be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He would consider the situation and find a way to change the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How can those who minister the word continue as usual when there is no profit?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not consider that it is sufficient merely to speak from the podium week after week.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Brother Nee began his work in Foochow, he fasted and prayed every Saturday for the gospel meeting on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He considered before the Lord what to speak and how to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He considered what word the sinners needed to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since he fasted and prayed with a heavy burden, his words were always very effective and were later published as messages.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many who are used by the Lord bear a burden in their ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Peace Wang was young, she had a successful revival work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She always knelt before the Lord and spent a long period of time weeping and grieving for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, when she stood up to speak, her words were always living and operative.</S>
