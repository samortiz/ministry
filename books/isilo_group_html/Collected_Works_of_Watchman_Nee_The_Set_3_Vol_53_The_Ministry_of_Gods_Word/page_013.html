A brother once said that of all the books of the Bible, the Corinthian Epistles, and in particular 1 Corinthians 7, show us the peak of human experience. This is right. Paul's experience proves this. Consider the following examples:</p><p>Verse 6 says, "But this I say by way of concession, not by way of command." The phrase this I say clearly indicates that this was Paul's own word.</p><p>Verse 7 says, "Yet I wish all men to be even as I am myself." Such a wish was Paul's own wish. Verse 6 presents Paul's own word, while verse 7 speaks of his own wish. He did not say that God commanded such or that God ordained such. Verse 7 continues, "But each has his own gift from God, one in this way, the other in that." God works in different ways. But it seems as if Paul was giving his own opinion. He was hoping that all would be even as he was.</p><p>Verse 8 says, "But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I am." This was again Paul's own word.</p><p>Verse 10 says, "But to the married I charge, not I but the Lord, A wife must not be separated from her husband." Paul first said that he charged them, but then he said that it was not him but the Lord who charged them. We can only find such expressions in 1 Corinthians 7. On the one hand, Paul charged, and on the other hand, he said that it was not his charge but the Lord's charge.</p><p>Verse 12 says, "But to the rest I say, I, not the Lord." This is Paul's word again. Verses 12 through 24 are all Paul's word; they are not the Lord's word. How could Paul have dared to say such a word? How could he have been so bold? By what authority was he speaking these words? In the following verses he presents the basis for his speaking.</p><p>Verse 25 says, "Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord." Paul did not lie. He honestly confessed that he did not have a commandment of the Lord. "But I give my opinion as one who has been shown mercy by the Lord to be faithful." Here was the opinion of one who had been shown mercy by the Lord, one who was empowered by the Lord to be faithful. God had done a profound work in him and had made him a faithful one. He was able to claim that God's mercy had made him a faithful person, that it had done so much work in him that he was now able to express his opinion. Here we do not find the Lord's commandment. Instead, we find Paul's opinion, that is, his view concerning a certain matter. All the words were Paul's. He told the Corinthians how he felt.</p><p>Verse 26 says, "I consider then that this is good because of the present necessity." Paul said that this was his opinion.</p><p>Verse 28 says, "I am trying to spare you." This was again Paul's opinion.</p><p>Verse 29 says, "But this I say, brothers." This is Paul's word.</p><p>Verse 32 says, "But I desire you to be without care." This is Paul's word.</p><p>Verse 35 says, "But this I say." This is again Paul's word.</p><p>Verse 40 says, "According to my opinion." This is Paul's opinion.</p><p>In verse 17 Paul said, "And so I direct in all the churches." He said this not only to the Corinthians but to all the churches. He charged all the churches with the same things.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, how marvelous this is! This is the opposite of our common understanding. In John 8:28 the Lord said, "As My Father has taught Me, I speak these things," and in 12:50 He said, "Even as the Father has said to Me, so I speak." Yet Paul was bold to tell others that his words were his own opinions, views, and even his charge to the churches. This is either the loftiest experience or the worst experience. Thank God that this is the loftiest experience. No place in the Bible is as high as 1 Corinthians 7. After his words in this passage, Paul concluded by saying, "I think that I also have the Spirit of God" (v. 40). Here we reach the highest peak. Paul was clear that he did not have God's commandment; he was clear that he did not have a word from the Lord. His speaking was merely based on the mercy that had been shown to him. He had no other basis. His only basis was God's compassion and mercy to him. But after he spoke, he could say that he thought he had the Spirit of God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 53: The Ministry of God's Word &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
