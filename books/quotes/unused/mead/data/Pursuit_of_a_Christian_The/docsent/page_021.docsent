   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LOST IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Using myself as an example, I can say that my experience of contradictions during the early years of my salvation was unbearable.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the moment I finished dressing and was prepared to go out, there came an inner sense that I should not go, and then when I returned to my study room to read, there came another sense that I should not read.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I just did not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This contradiction comes from two parties: we ourselves and Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Perhaps according to our preference we want to visit a friend, but Christ says, "It is your preference to visit your friend; I do not agree."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since He disagrees, we decide to stay home and read a book, but He says, "This is still your preference."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Gradually, we learn that whenever we have a sense within, the best thing is to kneel down and pray until we are one with the inward sense.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then, we are no longer in the state of contradiction.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, the more we pray, the more we sense the presence of God; the more we pray, the sweeter His presence is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this way, a part of us becomes lost and is dissolved in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No one who is a Christian is exempt from having contradictions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every Christian goes through a state of contradiction during the initial phase of his salvation, and the degree of contradiction may become very intense until he reaches a certain level of maturity when the Lord and he have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At that stage, the degree of contradiction diminishes because he has matured to a point where he is totally lost in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One who has not reached this state is still spiritually immature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After we are saved, we usually experience certain contradictions because Christ in us wants us to gain Him, and He also wants to gain us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His intention is to have us mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, because we do not know His intention and are not accustomed to it, the more we pursue Him, the more contradictions we experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is as though there is a person within us who is constantly against us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is as though He disapproves of everything we do in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It seems in particular that if we do not have a good prayer time in the morning to seek after Him, we do not sense many contradictions throughout the day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But when our prayer times are very good and our fellowship with the Lord increases, the contradictions during the day increase.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do not pray or have fellowship with the Lord for a month, our living will be carefree and sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, if we have good prayer times and have good fellowship with the Lord, our contradictions will definitely increase.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I believe that we all have this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today if we have a sweet time with the Lord in intimate fellowship and thorough prayer, then amazingly we sense that everything we try to do is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes the bothering gets to a point where we even doubt and ask, "Is it better to pray or not to pray?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why is it that if I do not pray, I am calm and clear, but if I pray, I become confused?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These confusions are all manifestations of the contradictions in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are confused because there is an internal conflict.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the more confusion and contradictions we experience, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What we should be afraid of is that we have neither confusion nor contradictions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All confused ones are ones with contradictions, and the ones with contradictions are those who have Christ in them as their Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>BEING CONFUSED RATHER THAN BEING COMPLICATED</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are not afraid if someone is confused; rather, we are afraid if someone is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One day there was a brother who was faced with a great difficulty, so he went to see two elderly brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After receiving instructions from them on how to resolve the difficulty, he returned home to act according to their advice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, as he proceeded, there was a forbidding within.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, he became confused.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He said, "The words of the two elderly brothers are very clear, but why is it that within me there is a forbidding, a contradiction?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is wrong?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the event unfolded after a few days, the confused brother realized that what he had sensed as a forbidding was actually the prohibition from the Spirit of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If he had done according to what the two elderly brothers had advised, the outcome would have been totally different.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The two brothers considered the matter according to common experience, and although their consideration was right, the Holy Spirit intervened.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to understand that this is also a case of contradiction.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When a person has contradictions within, this is proof that he is a true Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why we say that the more contradictions we experience, the better Christians we become.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do not have contradictions, then there must be problems with us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If our condition is proper before the Lord, we will have a great deal of contradictions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, if we have a problem before the Lord and our fellowship with Him has been interrupted, the contradictions will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The sisters experience a great number of contradictions in the matter of attire.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Normally, a Christian should have some feelings of contradiction concerning what they wear.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a person claims to be saved and yet has never experienced any contradiction in the matter of clothing himself, then either he is not saved or his salvation is still questionable.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A normal Christian most definitely has a great deal of feelings of contradiction.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is because a person who has received the Lord has been lost in Him and has become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nevertheless, because we are not easily subdued by the Lord so as to surrender before Him, we always have disputes with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have one idea while the Lord has another idea; we have a desire while the Lord has another desire.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Consequently, the two ideas and the two desires bring in contradictions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is why we say that a Christian who is contradictory within is a true Christian.</S>
