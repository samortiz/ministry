   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. The Spirit of Jehovah Resting upon Him</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning Christ as the twig and the branch, verse 2 goes on to say, "The Spirit of Jehovah will rest upon Him,/ The Spirit of wisdom and understanding,/The Spirit of counsel and might,/The Spirit of knowledge and the fear of Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit of counsel and might here equals the wisdom and power in 1 Corinthians 1:24, which tells us that Christ is God's wisdom and God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is the wisdom which gives counsel and the power which gives might.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The branching out of Jehovah is altogether a matter of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ was born of the Spirit, meaning that He was constituted of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then He was baptized, anointed, with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit was with Him all the time and was one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He walked by the Spirit and lived a life in, with, by, and through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, as John 14 reveals, the Spirit is the reality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Savoring the Fear of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"He will savor the fear of Jehovah" Isa 11:3a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word savor indicates that Christ will delight in the fear of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, "He will neither judge by what His eyes see,/Nor decide by what His ears hear./But He will judge the poor in righteousness,/And decide with equity for the afflicted of the land" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>3b-4a .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Unlike today, there will be no shortage of righteousness and equity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 4b continues, "And He will strike the land with the rod of His mouth,/And with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here, as is common in Isaiah's poetic writing, we have a pair: the rod of His mouth and the breath of His lips.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Righteousness Being That Which</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Girds His Loins,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>and Faithfulness Being That Which</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Girds His Hips</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Righteousness will be that which girds His loins, and faithfulness will be that which girds His hips v. 5 . Girding the loins gives one the strength to move, act, and especially to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Righteousness and faithfulness are two of Christ's virtues for standing and fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He stands with faithfulness and fights with righteousness.</S>
