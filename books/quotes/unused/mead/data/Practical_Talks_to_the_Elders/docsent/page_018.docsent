   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR GOD S UNIQUE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In these days, whenever I have the time, I have been considering the Lord s recovery according to what I have seen all these past years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As you know, it began there in China some sixty years ago, in 1922.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first ten years I was not there, but later I heard the history.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then for the past fifty-one years I have been directly involved and have seen many of the things that have happened.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What I fellowship with you tonight is based upon what I have seen and heard.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A WORD FOR THE FUTURE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why am I burdened to talk with you in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is because of the present situation and the situation yet to come.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You may wonder how we can consider our future situation when we don t know what it will be.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Well, history does help us to visualize what may happen in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is one factor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another factor is that I am burdened to take care of some crucial matters, hoping to get them completed if the Lord wills.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I want to concentrate my time and energy on these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because I do not have the time to visit the churches and help them directly, except in a limited way, I am burdened to put the things I have been considering into these practical talks and have them published.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then they will be useful not only for the present but also for the coming days.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We don t know how long the coming days will be; only the Lord knows.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But for as long as the Lord tarries, the recovery will be on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even though the scale of the recovery is small, it is nonetheless scattered throughout all the continents and is still spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all believe this spreading will continue, even though slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With these future days and future new ones especially in mind, I feel there needs to be a basic vision or basic knowledge of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just five years ago a distraction came in which confused some dear ones who were concerned for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since such a thing could happen in the past right before our eyes, how can we have the assurance that such a thing will not be repeated in the future?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, while the Lord still grants me the days, I would like to do as much as I can to put things clearly into writing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then the dear ones who are in and who will be brought into the Lord s recovery can have a clear view about what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What I would like to share I feel more free to say in these talks with you leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I would not feel so free in a conference, speaking to a larger audience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These are not conference messages.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nonetheless, I want to have them printed for all the saints in the Lord s recovery, whether old or new, experienced or newly saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I hope every one will have a copy to read now and later as well.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>NOT A REFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is easy to think of the recovery as meaning a reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I think such an understanding of the Lord s recovery today is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I would say that even the reformation at Luther s time was not an adequate recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>While it may be considered as a part of the recovery, it is not what the Lord wants today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For today the Lord wants a recovery that is according to the complete revelation of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we say the New Testament, we don t mean that the New Testament has nothing to do with the Old.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The New Testament is the outcome of the Old.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In a true sense, the New Testament includes the Old.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To speak of a recovery according to the complete revelation of the New Testament is the same as to say that it must be according to the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>GOD AND HIS UNIQUENESS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From the entire Bible we know that God is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is the only God and He has a plan, which is also unique.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then, according to His plan, He has an economy, and this economy of His is also unique.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, in His economy there is His work, which is also unique.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And to carry out His work, there is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This way is also unique.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From this it is clear that what is revealed in the Bible is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His plan is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His economy is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His work is unique, and His way to carry out the work is also unique.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In other words, as we have pointed out elsewhere, in the entire Bible there is only one line to carry out what God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Of course, there is another line, that of the evil work of God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yes, there are two lines in the Bible, but one belongs to God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At the beginning of the Bible there are two trees and at the end, there is a city of water and a lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These two, the city of water and the lake of fire, are the consummation of the two trees.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The tree of life will consummate in the city of water; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil will consummate in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Between these two ends, throughout the entire Bible, are these two lines.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As those who have been saved, called, and separated by God unto His economy, we are not in the enemy s line but rather in God s. That this line is one is clear even in the Old Testament, but it becomes even clearer in the New.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is the one line of the unique God, of His unique plan, of His unique economy, of His unique work, and of His unique way.</S>
