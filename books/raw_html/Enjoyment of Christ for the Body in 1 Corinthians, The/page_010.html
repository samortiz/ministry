 <h2 class="head1">COMING BACK TO THE PROPER GROUND<br />
OF THE ONENESS OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Some may say that they are not in division because they are no longer in the denominations. To give up the denominations is a good beginning, but it is still short. We must come all the way back to the proper ground of the church. We may illustrate this with the typology of the Old Testament. At the time Solomon built the temple in the good land, all the children of Israel were one. Because of their degradation, however, some of them were carried away into Syria, some into Egypt, and some into Babylon. They all were scattered. Instead of being one, they became several divisions. Many years later, God commanded them to return to the good land. After becoming clear that Babylon was not the right place to be, many came out of Babylon. However, some might have stopped midway between Babylon and Jerusalem, some in one place and some in another. Eventually, the result was that there were more divisions. At first there were only a few large divisions, but after many left Babylon, they became many smaller divisions.</p>
<p>Some, however, received the vision not only of leaving Babylon but of coming back to Jerusalem, and many eventually did come back. In Babylon there might have been a kind of oneness, a oneness in division, a subtle, divisive &ldquo;oneness,&rdquo; but Jerusalem was the place of the proper oneness (Deut. 12:5-18; 2 Chron. 6:5-6; John 4:20). This is a picture of the many non-denominational groups. There is no oneness among the many free groups. The proper oneness is the oneness of the church on the proper ground. Those who have come out of the denominations are happy to be nondenominational. On the one hand, it is good not to call oneself a Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, Episcopalian, or Catholic. On the other hand, God has no intention that we be a part of nothing and remain &ldquo;midway.&rdquo; In this sense, we must be neither denominational nor nondenominational, because God&rsquo;s intention is to have the Body. Satan in his subtlety has damaged the Body, but God is coming in today to carry out His recovery. He is demanding that all His seekers and lovers leave Babylon, not remain midway, and come back to the ground of oneness, the spiritual Jerusalem.</p>
<p>By this we can see that there are two different kinds of oneness&mdash;the oneness in Babylon and the oneness in Jerusalem. However, only the oneness in Jerusalem is the proper oneness. Although many of the children of Israel remained in Babylon, they were not the nation of Israel. The nation of Israel was in the good land. When those who returned to the good land stood on the ground of oneness to declare that they were the nation of Israel, some in Babylon might have been unhappy. They might have said, &ldquo;Are only you the nation of Israel? Are we not Israel also? We are all brothers. We all have the same Jewish life and are of the same Jewish blood. How can you say that you are the nation of Israel and that we are not?&rdquo; The same condition exists today among the Jews. There are nearly thirteen million Jews on the earth today, and over one million are in New York City alone. Only a few million, however, have returned to Palestine. It is only this small number that are recognized as the nation of Israel. Concerning those who return to the proper ground, the number is not the most important factor (cf. Ezra 2:64-65). What matters is the ground of oneness. Those Jews in New York are real Jews, and they may give much money for the nation of Israel. However, they are not the nation of Israel, because they are not on the proper ground. If they want to be in the nation of Israel, they must return to the land of Israel.</p>
<p>It is the same with the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today. When we say that we are the church, many in the denominations are offended. Thousands of them may be genuine Christians, children of God. They may love the Lord, love the Bible, and love people&rsquo;s souls, and they may do a certain amount of work for the Lord. However, they still say that they are Lutheran, Presbyterian, or something else. Since they do this, they lose the proper ground. They are the right persons, but their position is wrong. They need to come back to the real Jerusalem, the proper ground of oneness. All the Jews in the world today are privileged to return to Israel. Because they have Jewish blood, they will be received into the nation of Israel. Likewise, as believers we have the proper birth; however, most Christians have the wrong position. As long as they keep their old position in Babylon or at a midway point, they miss the proper ground of the church. They are right persons on the wrong ground. We must all give up the wrong ground and return to the proper ground of oneness. We must stress this, because today we are under a situation of confusion. God&rsquo;s intention is that we would be a corporate Body in oneness.</p>
<p>We need to know which meeting of Christians is on the proper ground of oneness. There are many Christian organizations, groups, and &ldquo;bodies&rdquo; today. Again, we may compare them to the Jews. Among the Jews today there are many organizations formed to help the nation of Israel. Among all these gatherings of Jews, however, only that group in Palestine is on the proper ground. If all the Jews in Israel were in New York, they would no longer be the nation of Israel. They would lose the ground. Likewise, if those in the Jewish organizations would return to Palestine, they would become the nation of Israel. It is not the number that is important; it is the proper ground. If we remain in Babylon or midway in the free groups, we are not the church. We may be members of Christ&rsquo;s Body, but we lose the ground to be the church in practicality. We all need to come back to the proper ground of the genuine oneness, not the &ldquo;oneness&rdquo; in the divisions.</p>
