This subject is the rapture. Rapture is a special term; it refers to our being taken up to the heavens at the time of the Lord's coming again. We all know that the Lord will come again soon. The Bible tells us that before He comes down to the earth, He will bring us to the heavens, after which He will come down. His bringing us to the heavens is called the rapture.</P><P>Concerning the rapture, there are several opinions among Christians. Let me bring a few points to your attention. What is before us, and what we are looking forward to, is the rapture. However, a terrible tribulation is also before us. This tribulation can be called the trial, or the last three and a half years. According to the Bible, this tribulation is very great. "For at that time there will be great tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor shall by any means ever occur" (Matt. 24:21). Both the rapture and the tribulation are before us. If we are not raptured, we will surely go through the tribulation; if we do not go through the tribulation, we will surely be raptured. Among Christians there are several different views concerning the matter of rapture.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THREE DIFFERENT VIEWS</H2><P>Some Christians say that all the saved ones who are genuinely regenerated and have new life will be raptured before the tribulation. This means that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation.</P><P>Other Christians say that the whole church will go through the tribulation and then be raptured. This means that all saved ones who are genuinely regenerated and have new life will go through the trial before they will be raptured.</P><P>Some other Christians say that among all the saved ones, a minority will be raptured before the tribulation and the majority will go through the tribulation before they are raptured. They say that not every regenerated person will be raptured before the tribulation, but only the regenerated ones who have been watching, preparing, and waiting for the Lord's coming back day after day will be raptured before the tribulation. The regenerated ones who do not watch, prepare, and wait for the Lord's coming will not be raptured before the tribulation. In other words, the whole church will not be raptured before the tribulation; only a minority will be raptured before the tribulation. Neither does this mean that the whole church will have to go through the tribulation before it can be raptured. It means that the majority will go through the tribulation. Those who hold this view make a compromise between the first and second view.</P><P>In brief, the first group says that the whole church (all the regenerated ones) will be raptured before the tribulation. The second group says that the whole church (all the regenerated ones) will be raptured after the tribulation. The third group says that the minority who are watching, preparing, and waiting for Lord's coming will be raptured before the tribulation, whereas the rest (also regenerated ones) will go through the tribulation and then be raptured.</P><P>We must be careful! Regarding the rapture, although there are three different views, our attitude must be fair and proper, because among these three groups there are persons who are very good in Bible knowledge and are very spiritual. They all have their arguments. For example, among those who believe that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation are J. N. Darby, William Kelly, R. A. Torrey, D. L. Moody, J. H. Brookes, J. M. Gray, A. C. Gaebelein, J. A. Seiss, C. I. Scofield, and others.</P><P>Among those who believe that the whole church will go through the tribulation and then be raptured are George Muller, A. J. Gordon, A. B. Simpson, Dr. Erdman, Professor Moorhead, H. W. Frost, Robert Cameron, James Wright, B. W. Newton, and others.</P><P>Among those who believe that a minority will be raptured before the tribulation and the majority will go through the tribulation before being raptured are: Hudson Taylor, R. C. Chapman, R. Govett, G. H. Pember, D. M. Panton, Paul Rader, and others.</P><P>Because every one of these is a reliable scholar and a spiritual person, it becomes impossible to follow man in this matter. If you want to follow man, whom should you follow? They all are outstanding children of God! This kind of situation only causes us to acknowledge that even the best persons can make mistakes. We need to come solely to the Lord and beseech Him for light.</P><P>Because there are very reliable scholars and spiritual persons on each side, when opinions differ, no one should revile others, and no one should say anything that is unbecoming of a Christian, such as, "Such a teaching is from Satan," or "Such a thought is from Satan," and so forth. We must realize that these are our brothers, and their life in Christ is probably deeper than ours. We should by no means consider them as "false prophets," or consider that they are "ignorant of the principles of prophecy," or that their views are "absurd" or are "cunning teachings." If we say these things, we will not only offend the brothers, but we will offend the Lord. We should only present the reasons and make a clear judgment according to the Bible.</P><P>It is impossible that all three of these views are correct. Either all three are wrong, or only one is correct and the other two are wrong. If we want to know who is correct and who is wrong, we must judge everything according to the Bible. Only the Bible has the authority to judge. We should find out the proofs from the Bible, and we should see whose reasons are most convincing and whose reasons are not trustworthy.</P><P>However, we have to be very careful about one thing. We cannot just quote verses every time we look for proof from the Bible. We should not presume that as long as a person has some verses, he has the proof. We must be careful that the verses we quote do indeed prove the things we are discussing. If we only quote verses, without asking whether or not the verses are appropriate to the subject matter, it would be like an incapable lawyer who quotes many irrelevant laws to defend his client. Is this not an unacceptable practice in the law? Now we will begin by considering the view of the first group.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 19: Notes on Scriptural Messages (3) &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
