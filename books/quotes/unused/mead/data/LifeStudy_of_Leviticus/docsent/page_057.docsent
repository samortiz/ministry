   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO FORMS OF THE MEAL OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Leviticus 2 we see that the meal offering can be in different forms.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our concern here is with two particular forms of the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The meal offering may be in the form of flour mingled with oil, or it may be in the form of a cake.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The flour meal offering signifies the individual Christ; it also signifies the individual Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The cake meal offering signifies the corporate Christ, Christ with His Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The New Testament reveals that the individual Christ has become the corporate Christ 1 Cor 12:12 signified by the cake.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul says, "We who are many are one bread, one Body; for we all partake of the one bread" 1 Cor 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This one bread is a "cake."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With the meal offering there is the individual aspect, and there is also the corporate aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today Christ does not live merely in an individual way; He also lives with His Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ lives before God in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is the Head, and He has His Body with its members.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, with the meal offering in the form of a cake we have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to have a cake meal offering, we need fine flour mingled with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The mingling of flour and oil will produce dough.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The dough is then baked in an oven and becomes a cake.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This cake is a symbol of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This symbol indicates that eventually Christ's life and our individual Christian life become a totality, and this totality is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church life is not an angelic life but a life full of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, some Christians have been told that they should try to be like angels and no longer live like human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This concept is altogether wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we would have more church life, we need more humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For the church life we need to be very human.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But this humanity should not be separate from the Holy Spirit;</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>rather, it should be a humanity which is mingled with the Holy Spirit and which has the Holy Spirit poured upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, for the church life we need to be oiled persons, those who are oiled by the Spirit and with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, we should not have leaven or honey, but we should have salt and frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In our life much salt, the death of the cross, should be applied, and we should be full of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we would have this kind of church life, we must be full of humanity and live like men, not like angels.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, certain sisters, and even some brothers, are trying to live as if they were angels.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These saints are peculiar and lacking in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more you try to be an angel, the more peculiar you will be.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead of being human, you will be a "ghost."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, I say again that in the church life we need to be full of humanity, but not with a humanity that is independent of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should be fully dependent on the Holy Spirit, being oiled with Him inwardly and having Him poured upon us outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are such persons, we will be full of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We will be centered on the Spirit and possessed by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We will also live a life that is through salt and in frankincense, that is, a life that is through the death of Christ and in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The salt will deal with the leaven, with the germs of sin; the salt will also deal with the honey, putting the natural life to death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the way to have a meal offering church life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The meal offering church life can be burned to produce a satisfying fragrance for God, and the remainder of this offering will be our food.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that we will eat our church life, for the church life will be our daily supply.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, the meal offering which is our daily supply is not merely Christ but Christ with the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now we are feeding on Christ, and we are also feeding on the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We eat the meal offering not only in the first form as flour the individual Christ; we also eat the meal offering in the second form as a cake the corporate Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I believe that in the coming days in all the churches we will see a meal offering church life, a life that first satisfies God and then feeds us.</S>
