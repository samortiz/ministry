<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. By Hearing Christ's Word<br>and Believing the Father Who Sent Him,<br>That We May Live in Our Spirit<br>and Have Eternal Life</H2><P>We receive, experience, and enjoy Christ also by hearing Christ's word and believing the Father who sent Him, that we may live in our spirit and have eternal life (John 5:24a, 25). We were saved first by hearing the word of Christ concerning the Father, and then by believing in the Father, who sent Christ. The Father sent Christ so that we could live in our spirit and have eternal life.</P><P>Eternal life is difficult to explain, but according to our experience we can testify that from the day we believed into the Lord Jesus, the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the life-giving Spirit&#151;entered into us. This Triune God is eternal life (John 14:6; 1 John 5:12; Rom. 8:2). Because the Triune God is within us, we can live in our spirit. The worldly people do not have the capacity to live in their spirit, because they do not have eternal life in their spirit. After we believed into Christ, the Triune God entered into us as the eternal life, giving us the capacity to live in our spirit. This capacity is the Triune God Himself. As we live in our spirit, we live the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. By Eating Christ<br>(Taking Him as Food into Our Spirit)<br>and Living because of Him</H2><P>We receive, experience, and enjoy Christ also by eating Christ (taking Him as food into our spirit) and living because of Him (John 6:57). We eat Christ by taking Him as food into our spirit. To eat physical food, we must take it into our stomach. Similarly, the Triune God embodied in Christ and realized as the Spirit to be our spiritual food and life supply must be taken into our spirit. In this way we live because of Him.</P><P>Before I speak in the meetings, I often feel empty within. So I must have some time with the Lord by myself to look to Him, to pray to Him, and to talk to Him. Sometimes, after only five minutes I am filled. At the beginning I feel like a "flat tire," but after a few minutes my "flat tire" is filled with "air." At that time I have the assurance, the boldness, and the power to speak. This power is just the Spirit. We need to come to this Jesus, to this Spirit, to take Him as our spiritual food and life supply.</P>
