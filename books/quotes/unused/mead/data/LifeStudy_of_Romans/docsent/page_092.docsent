   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE PRESENTING OF OUR BODIES A. The Begging of the Apostle</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 12:1 says, I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 12:1 Paul speaks in a begging way, revealing the importance of the matter concerning which he is about to charge us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It unveils God s desire and purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For centuries and ages God has had a particular desire to have a body for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, the Apostle said, I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Notice that it is not compassion in singular, but compassions in plural.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 9:15 we have seen that compassion is richer and deeper than mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God not only has one kind of compassion, but many kinds of compassion upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He has had compassion on us in selecting us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He has had compassion on us in calling us, in saving us, and in bringing us into His life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the previous chapters show, He has had many compassions on us in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was through these compassions of God that the Apostle Paul begged us to present our bodies to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we realize the compassions of God and are moved by them, we shall do what the Apostle begged us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>B. Presenting Our Bodies as a Sacrifice 1.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many Bodies, One Sacrifice</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 1 Paul also begs us to present our bodies a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 6:13, 19 he encouraged us to present the members of our bodies as weapons for fighting and as servants for serving because Romans 6 is a matter of warfare and service.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, in the church life it is a question of sacrifice, of offering ourselves to God for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church life as a whole is an offering for the satisfaction of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although many bodies are presented, the sacrifice is one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why are there many bodies but only one sacrifice?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because the many members are one Body and the many believers are one church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why does Paul use the word living ?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because he compares this sacrifice with the sacrifices of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The sacrifices offered in Old Testament days were all slain, but the church is not a slain offering; it is a living offering full of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In chapter eight we see that the believers are filled with Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When they come to chapter twelve to offer themselves as a sacrifice to God, they are a living offering filled with the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, the sacrifice is holy, meaning that it is separate from common things and that it possesses God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our God is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is absolutely different and separate from all other things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This holy nature of His has been wrought into the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So the Body is holy and unique.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is different from a club, the YMCA, and every kind of social organization.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Body is holy, and nothing common can be brought into it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, this offering is the only thing that is well-pleasing to God and is for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For the practice of the Body life this offering is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to offer our bodies for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A Priestly Service</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Which Is Most Reasonable</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To offer ourselves to God as a living sacrifice is our most reasonable service.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The words present and sacrifice mentioned above indicate that the reasonable service is a priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we have a sober mind and if we intend to be reasonable, fair, and logical, then we certainly must have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>People who do not like to have the church life are the most foolish of people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To practice anything other than the church life is foolish, but to give up everything for the church life is logical and reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nothing is more reasonable than churching.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To spend two dollars on a worldly item or amusement is foolish, but to spend two million dollars on the church life is reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If I had a hundred lives, I would give them all for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, I would not give even the smallest fraction of my life to the worldly things, for to do that would be stupid.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What a reasonable service it is to give ourselves to the church life!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I can testify that I have been in the Lord s work for more than forty years and that I do not have the slightest regret about it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever I think about the church I am excited.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every time I think about the church life and about my ministry for the church life I am in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What a reasonable service it is!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When Paul began to speak about the church life, he implored the believers to present their bodies because as human beings nothing is more real and practical than our body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If your body is not in the church life, please do not say how much you yourself are for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the past years many people have said to me, Brother, I stand with you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because the burden of my business is so heavy I cannot be in the church life, but I am one with what you are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Others have said, I m too tired to attend the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You go to the meeting and I ll stay home and pray for you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I can t go to the meeting physically because I m so tired, but my heart and spirit will be there with you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These words sound pleasant but they are a deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must realize that we are in our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Where our bodies are, we are.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Suppose that all the saints should say that they are too tired to attend the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What would happen to the meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thus, Paul begged the brothers to present their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you mean business for the Lord s purpose, you need to present your body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is good for you to come to the meeting even if you sleep through most of it.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is better to come to a meeting and sleep than not to come at all.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You may attend a meeting and sleep through it all except for the last few minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Perhaps during the last five minutes you will be inspired and receive a great help.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I am familiar with a number of cases in which this has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Let me tell you of one that occurred in my home province of Shantung.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I was visiting a certain church with a young apprentice, a brother who was under my hand learning how to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>His name was Chao.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The wife of the leading brother in this little church loved the Lord very much and she served us food three times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>As a result of all her work she was tired out.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>However, she could not stop attending the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>One day in particular she came and sat in the front row.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Brother Chao was asked to speak a word in the meeting that night.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>While he was speaking, the sister fell asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>During his message the young brother was very patient.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Nevertheless, near the end of his message, unable to restrain himself any longer, he turned to the sister and said, If you keep on sleeping, I ll kick you out!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When he did this I was very worried.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>After the meeting I told him never to do that again.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I felt ashamed as we returned to the sister s house for hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>However, the sister greeted us cheerfully.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This sister came to the meeting and slept almost the entire meeting, but during the last few minutes she received help.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We need to come to the meetings bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Do not say that you will be in the church spiritually but not bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>You need to present your body.</S>
