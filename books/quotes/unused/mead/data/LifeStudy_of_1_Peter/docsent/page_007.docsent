   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE THREE THE FULL SALVATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND ITS ISSUES 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:3-4</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the writings of Peter a single word is often rich in meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Take, for example, Peter s use of the word sprinkling in 1:2.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this verse Peter speaks concerning the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As Peter wrote these words, it seems he was saying, You scattered Jewish believers are familiar with the sprinkling of the blood of sheep and goats described in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, you must realize that the sprinkling of animal blood is a type of the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The old sprinkling, the sprinkling of the blood of animals, merely brought God s people into the Old Testament blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the new sprinkling, the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, brings us into the full enjoyment of God s new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By this example we see that in the Epistles of Peter a single word can indicate a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE GOD AND FATHER OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1:3 Peter goes on to say, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to pay close attention to the definite article used before the word God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this verse Peter speaks not only of God, but speaks of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The unbelieving Jews knew about God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Their God was the One who created the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But these Jews would not believe that their God was also the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is an important difference here.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Of course, it is not true to say that the Jews believe in one God and that Christians believe in a different God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The crucial point here is that there is a great difference between the understanding and realization concerning God among Jews and among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the understanding of the Jews, God is the Creator of the universe, but He is not the God and Father of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In our understanding, however, God is both the Creator of the universe and the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the reason Peter uses the definite article before God in 1:3.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 1:3 Peter declares that the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ has regenerated us unto a living hope according to His great mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here we see that once again Peter uses an adjective: he speaks not merely of God s mercy, but speaks of His great mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul also speaks concerning God s mercy, but he does not use the adjective great to describe it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>REGENERATED UNTO A LIVING HOPE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From 1:3 we see that the Father has not only chosen us, but has also regenerated us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1:1 through 3 we have four actions in the following sequence: choosing, sanctifying, redeeming, and regenerating.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In eternity past God chose us, selected us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then His Spirit came to us to separate us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Following that, we received the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, the application of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the very moment we were sprinkled outwardly by the blood, we were inwardly regenerated by the sanctifying Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, following God s choosing, the Spirit s sanctifying, and Christ s redeeming, we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Regeneration, like redemption and justification, is an aspect of God s full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Redemption and justification solve our problem with God and reconcile us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Regeneration enlivens us with God s life and brings us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, regeneration issues and results in a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such regeneration takes place through the resurrection of Christ from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When Christ was resurrected, we, His believers, were all included in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, we were resurrected with Him Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In His resurrection He imparted the divine life into us and made us the same as He is in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the basic factor of our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be regenerated is to receive another life, the divine life, in addition to the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all received the human life from our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But because of God s choosing, the Spirit s sanctifying, and Christ s redeeming, God begets us, regenerates us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As a result, we have a second birth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Through regeneration God the Father imparts the divine life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, the first birth was the birth of our human life, and the second birth, the birth of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all have been born of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is what it means to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In 1:3 Peter tells us that we have been regenerated unto a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Greek word rendered unto means issuing in, resulting in, with a view to.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God has regenerated us with a view to a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This hope in our pilgrimage today is for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not a hope of objective things; it is a hope of life, even eternal life, with all the endless divine blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is this hope that we should set completely on the coming grace 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In verse 3 Peter speaks not merely of hope, but of a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not easy to explain what this living hope is.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some may interpret it to mean a hope that is living and not dead.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Yes, it is correct to say that the hope we have is living in contrast to a dead hope.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Nevertheless, if we have the skill to interpret this expression according to our experience, we shall realize that more is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>From experience we know that the life-giving Spirit has come into us to enliven us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Formerly we were dead, and everything related to us, in particular any expectation for the future, was also dead.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But the enlivening which we have experienced through the life-giving Spirit results in a living hope, in the hope that everything related to us will become living.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we were sprinkled with the blood of Christ, immediately the life-giving Spirit came into us to enliven us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Using the word life as a verb, we may say that the Spirit came into us to life us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Formerly we were dead and altogether without hope, but we have been lifed through the life-giving Spirit unto a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now we have the hope that every part of our being will be lifed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To have a living hope is to be lifed.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The regeneration of God the Father results in the hope that every part of our being and everything related to us will be lifed, enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Everything related to an unsaved person is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But with one who has been regenerated by God with the divine life, there is the hope that everything will be enlivened and thus become living.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the Gospel of John the apostle John speaks about being born again.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Although Paul does not use the word regenerated or the expression born again, in 1 Corinthians 4 he says something that indicates regeneration: he tells the believers that he begot them through the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is related to regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But Peter is the only one who tells us clearly how we are regenerated and unto what we have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have been regenerated through the living and abiding word of God unto a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Through regeneration God has made us alive.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In Adam we all are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When we were born of our parents, we were born dead.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Furthermore, all unbelievers are dying a little more each day.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>All of them are marching toward the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Their destination is the tomb, and their destiny is death.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Hence, in Adam every man is born dead and is also born to die.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>According to the Bible the gospel is preached not merely to sinners; it is also preached to those who are dead in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We know from Peter s word in 1:3 that through the means, the instrumentality, of the resurrection of Christ, God has regenerated us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Through Christ s resurrection God has made us alive.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In Adam we all died, but in Christ we all have been made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Do you realize that you were born six thousand years ago, when Adam was created?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If Adam had not been created, you would not have been born.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Because we were born in Adam, we are all the same age six thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We also died in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But nearly two thousand years ago, when Christ was resurrected, we were made alive, regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>According to the New Testament, when Christ was resurrected, we were resurrected in Him Eph 2:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Hallelujah, although we were born with Adam, we have been reborn with Christ in His resurrection!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>At this point I would quote a word from Dean Alford: The resurrection of Christ, bringing in life and the gift of the life-giving Spirit, is that which potentiates the new birth into a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The concept here is deep.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The resurrection of Christ potentiates our regeneration into a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>When we were regenerated, the resurrected Christ entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He is not only the living One He is also the resurrected One.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Now He is the life within us that potentiates the new birth and causes every aspect of our being to become living.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Therefore, regeneration results in a living hope.</S>
