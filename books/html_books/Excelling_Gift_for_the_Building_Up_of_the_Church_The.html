<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:2, 7a, 9, 13a, 18, 23-24, 30; 2:2; 3:6, 9-14; 5:7-8; 6:17; 10:3-4, 16-17; 11:24-26; 12:1-11, 13b, 31a; 14:1, 3-5, 12, 19, 24-25, 31, 39a; 15:45b</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for this gathering. Thank You for gathering us all into Your name. We believe that You are with us, that You are present within us. Thank You for Your speaking. Thank You for all of Your mercy in which we fully trust. As sinful as we are, we need Your mercy. Thank You, Lord, that Your mercy is fresh every morning. We trust in You, we trust in Your presence, we trust in Your speaking, and we trust in Your mercy. Lord, visit each one of us and speak a word particularly to each one of us. Touch our spirit. Touch our heart. Touch our emotion, our mind, and our will. Touch our entire being. Lord, we are not here to seek after the knowledge concerning You. We are seeking You Yourself. We are seeking You in our experience and for our enjoyment in our daily life and in our Christian practice. Lord, help us in speaking. We do not want to speak by ourselves, and we have nothing to speak apart from You. We want to speak You, to speak with You, and to speak of You. Lord, vindicate Your way. Confirm that You are with us by speaking in our speaking. Lord, we hate Your enemy, the accuser of the brothers. Thank You, Lord, that we can overcome him by the blood of the Lamb. Shame the enemy and be sovereign over us. Thank You that You are still on the throne. You are still the very sovereign Lord on the throne standing with us. Amen.</p>
<p>In this book we want to fellowship concerning the excelling gift for the building up of the church. This matter is spoken of by Paul in 1 Corinthians 14. In order to see this excelling gift, we must first see the position of 1 Corinthians in the New Testament and its subject.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FIRST CORINTHIANS BEING A BOOK ON<br />
THE ENJOYMENT OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST</h2>
<p>We believe that the books of the Bible have been arranged in their sequence according to the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit. Revelation could not be the first book of the Bible nor could Genesis be the last book. In the New Testament there are firstly the four Gospels and then the Acts followed by Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles from Romans through Hebrews. The first of Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles is Romans and the second is 1 Corinthians. Romans is on the Christian life with the church life. Following this, the enjoyment of Christ is needed. First Corinthians is a book on the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ (1:2, 9, 24, 30).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Enjoyment of Christ Solving the Problems<br />
in the Church through the Work of the Cross</h2>
<p>Many students of the Bible think that 1 Corinthians is a book that merely deals with all kinds of problems. This book does deal with many problems, but it tells us how we can deal with them. Within a short time after being saved by the Lord, we discovered in our experience that it is not that simple to be a Christian. To live the Christian life is not easy. We encounter many problems in our daily life and church life. The only way to solve these problems is by enjoying Christ.</p>
<p>As an illustration of this, let us consider our physical body. God created us with a wonderful, organic, living body. Our body serves us and meets our need, but many times it gives us a lot of trouble. The basic way we can solve our bodily problems is by eating. Eating is an enjoyment. If we eat properly, many of our bodily problems will be solved. In the same way, the enjoyment of Christ solves the problems in the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>We need 1 Corinthians to speak to us concerning the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ. Paul begins this Epistle by saying that it is not only to the church in Corinth but also to &ldquo;all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours&rdquo; (v. 2b). &ldquo;Every place&rdquo; means all the geographical places on this earth. Therefore, this Epistle is addressed to all of us, the ones who call upon the name of the Lord. This very Christ upon whom we call is &ldquo;theirs and ours.&rdquo; He is yours and He is mine. This means that Christ is our portion. Christ has been given to us by God the Father to be our portion. He is the portion of the saints (Col. 1:12).</p>
<p>First Corinthians 1:9 says that our faithful God has called us into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ. The word &ldquo;fellowship&rdquo; includes the thought of enjoyment. Sometimes people may celebrate something by having a party. For us to fellowship together is to have a &ldquo;party.&rdquo; A party is a fellowship. The Christian meeting may be considered as a Christian party. Every meeting is a party to us. I am interpreting the word <em>party</em> in a very positive sense. A party is an enjoyment. If we are at a party, you will enjoy me and I will enjoy you. We will share our joy and feelings with one another. We are so happy when we are meeting with the saints because our meeting, in a positive sense, is a party.</p>
<p>In our hymnal, there is a hymn about the church life which begins, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy in this lovely place&rdquo; (#1237). It is hard to enjoy such a hymn by ourselves. If we were at home alone in our living room, it would be difficult to sing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy in the living room.&rdquo; But if you are in a small group meeting of ten to fifteen saints, you can declare&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy!&rdquo;&mdash;because you are having fellowship, a party. This party is not like the parties in the world with sinful and worldly things. It is a party of the Son, Jesus Christ. We are enjoying Him. We are happy with Him and happy because of Him. We are so happy because He is our joy. He is our enjoyment. Our fellowship, our enjoyment, our party, is to partake of, to participate in, the all-inclusive Christ. The faithful God has called us with a purpose. This purpose is that we may participate in His Son, Jesus Christ. This means that God has given us Christ and that He has called us into the enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p>Such a Christ is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom (1:24). Wisdom is for planning and power is for carrying out. Years ago the American scientists had the wisdom to make a plan to land on the moon. Once the plan was made, there was the need of the power to carry out the plan. With both wisdom and power we can accomplish what we desire. The United States landed on the moon because they had the wisdom plus the power. Today Christ is God&rsquo;s wisdom and God&rsquo;s power. God planned an eternal plan with Christ. Christ is the element, the factor, and even the sphere of God&rsquo;s eternal plan. Furthermore, Christ is the power of God to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan. This very Christ has been given to us as our portion. We can enjoy Christ as our designing, planning wisdom and as the power to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>When we read 1 Corinthians in the past, we may have seen only the troubles and problems in the church in Corinth. But we need to realize that 1 Corinthians is a book on the enjoyment of Christ as the solution of all the problems. Christ is our portion, and we have been called into the fellowship of this portion. This very Christ is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom transmitted into us to be our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1:30). For our past we need Christ as our righteousness, for our present we need Him as our sanctification, and for our future we need Him as our redemption for the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23), the transfiguration of our body (Phil. 3:21).</p>
<p>Christ is also righteousness, sanctification, and redemption for us to experience today. We need Christ as our daily righteousness for all that we do. Whatever we do without Him is not righteous. Without Christ as life mingled with us as the life and factor of our doings, whatever we do is unrighteous. Christ is also our daily sanctification. What we do should be right and what we are should be holy. Christ is our righteousness for our doing and our sanctification for our being. Furthermore, Christ is our daily redemption. What we are in the old creation according to our first birth needs to be redeemed. Day by day Christ is redeeming us. Whatever He redeems, He saves, and whatever He saves, He transforms. In what we are as the old creation, we need Him as our redemption to redeem us, to save us, and to transform us. Every day we need Him as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</p>
<p>In chapter five of 1 Corinthians, Christ is our Passover and our unleavened bread for us to keep the feast (vv. 7-8). A feast is altogether an enjoyment. In chapter ten Christ is our spiritual food and our spiritual drink (vv. 3-4), and He gave Himself to us by being crucified so that we can enjoy the fellowship of His blood and body (v. 16). In this Christ there is an absolute, wonderful, excellent, and killing death. In the crucified and resurrected Christ, there is the killing element that kills all of our negative &ldquo;germs.&rdquo; The food that we eat every day, on the one hand, nourishes us, and on the other hand, kills the negative elements in our physical body. In like manner, if we eat Christ every day to enjoy Him, we will be nourished and the negative elements within us will be killed.</p>
<p>The enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ solves the problems in the church through the work of the cross (1:13a, 18, 23-24; 2:2). By &ldquo;the cross&rdquo; I mean the death of Christ, especially the subjective aspect of His death. The Christ that we enjoy today is the all-inclusive One, and included in His being is the killing death. As long as we enjoy Him, we get killed, not in a negative way but in a positive way. When we enjoy Him every day, we get killed every day. One brother may be very offended by another brother and may even be full of hatred, but when this brother enjoys Christ, his germs of hatred toward the other brother are unconsciously killed. In marriage life, the husbands offend the wives and the wives offend the husbands, but when the husbands and wives love the Lord and enjoy the Lord day after day, their bad feeling toward each other disappears. It is cleared up by the killing element within the very Christ that they experienced. Inside of them there is a great change from hatred to love because of their enjoyment of Christ. Because there were so many problems among the Corinthians, Paul wrote to them concerning the enjoyment of Christ. This enjoyment solves our problems by killing the germs within us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Enjoyment of Christ Issuing<br />
in the Growth in Life, Producing the Precious<br />
Materials for the Building Up of the Church</h2>
<p>As the enjoyment of Christ solves our problems by taking away the negative elements within us, there can be the growth in life. This is similar to the physical food that we eat taking care of our bodily problems and helping us to grow. The issue of our enjoyment of Christ is the growth in life, producing precious materials for the building up of the church (3:6, 9-14). By enjoying Christ, our inward problems get cleared up and we grow. In 1 Corinthians 3:6, Paul said, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow.&rdquo; The very purpose for God to fill us with Christ is to make us grow, and the growth in life is for the producing of precious materials&mdash;gold, silver, and precious stones&mdash;for the building up of the church. As we grow in life, we become more golden, more precious, and more shining from week to week.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Enjoyment of Christ Developing Our Gifts<br />
by the Growth in Life</h2>
<p>The enjoyment of Christ not only solves our problems and issues in the growth in life, but it also develops our gifts by the growth in life (12:1-11). The word <em>gifts</em> may be considered as a synonym for the word <em>talents.</em> By our physical birth, all of us have received some talents. We have the talent to see, to hear, to speak, to walk, and to think and understand. We have received these talents by our birth, but all of these talents need to be developed. They are developed by the growth of our physical body. As a little child grows, all of his talents, or gifts, will be developed. The more a child grows, the more he can function in seeing, hearing, speaking, and other things. It is the same in our spiritual life. The initial gifts were given to the believers at their spiritual birth (1:7). The divine life and the divine Spirit were the two main gifts we received at our spiritual birth. Each one who has been regenerated has received these two great gifts. Within the divine life there are many talents, gifts, which need development. We have to enjoy Christ so that we may grow. As we grow, the gifts that we received by our spiritual birth are developed.</p>
<p>If our enjoyment of Christ is real and without problems, the spontaneous result will be the development of our gifts. A brother who has been saved for ten years may claim that he has been enjoying Christ every day. After ten years, however, we cannot see him functioning by speaking something concerning the Lord and for the Lord. After ten years, he still comes to the church meetings to sit and be silent. He may feel that to speak in the meetings is not his business but the business of other brothers. This means that his enjoyment of Christ has some problems. As a child eats every day, his talents should be developed by his growth in his physical life. If he eats much without such development, there are some problems. It is the same with our spiritual life. We should not be deceived. If we are enjoying Christ, there should be the development of the gifts by the growth in life. The initial gifts need to be developed by the believers&rsquo; seeking (indicated by &ldquo;earnestly desire&rdquo; in 12:31a) through the growth in life. To desire something earnestly means that you are seeking after something.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXCELLING GIFT PRODUCED IN THE GROWTH<br />
IN LIFE THROUGH THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Prophesying for the Building Up<br />
of the Church as the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>The excelling gift produced in the growth in life through the enjoyment of Christ is prophesying (14:12). First Corinthians 14 stresses that the top gift, the gift that excels all the other gifts, developed by our enjoyment of Christ is prophesying. Prophesying in chapter fourteen does not mean predicting. This is proven by verse 3 which according to the Greek says, &ldquo;He who prophesies speaks to men building up and encouragement and consolation.&rdquo; If a brother is speaking building up, encouragement, and consolation to others, this proves that his prophesying is not predicting. To prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14 is to speak for the Lord, speak forth the Lord, and speak the Lord into others, ministering (dispensing) the Lord to others (14:3-5). As proper, growing believers whose spiritual gifts are being developed, we must speak the Lord into others every day. If we practice this every day, we will all have something to share when we come together for fellowship. This will be the fulfillment of 1 Corinthians 14:26&mdash;whenever we come together, each one has.</p>
<p>The first item that we should have for the church meetings, according to 1 Corinthians 14:26, is a psalm. The New Testament shows us that psalms and hymns are firstly for speaking not singing. Ephesians 5:18-19 says that we are filled in spirit by speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. To speak the composed, poetic writings is more accurate, concise, and powerful than ordinary speaking. This is why we have to learn how to speak the hymns in our meetings. First Corinthians 14:26 also speaks of having a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, and an interpretation. All of these items are for speaking. The last two items, a tongue and an interpretation, are miraculous speakings. They are not by learning but by the miraculous power of the Holy Spirit. A psalm, a teaching, and a revelation require learning.</p>
<p>Speaking for the Lord, speaking forth the Lord, and speaking the Lord into others is for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ. With only one man speaking and the rest listening a congregation can be built up, but the Body of Christ as an organism can never be built up. To build up the organic Body of Christ, all of us need to speak. If we come together every week to listen to a pastor give a good sermon, this may build us up as a congregation, as a big facade to make a show. This kind of practice is prevailing in Christianity. For us to come together to build up the Body of Christ organically, the practice of one man speaking and the rest listening is not prevailing. All the members need to speak for the Body of Christ to be built up. One saint can speak for two minutes, another for five minutes, and another for three minutes.</p>
<p>Suppose that we have two hundred meeting together always with one speaker. Regardless of how good, how marvelous, and how excellent this speaker is, many would become tired of his speaking after two years. Even the speaker himself may feel the same. Suppose that, on the other hand, two hundred meet together for ninety minutes and everyone bears the responsibility to have something to speak for the Lord. If each one speaks for three minutes, thirty saints will be able to speak. This will be a refreshing meeting. Whenever a new one speaks, his speaking is especially fresh and refreshing. Everyone will say &ldquo;amen&rdquo; to his speaking. To build every part of the Body of Christ, we all need to rise up to speak for the Lord.</p>
<p>Our church meetings should be a feast of the riches of Christ. When we are invited to a feast, we do not partake of only one dish. A feast is full of many different kinds of food. Some Chinese feasts are composed of twenty-four courses of food. If we had many kinds of dishes in a meeting, how wonderful that would be! None of us would get bored of such a meeting. Our meetings need to be feasts full of enjoyment.</p>
<p>A meeting in which all the saints are speaking for the Lord is full of nourishing, cherishing, adjusting, and correcting. A brother may be in the meeting who has a habit that is not so fitting for the church life. With only one person speaking and the rest listening, a message may never be given that touches this brother&rsquo;s habit. But if twenty or thirty saints speak in the meeting, eventually someone will speak something that touches this brother&rsquo;s habit. Because many portions are presented in the meeting, many things can be touched. In such a meeting, the saints get corrected without anyone knowing. Furthermore, the saints get built up, supplied, furnished, and equipped. This is why the Apostle Paul had the burden to stress prophesying.</p><h2 class="head2">Highly Recommended by the Apostle</h2>
<p>Prophesying is highly recommended by the apostle in 1 Corinthians. In 12:31a Paul said, &ldquo;Earnestly desire the greater gifts.&rdquo; Some gifts are minor and others are greater. We have to desire earnestly the greater gifts. In 14:1 Paul said, &ldquo;Desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.&rdquo; At the conclusion of chapter fourteen, Paul said, &ldquo;Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy&rdquo; (14:39a). The first verse of chapter fourteen and the conclusion tell us that we need to desire earnestly to prophesy. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;I desire that you all...may prophesy;...greater is he who prophesies...that the church may receive building up.&rdquo; Paul repeatedly charged us to desire to prophesy. His speaking in 1 Corinthians 14 is a great encouragement to prophesy, and a great recommendation and uplifting of prophesying.</p>
<p>Verse 12 says, &ldquo;Since you are zealous of spirits (lit.), seek that you may excel to the building up of the church.&rdquo; Actually in the Greek text &ldquo;zealous&rdquo; is a noun, so Paul was telling the Corinthians that they were &ldquo;zealots of spirits.&rdquo; J. N. Darby indicates that before believing in the Lord, the Greek Christians were zealous for certain kinds of spirits. Of course, these spirits were actually demons. The Corinthians were zealots of demonic spirits. In the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, however, the main thing is the gift of the Holy Spirit. Now that they are saved, they should seek the excelling Holy Spirit and the excelling gift of prophesying for the building up of the church. They should seek to excel to the building up of the church. The word &ldquo;excel&rdquo; may also be translated &ldquo;abound.&rdquo; According to the context of verse 12, however, there is a comparison between prophesying and speaking in tongues, so &ldquo;excel&rdquo; is the best translation. If we desire spiritual gifts, we should desire the top one, the one that excels&mdash;prophesying. Other gifts are not as excelling as prophesying is. In building up the Body of Christ, you are not excelling if you do not prophesy. Prophesying is the excelling gift for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Verses 24 and 25 say, &ldquo;If all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all; the secrets of his heart become manifest; and so falling on his face, he will worship God, reporting that God is really among you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Convicted&rdquo; and &ldquo;judged&rdquo; also prove that prophesying in chapter fourteen is not in the sense of predicting. Predicting cannot convict people or judge people. A particular kind of speaking is needed to convict people, to judge people, and to make the secrets of their heart manifest.</p>
<p>Verse 31 says, &ldquo;You can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged.&rdquo; It is possible for all to prophesy one by one. If this were not possible, the Apostle Paul would not have said it. Our prophesying is so that &ldquo;all may learn.&rdquo; If we do not learn first, how can we say something for others to learn? Whenever a mathematics professor teaches his students, they learn something, and whatever he has taught them, he has learned first. Before someone teaches mathematics, he must study mathematics. In order to teach in a college, an undergraduate degree is not sufficient. One must have either a master&rsquo;s or a doctor&rsquo;s degree. If others learn when we prophesy, this means that we had to learn first.</p>
<p>We may speak many things, yet what we speak may be common and ordinary talk. To prophesy requires learning. We learn to prophesy through experiences, by being equipped with the Word (2 Tim. 3:16-17), by praying unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17-20), by praying ourselves into the Spirit, by living and walking by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25), and by practicing. If we do these things, we will learn to speak in a particular way for the Lord. If we love the Lord and we mean business with Him, day by day we will learn to experience Him by enjoying Him. We will learn to get into the Word in order to be equipped with the Word. We will not read the Word in a shallow way, but we will dive into the Word and be immersed and transfused with the Word. We will also pray unceasingly to pray ourselves into the Spirit, and we will live and walk by the Spirit in our spirit all day long. Then our speaking will be particular and not ordinary.</p>
<p>In the past we encouraged all of the saints to function, to speak in the meetings. Most of us did this in the way of giving a testimony or in a way of exhorting others. Many times our speaking was just human speaking in a natural way. To prophesy, however, is divine. Because you have experienced the divine life, have been equipped with the divine word, have been praying yourself into the Spirit all the time, and have been walking in the Spirit, you are not natural but spiritual. You are not living in a natural way by your natural life. You are living by the divine Spirit, and you are a person in the Spirit practicing to speak for the Lord.</p>
<p>Among so many chapters of the New Testament, 1 Corinthians 14 stresses one thing, treasures one thing, uplifts one thing, recommends one thing, and exalts one thing&mdash;prophesying. Without prophesying, there is no possibility of building up the Body of Christ. This is why we cannot see a meeting like that described in 1 Corinthians 14:26 in all of Christianity. In the entire history of the church, it is hard to find the practice of such a meeting of mutuality. This is because it is not that easy to practice. It requires you to live a life that experiences Christ all the time and that dives into the holy Word to get saturated and equipped with the Word. Because the holy Word has become one with your being, you will not speak in a natural and ordinary way but with the equipping, holy Word. As a person who prays unceasingly and who walks and lives in the Spirit all the time, you make yourself a divine person, a spiritual person who lives by the divine life. As such a person, you will speak in a divine way with a divine word. Whenever you come to a meeting, you will have something to present to others. You will not speak ordinary things in a natural way. Instead, you will speak a word in a divine way with the divine element by the divine life. Only this can build up the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">ENDEAVORING TO GO ALONG WITH THE LORD<br />
TO FULFILL 1 CORINTHIANS 14:26</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 14:26 says that whenever we come together, each one has something of the Lord to share with the other attendants in the meeting for the building up of the church. We have to ask where such a reality is on this earth today. This verse needs to be fulfilled and it will be fulfilled. Fifty years ago in 1937, Brother Nee saw this matter, and his fellowship was published in the book <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em> We did our best to find a way to practice this, but we did not get through. In 1948 Brother Nee gave a four month training in which he released a particular series of messages that are contained in the book <em>Church Affairs.</em> In this series of messages, he touched the truth of 1 Corinthians 14:26 again in a strong way. In 1984 I went back to Taiwan from the United States because I realized that we must have a new start. Taiwan was the source of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery outside of mainland China. After four years of study in Taipei, eventually I was led to this point&mdash;1 Corinthians 14:26. We must endeavor to do everything we can to go along with the Lord for the fulfillment of this verse. This has been unveiled to me, so I cannot remain merely in my teaching during the past twenty-five years. I must have a new start. I must do my best to lead and to guide the saints into this new stage.</p>
<p>Since 1 Corinthians 14:26 is a verse in the holy Word, it needs to be fulfilled. If we would not pick up this burden, the Lord will go to others, and this will delay Him. A small delay to Him, though, is inconsequential because to Him one thousand years are as one day. We will be the ones who will suffer loss. We will miss His mark, His smile to us today, and His reward. Brother Nee saw this matter and spoke it to the saints, but they did not find a way to practice it. Then he spoke it a second time, but soon after that he was arrested and put into prison where he died after twenty years. I believe that Brother Nee will surely be reckoned by the Lord as an overcomer, but if I am not faithful to carry out this vision, I feel that I will miss the mark, miss the reward, and receive a strong rebuke from the Lord. Brother Nee spoke this to me and I saw it, so I must do something. This is why I am so burdened.</p>
<p>Today is the day that the Lord is doing His work to fulfill 1 Corinthians 14:26. By fulfilling this verse, He will be able to build up His Body organically and prepare His bride organically. The Lord&rsquo;s building work is organic, not organizational as in Christianity. We must have a change. Certain factories must change the machines that they use at certain intervals so that they can be up-to-date with the most recent technology. Otherwise, they will be behind. We must &ldquo;change our machines.&rdquo; I have pointed out in the past that no one can change the globe that we live on, but the means of transportation can be improved. Man has progressed from the mule wagon to the 747. We cannot change the truth, but we must change to the best and most scriptural way to carry out the truth. We must change. We are too old in our way. The old way from tradition should be put away. We came into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, but much of the tradition of Christianity followed us.</p>
<p>I am so burdened because I have seen a clear vision. I have the deep conviction that I have been commissioned by the Lord. If I do not release this burden for the fulfillment of 1 Corinthians 14:26, I am not faithful to the Lord. I have no choice before the Lord. The Devil hates this way because he knows it puts him into the corner by building up the Body of Christ and preparing the bride for the coming Christ. I have the confidence that deep in our spirit there is an echo to this fellowship. I have the full assurance that the Lord will raise up some faithful ones to fulfill 1 Corinthians 14:26 to bring in the reality of the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">DESIRING AND LEARNING TO PROPHESY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:12; 12:31a; 14:1, 39, 31; 2 Tim. 3:16-17; Gal. 5:16, 25; 1 Thes. 5:17-20; Prov. 4:18; Lam. 3:22-24; Psa. 119:147-148; Rev. 21:7; 1 John 1:6; Rom. 8:4b; 2 Tim. 4:2a</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, again we ask You to cleanse us with Your precious blood that we may enter into the enjoyment of Your anointing. Lord, open up the Word and open up Yourself to us. Lord, visit us and give us Your living word. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DESIRING TO PROPHESY</h2>
<p>In chapter one we saw that 1 Corinthians is a book on the enjoyment of Christ and that the enjoyment of Christ does three things. First, it solves the problems in the church through the work of the cross. Second, the enjoyment of Christ issues in the growth in life which produces precious materials&mdash;gold, silver, and precious stones&mdash;for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ. Third, the enjoyment of Christ develops the believers&rsquo; spiritual gifts through the growth in life. The more that we grow in life, the more our spiritual gifts by our spiritual birth are developed. The enjoyment of Christ is in chapters one and two of 1 Corinthians, the growth in life is in chapter three, and the gifts begin in chapter twelve. The development of the gifts comes out of the growth in life, and the growth in life issues from the enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p>Among all the gifts that are developed in the growth in life through the enjoyment of Christ, the top gift is prophesying. This is the excelling gift because it builds up the church (14:4b-5). In the last verse of 1 Corinthians 12, a chapter on the gifts, Paul tells us to desire earnestly the greater gifts. There are many gifts. Some are greater and others are lower. As far as the building up of the church is concerned, miraculous gifts such as speaking in tongues and healings are low. The greater gifts are the ones that are most profitable for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>Chapter thirteen reveals that the way to apply our gifts is by love. We are not qualified to desire the gifts without love. Only love in life can qualify us for the seeking of the gifts. If we do not have a life of love, we may abuse the gifts, using them wrongly to damage people rather than build them up. If we want the gifts, we must have a qualifying life, and that qualifying life is a life of love. We all have to pursue love.</p>
<p>The first verse of chapter fourteen tells us to &ldquo;pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.&rdquo; In verse 39 at the end of chapter fourteen Paul says, &ldquo;Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy.&rdquo; The Greek word for &ldquo;desire earnestly&rdquo; is used three times in 1 Corinthians&mdash;in 12:31, 14:1, and 14:39. Paul was burdened that we all would desire earnestly to prophesy. Paul also says that we must seek that we may excel to the building up of the church (14:12). Merely to speak in tongues is to remain in a low state, but to prophesy is to excel.</p>
<p>Chapter fourteen also gives much evidence that to prophesy is not to predict. When you prophesy, you speak to men for building up, encouragement, and consolation (v. 3). If all prophesy in a meeting, those who attend will be convicted and judged, and the secrets of their heart will be made manifest (vv. 24-25). To prophesy here is not to predict but to build up, encourage, console, convict, judge, and make manifest the secrets of the heart. Among all the gifts, the top one, the excelling one, is prophesying because it builds up the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE LORD&rsquo;S NEW WAY<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>I returned to Taiwan from the United States in October of 1984 because we needed to have a breakthrough in our practice for the Lord&rsquo;s interest. I realized that by October of 1984 the Lord&rsquo;s recovery had nearly come to a standstill. The statistics of the major denominations in Christianity showed that many of them were decreasing in number. It is not easy to bring the gospel to a typical sinner who lives in the United States because the people have been complicated and occupied with religion, philosophy, or logic. The little increase that some of the denominations had was mostly from people who were already Christians and who joined them. I realized from this situation that we had to have a new way to go on.</p>
<p>In 1937 in Shanghai, Brother Nee spoke to us the messages which are now in <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em> In that fellowship Brother Nee pointed out the way to meet according to 1 Corinthians 14:26. This verse says that when the whole church comes together, each one has something. The word &ldquo;has&rdquo; is used five times in this verse&mdash;&ldquo;each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.&rdquo; When speaking of this verse, Brother Nee used the word &ldquo;mutuality.&rdquo; A church meeting is not a meeting where only one speaks and the others listen. This is only one-way traffic without mutuality. The church meeting described in 1 Corinthians 14:26 is full of mutuality. It is a meeting in which all the saints participate by speaking and listening to one another. Even though Brother Nee saw this, we did not find a way to carry it out.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1948 Brother Nee had a long training for four months. One series of messages that he gave is in the book <em>Church Affairs.</em> In this book he stressed more strongly that there was no need for us to maintain the practice of one man speaking and the rest listening in the church meetings. He said that since the pressure of tradition is very strong, we all need to push against it day after day until it is pushed out of the way. After Brother Nee shared these things in his training, I was sent out of mainland China to Taiwan in the spring of 1949 due to the Communist takeover. From 1949 to 1984 we still did not find a way to practice the meeting of mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26. The conclusion of my four-year study in Taipei beginning in 1984 is that we must cooperate with the Lord to fulfill 1 Corinthians 14:26.</p>
<p>We may think that we have had mutuality in the past since the saints shared and testified after a brother gave a message. This is better than what is practiced in Christianity, but very few of our testimonies in these meetings could have been considered as prophesying. To prophesy is to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, to speak the Lord into others, that is, to minister Christ into people&rsquo;s being. This is the dispensing of Christ. Thus, to prophesy, in the New Testament sense, is to dispense Christ into people&rsquo;s inner man. To prophesy is not to speak an ordinary word. Prophesying is a divine oracle. In the past we considered that speaking in tongues, prophesying, and healing were miraculous gifts, but we did not realize that prophesying requires learning. We have to desire, seek, and learn to prophesy. When we prophesy, it is so that others may learn (14:31). This indicates that we, the ones who prophesy, have to learn first. If we did not learn something, we would not be able to speak something for others to learn.</p>
<p>After much study and consideration, I was led to the conclusion that prophesying is not absolutely miraculous, but it is a miraculous normality. On the one hand, it is normal. On the other hand, it is miraculous because it is speaking with the divine element. To prophesy is to speak for God, to have God&rsquo;s oracle. Some of us may feel that only certain ones can have the oracle of God, but Paul does not agree with this. Paul says that we all can prophesy one by one (14:31). He also said that if we all prophesy, a new one who comes to our meeting will be convicted and judged by all and the secrets of his heart will become manifest. He will fall on his face and worship God, reporting that God is really among us (vv. 24-25).</p>
<p>Prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14 is not in the sense of predicting. Someone who prophesies might speak something like this: &ldquo;Brothers, 1 Corinthians 15:45b says, &lsquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rsquo; Christ, who died in the flesh for our sins, is now in resurrection the life-giving Spirit. Today He is indwelling us to be our life. The Lord Jesus is the life-giving Spirit, and our spirit, created by God, has been regenerated by this Spirit. Our spirit and the life-giving Spirit are now joined as one spirit. The Lord as the Spirit is indwelling us so that we can enjoy Him all the time to live Christ.&rdquo; This kind of speaking is neither a natural utterance nor a prediction. To prophesy in this way is God&rsquo;s oracle, and Paul says that we all can prophesy. In the past we had testimonies in our meetings, but many of them were not the divine speaking. Sometimes, however, a testimony could be the divine speaking. It depends upon the contents of the testimony and the way it is given. If someone gives a testimony, even of himself, in a spiritual, divine way, that is prophesying. A testimony is prophesying when there is some part in it unveiling the divine things concerning God to people.</p>
<p>To prophesy is to speak divinely, to speak something related to God, to speak something of God, and to speak God forth. To prophesy is to speak Christ into others. Let us suppose that one hundred brothers and sisters come together with no definite speaker, and they all exercise to speak Christ into one another for one hour and a half. How wonderful, rich, refreshing, nourishing, and enriching that meeting would be! No matter how good one speaker is, the congregation that he speaks to again and again will become bored of his speaking after a certain period of time.</p>
<p>Have we ever seen a meeting on this earth according to what 1 Corinthians 14:26 describes? I must say that our practice of sharing and testifying after a message has not been the practice of 1 Corinthians 14:26. In our meetings in the past in which there was testifying after a message, there was a little bit of mutuality, but not the mutuality that is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26. Some said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, this is not the new way. We did this already.&rdquo; What we did, however, was in a natural way, not in a revealed way. The way that the Lord has revealed to us in 1 Corinthians 14:26 is a way that we have never driven before. This is a new way.</p>
<p>When I went back to Taiwan in 1984, I illustrated our need to take a new way by using the improvement in our means of transportation on this earth. The God-created earth cannot be changed, but the means of transportation on the earth has been changed and improved again and again. If we do not have a change, we are behind the times. We cannot change the truth of the Scriptures, the Lord Jesus, and God&rsquo;s salvation, but we must change the way we minister the word of truth and practice the church life to the scriptural way, the God-ordained way, which is the best way. We must endeavor to have meetings on this earth that are according to 1 Corinthians 14:26. We have to learn. Just because a person can move his fingers on a piano does not mean that he knows how to play it. In order to learn how to play the piano properly, a person must have years of instruction. If we do not learn, how can we carry out the Lord&rsquo;s present move?</p>
<p>In the traditional practice of Christianity, a newly baptized one simply enters into the congregation to sit and listen. He is not perfected to speak for the Lord. The members of the congregation do not have to endeavor or learn anything. They simply hire a pastor who is eloquent, who can tell good stories and give good illustrations. The Sunday morning service is a place for them to relax and listen to a choir and a good speaker. They listen for years without learning and being perfected to speak themselves. This situation is not according to what Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 14. He encourages all of us to prophesy for the building up of the church. Do we really like Paul? We may say that we love Paul, but deep within we may feel that Paul is too hard on us, that he is over-burdening us. Someone who works hard for a living may think that he needs a rest at the end of the week. Instead of being charged to speak, he feels that he should be able to rest in the meeting. Just as doctors and lawyers are trained specifically for their jobs, he may feel that certain ones should be trained to be speakers. Then he can come to the meetings and enjoy listening. Paul, however, tells us that we should practice our meetings according to 1 Corinthians 14:26. He tells us to desire earnestly to prophesy and to seek that we may excel to the building up of the church.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:26 as a part of the holy Word needs to be fulfilled for the Body of Christ to be built up. The congregational way of one speaking and the rest listening cannot build up the Body of Christ. Where on this earth can we see the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ? Without this organic building, the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy in Matthew 16:18 cannot be fulfilled, and the church as the bride cannot be made ready for Christ as the Bridegroom. Some have advised me not to labor so hard at my age. One saint told me that whatever I had spoken concerning the new way is scriptural, but he did not believe it could be worked out. But within me was the thought, &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t do this, how can I go to see the Lord?&rdquo; Others told me that since I began to talk about the new way in 1984, the churches have been decreasing and the condition of the churches has been going down. They told me that I needed to reconsider my way. Despite all the criticisms and hardships, I have to take care of the commission that I have received from the Lord. My burden is to pass on His word so that at least a small number of Jesus lovers would take His word and get into it. Then the Lord Jesus will have a way on this earth. I do not care about the criticisms. I care that one day I will stand before the Lord. I must care for my inner burden from the Lord.</p>
<p>When we become old, it is hard for us to have a change and learn something new. Many companies and big corporations like to hire young college graduates because they are open to learning new things. In my youth I learned to use the abacus. When the adding machine was invented, the abacus became outdated because it was much slower and less efficient. Some people gave adding machines to me as gifts, but I never used them. I still like to use my old wooden abacus. In this matter I do not want to give up my old habit to have a change. It is also hard for an older person to learn how to use a computer because he may not want to have a change. There are a number of saints who have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for many years. They have been faithful and diligent, and they have endeavored for the recovery in those years. They may have been fresh with the Lord twenty years ago, but now that they are older, they do not like to have a change. Many of the young people in the recovery, on the other hand, have been so glad to take the Lord&rsquo;s new way.</p>
<p>Christianity has taken the lead to go the easy way, but the new way to practice the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery is the way of labor. Who likes to climb up a high mountain? We all like to take the easy way. The preaching of the gospel in the traditional way is according to the natural way, not by the way that is revealed in the Bible. This is because the natural way is easy. The traditional way of meeting with one man speaking and the rest listening is also according to the natural way. No one wants to practice 1 Corinthians 14:26 because it requires much labor.</p>
<p>In order for 1 Corinthians 14 to be realized among us, the co-workers and elders need to labor because all the saints need to be instructed. They have to learn, and they need some tutors. Ephesians 4 tells us that the Head, Christ, gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers for the perfecting of the saints (vv. 11-12). Perfecting means equipping and furnishing. Have we ever practiced the perfecting of the saints? This is a new way that we must take. Today my eyes have been opened more than ever to see that we need the gifts&rsquo; perfecting of the saints.</p>
<p>Even the evangelists are for the perfecting of the saints. This indicates that we need some particular perfecting and instruction in order to preach the gospel in a proper way. If someone is going to play the piano properly, he needs to be perfected, instructed, taught, and trained. The saints needing the evangelists to perfect them indicates that preaching the gospel should not be done in a natural way. It has to be carried out under the proper instruction and by learning. Which preachers in the denominations are perfecting the saints to do the preaching? Even among us it is hard to see this, yet we may charge the saints to go out to preach the gospel. If they are not perfected to preach the gospel, they will preach in a natural way. Even we ourselves are not so clear about the proper way to preach the gospel. If we do not know how to play the piano properly, how can we perfect others to do it? Likewise, if we do not know how to preach the gospel properly, how can we perfect others to preach? This is our situation today, and this is why I am burdened to the uttermost.</p>
<p>We must turn from the old, traditional way of meeting and serving to the new, scriptural way. To turn anything from one way to another way will involve some loss at first. To remodel a building, you have to suffer some loss initially. Eventually, however, the remodeled building is worth this initial loss. In taking the new way, we have to do our best to limit our loss by not going quickly but gradually and positively. In Taipei, we worked for thirty-seven months before we stopped having church meetings with one man speaking a message. If we would have stopped this immediately or too quickly, we would have suffered much loss. We turned to the new way of meeting according to 1 Corinthians 14:26 after we labored much to fully prepare the church.</p>
<p>The church should be organic in everything and in every aspect. A robot is mechanical with nothing organic, but a person is a living, moving, functioning organism with a body that is totally organic. Christ is a living person and His Body is absolutely organic. Our gospel preaching may be according to the trained way, but we may still need some arrangement. Without arrangement, no one may go out to preach the gospel. This is not organic. We have to endeavor and train the saints until they arrive at a state in which they will be organically burdened to go out. Then there will be no need of any arrangement by the church. The saints will have an organic feeling to go out to reach people and get them baptized. Without any need of organization or arrangement, the saints will have the burden to go to the homes of the new believers to take care of them. Furthermore, they will have the burden to take care of the small group meetings organically, and they will have the organic motive to function, to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, in the church meetings.</p>
<p>We have to realize that we are far behind the biblical revelation in our practice of the church life. Twenty-six years ago, I came to the United States with a burden to bring the Lord&rsquo;s recovery here, but the saints came into a recovery that was still, to a certain extent, remaining in tradition. Now we have seen that we must take the new way, the scriptural way, to practice His present recovery. We must learn to preach the gospel not by the natural way but by the biblical, revealed way. We also have to meet, to come together, not by the traditional way but by the way according to 1 Corinthians 14:26.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO PROPHESY</h2>
<p>To meet according to 1 Corinthians 14:26, we must desire and learn to prophesy. Prophesying is so that others may learn; hence, to prophesy requires learning. If we say something for others to learn, we have to learn first. We learn to prophesy through experiences. We have to love the Lord, live Him, and enjoy Him. We also learn to prophesy by being equipped with the Word (2 Tim. 3:16-17). We must get into the Word and become saturated with the Word until we are one with the Word. To learn to prophesy we need to pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17-20). We need to pray ourselves into the Spirit. This kind of unceasing prayer will keep us in the Spirit all the time. We must be in the Spirit; otherwise, we cannot have God&rsquo;s oracle. We must be in the Spirit; otherwise, we cannot speak something divine. We learn to prophesy by living and walking by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25). We also learn to prophesy by practicing. Our learning to prophesy is for attending the meeting of mutuality to fulfill 1 Corinthians 14:26.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPHESYING LIFE</h2>
<p>If we are going to prophesy, we need to live a prophesying life. First, we need to be revived every morning (Prov. 4:18; Lam. 3:22-24; Psa. 119:147-148). Proverbs 4:18 says, &ldquo;But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day&rdquo; (ASV). The way of the just is like the dawn that becomes brighter and brighter until noontime. Every twenty-four hours there is a new start, a dawn, a rising sun. This is according to the natural law in God&rsquo;s creation. We have to go along with this natural law. Every morning, we have to rise early to contact the Lord, to call on Him, and to be revived by Him. In Lamentations 3:22-24, Jeremiah says that the Lord&rsquo;s mercies are fresh and new every morning. His mercies are like the fresh dew in the morning. Every morning we must enjoy this fresh dew to have a new start, a morning revival.</p>
<p>In addition to being revived every morning, we must also live an overcoming life every day (Rev. 21:7). After the morning revival, we should not stop contacting the Lord. We can live a victorious life by fellowshipping with the Lord moment by moment (1 John 1:6). We also need to walk according to spirit (Rom. 8:4b), not doing anything outside of the Spirit. We should also speak the word (the Lord) all the time. Paul charged Timothy to preach the word in season and out of season (2 Tim. 4:2a). We should not say, &ldquo;Now is not the time for me to speak to people.&rdquo; Seemingly it is out of season, but even if it is out of season, we still have to speak the word. Such a prophesying life qualifies us to prophesy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREPARING TO PROPHESY</h2>
<p>In Taipei we gave the saints some practical fellowship concerning how to prepare to prophesy in the church meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Every week they will cover a chapter of a certain book of the Bible and divide this chapter into six portions for six days. In each section for each day, they choose two or three verses for pray-reading, and they enjoy the Lord with these verses for their morning revival. We charged the saints to write down a short reminder of what the Lord inspired them with in their time with Him in the morning. At the end of the week, they will have six notes of what they were inspired with during the week. On Saturday night they use these notes of their inspiration to compose a prophecy to speak for three minutes. Then they practice it in their homes. They are instructed not to be too long or too short. When they go to the church meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, they have something, thus fulfilling the Lord&rsquo;s word in 1 Corinthians 14:26&mdash; &ldquo;each one has.&rdquo; They do not trust merely in instant inspiration, but they come to the meeting prepared with the riches of Christ that they have enjoyed. Certain brothers who may be considered as &ldquo;tutors&rdquo; will spend time with a number of the saints after they have spoken on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to give them more help, adjustment, and perfection. The saints need to be perfected to enjoy the Lord, to be saturated with the Word, to pray unceasingly, to fellowship with the Lord moment by moment, to walk in the Spirit, and to speak the Lord in the Spirit at all times. Then they need to learn how to compose a prophecy for the church meetings. I hope that we all would try to practice this for our church meetings.</p>
<p>If only fifteen out of fifty saints prophesy in a meeting of the church, that meeting will be in the third heavens. This is what the Lord desires. Regardless of how long a message is or how good it is, it only covers one main item. But when fifteen prophesy, different points will be covered. This prophesying will touch people&rsquo;s problems in a particular way. Such speaking will not only nourish the saints but also build them up. When one person speaks, only what he has experienced of the riches of Christ is released. When fifteen people speak, the riches of Christ come out of fifteen sources and fifteen portions of Christ are ministered.</p>
<p>I want to repeat again that we should not make a quick change from the old way of one man speaking to the new way of &ldquo;each one has.&rdquo; On the one hand, we have to remain in the old way to keep the saints. On the other hand, we have to take the time to train them and educate them in order to bring them into a full realization that the Lord today needs His saints to meet according to 1 Corinthians 14:26. Our teaching will stir up their appetite, and they will begin to desire to prophesy. They will seek to excel to the building up of the church. By this way I believe the entire church in our place, maybe within one year, will gradually have a radical change.</p>
<p>We have seen a clear view from the Lord concerning how to preach the gospel and how to have church meetings. We are still not completely clear regarding how to have the home meetings and small group meetings because the New Testament does not say much about this. We do know, though, from the Scriptures that the home meetings and small group meetings are greatly needed (Acts 2:46; 5:42; 12:12). First Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4:11-16 give us a clear view regarding how to have the church meetings. We need to cooperate with the Lord and labor together with Him to see these portions of the Word fulfilled for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THROUGH EVERY JOINT OF THE RICH SUPPLY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:11-16</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for this gathering, and we thank You for Your cleansing. We need the cleansing of Your precious blood. Lord, have mercy upon us and unveil Yourself to us. Open up the heavens to us. Lord, give us a clear sky that we all may see something in the heavens, something on Your heart, and something in Your Spirit. Lord, bring us all into this vision, and grant us the rich anointing. Give us the word, the instant utterance, the very expression, that can minister Yourself with Your ministry into the saints. Lord, speak a word to each one of us and unveil the mystery of Yourself, of Your plan, of Your economy, and of Your Body to all of us. Lord, be one with us in our speaking. We trust in You, and we trust especially in Your mercy. Amen.</p>
<p>In chapters one and two, we saw that prophesying is the excelling gift for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ. In this chapter we want to see that all the Body of Christ causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself through every joint of the rich supply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The New Testament shows us a very particular matter&mdash; the building up of the organic Body of Christ. The Lord does not desire to build up a congregation or an organization. He wants to build up a particular thing that is altogether organic. God&rsquo;s creation is full of things that are types, figures, and shadows of the spiritual, heavenly things which are difficult to describe. Our human body typifies the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:4-5). A wooden stand is a collection of pieces of wood put together in an organizational way, but our physical body is an organism that is altogether organic. If a table gets damaged, the damage will remain unless it is fixed, but if our body gets damaged in a certain way, it will heal itself organically. A table can be repaired, but it cannot be healed. Our body, on the other hand, heals itself again and again. Often we may be worried about the church&rsquo;s condition. Whenever I exercised my mind to worry about the church, however, the Lord always rebuked me. He told me that I did not need to worry because the church is His Body and it will heal itself. The church is the very Body of Christ, the organism of the Triune God. In today&rsquo;s organized Christianity, the Body of Christ cannot be seen. What can be seen is many congregations, but not an organism. We must admit that even among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we cannot see much of the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God. This is why I am desperately burdened. About thirty years ago, my burden was primarily to release the word concerning the divine Spirit and the human spirit. Today my burden is the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-16 is a portion of the Word covering this organic building. Verses 11 and 12 say that Christ has given some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ. The work of the ministry is the building up of the Body of Christ. Verses 15 and 16 say: &ldquo;But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; In both verse 12 and verse 16, the building up of the Body of Christ is mentioned. The Body is built not only by the gifted ones&rsquo; perfecting of the saints and by the functioning of the perfected saints but also by the growth of the Body. The Body has to grow. The growth of the Body results in the building up of the Body. All the Body causes the growth of the Body. Have we seen the growth of the Body in our locality? Many of us may not care for this. We may not care for this in the way that we meet, serve, and work. We may like to see a very &ldquo;splendid&rdquo; meeting that is splendid in size, in appearance, in order, in singing, in praying, in praising, in sharing, and in testimonies, but do we care for the genuine growth of the Body?</p>
<p>The fundamental denominations try to get capable pastors who are eloquent speakers full of knowledge of history and of other things. Such speakers are able to give wonderful messages that make people happy. As a result of this, their congregations grow. Perhaps their congregations grow from five hundred to one thousand, from one thousand to three thousand, and from three thousand to ten thousand. If this good speaker is suddenly taken away by the Lord, however, his congregation will decrease and decrease. This shows that a congregation was built up, but not the organic Body of Christ. What would be the result if all of the Sunday morning meetings in Christianity were stopped? Many would enjoy worldly entertainments and satisfy their fleshly lusts. These ones were not built up in an organic way. I believe, however, that the day is coming when the Lord will have something totally organic on this earth instead of a congregation. Thousands of saints in city after city will be busy in praising, singing, prophesying, and preaching the gospel. We need to ask ourselves how organic we are today. If we closed the door of our meeting hall for six months, what would be the result? This is proof that there has not been much of the organic building up of the Body of Christ among us.</p>
<p>The unscriptural, traditional way of meeting and serving from Christianity has been existing on this earth for many years. When people think of Christianity, they think of a church building with a big congregation and a good pastor as the speaker. This is the traditional way to worship, serve, work, and exist in Christianity. In Rome during the second or third century, the Christians did not meet in the congregational way. They met secretly underground in the catacombs. Probably there has never been as much genuine worship of the Lord as from those saints who met in the catacombs. My point is this&mdash;we must get out of our traditional concept. We do not realize how much we have been kept away from the real vision presented in Ephesians 4.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4 tells us that the Lord gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers. According to our thinking, an apostle establishes churches with elders, a prophet speaks for the Lord, an evangelist has campaigns for the preaching of the gospel, and the shepherd-teachers shepherd and teach the saints. However, Ephesians 4:11-12 says that these gifted persons are for the perfecting of the saints. How much perfecting has there been among us? In Ephesians 4 Paul gives us the teaching of the perfecting of the saints, and in Acts 20 there is a record of how he perfected the saints. After establishing the churches and appointing the elders in them, he went back to visit them and wrote epistles to them. He stayed in the church in Ephesus continually for three years (Acts 20:31). Within those three years, Paul said he taught them publicly (no doubt, in a bigger meeting) and from house to house (v. 20). He admonished each one of the saints night and day with tears (v. 31). He said that he declared to them everything that was profitable (v. 20), that is, all the counsel of God (v. 27). Surely he talked a great deal about God&rsquo;s economy. Not only did he write concerning the Body of Christ in the book of Ephesians, but he also should have taught this to the Ephesian saints publicly in big meetings and in their homes. &ldquo;From house to house&rdquo; means &ldquo;according to houses.&rdquo; Paul taught according to houses, which means that he taught in all the homes of the Ephesians, admonishing each one of them with tears.</p>
<p>There might be a little visitation in Christianity and among us, but how much vision concerning the things of God has been ministered to the saints? I would say there has been very little. Some of us may have some vision, but how much perfecting work has been going on among us? The co-workers and the elders must be honest with themselves. We may have visited the saints a little, but we did very little perfecting. We may have preached the gospel to bring new people in, but we did not continue our work in the perfecting of the saints. This perfecting results in the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12) and the operation in measure of each one part (v. 16). It is very hard for all the dear brothers and sisters to speak, to function, in a meeting. Paul, however, points out that when the gifted persons perfect the saints, the saints will be perfected, issuing in every member, each one part, operating in his or her measure.</p>
<p>Each member of our physical body, no matter how small it is, has a measure. Today, however, there are many members of the Body of Christ who will admit that the pastors have a measure but will not admit that they have a measure. We need to realize that all of us as members of the Body of Christ have a measure and that we all need to operate according to our measure. If there is no operation of each one part, each member of the Body, how can the Body be built up? When the members of the Body operate, the Body grows. The Body grows by each member operating in its measure. A person&rsquo;s feet have to operate in their measure for his physical body to grow properly. If his feet do not operate, he is crippled and the growth of his body has been greatly damaged. If his physical body is to grow adequately, every member of his body has to operate. If I am not able to walk for three days, I will feel sick. The more I walk, the stronger I become. If an older person does not &ldquo;operate&rdquo; in this way, he is dying. While I am walking, I am struggling to live. If I do not move, or operate, I will die. Many Christians today are not living but dying. If all the members of the Body are dying, how can the Body grow, resulting in its building up? There is no possibility.</p>
<p>We all have to wake up. We need a change of mind. We have been drugged to the uttermost by Christianity. We have been poisoned, but we do not have the consciousness that we have been poisoned. We have been covered with a heavy, foggy, and smoggy situation. We need to get out of this. Many Christians are dying, yet with no consciousness that they are dying. What a deceit to the Christians on this earth! This is why I am so burdened. I would like to share something with you to make you happy, to &ldquo;sing a melody&rdquo; to you, but the vision that I have received does not allow me to do that. It only allows me to study more and to pray more for you. All of us need to wake up.</p>
<p>I believe that among us there are a number of apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, but these gifted ones did not do the proper work. In other words, these gifted ones have not done the work of perfecting the saints. We have the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers, but where is the perfecting? We have very little perfecting among us. We have to rise up to do the perfecting work. We must learn of Paul by visiting the homes to teach the saints. Many of us are very rich, but we do not exercise to use our riches to perfect others. Thousands of saints and new ones are waiting to be perfected, but who will do this work?</p><h2 class="head1">BEING PERFECTED AND<br />
PERFECTING OTHERS TO PROPHESY</h2>
<p>In chapters one and two, I talked about prophesying as the excelling gift for the building up of the Body of Christ. I also spoke of our need to desire and learn to prophesy. I am concerned, however, that you may have forgotten this fellowship. I also feel that some who are endeavoring to prophesy have not prophesied adequately. We need to be perfected to prophesy. First Corinthians 14 stresses and uplifts prophesying. It is considered as the excelling gift, the top gift, for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ. Prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14 is a speaking that builds up, encourages, consoles, convicts, and judges (vv. 3, 24). Prophesying is not ordinary speaking. It is speaking for the Lord and with the Lord.</p>
<p>Anyone can speak in a general way, but to prophesy, to speak the Lord forth, comprises three elements. First, we must learn the holy Word. We must gain the proper knowledge concerning God and concerning the things of God through the knowledge of the holy Word. We have to study the Bible. Second, we must have the instant inspiration of the Holy Spirit. This implies that we must be persons who are always communicating with the Lord, who are living in the Lord&rsquo;s fellowship. As long as our fellowship with the Lord is cut off, we can never have the instant, living inspiration of the Holy Spirit. We must be persons living in the fellowship of the Lord all day long. All day long we should be enjoying the current of the Spirit. As persons abiding in the Lord in fellowship with Him, we can have the inspiration of the Spirit at any time. Third, we must have a vision concerning God&rsquo;s interest, the churches&rsquo; condition, our condition, and others&rsquo; condition. We must have a vision concerning the world, concerning the sinners, concerning God&rsquo;s people, concerning the church as the Body of Christ, and concerning ourselves. To prophesy, we need to have a clear vision to see through all things in all situations. When our eyes are open and the sky above us is clear, we can speak what we see with the word of the Bible under the inspiration of the Spirit. This is what it means to prophesy. This divine speaking ministers Christ as life to others. When we speak in this way, we have the Word and the Spirit, and out of the Word and the Spirit, we have the authority and the power. To prophesy, we need the human element of learning the Word and the divine element of the inspiration of the Holy Spirit plus a clear view.</p>
<p>Luke 1 is a record of three persons prophesying: Elizabeth, Mary, and Zachariah. Mary&rsquo;s prophecy is full of quotations from the Old Testament. Mary was very familiar with the Old Testament, and she spoke with what she had learned from the Old Testament. She also had the inspiration from God and she saw something. She was in a condition to receive the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to speak with a clear view. Elizabeth and Zachariah were the same. They all had learned the Word, they had the divine inspiration, and they had a seeing of the situation. Thus, their speaking was prophesying.</p>
<p>If we really mean business to practice prophesying, we must first spend our time and energy to study the holy Word. Isaiah was an Old Testament prophet who wrote a long book of sixty-six chapters. Most of what Isaiah spoke in his book is not foretelling, or predicting. Most of the book of Isaiah is prophesying in the sense of speaking for the Lord, speaking forth the Lord, and speaking the Lord into people. In his rebuking of Israel, for example, there are many quotations from the law of Moses. This proves that he surely studied the Pentateuch to the uttermost. When he saw the situation among the Israelites, he rebuked them, not with his own word but with the word he had learned of Moses in the first five books of the Bible. No doubt, when he was speaking, he was under the inspiration of the Spirit. Thus, Isaiah had learned the Word, he had the divine inspiration, and he had a clear view. Then whatever he spoke was his prophesying, his speaking for the Lord, his speaking forth the Lord.</p>
<p>We must practice this fellowship in order to learn to prophesy. If we practice this fellowship, we will be perfected unto the work of the ministry. In other words, we will be perfected to prophesy for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ. Then we have to go to others to perfect them. If we all do this, all of us will become prophets. How good it would be for all the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to be prophets in this way! Some of the sisters may wonder whether or not they can do such a work. In the Old Testament, there were both male and female prophets (Exo. 15:20; Judg. 4:4; 2 Kings 22:14), and according to the New Testament, women can prophesy (1 Cor. 11:5; Acts 2:17-18; 21:9). This is why Paul says that when the whole church comes together, all can prophesy (1 Cor. 14:31). Both the brothers and the sisters can prophesy. I hope that we would receive the perfecting fellowship in this chapter and practice it. Then we can go to others with this fellowship and perfect them from house to house the way the Apostle Paul did.</p>
<p>Recently I called a certain leading brother early in the morning. I was a little fearful of calling him so early, but when I called he was not home. He had gone to another brother&rsquo;s home to have morning watch. When I heard that, my fearfulness turned to happiness. It would be wonderful if we could go to another brother&rsquo;s home every morning to have morning watch with him and teach him how to perfect others. If all the saints are perfected in this way, the church will be full of functions. The Body growing through &ldquo;the operation in measure of each one part,&rdquo; mentioned in Ephesians 4:16, will be fulfilled. Then it will be so easy to get someone saved and keep him. Right after you baptize him, you can go to have morning watch with him the next morning.</p>
<p>We all need to visit people with the gospel and visit the new ones and the other saints for their perfecting. We have the holy Word in our hand and the Holy Spirit within us. When we work together with the Lord to visit others, the Word becomes living, and the Spirit exercises authority and power over people. We need to go out to save people and to nourish them, to teach them, to perfect them. By this way, the church will always be growing. Today, however, not many of us will go out to perfect others. We have much knowledge in our mind concerning the Word, but we do not use it. We have the Holy Spirit within us, but we do not exercise our spirit. As a result, we see more of a congregation among us than the living Body of Christ. If we all would practice the fellowship in this chapter and then go to perfect others, what a marvelous situation there would be in the churches. All of the churches are full of people who need perfecting. Who is going to do it? If all of us pick up the burden to go and perfect others, the condition of the churches will be changed after two months.</p>
<p>The Lord gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherd-teachers for the perfecting of the saints unto, resulting in, issuing in, the work of the ministry. God has only one ministry today on this earth. This is the unique New Testament ministry for the purpose of building up the Body of Christ. To do the work of the ministry, we need to practice prophesying. If we are going to prophesy, we must learn the Word day by day to get familiar with the holy Word. We must also fellowship with the Lord, remaining in His fellowship. This means that we are always in the current of the Spirit, so at any time we can have the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. If we are such persons, our eyes will be opened. The sky above us will be clear, and we will have a clear view of the entire universe. We will always see the real situation of the world, the real situation of the churches, the real situation of our fellow believers, and the real situation of ourselves. Thus, we will always have something to speak about. When we have these three elements&mdash;the human learning of the Word, the divine inspiration of the Spirit, and the clear view&mdash;we will be able to prophesy. Because I have these three elements, I have a lot to say to the saints in the ministry of the Word.</p>
<p>If we put these points into practice, it will be easy for us to prophesy. After two weeks of practicing, we can pick up the burden to perfect others. After another two weeks, the ones that we perfect will be able to do the same thing, and they will perfect others. Then the churches will be filled with this kind of living perfecting. After two months of such activity, the churches will be revived and stirred up.</p>
<p>A portion of the Word like Ephesians 4:11-16 altogether needs some practice. All of us need to rise up to perfect the saints. We should not say that we are not apostles or prophets. If we practice the fellowship in this chapter, we will get ourselves perfected, and we will become apostles or prophets. It is not that difficult. The grace is in the Word and in the Spirit. We have the Word in our hand and the Spirit within us, so we can practice according to the biblical way. We will see the easiness in taking this way and the rich result. I have the full assurance that this is the Lord&rsquo;s way. I hope that we all would receive the perfecting word in this chapter.</p>
<p>Many saints among us are the joints of the rich supply. They have been gifted, but they need perfecting. After being perfected, they will function to prophesy, and they will go to perfect others. The joints, the gifts, perfect the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12). Then all the members hold to truth in love and grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things (v. 15). Out from the Head all the Body is joined closely together and knit together through every joint of the rich supply. This causes the growth of the Body through the operation in measure of each one part unto the building up of the Body in love (v. 16).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THROUGH THE OPERATION IN MEASURE<br />
OF EACH ONE PART</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:11-16</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to have more fellowship concerning how the Body of Christ causes itself to grow unto the building up of itself. We saw in chapter three that the first means by which all the Body causes the growth of the Body is every joint of the rich supply. In this chapter we want to go on to see that the Body grows and is built up also through the operation in measure of each one part.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PERFECTING THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-16 is a very particular portion of the holy Word. It tells us that the ascended Christ in all His qualifications and in His position as the Head in the heavens, gave His church some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers. The terms apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are very particular. Before the church came into being, there were not terms such as apostles and evangelists. When we read such a portion of the Word today, we may take it for granted. Actually, we may understand very little.</p>
<p>These verses mainly unveil to us that the ascended Head gave some apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers for the perfecting of the saints. According to our concept, the apostles were given merely for the establishment of the churches, the prophets for speaking the Lord, the evangelists for the preaching of the gospel, and the shepherd-teachers for shepherding and teaching the saints. Although this is true, Paul emphasizes that these gifted ones were given for the same thing&mdash;the perfecting of the saints. If a person who desires to serve the Lord wants to know what he should do, he must listen to the Apostle Paul. Paul still speaks to us today in his Epistles. If we are going to serve the Lord, we must perfect the saints.</p>
<p>To perfect is to make perfect or complete. A newly saved and baptized one is altogether not perfect or complete, so he needs some perfecting, some completing. To perfect the saints you have to teach them, to instruct them, to equip them, and to furnish them. When people join the military service, they are perfected. Because they do not have any knowledge about fighting, they are not perfect or complete in this matter. In order to defend their country, they need to be perfected, or completed, in fighting. The military instructs and disciplines them. They are also equipped with weapons and furnished with supplies to fight. After this perfecting by the military, they are qualified to fight.</p>
<p>A young man who is nineteen years old does not know anything about fighting, so he is not perfect or complete. In the same way, a new believer does not know anything about the Christian life, so he is not perfect or complete either. He was a heathen, but through the saints&rsquo; preaching, he believed and was baptized. In the sense of being a Christian, however, he is full of defects and shortages. He does not know who God is or what Christ&rsquo;s redemption is. He is like a newborn babe who has just been delivered. From the time that a newborn child is delivered, he needs perfecting. It takes about eighteen years for parents to perfect a child until he is full-grown. Every mother and father wants to hear their child say &ldquo;ma ma&rdquo; and &ldquo;da da.&rdquo; After speaking these words to their babe again and again, he spontaneously and organically begins to address his mother and father in this way. Their little child begins to speak this according to his gift, his talent, by birth. This gift by birth, however, needs some instruction. The mother needs to say &ldquo;ma ma&rdquo; again and again to her child until he is able to say it. This is the perfecting of the child. To perfect is to make perfect, to make complete.</p>
<p>Because we love the Lord, we desire to serve the Lord. To serve the Lord we have to follow Paul&rsquo;s pattern to preach the gospel and to perfect others. Even if we were just saved, we can go to preach the gospel because we have been perfected to lead people to Christ. We saw how someone knocked on our door. We heard what he said to us, and we can repeat that. We saw how we were led to pray and believe in the gospel, and we saw how we were baptized.</p>
<p>If you have just been saved you know at least four points. First, you know about visiting others with the gospel by knocking on their doors. Second, you know how to tell people that Jesus is the Son of God and our Savior. Third, you know how to lead people to call on the name of the Lord and pray. Fourth, you know how to baptize people after they have received the Lord. After this, you need to perfect the ones that you have led to the Lord. Because we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have not risen up to perfect others, the Lord has been delayed. After being saved, not many Christians endeavor to perfect others because they themselves have not received the perfecting. We should not take the excuse that we do not know that much.</p>
<p>We need to be impressed that we Christians, in general, do not function to perfect others because of tradition. Many were saved in big congregations through the preaching of a good speaker. Most do not have the ability to be a top speaker and to carry out an altar call, but this is the pattern of preaching that they saw at their salvation. On the one hand, they received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, but on the other hand, they received a pattern that killed their function. After a person gets saved in this way, he may love the Lord very much, but he has not received the perfecting to preach the gospel. He can only invite his friends to a big meeting to hear someone else preach the gospel. The functions of the believers have been killed by the traditional way of meeting and serving.</p>
<p>The beginning of Paul&rsquo;s ministry is recorded in Acts 13. When he went to Asia Minor, he went to the synagogues to take advantage of the Jews&rsquo; gathering there. This shows us that in order to save people, we need to go to them where they are. This is why we go to visit people by knocking on their doors. We are going to them where they are to bring the gospel to them. When we knock on someone&rsquo;s door, preach the gospel to him, and lead him to believe and be baptized, he will be impressed that this is the way to preach the gospel, to bring sinners to Christ. Immediately after a new one is baptized, we need to instruct him. We may say: &ldquo;Now you are my brother because we have the same divine life. I am a child of God and so are you. I am organic and so are you. I am living and so are you. I would now like to go with you to knock on other people&rsquo;s doors to preach to them.&rdquo; From the very time a new one is baptized, we can instruct him to practice what he has seen of us. He will do it because this will be what he has seen. He will function according to the pattern that has been presented to him. The traditional way of preaching the gospel kills the functions of the believers. It is a threat to them because they think that they need to be good speakers to preach the gospel. We must totally abandon the traditional way of meeting and serving and come back to the scriptural way to meet and to serve for the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The way that God wants His people to carry out His economy is revealed in Ephesians 4:11-16. The ascended Head gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers to His church to do one thing&mdash;to perfect the saints. To perfect the saints is to instruct them, to equip them, to furnish them, making them perfect and complete, that they may do the unique work of the unique New Testament ministry. The work of the New Testament ministry is not to build up anything organizational, a congregation, but something organic, the Body of Christ. To perfect the saints is an organic work.</p><h2 class="head1">HOLDING TO TRUTH</h2>
<p>To perfect the saints, we have to help them hold to truth (Eph. 4:15), to hold to the real and true things in this universe. The entire universe is vanity. Everything is vain and empty. Only God, Christ, and the organic Body of Christ are real. We need to hold to these three things. When we leave the truth and pay attention to things other than God, Christ, and the Body of Christ, there will be problems. If we hold to truth, however, we will grow. This means that we will have more of Christ added into us. To have more of Christ added into us means that we are growing not only in Christ but also into Christ in all things. Although we are saved, in many things we are still not in Christ. Instead, we are outside of Him. We have to grow up into Him in all things. We should not touch, do, or speak anything that is not in Christ. We must have Christ increasingly added into us so that we may have the growth in Christ as life. Gradually, little by little, we grow up into Christ, taking Him as the Head, in item after item, in all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE JOINTS OF THE RICH SUPPLY<br />
AND EACH ONE PART</h2>
<p>Out from the Head, the whole Body of Christ causes the growth of the Body through two means: the first category of the members of Christ and the second category of the members of Christ. The first category of members is the gifted ones&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers; and the second category is &ldquo;each one part&rdquo; (Eph. 4:16). Paul refers to the gifted ones as the joints of the rich supply. I would like to ask, &ldquo;Are you in the first category of members, the gifted members of Christ?&rdquo; Some in the churches are definitely in this category, while others are in this category to some extent. Still others may say that they are definitely not in this first category. They may say this only temporarily, however. They cannot say this forever. Today you may not be an apostle, but in a short time you may be perfected to be able to do what an apostle does. A professor at a teachers&rsquo; college perfects his students to do what he does. While the student is studying, he is in the process of becoming a teacher, so he is a teacher to some extent. Many of us may be in the &ldquo;student stage,&rdquo; but after a certain amount of perfecting, we will become the &ldquo;teachers.&rdquo; A gifted person such as a prophet should not only speak forth the Lord but also perfect the saints. All of us have to rise up to perfect the saints.</p>
<p>The gifted persons are the joints of the rich supply. Our physical body is full of joints. Each one of our fingers, for example, has joints. The ability, the capability, and the strength to do things comes from our joints. If my arm did not have joints, it would be very difficult to perform the simplest of tasks. Our legs are jointed legs. If they were not jointed, it would be difficult for us to move. The joints enable our body to operate. The more that we exercise our joints, the more we operate.</p>
<p>The second category of members is &ldquo;each one part.&rdquo; If we are not in the first category of gifted persons, we are surely in the second category of Christ&rsquo;s members. To be apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers requires some qualifications, but to be parts of the Body does not need qualifications. All the members of our physical body, regardless of how small they are, have a measure. Our little finger has its measure, and the blood within it is circulating all the time. Each part of our physical body has a measure. It is the same with the believers who are the members of the Body of Christ. Each believer has a measure.</p>
<p>The first category of members, the joints, must have the rich supply. The second category of members, each one part, does not need to be qualified with the rich supply. As long as we are members of the Body of Christ, we have a measure. Each one part needs only to operate according to its measure. To visit people with the gospel by knocking on their doors and to come to the meeting to pray are to operate. Do not use the excuse that you do not have the rich supply. As a part of Christ&rsquo;s Body, you have a measure. You can declare: &ldquo;I may not be a joint who has the rich supply, but I am a member of the Body. I am a part of the Body and as a part, I have a measure. I do not know how big my measure is, but I know I have a measure.&rdquo; You can go to visit people as a part with a measure. As parts of the Body, how much have you operated? You may have operated very little because you have been drugged by the traditional way that kills our function.</p>
<p>I have the full confidence that the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery love the Lord. As those who love the Lord, we have to be according to His heart to do His will. His will in the New Testament is unique. It is to build up the Body of Christ. Romans 12:2 says, &ldquo;Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind, that you may prove by testing what the will of God is....&rdquo; In the following verses Paul reveals that the will of God is to have a proper church to be the Body of His Son, Christ. This is the only thing that is on God&rsquo;s heart. Nothing can please Him or make Him happy except the building up of the Body of Christ. Our job, our profession, today on this earth is to operate, to act, to move to build up the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Of course, we need a job to take care of our livelihood, but in our leisure time on weekday evenings and on the weekend, we can operate to build up the Body of Christ by knocking on people&rsquo;s doors to bring them the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. After we baptize them, we can go to them again and again to perfect them. If we could visit a new one twelve times in the first four weeks after he has been saved, he would be greatly established. If we all would do this, what a marvelous situation there would be in the church life, but our real situation is different from this. We have been drugged, influenced, and deformed by the traditions of Christianity. The traditional way of meeting and serving is absolutely different from what is revealed in the Bible.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-16 reveals that the Head has given the gifts, the gifts perfect the saints, and the saints operate. The gifts are the joints acting to perfect the saints. When the joints of our physical body act, they supply the rest of our body. If a person would not move, his body would not get the supply because his joints do not act. When the joints work, they supply. This is why we must exercise in order to be strong. We are either the joints of the rich supply or the parts operating in our measure. As parts of the Body, all of us have a measure, so we can operate. After a long period of operation, the parts will become the joints. Today you may be a part. Eventually after much, much operation, through the operation, you will become a joint.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW THE BODY OF CHRIST CAN BE BUILT UP</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 4:11-16 we can see a clear picture of how the Body of Christ can be built up. It can only be built up by all the Body of Christ causing the growth of the Body. All the Body of Christ is joined closely together and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part. This causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.</p>
<p>The Body is built up by itself through the gifted persons, the joints, and through the other members of the Body, each one part. The joints have the position and the storehouse of Christ&rsquo;s riches, but they still need to act. The other members do not need the rich supply; they only have to operate. When the joints and the parts are functioning, this keeps all the members of the Body living, moving, acting, and operating. Then sinners will be saved, and the saved sinners will be established, nourished, cherished, and perfected. Eventually, all of them will repeat the same thing that we are doing. The practice of the truth in Ephesians 4:11-16 will change the entire scenery of the Christians. I am so insistent because I have seen something real. We need to have a change. We need to be revolutionized. We need to practice to perfect the saints in our locality. After two weeks the saints that we perfect will go to others to perfect them. By this way the whole church will be stirred up.</p>
<p>To be an operating one, we have to be revived every morning. Every day we need to live a victorious life, an overcoming life. Moment by moment we should live in the fellowship of our dear Lord. Then at any time, we can have the inspiration from the divine reality. As such persons, our vision will be keen to see all things and to discern all things. We will always have a clear view. Then we will be able to prophesy, to speak the Lord, at any time it is needed. Such prophesying in our meetings builds up the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We need to consider what the New Testament says concerning the Christian meetings. In the Gospels the one solid verse concerning Christian meetings is Matthew 18:20 where the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;For where two or three are gathered together into My name, there I am in their midst.&rdquo; This may be considered as a small group meeting. The book of Acts shows us how the early believers met. The first twelve chapters of the book of Acts are on Peter&rsquo;s ministry and the last sixteen chapters are on Paul&rsquo;s ministry. In the first twelve chapters, we can see that before the church came into existence, the one hundred twenty were praying for ten days. After ten days on the day of Pentecost, something spectacular occurred, that is, the one hundred twenty were baptized in the Holy Spirit. Peter took the opportunity to stand up with the eleven to speak to the people gathered there and three thousand were saved. That was not a church meeting but something that happened suddenly. Peter took advantage of that gathering to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>On the same day, those three thousand began to meet from house to house, which in Greek means &ldquo;according to houses&rdquo; (Acts 2:46). This shows that there was a meeting in each house. With three thousand people, there were at least four hundred families with four hundred homes. The ones who could help these newly baptized ones were the one hundred twenty. These ones were baptized early in the day. By the one hundred twenty disciples visiting four homes each in the early afternoon, late afternoon, early evening, and late evening, they could have covered four hundred eighty homes. My point is this&mdash;after the one hundred twenty baptized people, they went to perfect them right away. In the past we baptized many people, but not many of them remained because we did not visit them again and again to perfect them. If we did the perfecting work that the one hundred twenty must have done beginning at Pentecost, at least fifty would remain out of two hundred that we baptize.</p>
<p>Acts shows us that the saints did the following things in their homes: they had the Lord&rsquo;s table, they had fellowship, they preached Christ as the gospel, they taught the truths, and they prayed (Acts 2:42, 46; 5:42). The main way for Christians to meet is in the homes. Acts 12 records that when Peter was in prison the church prayed for him (v. 5). When he was released from prison, he went to one of the homes where the saints were praying (v. 12). Surely there were saints in many homes praying for Peter that night, and Peter went to one of them. This shows us that the saints in the early church met in their homes. No verse tells us that the saints prepared a hall or had a schedule of regular meetings. The Scriptures tell us that the three thousand new ones on the day of Pentecost met every day, and they even had the Lord&rsquo;s table daily (Acts 2:46). When Peter was living on this earth, the meetings that he saw were absolutely different from what is seen today in Christianity.</p>
<p>We can also see something concerning the Christian meetings in the last sixteen chapters of Acts covering Paul&rsquo;s ministry. Wherever Paul went, he took advantage of the people&rsquo;s gathering to preach the gospel. He went to the synagogues, not to keep the Jewish worship but to preach the gospel. When a number of people were saved, he formed them into a church. Acts 20 records a meeting of the saints in Troas with the Apostle Paul. When Paul was traveling, he stopped at Troas for seven days. On the first day of the week, the saints had the Lord&rsquo;s table, and Paul shared with them until morning. Paul&rsquo;s sharing with them should not be considered as a regular church meeting. This was a meeting for a gifted person to impart revelation.</p>
<p>Acts tells us that the early churches met in the homes of the saints. The Epistles tell us of four different homes in which the churches met (Rom. 16:5; 1 Cor. 16:19; Col. 4:15; Philem. 2). To meet in the homes is organic. If we only have a meeting hall with a definite, regular schedule, this will bring the entire church into the &ldquo;box&rdquo; of organization and causes us to lose the organic ability. If we take the way revealed in Acts, whatever we do will be organic, not organizational. I encourage you all to go out to visit people and meet with them organically and not by being organized.</p>
<p>In Hebrews 10:25, Paul says that we should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together, but exhort one another. I do not believe that this describes a big meeting because it is hard to exhort one another in a big meeting. This must describe a small group meeting where we can exhort and encourage one another.</p>
<p>We must see that we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, to a certain extent, are still practicing and carrying on our meetings and service according to the traditional way of Christianity. These practices put us into an organizing box. Everything may be organized and regulated with schedules in a definite way, but this is not organic. I do not mean that when we practice the biblical way, the church should not come together. We have to come together. According to our experience, it is most profitable for the saints to meet in their homes for fellowship, for the Lord&rsquo;s table, for preaching the gospel, for teaching the truth, and for prayer. Then maybe once a week or once every two weeks, the saints should come together to be built up with one another.</p>
<p>According to our experience, however, it is hard to have the whole church come together every week. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning about five thousand saints in the church in Taipei meet. If they all met together in the same place, very few of the saints would be able to speak in the meeting. Thus, the church in Taipei has over one hundred district meetings with about fifty saints in each meeting. We can come together in bigger groups of at least fifty saints on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. When we come together, there should not be a definite speaker. This meeting should be full of mutuality according to the practice of 1 Corinthians 14:26&mdash;&ldquo;each one has.&rdquo; This meeting is the best time for the saints to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, to speak the Lord into others. In the district meetings in Taipei, the saints are practicing to prophesy. Each one who speaks does not occupy more than three minutes. That means at least twenty saints can prophesy in an hour.</p>
<p>As we have seen in chapter three, to learn how to prophesy we have to learn the Word and live in fellowship with the Lord so that we can have the instant inspiration of the Triune God at any time. Then we can have a clear view to see through all things in all situations. Because we have the learning of the Word, the inspiration of the Triune God, and the clear view, we will be able to prophesy whenever the need arises.</p>
<p>If we meet and serve in the scriptural way, the entire church with every member will be active. The joints will act to supply, and each one part will operate to preach the gospel, to have home meetings, to have small group meetings, and to prophesy in the bigger meetings. The church will be increased, and the saints will be not only edified but also built up. In the larger church meetings there will be much opportunity for each one to prophesy. In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul says that we can all prophesy one by one. We can prophesy because we have been taught, perfected, equipped, and furnished to prophesy. This is the way that is revealed for us Christians to meet according to God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire. This is absolutely different from today&rsquo;s traditional practice.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PATTERNS OF PERFECTING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:11-12; 1 Thes. 2:6-8, 11-12; John 21:15-17; Matt. 28:20; 1 Cor. 14:3-4, 24-25; Acts 20:17-21, 24, 27-28, 31; 8:4-5, 12, 26-38</h1>
<p>In this chapter we need to be impressed that the Lord needs to recover the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry. For this perfecting work to be carried out, we need to see the patterns of perfecting presented in the Scriptures.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLICAL WAY TO BUILD UP THE CHURCH<br />
AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s desire, as He promised in Matthew 16:18, is to build up the church which is His Body. He does this as the Head of the Body by giving the gifted persons to the church. The gifted persons surely do what they are capable of doing. The apostles establish churches, the prophets speak for the Lord, the evangelists preach the gospel, and the shepherds and teachers shepherd the church and teach the saints. Along with this work, the gifted persons do another work, that is, they perfect the saints. The Apostle Paul did much work to set up churches and establish elders, and while he was doing this, he perfected all the saints to do the same thing that he did. This perfecting work builds up the church as the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The Body is not built directly by the Head or by the gifted persons but by the perfected saints. The Head and the gifted persons build the church indirectly, while the perfected saints do the direct building work. We have to see these three levels of building: first, the Head gives the gifts; second, the gifts perfect the saints; third, the perfected saints do the work to build up the church directly. This is clearly revealed in the New Testament, especially in Ephesians 4 and 1 Corinthians 14, but we cannot see such a practice on this earth. We may have known Ephesians 4:11-16 and 1 Corinthians 14 in the past, but we took these portions of the Word for granted, thinking we understood them. The Lord has recently brought me into these two portions of the Word and my eyes have been opened to see their significance. I am burdened to see the real practice of these verses among us so that the Lord can accomplish His heart&rsquo;s desire to build up His Body.</p>
<p>We have been so slow in practicing the scriptural way because we have been influenced by tradition, and now we are held back by our habit. Our habit is a great hindrance. We may understand Ephesians 4 and 1 Corinthians 14, yet remain the same in our practice. If I had the way, I would go to each one of the saints and take them with me to preach the gospel by knocking on people&rsquo;s doors. Then I would go with the saints to visit the homes of the newly baptized ones to cherish and nourish them. I would charge the saints to take care of these new ones as they would their own children. If we all did this, there would be a big change in our church life. Our church life today may be carried out merely in a routine way. The elders may schedule the prayer meeting and leave the rest of the week up to the saints for home meetings and small group meetings. They also may schedule the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting for us to come together to take the Lord&rsquo;s table and share with one another. The situation among us, however, may remain the same week after week without the real progression into the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery.</p>
<p>If we had been brought into Christ apart from the prevailing influence of traditional Christianity, our church life would be much different. Suppose that a group of us come to some people&rsquo;s door, preach the gospel to them, and baptize them into the Triune God. Then we continue to meet with them twice a week, not in a formal way but in a practical and free way. We open the Bible to these new ones and tell them about the process the Lord went through to become the life-giving Spirit. We also share with them how the Lord is both in the heavens and within us, that is, in our spirit as the life-giving Spirit. Then we teach them and lead them into the practice of calling on the name of the Lord. At first, they may not have much feeling when they call, but as they keep practicing to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, they will have some inner sense, some inner feeling. After two months of being visited by us, there will be a big change not only in their concept but also in their daily walk and family life. Then we can tell them that as Christian brothers we should come together in our community, and we can bring them together for a group meeting with three or four other nearby new families, on whom we have been laboring. We can lead them into the proper practice of the Christian meeting, and begin to have the church life with them. We can help them to learn from us, perfecting them to do the same thing that we have been doing.</p>
<p>We should not tell them what an elder is because we do not want to teach them anything that is premature. When parents are raising their children, they only let them know certain things when they are ready to receive them at the appropriate stage of their growth in life. After a certain period of time, the new believers will say that they want to go on further with the Lord. At that point, perhaps when their number has grown to twenty or thirty, you can help them realize that they are the church in their locality, and in the church the leading ones are needed. This group of Christians would be in a situation absolutely different from today&rsquo;s traditional Christianity. They would go out to knock on doors for the preaching of the gospel and go out to have home meetings. They would go to knock on the doors of their relatives, classmates, and colleagues, and they would perfect the new ones that they baptize to do what they are doing. They would all learn to have home meetings and group meetings, and they would learn to prophesy, to speak Christ. Such a church would be the top church.</p>
<p>Recently in Taipei the brothers have begun to carry out the work to evangelize the whole island of Taiwan. Five teams of twenty saints each went to five cities to raise up the church life. Within less than one week of visiting people door to door, they baptized over one hundred twenty. Each place gained over twenty new ones. I was a little concerned that they might be baptizing too many without enough nursing mothers to take care of the new ones. They told me, however, that according to their experience, about fifty percent will remain out of the ones that they baptize, so they intend to baptize fifty in each locality. After two weeks, two full-timers will remain in each locality to continually visit the homes of all the new ones, and eighteen remaining full-timers will go to a new locality to raise up another church. From the very beginning of their Christian life, the new ones will be brought into the scriptural way to practice the church life. All the new ones will learn how to do the same thing as the full-timers do to raise up the church. Every day the new believers are learning something new that they never heard or saw before. The twenty full-timers are working in each locality as patterns, and the new ones are learning from these patterns.</p><h2 class="head1">DEVOTING OURSELVES TO THE LORD<br />
FOR HIS BIBLICAL WAY</h2>
<p>Those of us who have been in the church life for a number of years may have become old, so we all need to have a new start. I would entreat all of us to drop all of our traditional knowledge and background from Christianity. We should just practice what the Bible teaches. To practice the biblical way, we have to begin every morning with the Lord to get ourselves revived anew (Lam. 3:22-23). We also need to devote ourselves to the Lord. In the recent winter training on Leviticus, we saw from Leviticus 27 that the Lord desires that we devote all that we are and have to Him. <em>Devote</em> is a stronger word than <em>consecrate</em> because it implies making a vow to the Lord. We should tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I vow to You to devote myself to You for Your biblical way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we are going to devote ourselves to the Lord for His biblical way, we have to visit people. I hope that we would all devote two days a week to the Lord, three hours of each day, for visiting people. The Lord has done so much for us. In return we can dedicate this time to the Lord. We should be able to separate, sanctify, six hours to the Lord every week. We can use the weekends or the weekday nights for this purpose. We need to do this by making a vow: &ldquo;Lord, I vow to You that from today I will give You three hours, twice each week.&rdquo; This would be in addition to the regular meetings of the church. We should at least have a prayer meeting during the week and attend the church meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day in order to have the Lord&rsquo;s table and the speaking for the Lord. If we all would give the Lord six hours a week to visit people for preaching the gospel, we will surely and eventually gain some new ones. If we cannot gain some new ones one week, we will gain some the next week.</p>
<p>We need to visit people with the goal that within one year we will have two remaining fruit for the Lord. Whether we baptize ten or five in a year, we should look to the Lord that at least two of them will be remaining fruit. We can go out twice a week, three hours each time, either to baptize people or to nourish, cherish, and teach them. We can go out to raise the new ones up in Christ and to bring them together as a small group. We need to visit them again and again to continually nourish, cherish, and teach them. The mothers know that raising up children is a &ldquo;joyful hardship.&rdquo; It is hard but joyful. After two months of caring for certain new ones, we will love them as our own babes. After one year they will do the same thing that we are doing. In every family, as the little ones grow, they imitate their parents. Whatever we do, the new ones will do. Whatever we speak, they will speak.</p>
<p>The human race is being raised up, not by big gatherings but in homes. In home after home over the whole earth, children are being raised up. This is an example, a type, of the saints being raised up to be the church. The New Testament shows us that it is in home after home that we raise up the saints to be a church. If many of us would rise up to visit people in their homes, I believe the churches would double in a year. I have the assurance that whoever devotes six hours a week to visiting people will have two remaining fruit yearly.</p>
<p>Suppose that fifty percent of the saints who meet with us decide to devote six hours a week to the Lord for this purpose. The other fifty percent might not be able to go out due to their health, their limited physical strength, or their environment, but they can still pray for the ones who do go out. If each one who goes out gains two new ones yearly, the number of the church will be doubled. I hope that many of us will rise up to take this way. I have received reports from many places around the world. Many churches are rising up to take the biblical way, and the results are very encouraging. The biblical way to take for the increase of the church is first, to visit people for gospel preaching; second, to have home meetings with the newly saved ones; third, to have small group meetings; and fourth, to bring the baptized, nourished, cherished, and taught new ones into the church meetings.</p>
<p>If the church meetings are too big, not many of the saints will have an opportunity to speak for the Lord. For this reason, it is good to have meetings of about fifty saints on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. If there are three hundred saints meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day in a certain locality, they can be divided into six meetings of fifty each. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day, we can have a meeting for the Lord&rsquo;s table and use the remainder of the time for the saints to practice 1 Corinthians 14:26. Each one has something, and many of the saints will speak. Twenty saints speaking for three minutes each will occupy one hour. Sometimes the speaking will be shorter, but if it is too short it will not be that rich. According to our experience, three minutes is a good amount of time to speak for the Lord. This time is not just to give a testimony or to praise the Lord but to give a short message. The saints&rsquo; speaking in the meetings in this way will be a ministering of Christ to one another, and this speaking will build up the Body organically.</p>
<p>The preaching of the gospel, the home meetings, and the group meetings are steps to prepare people to fully enter into the church life. We have to utilize the Lord&rsquo;s Day for a church meeting because many people are free on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. The majority of the saints will be the most free on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, so we need to have a church gathering, but not with a big group. A big group is mostly good for one person speaking, not for many of the saints to speak. To practice 1 Corinthians 14:26&mdash;&ldquo;each one has&rdquo;&mdash;there is the need of time. It is best to have meetings of fifty to eighty so that many saints are afforded the time and have the opportunity to speak for the Lord.</p>
<p>During the week the saints will be free to go out. The saints who go out do not need to be organized and managed under the eldership. They can simply go out to visit people to get them saved. Then they can go to have home meetings with the new ones and group them together into small groups. In this way people will get saved, and they will be nourished, taught, and brought into the church meetings. The new ones will learn of us in our preaching the gospel, and in the home meetings and group meetings we can instruct them to speak. We can tell them that we do not have pastors or preachers, but all the saints exhort, encourage, and comfort each other. After we meet with the new ones for six months, they will have learned much. What we have fellowshipped is the principle of raising up the saints to form a church and to build up the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The biblical way to practice the church life can never allow us to be idle or slothful. This will keep us doing something every day for the Lord, and every year we will bear two remaining fruit for the Lord. Some may ask, &ldquo;Suppose the elders in my locality would not agree with this?&rdquo; We should respect the elders, but every believer has the freedom in the Spirit that no elder can control. If we feel led of the Lord, we should go to preach the gospel by visiting people. No one can condemn this. Then we can continue to go to the ones that we have baptized to have home meetings with them. We can also go to have group meetings, and bring the new ones to the church meetings. Even if the elders do not agree with what we are doing, they will be happy because we are bringing new ones into the church. If we meet with the same people for many years and never have any new ones among us, we may become bored of seeing one another. A new child in a family makes the family happy. All the elders will be grateful to the saints who bring in the new ones. We should not be discouraged, disappointed, or held back. We must go on with the Lord to bear remaining fruit. The result will convince people.</p><h2 class="head1">PERFECTING THE SAINTS<br />
UNTO THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY</h2>
<p>The Lord needs to recover the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry. The gifted persons were given by the Lord to His Body for the perfecting of the saints. I believe that there are a number of gifted persons among us who need to rise up to perfect the saints. In order to perfect others, the gifted persons must practice, and they must begin their practice with preaching the gospel to save sinners by knocking on their doors. When we practice the biblical way, we are qualified and we have the position, the standing, to perfect others. We can ask certain ones to go along with us to preach the gospel for their perfecting. When they go with us, they will learn from us and spontaneously we will perfect them.</p>
<p>In the church in Taipei, hall sixteen had an attendance of about one hundred saints in the church meetings for many years. Today they have close to three hundred in attendance. This is because the leading ones in hall sixteen went to visit the saints, and they perfected many to visit others. We need the practice of the perfecting of the saints by the gifted persons. The gifted ones among us should not be idle and allow their gifts to become idle. They must use their gifts to perfect others. Furthermore, if we learn from the gifted ones to be perfected, we can become a perfecter to perfect others after a few months. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there must be a practical move in which many gifted persons are perfecting the saints, and eventually many saints are perfecting others.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 4:16 Paul stresses that all the Body of Christ causes the growth of the Body through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part. The joints supply the riches of Christ, and each one part operates according to its measure. We have to reach this condition. We need to see our real situation and realize what our real need is. We need the perfecting of the saints to do the work of the ministry, which is to build up the Body of Christ. We surely need such a biblical practice to begin among us.</p>
<p>We all must begin to labor on others. Each one part needs to operate. The more we operate, the more we learn; and the more we learn, the more we will know how to operate. Eventually, all the parts of the Body will be operating parts, so everyone will render some profit to the Body. Then the Body will be built up. A local church is built up by the increase in number and by the growth in life. A local church must increase in number and must grow in life. If we cannot see the increase in number and the growth in life with a local church, that means that it is idle in the eyes of God. This is why we must endeavor to practice the biblical way. The work of the ministry, the biblical way, is not to build up a local congregation, but it is to build up the organic Body of Christ. We must make this difference clear. We have to follow the Spirit within us to build up the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>In the work of the ministry, we first have to preach the gospel to save sinners. Then we have to cherish, nourish, shepherd, and teach the new believers to raise them up in Christ (1 Thes. 2:7, 11; John 21:15-17; Matt. 28:20). Regardless of how busy we are, I hope that we would dedicate six hours a week to the Lord for His work. If we do this, the Lord will bless us in many ways. He will bless us in our health, in our finances, in our situation, in our business, and in our career because we are taking care of His interests. According to history, the Lord will always return His blessing to everyone who dedicates something to Him. Today the Lord needs us to give Him six hours a week for serving Him in the biblical way by getting people saved in their homes and by going to their homes to nourish and to teach them. If we do this, we will see the results. Every year we will reap two remaining fruit. The Lord will honor our labor and honor our vow.</p>
<p>To do the work of the ministry, we also need to prophesy in order to minister Christ with all His riches for the building up of the church organically. Eventually, we will learn to perfect others to speak for the Lord. Then all the meeting members in the local church will be prophets. Everyone will be able to speak something for the Lord and of the Lord into others. To prophesy is to minister Christ with all His riches to the other members. This is the actual, practical, building up of the Body of Christ organically.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PATTERNS OF PERFECTING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Apostles</h2>
<p>The patterns of perfecting are the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. In Acts 20 Paul reminded the elders in Ephesus of what he did when he was among them. That meant that he wanted the elders to do the same thing that he did among them. He told them to remember how he was with them for three years, admonishing all the saints day and night with tears (v. 31). He said that he did not shrink from declaring to them all the counsel of God (v. 27). He also reminded them that he taught them publicly and from house to house (v. 20). This was how the Apostle Paul perfected the saints.</p>
<p>In 1 Thessalonians Paul likened himself to a nursing mother (2:6-8) and an exhorting father (2:11-12). He was a mother cherishing and nourishing the saints and a father teaching the saints. This is the way to perfect the saints. The gifted ones among us should do the work of cherishing and nourishing the saints as a mother and of exhorting, admonishing, teaching, and instructing them as a father. We should have many mothers and fathers in the churches. We have to follow the Lord to go out as a mother and as a father to visit others. There are many saints among us who have not been in the church meetings for years. All of these dear ones need us to nourish them. We should not go to them and say, &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen you in a long time. Please come to the meeting.&rdquo; We have to nourish them and take the opportunity to give them some helpful instructions. We have to recover the dear ones among us who have not been coming to the meetings for years. Paul said that he yearned over the saints and was well pleased to impart to them not only the gospel but also his own soul (1 Thes. 2:8). We all should do this kind of work. Some may ask whether Paul was doing the work of an apostle, a prophet, an evangelist, or a shepherd and teacher. My response is that I neither know nor am concerned about this. What matters is that we do the work that Paul did.</p>
<p>In this fellowship we have seen what the work of the ministry is. If we do not respond to this fellowship and the Lord returns, He may call us slothful slaves and cast us into outer darkness for a period of time (Matt. 25:26, 30). It is not good enough to have merely the knowledge of what the gifted persons do. Many sinners need to be saved, and many backsliding saints need to be recovered. We have to cooperate with the Lord to carry out this work. We also have to speak Christ forth into others, ministering the riches of Christ into others whenever the church comes together. There is the need of such a revival among all the churches. We have to bear our responsibility and do our duty. Our duty today is to perfect others. We have to get people saved, nourish them, teach them, raise them up, and put them into the church meetings. This is not to build up a congregation but to build up the Body of Christ in an organic way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Prophets</h2>
<p>A pattern of prophesying is seen in 1 Corinthians 14. Verse 3 says, &ldquo;He who prophesies speaks to men building up and encouragement and consolation&rdquo; (Gk.). This is a pattern. In verses 24 and 25, he says that prophesying convicts people and judges them. When we speak the word in a pure motive without any intention to judge others, our word will be used by the Lord to convict others, to judge them, and to make their condition manifest to them. When people&rsquo;s real condition is manifested to them, they will admit that God is among us. If God were not among us, how could an unbeliever or unlearned person&rsquo;s condition be manifested to him when we do not even know it? Such prophesying ministers God to the hearers and brings them to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Evangelists</h2>
<p>Acts 8 presents the pattern of the evangelists. Verse 4 says that all the scattered saints from Jerusalem went out to preach the gospel. Surely their preaching involved visiting others. These saints did not have a hall to have a large gathering for the preaching of the gospel. They went everywhere to visit people and bring the good news to them. Philip the evangelist also went out to preach the gospel (v. 5). As he was on the road, he preached the gospel to an Ethiopian man and baptized him. He did not baptize him in a baptistry but in a body of water that was near the road. The baptisms of the early believers were without regulations and rituals. They did what was convenient according to where they were.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Shepherds and Teachers</h2>
<p>The Scriptures also show us the pattern of the shepherds and teachers. The Lord&rsquo;s conversation with Peter in John 21:15-17 indicates that if we love the Lord, we must feed His lambs, shepherd His sheep, and feed His sheep. In Matthew 28:20 the Lord charged the disciples to teach the ones that they had baptized. They were to teach them to observe whatever the Lord had commanded them. This is the perfecting work of the shepherds and teachers.</p>
<p>We need to cooperate with the Lord to visit people. The results are up to Him. I hope that many of us will make a vow with the Lord to devote six hours weekly to the Lord to walk in the biblical way so that the Lord will have a way to build up His organic Body.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE DESPERATION AND DILIGENCE<br />
IN PRACTICING THE BIBLICAL WAY<br />
TO SERVE AND TO MEET</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 1:16; Eph. 3:8; 1 Cor. 15:10; 9:16; Col. 1:28-29; Acts 20:19-20, 31; 1 Cor. 9:26-27; Matt. 24:45-51; 25:24-30; Eph. 5:16</h1>
<p>In chapter five we saw the crucial need in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for perfecting the saints unto the work of the ministry and the patterns of perfecting. In this chapter we want to see the desperation and diligence required to practice the biblical way to serve and to meet.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S REQUIREMENTS AND GOD&rsquo;S SUPPLY</h2>
<p>From eternity past God has had a plan, which in the New Testament is called <em>God&rsquo;s economy.</em> In the new testament age, God has brought His economy to us, and He has called us into this economy. Now we need to consider how God called us into His economy. We may realize that God is full of mercy, love, grace, and forgiveness. This may be our simplified concept of the gospel. In the beginning of the New Testament, however, the first word of the preaching of the gospel is: &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (Matt. 3:2; 4:17). The kingdom is a matter of God&rsquo;s requirements. God&rsquo;s economy is based upon the requirements of His righteousness, holiness, and glory.</p>
<p>The kingdom is revealed in the Gospel of Matthew, and life is revealed in the Gospel of John. First, the kingdom comes as a requirement. Second, life comes as a supply. When God requires, He supplies. God does not require us to do something without supplying us with what He is to meet what He demands. If God&rsquo;s requirements are high, His supply is high. He requires righteousness, and He is righteousness to us. He requires holiness of us, and He is holiness to us. He requires that we meet the standard of His glory, but all have sinned and come short of God&rsquo;s glory (Rom. 3:23). We cannot make it in ourselves, but Christ is the very glory of God to us. The New Testament principle is that the requirements come first and the supply always follows. We should not be disappointed or fearful concerning the Lord&rsquo;s requirements because when we heed His requirements, He is there to supply us.</p>
<p>Many believers like to begin their study of the New Testament with the Gospel of John, but the divine arrangement of the Scriptures has Matthew as the first Gospel. Matthew begins with the genealogy of Jesus Christ, which is difficult to understand, but John begins in a simpler way&mdash;&ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (v. 1). Verse 4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men,&rdquo; and verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace....&rdquo; We may not fully understand these verses, but these words are sweet and precious to us. Even the Gospel of John, however, brings us into the thought of the kingdom. Chapter three says that unless we are born again, born of water and the Spirit, we cannot see the kingdom of God (vv. 3, 5). We like the thought of grace more than the thought of the kingdom, but according to the principle of the New Testament, the kingdom comes first and grace follows. The requirements of God are followed by His grace, which is God Himself as our enjoyment that we may live with Him, in Him, and by Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A NEW TESTAMENT VOW&mdash;<br />
PRESENTING OURSELVES TO GOD</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter I admonished us to make a vow before the Lord according to the truth in Leviticus 27. Leviticus is a book on the enjoyment of Christ. It begins with our enjoyment of Christ as all the offerings&mdash;the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. We have sin and trespasses, but Christ as the sin offering takes care of our sin, and Christ as the trespass offering takes care of our offenses, mistakes, transgressions, trespasses, and wrongdoings. Eventually, the book of Leviticus reveals that our condition is leprous and that what comes out of us is unclean and contagious, but this kind of exposing is to prepare us to enter into the enjoyment of Christ more and more deeply. Leviticus then brings us to the festivals, where we have daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly enjoyment. In Leviticus 25 we are brought into the enjoyment of the jubilee. Then in Leviticus 27, the final chapter of the book, God proposes to us that we devote all that we are and all that we have to Him with a vow. In such a book of the enjoyment of Christ, a vow is proposed. We have to make a vow to devote ourselves with all of our possessions to Him.</p>
<p>Now we need to see the truth in the New Testament concerning devoting ourselves with a vow to God. In the first eleven chapters of the book of Romans are God&rsquo;s grace, redemption, justification, and reconciliation. Chapter nine says that we have been chosen by Him. He chose us to be His enjoyers. We have been predestinated to be forgiven and to be justified, so we do not need to endeavor in this matter. This is our destiny. Chapter eleven of Romans says that God&rsquo;s choosing, His selection, can never be changed. Then in chapter twelve Paul says, &ldquo;I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies....&rdquo; (v. 1). Paul tells us &ldquo;to present.&rdquo; To present means to give God a gift. A gift must be something precious that makes the receiver happy. We are the very objects of God&rsquo;s favor. We are so precious to Him. We are no longer God&rsquo;s enemies. Through God&rsquo;s mercy and grace in His redemption, we have become presents to Him.</p>
<p>Through God&rsquo;s compassions, we should present ourselves to God. In the New Testament, God first presented Himself to us as a gift. We have received Him as a present to us. In return we have to present ourselves to Him, and this is a New Testament vow. A vow is something that should not be altered or changed. If I say that we need to make a vow, this may frighten us, but what about presenting ourselves to God? Since God loves us and we love Him, we should present ourselves to Him. In the New Testament, to present ourselves to God is to make a vow to God. From the day that we present ourselves to God, we belong to God.</p>
<p>One day we may have been touched by the Lord to kneel down and pray, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, You are so gracious. I present myself to You.&rdquo; To present yourself is to give yourself to Him. If we give someone a gift, it is not right for us to ask him to return it later. Once we give someone a gift, it is no longer ours but his. This is a vow. We may not enjoy Christ that much because we altered our vow. If we do not keep the presentation of ourselves to God, we will be out of the enjoyment of Christ. In 1963 I began to speak in the United States on the enjoyment of Christ. I also wrote the hymn &ldquo;Let us exhibit Christ&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #864). The saints were excited about this fellowship at that time. If we do not have the enjoyment of Christ, we will not exhibit Christ. Many of us who have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for years should ask ourselves if we have been enjoying Christ all the time. We do not enjoy Christ continually because we have annulled our presentation of ourselves to Him. This is like a person giving a watch to someone and then stealing it back from him later. In principle, this may be our situation with the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">RECOVERING 1 CORINTHIANS 14:26<br />
BY EPHESIANS 4:11-16</h2>
<p>In 1984 I realized that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery had nearly come to a standstill. We had become dormant. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. He caused us to realize that we needed to get into His recovery in an ultimate way. Many scriptural truths and practices have been recovered by the Lord throughout the history of the church. Brother E. H. Broadbent in his book <em>The Pilgrim Church</em> traced the line of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery since the second century. The Lord has recovered so much, but there is at least one thing He has not recovered. He has not yet recovered the way to meet. The traditional way of meeting in Christianity is according to the customs of the nations (2 Kings 17:8&mdash;NASB). Brother Nee saw this fifty years ago. This matter of the scriptural way to meet has been printed in his books <em>The Normal Christian Church Life</em> and <em>Church Affairs.</em> He said that the church has to practice 1 Corinthians 14:26. This is a big item in the New Testament that needs to be recovered. Where can we see a meeting in which the Christians come together, and each one has something? In 1 Corinthians 14:26 Paul used the word &ldquo;has&rdquo; five times&mdash; each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Brother Nee called this kind of meeting a meeting of mutuality. This is different from the customs of the nations. Whenever the nations have a gathering, only one person speaks and the rest listen. This practice is worldly and natural.</p>
<p>When Brother Nee gave the messages printed in <em>The Normal Christian Church Life</em> in January of 1937, I was there. One day he was sick and he charged me to speak one of the messages. He gave me the points to speak for him. Eleven years later in 1948 he had a training in which he gave a series of messages in the book <em>Church Affairs.</em> He again spoke concerning our need to practice 1 Corinthians 14:26. Soon after that training, however, mainland China fell into the hands of the communists, and Brother Nee was imprisoned for twenty years until his death. After that training, I was sent out to Taiwan, so we did not have time to practice the truth of 1 Corinthians 14:26.</p>
<p>It was not until recently in my ministry that the Lord reminded me of this matter. I asked the Lord how we could have such a meeting in which each one has something to minister for the fulfillment of 1 Corinthians 14:26. Then the Lord led me to Ephesians 4. If we are going to fulfill 1 Corinthians 14:26, we must take care of Ephesians 4:11-16. All the gifted persons have to perfect the saints. Then all the saints will do exactly what the gifted persons do, and each one part of the Body will operate. All the Body of Christ causes the growth of the Body through every part operating. The answer to how 1 Corinthians 14:26 can be fulfilled is in Ephesians 4:11-16. This should be considered as the gospel, the good news, because this is a part of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and a progression of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>We are so blessed to be saved, to be unveiled, and to be in a position to practice 1 Corinthians 14:26. This is a significant part of church history; I believe that the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery is eternally significant. We have the assurance from the Word that 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Ephesians 4:11-16 must be fulfilled. The main thing that these two portions of the Word reveal to us is the proper church meeting for the building up of the organic Body of Christ, not for the building up of a congregation. This has to be fulfilled, and this fulfillment is a great part of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We have to treasure this revelation and receive it as the glad tidings. We are blessed to be in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery at this time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE BIBLICAL WAY, THE CONSTRICTED WAY</h2>
<p>To be a Christian in today&rsquo;s traditional Christianity does not require much. People hear the gospel, they repent, confess their sins, receive the Lord, and get baptized to become members of fundamental denominations. After their salvation, they come to meet week after week on the weekend to listen to one man speaking. After working hard during the week, people like to relax on the weekends and have some entertainment. &ldquo;Going to church&rdquo; on Sundays is a form of entertainment for many Christians. They can listen to a choir sing beautiful music and listen to a good speaker give an eloquent message. There is no requirement for them to be full of life and in the spirit. To be Christians according to God&rsquo;s Word, however, is very troublesome to the natural man. Now that we are Christians, we have to take the biblical way, not the easy, traditional way.</p>
<p>Once we are born into this world, we have to believe in the Lord Jesus to become Christians; otherwise, we will go to the lake of fire. Now that we are Christians, we have to love the Lord, to get ourselves engaged to Him. We have no choice in this matter because we are not the Lord. He created us, regenerated us, and chose us. We have no choice. We have to take His way. As believers in Christ, we are married to Christ. Marriage is a kind of binding. When a person gets married, he does not have the freedom that he used to have when he was single. Both the husband and the wife are limited by one another. We are limited by the Lord in the same way. We cannot do whatever we desire because He is our Husband. The more we accept His limitation, the more peace we will have. Actually, His limitation is profitable to us.</p>
<p>The New Testament is full of grace and also full of responsibility, full of burden. Paul is a real pattern to us of someone who bore his responsibility by laboring abundantly. He took the &ldquo;troublesome way&rdquo; because he realized that he had no choice. One day he would have to stand before the Lord to give an account of his stewardship. All of the unbelievers will be judged at the great white throne, and the issue of that judgment will be the lake of fire (Rev. 20:11-15); while all of the believers will appear before the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10). The issue of that judgment will either be the kingdom of the heavens for us to enter into the Lord&rsquo;s joy in the kingship or the outer darkness for us to suffer some dispensational punishment. I must say this to be faithful to the Lord and honest to His children. We have to realize where we are and what we have to do. If we are going to enjoy more of His grace, we must take the &ldquo;troublesome way.&rdquo; In Matthew 7 the Lord told us that the gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads to life, but the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction (vv. 13-14). Which way will we choose? I surely will choose the constricted way. I am constricted and restricted by the Lord every day. At times I may want to do something to vindicate myself, but the Lord will not allow me. I have entered the narrow gate, and I am now on the constricted way.</p><h2 class="head1">BEARING OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO BEAR FRUIT<br />
AND SHEPHERD THE FLOCK</h2>
<p>Now that we have been saved by the Lord, we may only want to come to the meetings for our enjoyment. Do we think that this is enough? There are thousands of unbelievers living around us, and they need someone to preach the gospel to them. In the New Testament, the Lord first called us to Himself, and then He sent us to preach the gospel, to disciple the nations. Have we done this? Even in the Gospel of John, a book on Christ as our life and life supply, we are charged to bear fruit and to feed and shepherd the lambs. In chapter fifteen the Lord is the vine tree and we are the branches. Surely all the branches enjoy the life supply of the tree, but that is not the goal. The goal is for all the branches to bear fruit. We may say that we are enjoying the Lord, but where is our fruit? The enjoyment of Christ as grace to be our life issues in two things: fruit bearing and shepherding the flock. After we bear the fruit, this fruit becomes a flock of lambs for us to shepherd. We have to shepherd the flock and feed the lambs one by one. The Gospel of John is a book of enjoyment, but that enjoyment issues in something. This issue becomes the very responsibility upon our shoulders. We may like to hear about the enjoyment of Christ but not about our responsibility or duty. There is no such thing, however, as enjoyment without responsibility. If we think this, we are self-deceived.</p>
<p>According to the Lord&rsquo;s word in John 15, if we branches of the vine do not bear fruit, we will be cut off from the enjoyment of the riches of the vine (vv. 2, 6). To be cut off is not to perish but to lose the rich life juice of the vine for our enjoyment. We may say that we are enjoying Christ when actually we may be cut off from this enjoyment. We may have the concept that the Lord would never ask us to do such a hard thing as to go out to visit people for preaching the gospel, but the New Testament shows that we have to be prepared to be persecuted and even martyred for the preaching of the gospel. After Pentecost a number of saints in Jerusalem were martyred (Acts 7:54-60; 12:1-2). Who would prepare himself for persecution? We all like to take the easy way, but the easy way is not the successful way. To have a successful class, the teacher must bear the burden. An executive of a corporation must bear the responsibility. It is the same with us Christians. Christians should be the top class of people among the human race. As such a people, we surely have to bear some responsibility.</p>
<p>First, the New Testament charges us to preach the gospel; then it charges us to feed the lambs. In John 21:15-17 the Lord asked Peter three times if he loved Him. When Peter told the Lord that he did love Him, the Lord told Peter to feed His lambs and sheep and to shepherd His sheep. Then in verses 18 and 19, the Lord told Peter, &ldquo;When you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go. Now this He said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, Follow Me!&rdquo; The Lord said this to Peter to prepare him to be martyred, to follow Him to death. This is our fate, our destiny, which brings us into the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LABORING IN THE BIBLICAL WAY<br />
TO ENJOY THE LORD AS OUR RICH SUPPLY</h2>
<p>I feel that we are blessed that the Lord would speak this word to us. We are under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing because He has shown us not only the truth of His present recovery but also the way to practice it. None of us should be afraid of even the highest requirement. The higher the requirement of God is, the richer His supply is. In the Bible there are many charges and warnings, but there is also God&rsquo;s gracious supply. This supply is God Himself in His Trinity becoming everything to us to meet our every need. The more we get ourselves exercised for His purpose, the more we participate in Him. If we go out to visit people for the preaching of the gospel, outwardly we are doing something difficult; but in going out to visit people for the gospel, we will participate in the Triune God much more than we ever did before. He will become our rich enjoyment. In Acts 5 when Peter and the apostles were insulted and beaten by the Jewish Sanhedrin, they were rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer on behalf of the Lord (vv. 40-41). They felt that it was a glory to suffer for the Lord and His gospel. The more they suffered, the more joy they had.</p>
<p>The Triune God is real, and He is within us. He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit to be everything to us, but we need to be exercised. We need to rise up to bear some responsibility. If all the saints in the United States rise up in this way, we will be prevailing, living, and a bright testimony. This surely will influence others, and all the Christians in all of the United States and even on the whole earth will see something. The local churches will really be the golden lampstands shining in the darkness. We may be the lampstands, but where is the shining? We could be the lampstands without the light. If we all take the biblical way, every local church will be a shining lampstand. People will receive the light, and they will walk in the light of the local churches.</p>
<p>To take the biblical way, we need to begin by going out to visit people to bring them into Christ. Then we need to take care of them in the home meetings and group them together for group meetings. Along with this we can bring them to the church meetings. We may say that this is too hard and burdensome for us. This is why we need to get ourselves revived to take this way. To get ourselves revived means that we have to enter into the real and practical enjoyment of Christ. Whether we are enjoying Christ is not up to our supposition. If we are really enjoying Christ, we will bear fruit. If a branch of a vine is really enjoying the tree&rsquo;s juice, it will bear fruit. If we have really borne the fruit, this is a strong sign that we have been enjoying the vine. If we are not bearing fruit, this indicates that we are not enjoying Him. The issue of our enjoyment of Christ is fruit bearing.</p>
<p>We must get ourselves revived by going to the Lord to pray. We need to confess our shortcomings, mistakes, sinfulness, and uncleanness from our natural life, the self, the flesh, and the old man. When we confess thoroughly, the Lord will be within us as our enjoyment, and we will be revived. We will begin to live a revived life, a daily victorious and overcoming life. We will walk in fellowship with Him and spontaneously have something of Him to tell others. Through such a revival, we will be on the right track. We will go out to visit people organically. Someone within us will burden us to go out. If we do not get one saved this month, we will expect to get one the next month.</p>
<p>Actually, it is not that hard. We only need to bear two remaining fruit per year. In John 15:16 the Lord said that He appointed us to go forth and bear fruit and that our fruit should remain. To bear fruit is the first step. This is to preach the gospel to get people saved. The second step is to have home meetings with them to keep them as remaining fruit. To bear two remaining fruit each year is not too much of a burden. In order to have two remaining fruit, though, we need to save about five or six. Even the orchard farmers would tell us that not all of their fruit remains. During the whole year, we can get six saved and bear two of them as remaining fruit.</p>
<p>As long as we cooperate with the Lord to give Him two days a week, three hours each day, for laboring in the biblical way, we will certainly bear the fruit. When we think about this, it may seem hard, but when we begin to labor, we will see that it is not. It seems that knocking on doors for the preaching of the gospel is difficult and a suffering, but once we get into it, it becomes an enjoyment. For a mother to deliver a child is a suffering, but after the delivery she is joyful and happy. Before I begin to write the outlines for the Life-study of the books of the Bible, I always consider it a very difficult task, but when I get into it, I enjoy it. The more I do, the more I want to do. When we get into the labor with the Lord, the labor becomes a joy to us. If we respond to His requirements, His supply surely follows. If we get ourselves exercised by His requirements, we will be happy and ready to receive His supply. The supply comes to us because of our exercise. This is the glad tidings.</p>
<p>When the trainees are being tested in the summer and winter trainings, I frequently tell them to come to the altar. If we do not get on the altar, it remains an altar in our sight, but once we get on the altar, it becomes a dining table. We are so happy to labor in and with the Lord because this labor becomes our enjoyment. We need to get ourselves exercised by His requirements. Because He requires us to do something, we have no choice, but when we do it, it becomes a dining table, a real enjoyment, a real joy.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PATTERN OF PAUL</h2>
<p>Paul is a pattern of a person who was desperate and diligent in cooperating with the Lord to carry out His desire for the organic building up of the Body of Christ (1 Tim. 1:16; Eph. 3:8). Paul was a pattern by the grace of God, not by his own endeavoring. Paul was what he was by the grace of God, and by this grace he labored more abundantly than all the other apostles (1 Cor. 15:10). In Ephesians 3:8 Paul said that he was less than the least of all saints. He was such a small Christian, yet he received the grace to make him such a person. If the less than the least of the saints received this grace, all of us can receive this grace. We are qualified to receive grace by exercising ourselves. We need to pray, repent, and confess to get ourselves exercised. Then grace will come to us, and this grace will make us another person. Paul said, &ldquo;By the grace of God I am what I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul is also a pattern of one who was fully exercised in the gospel. He said, &ldquo;Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel&rdquo; (1 Cor. 9:16). Do we want to receive the blessing or the woe? If we want the blessing, we must preach the gospel. In Colossians 1:28-29 he said that he announced Christ, warning and teaching every man in all wisdom to present every man full-grown in Christ; laboring and struggling according to the operation of Christ in him in power. What a pattern Paul is! He labored by struggling. To struggle is to wrestle, to strive, and to fight. He struggled according to the operation of Christ in him. We all have this operation of Christ within us, but if we do not get ourselves exercised, the operation will stop. The operation of Christ within us is like a motor. When we switch on by getting ourselves exercised, the motor operates. We have to get ourselves exercised according to this operation, not according to our natural energy, natural strength, or natural ability. We labor and struggle according to Christ operating within us in power. This power is the power of the divine dynamo, the divine motor.</p>
<p>In Acts 20 Paul said that he taught the believers publicly and from house to house, admonishing each one of them night and day with tears (Acts 20:19-20, 31). Paul told us that he ran, not as uncertainly, that he boxed, not as beating the air, and that he buffeted his body and led it as a slave (1 Cor. 9:26-27). Paul subdued his body, but most people are controlled by their bodies. The body is rebellious, so we have to buffet it and lead it into slavery, making it a slave to serve our purpose. Paul presented himself to us as a pattern in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNFAITHFUL AND IMPRUDENT SLAVE<br />
AND THE EVIL AND SLOTHFUL SLAVE<br />
SUFFERING PUNISHMENT IN THE KINGDOM AGE</h2>
<p>The unfaithful and imprudent slave and the evil and slothful slave will suffer punishment in the kingdom age. We need to read Matthew 24:45-51 and 25:24-30 again and again to be impressed with this warning. Today it may seem that nothing happens if we do not preach the gospel or take care of the meetings, but in that day it will not be all right. The Lord will come to judge, and we will have to give Him a full account of what we have been and of what we have done. He will send the evil and slothful slave into outer darkness. That will be a dispensational punishment in the kingdom age. Because I do not want to see this happen to any of the saints, I must be honest to present this warning.</p>
<p>The truth has been clearly presented to us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If we do not take His grace to follow Him according to His will, we will suffer the loss of the enjoyment of the kingdom and a dispensational discipline for a period of time. What I have presented in this book is the truth from the Bible. We should reconsider our concept in the light of this truth. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is full of truth. The Bible tells us the more we know the truth of the Lord&rsquo;s will, the more we are held responsible (Luke 12:47-48).</p>
<h2 class="head1">REDEEMING THE TIME</h2>
<p>If we are desperate and diligent in practicing the biblical way to serve and to meet, we will redeem the time (Eph. 5:16). Time is very precious. If it were not precious, it would not be worth being redeemed. Anything that is worthless is not worth redeeming. Because time is so precious, we have to redeem it by seizing every available opportunity. We have to treasure the time that we have, and seize every available opportunity to serve the Lord. One day He may check with us even concerning what we are reading here. In that day, the Lord could ask us why we did not respond to this fellowship. If we receive the fellowship in this book, it will be a great blessing to us and to many who will be our beneficiaries. They will receive the profit from our service, and they will be grateful to us. The church as the Body of Christ will be organically built up as the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. If we do not exercise to practice the biblical way, we will suffer loss. Sinners will not be saved by us, the church will not be built up by us, and we will have no way to stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
<p>To redeem the time, we need to be wise to abandon the things of the evil age, which destroy, damage, and spoil our time. Our talk on the telephone may be an evil thing that damages our time. If we cut short our talk on the telephone, this will save us a lot of time. We may say that we are too busy to pray, but when we get on the phone, we have much time. We have to abandon needless talk and gossip on the telephone. We need to redeem the time for the Lord.</p>
<p>Today you may be thirty-five years old. You may seek after the Lord and come to the meetings regularly without wanting to bear any burden. You may only want to &ldquo;enjoy Christ.&rdquo; Time goes by quickly. Before you know it, you will be fifty-five and then sixty-five years old. When you are sixty-five, you may consider your situation with regret. You may say: &ldquo;I have been saved for so many years, and I have been meeting regularly with the church and loving the Lord, yet I have not borne any fruit. I cannot point out anyone on this earth whom I have brought to the Lord.&rdquo; Even before you appear before the judgment seat of Christ, especially when you are about to die, you will recall all your years with the Lord and what you have done for Him. You will be full of regret if you did not redeem your time to gain some profit for the Lord&rsquo;s interest, but regret will not bring back your time. The time will be gone.</p>
<p>I still remember the story of D. L. Moody as he was about to die. He said happily to all the surrounding saints, many of whom were saved through his preaching: &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; I believe that when he was dying, he considered his past years of work for the Lord in preaching the gospel faithfully to bring thousands to the Lord. While he was dying, he was victoriously happy. How about us? When we are going to leave this earth, will we be able to happily say &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; to the brothers and to our relatives? On the one hand, we may have some comfort in the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. On the other hand, we may feel very regretful because of the way that we lived our Christian life. Thank the Lord, though, that we still have today, just as the book of Hebrews tells us (Heb. 3:7-8, 13, 15; 4:7). It is not too late for us because we still have today.</p>
<p>When we appear before the Lord at His judgment seat, what will matter is how much fruit we have borne. We cannot tell Him that we did not have time to bear fruit when we spent much time to take care of our homes and private interests. In this age, we need to be fully occupied with the Lord&rsquo;s interests. Then the Lord will say at the judgment seat, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave...enter into the joy of your lord&rdquo; (Matt. 25:21, 23). If we are not faithful to cooperate with the Lord in this age, He will call us evil and slothful slaves and will cast us out into outer darkness (Matt. 25:26, 30). May the Lord have abundant mercy upon us that we will reconsider our way and take His way to please Him.</p></body></html>
