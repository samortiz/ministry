   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. To Observe the Feast</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of Unleavened Bread as a Continuation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of the Feast of Passover 1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For Seven Days</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The children of Israel were to observe the feast of unleavened bread as a continuation of the feast of Passover 12:15-20; 13:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Exodus 12:18 says, In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have pointed out that when the children of Israel ate the Passover lamb, they were also required to eat unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have seen that the feast of the Passover lasted one day, whereas the feast of unleavened bread continued for seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the feast of unleavened bread was a continuation of the feast of Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The flesh of the Passover lamb signifies the sinless life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We received Christ not only in His death and resurrection, but also in His sinlessness, for His life is not only a crucified and resurrected life, but also a sinless life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we must eat the flesh of the lamb and also the unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that from the time we received Christ and were saved and had a new beginning in life, we began to live a life without leaven, a life without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Exodus 13:7 says that no leaven was to be seen with the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In our Christian life no leaven should be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is impossible for us to have no leaven at all, but it is possible for the leaven not to be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although it is not possible for us to be without sin, we must deal with any sin that is manifested, with any sin that is seen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that we are responsible to deal with the sin of which we are conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever we discover something sinful in our lives, we must eliminate it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This, however, does not mean that we shall have no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There may be much sin in our lives or in our environment, but we may not be conscious of it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, as soon as we become conscious of it, we must deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must forsake the sin of which we are conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not tolerate any manifestation of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 12:19 the children of Israel were given a strong word: Whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To be cut off from the congregation of Israel was to be cut off from the fellowship of God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This serious word corresponds to Paul s word in 1 Corinthians 5:13: Remove the evil man from among yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To put away such a one is to cut him off from the fellowship of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we tolerate sin once it has been exposed, our fellowship will be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that as Christians we should live a sinless life, not tolerating any sin that has been exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To deal with manifested sin is to observe the feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Exodus 12:14 says, This day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to Jehovah throughout your generations: ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This verse indicates that the Passover was to be kept as a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The same was true regarding the feast of unleavened bread 12:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A feast involves both eating and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever we eat without having enjoyment as the purpose of our eating, that eating is common.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But when we eat for enjoyment, our eating becomes a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, we may daily eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner without any special enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But sometimes we come together to hold a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At such times, our eating is for the purpose of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The eating of the Passover was called the feast of Passover because it was an eating for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we were saved, we enjoyed the feast of Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But this feast should immediately be continued by the feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This indicates that a Christian s enjoyment should not cease.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, in the experience of many Christians, the feast of Passover is not followed by the feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the time of their conversion, they were joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But this enjoyment did not last, because they did not observe the feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that they did not deal with their sinful living.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, they allowed the leaven that was exposed to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They did not deal with sin that had been exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For this reason, many Christians do not observe the feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After we receive the Lord and are saved, we should continue our enjoyment by dealing with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This should last not just for one day, but for seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that it should last throughout the course of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our whole life after we are saved should be a feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This was Paul s concept in 1 Corinthians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In verse 7 Paul says, Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For indeed our Passover, Christ, has been sacrificed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then in verse 8 he goes on to tell us to keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and evil, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Day by day we need to keep the feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should keep this feast throughout the course of our Christian life until we see the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As soon as we refuse to deal with any sin that has been exposed, we no longer keep the feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This means that we lose the enjoyment of this feast.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Tolerating sin causes loss of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the contrary, the more we deal with sin that has been manifested or exposed, the more enjoyment we have.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is to keep the feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I appreciate the way Paul allegorized the Passover and the feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He says that Christ our Passover has been sacrificed, that we should purge out the old leaven, and that we should keep the feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We keep this feast by dealing with sin and by living a sinless life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whenever something sinful is exposed, we immediately deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In this way no leaven shall be seen in our houses.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Christ is the unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The more we eat Him, the more we shall become unleavened.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The only way to eliminate sin is to eat Christ s crucified, resurrected, and sinless life.</S>
