   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The teaching of the apostles is the holding factor of the one accord, causing us to have one heart, one way, and one goal Acts 1:14; 2:42a, 46a; Jer 32:39.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Different teachings, other than the teaching of the apostles, are the major source of the church s decline, degradation, and deterioration 1 Tim 1:3-7; 6:3-5, 20-21a: The striking point of the churches degradation is different teachings; these teachings crept in because the churches turned away from Paul s teaching, the unique teaching of God s eternal economy Rev 2:14-15, 20; 2 Tim 1:15.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fellowship of the apostles is the unique and universal fellowship of the Body of Christ the reality of living in the Body of Christ Acts 2:42: Teaching creates fellowship, and fellowship comes from teaching; if we teach wrongly or differently from the apostles teaching, our teaching will produce a sectarian, divisive fellowship 1 Cor 4:17; 1:9; 10:16; 1 Tim 1:3-4; 6:3.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fellowship is the flow of the eternal life within all the believers, who have received and possess the divine life 1 John 1:3; 2 Cor 13:14; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rev 22:1.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The initial experience of the apostles was the vertical fellowship with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ, but when the apostles reported the eternal life to others, they experienced the horizontal aspect of the divine fellowship 1 John 1:2-3: Our horizontal fellowship with the saints brings us into vertical fellowship with the Lord; then our vertical fellowship with the Lord brings us into horizontal fellowship with the saints vv.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The coordination of the four living creatures presents a beautiful picture of the practical fellowship of the Body of Christ; fellowship means doing everything through the cross and by the Spirit to dispense Christ into others for the sake of His Body Ezek.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>1:9.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the church service we all need to learn not only how to walk straight forward but also how to walk backward and sideways ; in coordination there is no freedom or convenience; coordination keeps us from making turns cf.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eph 3:18: To walk backward and sideways is to say Amen to another member s particular function or ministry and burden Rom 12:4; cf.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Fellowship blends us, mingles us, adjusts us, tempers us, harmonizes us, limits us, protects us, supplies us, and blesses us, giving us the power and the impact of the Spirit; the Body is in the fellowship 1 Cor 12:24-25; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>1:13-14.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should apply this matter of coordination not only in a particular local church but also among the churches; this means that we are followers of the churches and that the local churches should fellowship with all the genuine local churches on the whole earth to keep the universal fellowship of the Body of Christ 1 Thes 2:14; 1 Cor 10:16.</S>
