   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. By Prophesying</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 14 says that when we come together, we all can prophesy one by one v. 31 and that prophesying builds up the church v. 4b . In Exodus 4 Moses told the Lord that he was not an eloquent speaker v. 10 . Then the Lord gave Aaron to Moses to be his co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He said to Moses concerning Aaron, "And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do" v. 15 . When Moses would speak to his brother Aaron to put some words into his mouth, God would be with Moses' mouth and with Aaron's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then the Lord said to Moses, "And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people" v. 16 . Aaron was to be Moses' spokesman.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Exodus 7:1 the Lord said to Moses, "See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That meant that Aaron would speak for Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A prophet is a spokesman.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The basic meaning of the word prophesy is to speak for someone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To prophesy, in the New Testament sense, is to speak for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to use 1 Corinthians 14:31 to impress the saints that in the church meetings we all can prophesy one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>F. Without Division</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1 Corinthians 11:17-18 the apostle Paul said, "But I give you this charge and do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and some part of it I believe."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul told the Corinthians that they were meeting not for profit but for a loss because they met with divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we must stay away from any division in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not participate in any divisive meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the type in the Old Testament, the children of Israel had to come together to one unique place, and that one unique place kept them all in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their gathering according to God's way was in oneness and was also a preservation of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The oneness among the children of Israel in ancient times was preserved by their kind of gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The children of Israel appeared before the Lord three times a year in the place chosen by God to be gathered together into one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As long as division exists yet we meet, that is not a profit to us but a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The points in this message should be sufficient to give the saints a clear view of how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to remember the focus of this message: to meet is to serve, to minister.</S>
