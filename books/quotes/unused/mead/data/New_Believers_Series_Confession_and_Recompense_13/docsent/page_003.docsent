   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. How to Return</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our manner of life has to be righteous, and our conscience must be void of offense before God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's Word says, "Then it shall be, when he sins and is guilty, that he shall return what he took by robbery" v. 4 . The word return is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are two aspects to the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, there is the need of propitiation before God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the other hand, there is the need to "return" to man that which has been taken.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not think that propitiation before God is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You must also return to man that which has been taken.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you do not return it, something is lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The trespass offering in Leviticus 5 deals with sins that do not involve material transgressions against people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of course, there is no need to return anything in that case.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the sins spoken of in chapter six involve material loss, in which case one must return something.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Propitiation through sacrifice was not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One still had to "return" that which was taken.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is why verse 4 says, "Then it shall be, when he sins and is guilty, that he shall return what he took by robbery."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everything acquired through sinful means must be returned.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One must return what was taken by robbery, what was gained through extortion, what was deposited with him, whatever has been found, and whatever has been falsely sworn.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All of these things must be returned.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How does a person return these things?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"He shall make restitution for it in full and add to it one-fifth more; he shall give it to whom it belongs on the day he is found guilty" v. 5 . Here are three things that we need to take note of.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First, we have to make restitution in full.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are wrong if we do not make any restitution.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are equally wrong if our restitution is not made in full.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No one should consider an apology as being sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the object in question remains in our house, it proves that we are still wrong; we have to return it in full.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second, God wants us to not only return in full, but also to add one-fifth more when we make a recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why must we add one-fifth?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to this principle, we have to return abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we have taken money or things from others, God wants us to add one-fifth to the full amount when we return it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God does not want His children to return the bare minimum.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In printing books one has to leave margins at the top, bottom, left, and right of a page.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Similarly, we should not be stingy in apologizing to people and returning what has been taken from them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must be generous and liberal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some people do not add one-fifth to their recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In fact, they return much less than one-fifth of what was owed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They apologize by saying, "Although I offended you in this matter, I was not wrong in other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other matters I did not offend you; rather, you offended me."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a settling of accounts, not a confession.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you want to confess, do not be that stingy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is all right to apologize more than you need to, but do not apologize less.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why did you sin in the first place?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since you have to recompense now, be more generous.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not take things away from others and then return only that much to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You have to return generously.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's children should behave in a way that is worthy of their dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even in the matter of confession, we should do it in a way that is worthy of our dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>An apology that is in the way of settling accounts is not the kind of confession that God's children should have.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's children should confess their transgressions thoroughly and add one-fifth to the recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No one should be calculating and unwilling to make the smallest of sacrifices when confessing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you are concerned about how much each party owes the other when you apologize, you are not behaving like a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some people say, "I was not angry at first, but your words made me angry.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since I have confessed my wrong already, it is your turn to confess your wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is altogether a matter of settling accounts; this is not a confession.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you are making a confession, you should go an extra mile.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Be more generous in the matter of confession.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not withhold anything in your confession; instead, try to be liberal in it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Adding one-fifth to our confession or recompense reminds us that offending others is a losing proposition and that we should never do it again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When a new believer offends others, he should realize that he will suffer loss eventually, even though he may gain something temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He took five-fifths, but he has to return six-fifths.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is easy to take something from someone.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But when you return it, you have to not only return it in full but also add one-fifth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Third, we should make our confession and recompense as soon as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Verse 5 says, "He shall give it to whom it belongs on the day he is found guilty."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If it is within our ability to return the object, or if the object in question is still in our hand, we should return it on the day we learn of this sin.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is easy for people to delay in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But the more God's children put off confession and recompense, the more their feeling will become dull.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As soon as we receive the light, we have to act upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to return it that very day.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hopefully, our brothers and sisters will take a straight path from the day they become a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should never take advantage of others and never be unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The basic principle of the Christian life on earth is not to take advantage of others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Taking advantage of others in any way is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must not take advantage of others.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Instead, we must be righteous from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have to give back to others.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should not think that everything is settled after we have made our apology and recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The matter is not settled.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>"Then he shall bring to the priest his trespass offering to Jehovah, a ram without blemish from the flock, according to the valuation, for a trespass offering" v. 6 . After we have confessed to and recompensed others, we still have to go to God for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The trespass offering in chapter five deals with just God because no material loss is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But chapter six speaks of transgression against man.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore, one must deal with man first, before going to God to ask for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Before a matter has been settled with man, one cannot go to God to ask for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>What happens once one has settled the matter with man and has asked for forgiveness before God?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>"The priest shall make propitiation for him before Jehovah, and he shall be forgiven for whatever he may have done by which he has become guilty" v. 7 . This is what the Lord wants.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Whoever has transgressed materially against man should try his best to make recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then he can come before God and ask for forgiveness through the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should not consider this as a trivial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Once we are careless, we take advantage of others and transgress against them.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God's children should remember this point and pay attention to it all their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In whatever matter they have transgressed against others, they should return these things to them and ask God for forgiveness.</S>
