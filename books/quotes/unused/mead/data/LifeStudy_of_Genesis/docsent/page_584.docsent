   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE RECOVERY WITH GAD A. Coming Back to the Victory of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Praise the Lord that, under the inspiration of God, after Dan, Jacob spoke of Gad!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With Gad we see recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After the apostasy of Dan, Gad came in to recover the lost victory 49:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The victory of Judah, the lion, had been lost by Dan's apostasy, but Gad regained it and even enlarged it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Gad is not a young lion, but a lioness producing cubs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is the continuation of the victorious Judah and Dan</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. Enlarged by God</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God was so happy about Gad's recovery of the victory that He enlarged him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Deuteronomy 33:20 says, "Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Gad was enlarged not only by God, but also for God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was enlarged for the executing of God's justice among God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>C. Crushing the Enemy</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>by the Productive Life of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Gad crushed the enemy by the productive life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Deuteronomy 33:20 says, "He dwelleth as a lioness and teareth the arm, even the crown of the head" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Gad crushed the enemy not as a lion, but as a lioness producing young lions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This implies that his destruction of the enemy is a corporate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is the same with us today in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are the young lions destroying the enemy in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>D. Taking Care of the Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The best aspect of Gad is not merely that he crushed the enemy's head, but that he would not enjoy his victory by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although he gained land on the east of the Jordan, he would not enjoy it until the other tribes had won their portion of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Gad went with the other tribes to fight the battle to gain more land so that all the tribes might be able to have their share.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The New Testament interpretation of this Old Testament figure is that we must always take care of the brothers, the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For many years I could not understand Moses' word in Deuteronomy 33:21.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This verse says, "And he provided the first part for himself, for there a portion of the lawgiver was reserved; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the Lord, and his ordinances with Israel" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although I studied this verse again and again, especially the last part about the heads of the people, I simply could not understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But today I understand this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The "first part" refers to the land east of the Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Gad provided that part for himself; yet he would not remain there to enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, he came with the heads of the people, the princes of the other tribes, to fight the battle for the rest of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here we see the action, the move, of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Dan took care of himself individualistically, but Gad took care of the Body corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the church today we would say that Gad was filled with the sense of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The reason for Gad's success was that he let go of his own enjoyment in order to take care of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is justice in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is the executing of the justice of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In New Testament terms, it is the accomplishment of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the children of Israel entered the good land, it was God's will in His justice that His people be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God did not want only Gad; He wanted all the twelve tribes to be settled to become His kingdom that His ordinances may be observed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is to accomplish the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Romans 12:1 and 2 say that if we present our bodies a living sacrifice, we shall be able to prove what the will of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Romans 12, the will of God is simply to have the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, to have the Body life, to take care of the needs of others, is to execute God's justice for observing His ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Nothing is so just as caring for the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No ordinances can be observed without the execution of God's justice.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's New Testament ordinances can only be observed in the Body of Christ, which is built up by the mutual care of its members in justice.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Dan's failure was that he was individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Gad's success was that he was corporate, moving with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Dan was for himself, but Gad was for all the tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever you are concerned only for your own spiritual interests, you are a Dan But when you forget your own spiritual interests and care for all the other brothers, that is, care for the Body, you are a Gad.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must care for the Body and move with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Are you a Dan or a Gad?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Are you taking care only of your locality or of the whole Body?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As long as we do not care for the Body, we are today's Dan, and we have fallen into a form of apostasy.</S>
