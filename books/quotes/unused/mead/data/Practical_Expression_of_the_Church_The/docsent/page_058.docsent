   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN THE CONTENT OF THE CHURCH Scripture reading: Matthew 13:3; 1 Corinthians 3:6-7; 1 Peter 1:23; 2:2, 5; Ephesians 2:21; 4:15-16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the content of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some may answer that the content of the church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is right; but when people say "Christ," sometimes they do not understand what they mean.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is the content of the church, but we must realize that this Christ who is the content of the church is life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He must be our life in order to be the content of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ does not merely come and stand among us as the content of the church; it is not in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As such, He would only be the ruler of the church, not the content of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If He is to be the content of the church, He must be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The content of the church is Christ as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All Christians recognize that Christ is in the church, but few realize that Christ in the church means that He is life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is not only in the midst of the saints, but He is also life to the saints as the content of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we say "life," we must realize that life can never be separated from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit is the reality of life, and the Spirit is life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, when we say that Christ is life to us, we must realize that this life is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He could never be life to us except in the divine Spirit, and we could never enjoy, realize, and experience Him as life unless we are in the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is in the human spirit that we realize and experience Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not just the teaching or talk about life, but the real experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why we stress that we must turn to the spirit and know how to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is similar to our relationship to the air.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our physical body has its being in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Air, in a sense, is life to us, but we need to breathe it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By breathing the air, we can realize the air as life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the same way, it is not by understanding or knowing, but by exercising our spirit to breathe that Christ as the life-giving Spirit can be realized as our very life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>NOT GOOD, BUT GOLDEN</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose there are two brothers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One is a nice man by birth, not by regeneration: he was born nice and gentle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is difficult for him to lose his temper; it even seems that he has no temper.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Regardless of what you say or do, he is never offended.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He seems to be in another world, a world without a temper.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He has an exceedingly gentle disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now he is saved and is one of the brothers, and everyone thinks that he is a wonderful brother.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Another brother, on the contrary, can so easily lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is not so refined, but indeed quite rough.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everyone in the church is afraid of him, especially the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They are afraid of his tough disposition and his capacity to easily lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Suppose we have these two brothers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One is "white," and the other is "black."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am not referring to the color of their skin, but their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Which would you love, the black one or the white one?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suppose one of these two brothers were going to stay with you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Which would you like to have?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Would you take the white one and give someone else the black?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Which would you choose?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It depends on how much you want to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Undoubtedly, the black one would contribute more to your transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But the answer is that we should prefer neither of them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not love the white nor the black, for both are natural.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Neither of them is of life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One is white, but he is not "golden."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The other is black, and he is not "golden" either.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What God wants is "gold," not white or black.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Good is not "gold" and neither is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Regardless of whether you are white or black, as long as you are not "golden," God will not take you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church is not a place for the education or correction of people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The church is not a place to change people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is the very means for God to put Christ as life into man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The black ones need life, and the white ones also need life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But according to the situation of today's Christianity, this is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today's Christianity attempts to educate, correct, and change people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you are white, they say that you are all right.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But if you are black, they try to correct, change, and improve you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The content of the church is nothing less than Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The black ones are undoubtedly short of Christ, but so are the white.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All are short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many times the white ones become a real frustration to life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In many local churches, the black ones are easier to handle as far as life is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To minister life to them is easy, but to minister life to the white ones is really difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The white ones think they are quite all right, and others also think they are good.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Within them there is a certain kind of pride in being better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All the brothers and sisters think that it is unnecessary to pray for them; they think that they must pray for the black ones.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>So eventually the white ones become a frustration to the ministry of life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is difficult to convince the white ones that they need Christ even more.</S>
