   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brothers and sisters, what are the similarities between a covenant and a testament?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What we have received from the covenant and testament is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But as far as God is concerned, they are different.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With respect to our relationship with God, it is a covenant; with respect to our relationship with the Lord, it is not a covenant, but a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord, however, is also the Executor of this testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since it is a testament, it is not effective until the Testator has died.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why chapter nine emphasized the blood of the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus has brought the blood into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This shows that the Testator has died.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this way, God knows that the Testator has died and we know it also.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the night of His betrayal, the Lord Jesus lifted up the cup and the bread, as a sign that we should remember His death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul explained the same thing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He said that the purpose of the cup and the bread is to declare His death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can declare that the Lord has died and that the testament has come into effect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yesterday we mentioned that the new covenant was mentioned in Jeremiah's time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even though there was a covenant during those five or six hundred years, it had no effect.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is like a man leaving his will in the safe or with a lawyer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The will is not effective until the man dies; only then will the items mentioned in the will become available to others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before a testator dies, the testament is just a useless piece of paper.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But one day, the Lord suddenly said, "Take, eat; this is My body...Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant" Matt 26:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By this word we can receive the testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The greatest and most glorious covenant was there for five or six hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now it is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brothers and sisters, I am not trying to delay telling you about the content of the new covenant; I am trying to show you what the new covenant is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The new covenant is the Lord's testament; it is the Lord's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can know God without anyone teaching us, and we can have the power to do God's will and please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are the things that God's new covenant and the Lord's testament have left to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For a testament, there is not only the crucial need for a witness, but more importantly there is the need for someone who will execute the testament.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many times, the executors of testaments cheat.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We sometimes find lawyers, serving as executors, who cheat.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thank God that the One who made the testament is the Lord, and the One who executes the testament is also the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As far as His death is concerned, the Lord Jesus is the One who made the testament.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As far as His resurrection is concerned, He is also the One who executes the testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He has given us the most precious and best blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He has given us salvation and victory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although the new covenant seems to include only these three items, all the needs and demands of a Christian are included in these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thank God that the Lord has brought the blood into the Holy of Holies and has told us that the Testator has died.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the High Priest, He has become the Mediator of the new covenant in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hebrews 12:22-24 says, "But you have come forward to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem; and to myriads of angels, to the universal gathering; and to the church of the firstborn, who have been enrolled in the heavens; and to God, the Judge of all; and to the spirits of righteous men who have been made perfect; and to Jesus, the Mediator of a new covenant; and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks something better than that of Abel."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here it tells us that we have not come to Mount Sinai, but Mount Zion, which is the gathering place for God, the angels, the resurrected righteous ones, and the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But this is also where the Lord Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant, is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From this, we see that the Lord is the Mediator of the new covenant in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is not only the High Priest, but He is also the Mediator, an eternal Mediator.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He lives forever and causes the new covenant to become effective in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He will see the result of His work of shedding the blood: we will know God, no one will have to teach us, and we will have the life and power to obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He has become the Mediator for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As far as God's faithfulness and righteousness are concerned, this covenant can never be repealed or annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As far as Christ's resurrection power is concerned, this covenant is forever effective.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus Christ is the One who has made the testament.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In His testament, He has left us an inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Receiving something from the testament means having something which we did not have before.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We receive it without labor and work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is something given to us by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is what it means to inherit the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many people have many foolish thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A sinner often thinks that after he has sinned, he has to try his best to do good until his sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I do not know how many years he will wait before he thinks his sins will be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Others think that after they have sinned, they should pray until they feel peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then they think that they are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Friends, this is what they do, but this is not what the testament gives to them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul said one word that was quite meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He said that, humanly speaking, children should not store up for the parents, but the parents for the children 2 Cor 12:14b .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A testament is something that others leave to us; we are only enjoying the labor of others.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We only need to sit quietly and enjoy; there is no need to labor and work.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We can inherit what others have done.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many people have asked me how they can know God's will, and why they do not know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Perhaps among us there are some who have similar questions.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I wrote in my magazine that a Christian can distinguish God's will like a man can distinguish tares from wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After a believer read the magazine, he wrote to me and said that he could not distinguish God's will in a way similar to distinguishing tares from wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What enables us to distinguish God's will is a kind of spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This knowledge causes us to know God's will without any effort or vain attempts.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This knowledge is willed to us by the Lord Jesus' testament.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is within us and causes us to know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, every Christian should know God's will, and every Christian can know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>No Christian can deny this.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Some Christians say, "It is doctrinally correct that the Bible says this.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But after I heard such a word, I was still as weak as ever.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Every time temptations came, I failed, and I am still not victorious."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Everyone who has experienced Romans 7 knows how weak they are.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All those who do not know God's power have no power in themselves to overcome the power of the world and the power within them which is the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Brothers and sisters, the way is not by thinking about what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Thank God that with the Lord, there is a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We do not have to labor and strive before we can receive; everything has been freely given to us.</S>
