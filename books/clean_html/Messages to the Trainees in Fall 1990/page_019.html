In the first chapter of the Bible, Genesis 1:2 says, "And the Spirit of God brooded upon the face of the waters" (Heb.). Then in the last chapter of the Bible, Revelation 22:17 says, "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!" At the beginning of the Bible, the Spirit is revealed as the Spirit of God. However, at the end of the Bible, the title of the Spirit of God is simplified. It is simply "the Spirit." As the Spirit of God, He has become "the Spirit." God is triune&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. After all His processes, the Triune God, the Three-One God, was consummated as the Spirit. Now the Spirit is not only the embodiment of the Father and the Son, but also the consummation, the totality, and the aggregate of the consummated, processed Triune God. When the Spirit is mentioned, the entire Triune God, comprising the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, is implied.</P><P>In Genesis 1:2 the Spirit of God did not have a companion. He was alone as a "bachelor." However, in the last chapter of the Bible, the Triune God has a counterpart, a bride. The Spirit as the Husband and His wife together say, "Come!" This indicates that His work both in the old creation and the new creation has been completed. Everything is finished, prepared, and ready. Now we are invited to come and enjoy Him by drinking the living water. The living water is the consummated Triune God as the Spirit. The consummated Triune God is both the Caller and the very drink we are called to drink. In Genesis 1:2 the Spirit of God was moving in the old creation. In the New Testament, He works in the new creation. In the last book of the Bible, God's work has been completed and consummated. Now He Himself becomes the consummated Triune God to be the Caller with His counterpart. The Spirit and the bride are now calling us to come to the feast to drink of the river of the water of life and to eat of the tree of life (Rev. 22:1-2, 17). This is to take the consummated Triune God as our drink and our food. The consummated Triune God is the river of the water of life, and He is also the tree of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WORSHIPPING THE DIVINE SPIRIT<br>WITH THE HUMAN SPIRIT</H2><P>As we have seen, the Spirit of God is first mentioned in Genesis 1:2 in relation to His creation. The Spirit of God is next mentioned in Genesis 6:3 as the Spirit of Jehovah in His relationship with man. These two verses refer to the divine Spirit. Zechariah 12:1 and Proverbs 20:27, however, refer to the human spirit. Zechariah 12:1 says, "The Lord...stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him." Proverbs 20:27 says, "The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord, searching all the inward parts" (Heb.).</P><P>In John 4:24 both the divine Spirit and the human spirit are mentioned. Verse 24 says, "God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality." This verse connects the divine Spirit revealed in Genesis 1:2 to the human spirit revealed in Zechariah and Proverbs. God is Spirit to be worshipped in the human spirit. The means of uniting the two spirits is worship. The human spirit worships the divine Spirit, and this worship joins the two spirits together. The proper meaning of worship is revealed in John 4:9-14. The central point of John 4 is the drinking of the living water. However, the immoral Samaritan woman with whom the Lord spoke was subtle, and she turned the conversation to her religious concept about worshipping God. The Lord was wiser than she, and He went on to say that the real worship which the Father is seeking is the worship of the divine Spirit in and with the human spirit. To worship in this way is to drink the living water. The real worship we render to God today is to drink Him as our living water. The more we drink Him, the more we worship Him. The New Testament never requires us to worship the Father by bowing down to Him. The New Testament requirement for our worship to God is that we drink Him. Even now we are drinking Him, and our drinking is the real worship to Him.</P><P>John 7:38-39 also shows how the divine Spirit and the human spirit are joined by drinking. These verses say, "He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified."</P>
