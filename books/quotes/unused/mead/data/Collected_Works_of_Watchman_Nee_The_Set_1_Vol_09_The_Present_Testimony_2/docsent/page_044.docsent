   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord said clearly to David, that even if his descendants were to forsake His commandments and break His laws, He could not break His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do you know when Psalm 89 was written?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was written at the time the Jews were captured in Babylon, at the time of captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The people thought that God had forgotten His covenant with David.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God promised that David's descendants would continue on the throne, and that his kingdom and house would be forever.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the kingdom was gone, and the people were exiled into the enemy's land.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Where was the king?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How could the kingdom and house be established?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the middle of all these visible things, the psalmist said to God, "But thou hast cast off and abhorred, / thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>/ Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: / thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>38-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First he mentioned God's covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then he continued with the captivity of his countrymen and their suffering under the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When he came to verse 49, he seized the covenant and interrogated God, "Lord, where are thy former loving-kindnesses, / which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Notice this word: "Lord, where are thy former loving-kindnesses, / which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Friends, have we ever prayed this way?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Have we ever been so bold in our prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many people beg for the Lord's mercy like beggars.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have never said to God, "Lord, execute the covenant that You made with me according to Your faithfulness."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Holy Spirit purposely records this interrogating prayer to God; it shows us that God loves to see us interrogating Him according to a "handle" in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we do this, it gives Him far more glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have said many wavering words to God; all these words come from an evil heart of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although we have prayed to God, we do not have any assurance at all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can God answer our prayers?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The problem is not on God's side, but on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we believe, God will surely forgive our sins and cleanse our unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He will surely fill us with the Holy Spirit and give His life to us so that we can live, grow, and be obedient children according to His new life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>With His life, we will become perfect, even as His Son the Lord Jesus was perfect, clean, undefiled, and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Can we achieve all this?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On God's side, there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The problem is whether or not we will believe in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Just as He made a covenant with David and promised His loving-kindness to him, He has made a covenant with us, who have believed in the name of His Son, and has promised us unmatched spiritual blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God loves to see us drawing nigh to Him, seeking after Him, and interrogating Him according to His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He loves to see us taking His same standing and communicating with Him, demanding that He fulfill all that He has promised in His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At this point, I have to exalt and thank God, for He has given us many "handles" in His Word so that we can lay hold of them and apply them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our God is worthy of all praises.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He will surely fulfill what He has promised and covenanted with us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brothers and sisters, have you ever realized that God has given us "handles" in His Word by which we can believe in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today, we present you this glorious truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has not only given us His promises and facts, He has given us the greatest handle of all His covenant, by which we can lay hold of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Tomorrow we will see how much this covenant includes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Presently we have seen that God has made a covenant with us and promised to accomplish the things said in the covenant for us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The believers who are weak, despondent, and cold should realize that God has made a covenant with us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He has put this handle in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let us come to Him in all boldness, interrogate Him according to this covenant, and deal with Him because this is His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He says that whoever believes in Him will see Him accomplishing things for them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The only reason the church is so feeble in strength is that it does not know the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The new covenant has been forgotten!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Has not the Bible taught us about the new covenant?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we read the Bible, we will find out that we are now in the New Testament age; we will see that the Lord Jesus died and shed His blood for the enactment of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since we know the Bible and the term the new covenant, why are we so weak and powerless?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The reason is that the letter kills, while the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We know that this is the New Testament age, but we do not know how to bargain with God and apply God's promises to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this conference, we want to consider how precious and wonderful the covenant is.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We want to see how much the new covenant includes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But in order to receive the blessing of the new covenant, we must have an honest and upright heart before God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must not only listen to the truth and know about the truth, we must also receive God's revelation before we can have the strength to believe and to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Psalm 25:14 says, "The intimate counsel of Jehovah belongs to those who fear Him, / And His covenant will He make known to them."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Unless the Lord shows us His covenant, we have no way to know about it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can hear men speaking about God's covenant, and our mind can understand something concerning the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But when we go home, we are still the same as before; we have not received anything.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are still weak and have not taken hold of God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need God to grant us a revelation in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, we must first fear God before He can show us anything.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What does it mean to fear God?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Fearing God means wanting God, desiring single-heartedly to keep His will, being fully submissive to Him, wanting nothing of ourselves, walking not according to our will, seeing not ourselves, and seeing God's greatness alone.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>According to the Hebrew language, Psalm 25 is in parallel form, where two sentences are parallel one to another, saying the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The first sentence says that the Lord reveals His intimate counsel to those who fear Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The second sentence says that He will make His covenant known to them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>From this we see that the intimate counsel of the Lord is His covenant, the covenant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Today, God's intimate counsel, the covenant, is before us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should fear Him, exalt Him, and consider ourselves as nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In this way we will see God's covenant; we will be able to inquire of God by laying hold of His covenant, and we will receive the blessing of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>May God work in this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>May He attract men and lead men to know His secret.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>On the one hand, we have to be careful about God's covenant because this is holy ground, and everyone who comes to Him has to fear Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>On the other hand, may we come boldly before Him because this covenant is filled with grace.</S>
