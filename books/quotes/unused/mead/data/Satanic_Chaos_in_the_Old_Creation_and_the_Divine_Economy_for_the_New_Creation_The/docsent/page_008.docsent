   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God's intention is to produce the new creation out of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The universe exists for this purpose, this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God created the first creation, which has become the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now out of the old creation He is producing the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This new creation is something that is mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to produce the new creation out of the old creation, God first came into the old creation as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then He lived in the old creation as a man for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He died in the old creation and then was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 to enter into all His believers, who were the old creation, to make them something new.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that all His believers have received Him as the divine economy for the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our becoming a new creation in Christ began with our regeneration, and it continues with our being sanctified, renewed, and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, we will be conformed to the image of Christ and glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That will be the consummation of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the Bible, the old creation must pass through four ages: the age before the law, the age of the law, the age of grace, and the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As believers in Christ, we are now in the third age, the age of grace, expecting to enter into the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God uses these four ages to gain the new creation out of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today the earth is filled with chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Chaos is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every part of society is chaotic.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, we should not be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In addition to the satanic chaos, there is the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whereas the satanic chaos will come to an end, the divine economy will reach a consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The end of the satanic chaos will be the lake of fire, and the consummation of the divine economy will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to realize that, both in the Bible and in our experience, the satanic chaos always goes along with the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It seems that we alternate between economy and chaos, between chaos and economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Where there is the divine economy, there is the satanic chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Where God is, Satan is also.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Satan is not behind God, following Him; rather, Satan is at God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may say that God is in the "central lane" and Satan is in the "side lane."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let us now go on to consider the record of the divine economy and the satanic chaos from Genesis to Malachi.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I. IN THE PREADAMIC AGE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There was an age before Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In that age, the preadamic age, there were the divine economy and the satanic chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A. The Divine Economy 1.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's Creation of the Heavens and the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the preadamic age, the creation of the heavens and the earth was a matter of the divine economy Gen 1:1; Job 38:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Out of nothing God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God's Orderly Creation Stirring Up</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>the Angels to Sing and Shout for Joy</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's orderly creation stirred up the angels to sing and shout for joy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Job 38:7 indicates that the angels sang and rejoiced when they saw the beautiful universe which God had created.</S>
