   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Living God</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A number of verses in the New Testament reveal that God is the living God Matt 16:16; 1 Tim 3:15; Heb 3:12; 9:14; 10:31; 12:22 .</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1 Timothy 3:15 we see that the church, the house of God, is the church of the living God....The living God who lives in the church must be subjective to the church rather than merely objective.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this parable God to whom we pray is likened to our friend, and we are likened to His friend, indicating that in prayer God is intimate to us and we are intimate to Him in a mutual love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This picture of intimacy between friends annuls the religious concept of reverence in our prayer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>27</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The prodigal son gathered everything he received from his father and traveled into a distant country where he squandered his estate, living dissolutely v. 13 .

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates that God the Father runs to receive a returning sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What eagerness this shows!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The father s falling on his son s neck and kissing him affectionately shows a warm and loving reception.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The father then said to his slaves, Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Greek word for temple in this verse, naos, does not denote the whole temple in a common way....It denotes the inner temple, the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This inner temple is the Lord God, signifying that God will be the place in which we, His redeemed, dwell and serve Him.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Psalm 90 is a prophecy of this....Our natural mind would never think that we could dwell in God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nevertheless, the entire city of New Jerusalem will be God Himself as our habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The expansion and the enlargement of God will be our eternal city in which we shall dwell for eternity.</S>
