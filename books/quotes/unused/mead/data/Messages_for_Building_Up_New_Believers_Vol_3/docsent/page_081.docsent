   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Last Four Churches Continuing</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>until the Lord s Second Coming</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 are divided into two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first three have disappeared, but the last four are still with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They will continue until the second coming of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With Thyatira, there is the prophecy, Until I come.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation 2:25 says, Nevertheless what you have hold fast until I come.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This shows us that the church in Thyatira will continue until the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church in Sardis will continue until the Lord s coming as well.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Revelation 3:3 says, Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and keep it and repent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This tells us that the church in Sardis will continue until the Lord Jesus second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church in Philadelphia will continue until the Lord s second coming because verse 11 says, I come quickly; hold fast what you have that no one take your crown.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church in Laodicea is the final church on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 21 says, He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This church is the final one and will naturally remain until the Lord Jesus second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first three churches did not receive any promise of the Lord s coming, but the last four all received a promise of the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They will surely remain until the Lord Jesus comes again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Choosing the Proper Church</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>from the Last Four Churches</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today we will consider these four churches carefully before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This will show us the pathway we should take as children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If there are four different kinds of churches on earth today and if all of them continue until the Lord comes again, what kind of attitude should a child of God have in regards to these churches?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must choose carefully from among these four churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we choose a church which is not well pleasing to the Lord and which the Lord condemns, we will suffer a great loss before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is why we have to spend some time to look at the last four churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>D. The Fourth Church Thyatira</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The fourth church is Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After the Caesar of Rome accepted Christianity as the state religion, he promoted Christianity and propped it up with his political power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Prior to this, the Roman Empire exercised its political power to suppress Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then it began to exercise its political power to support Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Consequently, Christianity was not only married to the world but even exalted above the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One meaning of the name Thyatira is a high tower.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church has now become a high tower in the world, one that is seen, respected, and worshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thyatira Being Roman Catholicism</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All Bible readers agree that the church in Thyatira signifies the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Roman Catholic Church is a union of the church with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The result is that the church is elevated in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One intrinsic problem with this is that a prophetess is produced out of this union.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This woman is called Jezebel, who assumes the role of a teacher among God s servants.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church is turned over to her rule and control.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The problem of the Roman Catholic Church is the problem described in the fourth parable in Matthew 13, where a woman takes the leaven and hides three measures of meal in it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Bible this woman signifies the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>a. Two Fundamental Sins Fornication</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>and the Eating of Sacrifices Offered to Idols</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What does this woman do?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Revelation 2:20 says, But I have something against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Jezebel has two chief sins: One is fornication, and the other is eating sacrifices offered to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These two are sins that are worthy of excommunication.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord rebuked the teachings of Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verses 21 through 23 say, And I gave her time that she might repent, and she is not willing to repent of her fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her, into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works; and her children I will kill with death; and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the inward parts and the hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your works.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church in Thyatira and the teachings of Jezebel have two characteristics: One is fornication, and the other is idol worship.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the Bible fornication means mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For a man to be in a mixture means that he is involved in fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Here we see that the Roman Catholic Church is mixed up with the world.</S>
