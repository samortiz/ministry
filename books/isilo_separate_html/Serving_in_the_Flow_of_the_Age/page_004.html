IN ORDER TO LET THE LORD LIVE OUT OF US</h2>
<p>According to Ephesians 5:19, we should speak to one another in &ldquo;psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,&rdquo; and according to Colossians 3:16, we should also teach and admonish one another with &ldquo;psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.&rdquo; These are not ordinary words; this is an exercise involving the release of our spirit. I hope that we would practice this in our meetings and not boast in our seniority, put on airs, or give the same old messages. I am worried that we may be devout Christians who love the Lord but who never use our spirit. This is the influence of Christianity. According to the truth, we should be in spirit continuously, living and walking in our spirit rather than relying on our soul. As Christians, we must exercise our spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s present flow of the age is a matter of being in spirit. Our prayer should be in spirit, our singing should be in spirit, and our speaking to one another should be in spirit. Our mind should not be our most active part; we must exercise our spirit to let the Lord live out of us.</p>
<p>If a person is in his mind, everything that he does will come out from his self. A certain brother, for example, may have a disposition that is naturally suited for cultivating godly characteristics. If he does not exercise his spirit, however, none of his living will be of the Lord. Furthermore, the Lord will not live out of him, no matter how much he testifies of the Lord&rsquo;s mercy in regard to his godly cultivation. The present flow in this age is to let the Lord live out of us through the exercise of our spirit. Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; Every method to cultivate godliness is merely a formula and an outdated routine.</p>
<p>Godly cultivation is not the focus of God&rsquo;s will, but the pursuit of godly cultivation has been a tradition in Christianity since the first century. In contrast to this, the Lord has been doing a recovery work throughout the centuries, and today He is recovering our experience of the spirit. This is a new beginning. We should not give long messages but instead speak in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs directly from our spirit. We can also pray-read. We do not need to compose prayers; we only need to release our spirit. Whether we are speaking hymns to one another or pray-reading verses, we can release our spirit to supply and edify the saints. We do not have to speak hymns rigidly, but in principle, the way that we meet must come out of our spirit. We must flee everything of the mind, knowledge, and routine.</p>
<p>Among the various churches in the Far East, Hong Kong is under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing for two reasons: First, the older saints do their best to give the young saints an opportunity to function. Second, the young saints are able to advance and learn lessons, while still submitting to and cooperating with the older ones. If the older saints believed that the young saints were not sensible enough and kept the service to themselves, the situation in Hong Kong would be finished. Several elders in Hong Kong have been blessed with a realization of their limitations, and they have encouraged the young people to rise up to fill up their lack. In this way the older saints are a blessing to the church, and the church has no problems. If the older saints do not give the young saints an opportunity to function, there will be much loss. Being able to advance is a strength of the young people, but the young people must learn the lesson of submission. The church profits greatly when older and younger saints coordinate with each other.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE CHURCHES ACCORDING TO ONE VISION</h2>
<p>My burden is not related to outward affairs but to our inner vision. If we can see the vision clearly, we will be able to bring the churches into living in the spirit and living one with the Lord. This cannot be achieved in a short period of time. It may take quite a long time to bring the brothers and sisters into the spirit in order to practically experience Christ living in us. This requires that the elders, co-workers, and responsible brothers see the vision and pursue, fellowship, and pray together so that they may be in one spirit to bring the churches into this vision.</p>
<p>If the brothers see this vision, they should bear the burden to bring the saints into the spirit, into the flow of the age. The brothers and sisters who see this vision should come together to fellowship, pray, and pursue the Lord in one spirit. I believe that the Lord will give us a definite leading every day. Then our supply of the word in the meetings will not be the issue of our opinions but of our fellowship. In this fellowship we will have a sense of what to speak on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, who should speak, and what material to use. We do not have a lack of material among us. In both English and Chinese a considerable number of messages have been released. The most important thing, however, is to fellowship and pursue together in one spirit. The brothers in the various churches should not be like public servants who carry out routines and follow old methods. This will not bring in any blessing.</p>
<p>If we fellowship and pursue according to this one vision, the Lord will clearly and practically lead us in the meetings of the church. The Lord&rsquo;s supply is living and constant. We need to draw out the Lord&rsquo;s supply from these messages by entering into them ourselves and by having fellowship with one another in order to bring the saints into them. This is the principle of Paul&rsquo;s charge in 2 Timothy 2:2, which says, &ldquo;The things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also.&rdquo; Paul wanted Timothy to be clear concerning the vision so that he could lead others, who then could teach others as well. Although the local churches are autonomous, there is only one testimony, and everyone should go forward in the flow according to one vision.</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul speaks of not teaching different things rather than God&rsquo;s economy. This indicates that there was a group of people in the church who were not necessarily teaching heresy but who were teaching something different from the central vision of the apostles. Hence, Paul wanted Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones in the church not to teach things that differ from the central vision of God. We should apply this principle in the local churches. The churches need to see the central vision and take it as their way and goal. I hope that we would see this and then fellowship, pray, and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading together with the serving ones in our locality. Then we will provide the whole church with a timely leading in one spirit. We must drop our old methods and set practices; nevertheless, we are not simply replacing old methods with new methods. Instead, we are seeking to be governed by the vision and to advance according to the Lord&rsquo;s present leading.</p>
<p>Wherever the co-workers serve, they should not consider themselves as &ldquo;message-giving&rdquo; co-workers; instead, they should fellowship and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading with the brothers in one spirit. In regard to weekly meetings or the Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings, the co-workers should learn to take the new way in spirit and not give old, routine messages based on old experiences. The revelation that the Lord has shown us is of our living Lord, who passed through death, resurrection, and ascension to become the life-giving Spirit in our spirit so that He can live in us, and we can live one with Him. When we live according to our mingled spirit, we are Christians who are living with the Lord.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
