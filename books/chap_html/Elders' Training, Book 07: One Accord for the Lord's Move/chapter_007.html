<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">A WISE MASTER BUILDER<br />
AND THE BUILDING OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 3:3-23</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A MATTER OF LIFE AND THE GROWTH IN LIFE</h2>
<p>After fellowshipping in the last chapter concerning the uncertain sounding of the trumpet in the Lord&rsquo;s ministry, which refers to the army fighting the battle, I would like to fellowship in this chapter concerning the wise master builder and the building of God. The fellowship in this chapter is different in nature from that of the last chapter. When we go to the front to fight the battle, we have to be bold. Then we can win the war. But when we come to build, we have to be wise. We have to realize that the building which we are building is altogether a matter in life. The twenty-one verses of the Scripture reading show us that the wise master builder and the building of God are both matters of life and in life. First, Paul&rsquo;s ministry was a matter of planting. Paul said, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow&rdquo; (3:6). This is not a matter of fighting, but a matter of the growth in life. Then Paul goes on to say that we are God&rsquo;s cultivated land, God&rsquo;s farm (3:9). This farm is not wild or uncultivated, but it is a farm cultivated by God to grow Christ. A farm is also a matter of life. Then Paul says that we are not only God&rsquo;s farm but also God&rsquo;s building (3:9). This building surely is a building in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING HEED HOW WE BUILD</h2>
<p>Paul continues to tell the Corinthians that he has laid the foundation as a wise master builder, and the rest of the believers, whether they are co-workers like Apollos or believers in the church, are all workers, builders. Each one is a builder, yet you have to be careful, to take heed, with what you build and how you build. If you build with the transformed precious materials&mdash;gold, silver, and precious stones&mdash;you will receive a reward. If you build with other categories of material&mdash;wood, grass, and stubble&mdash;that will be burnt and you will lose your reward. You will still be saved, yet saved as through fire (3:15). To be saved through fire indicates clearly that you will be saved through a certain amount of discipline. To be saved through fire is to be saved through a certain kind of burning purification, a certain kind of purging. This is a suffering, a discipline, and a kind of punishment. Those who build with the wrong material will be saved through punishment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING CARE OF THE TEMPLE OF GOD</h2>
<p>Paul continues to say that we need to realize that we are the temple of God (v. 16). Apparently, these verses are not in a good continuation. Although it may appear that each of these verses stands alone, in the apostle&rsquo;s thought when he wrote this chapter, all these items are connected with one another. On the one hand, we are the workers who are working on God&rsquo;s building. On the other hand, we ourselves are the building, the temple. It is not merely a matter of how we build, but we also need to realize how we treat this temple. If you deal with the temple of God carefully, you will not destroy it. If you deal with it carelessly, He will destroy you. First Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;If anyone destroys the temple of God, God shall destroy him.&rdquo; This is not to perish forever, but to experience God&rsquo;s dealing, God&rsquo;s punishment.</p>
<p>According to my understanding of the holy Word, to be saved through fire will surely be in the future, but for God to destroy the one who destroys His temple is surely in this age. In this age, the one who destroys the temple of God will suffer God&rsquo;s destruction. This is similar to what Paul talks about in 1 Corinthians 11. If we eat the bread and drink the cup at the Lord&rsquo;s table in an unworthy manner, we eat and drink judgment to ourselves. Paul goes on to say that this is why &ldquo;many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep&rdquo; (v. 30). The Lord firstly disciplined the ones who participated in His table in an unworthy manner so that they were weak physically. Then, since they would not repent of their offense, they were further disciplined to be sick. Because they still would not repent, the Lord judged them by death. This death is not a curse, but a destruction, because of a person ruining or destroying the temple of God. To partake of the Lord&rsquo;s table in an improper manner is to destroy the temple because the Body that we partake of at the Lord&rsquo;s table signifies God&rsquo;s building. The Body in chapter eleven is the temple in chapter three.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 3 is a chapter full of seriousness. The church as the temple of God is also God&rsquo;s farm and God&rsquo;s building. God&rsquo;s farm, God&rsquo;s building, is altogether a matter of life plus transformation. We all have to be very serious concerning ourselves. We have to grow in life. We have to learn how to build and with what to build. The way you build must be the way in life, and the materials with which you build have to be the substances of life plus transformation. Our future destiny for at least one thousand years depends upon how we grow and how we take care of God&rsquo;s unique building in this universe, His temple. You have to be careful not to do anything to destroy this temple. If you destroy this temple, the church, God will deal with you, God will destroy you. When you come to the Lord&rsquo;s table, you touch the Lord&rsquo;s Body, the mystical Body of Christ, which is the temple of God. If you touch the Lord&rsquo;s Body carelessly; you will damage it, and to damage the Body is to destroy the temple. If you destroy the temple, God will destroy you.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 11 the way God disciplines us is firstly to give us an alarm. Whenever we get sick, we should not take it for granted. Do not think that your getting the flu is merely a physical matter due to the fact that everyone is getting it. Some people did not get the flu, so why are you among the number who did get it? There should be a reason. Whatever happens to us, we have to believe that it is sovereign of the Lord. Even a small case of the flu that comes to us may mean something. We have to consider in this way. If you have a small case of the flu, this should cause you to go to the Lord to have a full exam. Do not only go to the doctor to have a test of your blood, of your blood pressure, or of your heart. You had better spend more time to be tested by the Lord. Let the Lord speak a word to you. Take your sickness as a warning. I assure you that you will surely be healed. Do not excuse your illness as a mere natural occurrence. Whatever happens to us must remind us that we should go to Him to be enlightened, to be exposed, to be tested, to be examined. We have to receive the Lord&rsquo;s warning; otherwise, death will come. Death surely is not a curse to us because we have been saved from the curse already. Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law (Gal. 3:13). But the New Testament does not say that we will not be disciplined.</p>
