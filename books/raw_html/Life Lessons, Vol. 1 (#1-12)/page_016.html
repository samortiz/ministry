<h1 class="msg">LESSON TEN</h1><h1 class="msg">KNOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1><p>The Holy Spirit is the One who brings in the Triune God for our experience and enjoyment. Therefore, we should also know Him that we may richly experience Him.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p><b>1) “Baptizing them into…the Father and…the Son and…the Holy Spirit”</b> (Matt. 28:19).</p><p>In the divine Trinity, the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of God, is listed last, showing that He is the ultimate expression of the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE TRIUNE GOD REACHING AND ENTERING INTO THE BELIEVERS</h2><p><b>1) “The Father…will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality”</b> (John 14:16-17).</p><p>It says here that the Holy Spirit is the Triune God reaching man, that is, the Triune God becoming the Spirit to reach man and be with him forever.<p><b>2) “The Spirit of reality…shall be in you…and I [the Son] in you”</b> (John 14:17, 20).</p><p>This word further shows us that the Holy Spirit, who reaches us with the Father and the Son, will also enter into us. This indicates that He is the Triune God entering into the believers. When He enters into us, the Father and the Son enter into us (John 14:23).</p><h2 class="head1">III. WHAT THE HOLY SPIRIT IS</h2><p><b>1) The “Spirit of God”</b> (Gen. 1:2), participating in God’s work of creation.</p><p><b>2) The “Spirit of Jehovah”</b> (2 Chron. 20:14), participating in God’s relationship with man (Gen. 2:7).</p><p><b>3) The “Holy Spirit”</b> (Luke 1:35), participating in Christ’s incarnation to sanctify man unto God.</p><p><b>4) The “Spirit of Jesus”</b> (Acts 16:7), participating in the birth, the living, and the sufferings of Jesus.</p><p><b>5) The “Spirit of Christ”</b> (Rom. 8:9), participating in the resurrection of Christ and the impartation of life.</p><p><b>6) The “Spirit of Jesus Christ”</b> (Phil. 1:19), participating in the birth, living, and death of Jesus, as well as in the resurrection of Christ and the impartation of life, with a bountiful supply that the believers may be saved in all things.</p><p><b>7) The “Spirit of life”</b> (Rom. 8:2), <b>“the life-giving Spirit”</b> (1 Cor. 15:45), participating in Christ being man’s life and giving man life.</p><p><b>8) “The Spirit…for the Spirit was not yet [before the resurrection of Christ], because Jesus was not yet glorified [through resurrection]”</b> (John 7:39).</p><p>The Spirit here is the issue of the Holy Spirit having passed through all the items of what He is, mentioned above. Thus, He is the all-inclusive and consummated Spirit as the ultimate expression of the Triune God to reach and enter into those who believe into Christ.</p><p><b>9) The “seven Spirits”</b> (Rev. 1:4), referring to the sevenfold intensified Spirit, that the church in desolation may receive the sevenfold riches of grace and power.</p>
