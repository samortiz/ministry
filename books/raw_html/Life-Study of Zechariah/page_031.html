<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. To Turn to the Reality of a Godly Life</H2><P>Israel was advised not only to turn from the vanity of their ritualistic religion but also to turn to the reality of a godly life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Hearken to the Word of God</H2><P>First, Israel was told to hearken to the word of God proclaimed by the prophets (Zech. 7:7, 11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Judging with Judgment of Truth</H2><P>If the people of Israel were to have the reality of a godly life, they would have to judge with judgment of truth, show lovingkindness and compassion each to his brother, not oppress the widow and the orphan, the stranger and the poor, and none of them was to think evil in his heart about his brother (vv. 9-10; 8:16b-17a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Each Man Speaking Truth to His Neighbor</H2><P>Further, God's people were charged each man to speak truth to his neighbor. They were not to think evil in their hearts about their neighbor, and they were not to love a false oath, for these are things hated by Jehovah (8:16a, 17b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Loving Truth and Peace</H2><P>Finally, the children of Israel were to love truth and peace (v. 19b). They were advised to turn from their ritualistic religion with its weeping and fasting to the reality of a godly life, a life full of righteousness, lovingkindness, compassion, truth, and peace.</P>
