   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many today apply this passage incorrectly.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They think that the Lord Jesus wants us to love our neighbor as ourself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whether it is the Bible schools, the Sunday schools, or the Sunday pulpits, they all tell people that one has to be a good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have to love your neighbors, to show mercy to them, and to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To them, who is the neighbor?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is the one who was wounded by the robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And who are we?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But this is exactly the opposite of what the Lord Jesus was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What the Lord meant was that we are the ones wounded by the robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who then is our neighbor?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our neighbor is the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We think that we are the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can move.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can walk.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we see those bound by sin, we are able to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the Lord Jesus said that we are not the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, we need the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are the man wounded by robbers on the journey.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are those who are waiting to die.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not have any good works.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Who is our neighbor?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is it to love our neighbor as ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It does not say that we have to love others as ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It means that we have to love the Savior as ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It does not mean that we must first love others before we can inherit eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, it means that if we love the Savior, the Samaritan, we will surely have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The problem today is that man continually thinks of works.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When he reads Luke 10, he says to himself: "Someone is wounded.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Someone is dying.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If I care for him and love him, I will be a good Samaritan, and I will have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We think that when we help others, we will inherit eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the Lord Jesus said if you allow someone to help you, you will have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>None among us is qualified to be the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thank the Lord, we do not have to be the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have a good Samaritan already.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This Samaritan, who formerly had no dealings with us, has now come.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He has died and has solved the problem of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is now resurrected, and He has given us a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This One has bound up our wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He has given us redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is helping us and is bringing us to heaven, that God would accept us and care for us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Finally, we have verse 37: "And he said, The one who showed mercy to him."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This time the lawyer answered correctly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He answered that it is the One who showed mercy to him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The One who shows mercy to me is my neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>My neighbor is the Samaritan who stopped to bind up my wounds with the oil and the wine, who put me on the beast and brought me to the inn.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>My friends, the whole question is not to be the neighbor of someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, it is the One who showed mercy to you becoming your neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Jesus said, "Go, and you do likewise."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This word confuses many people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They think that the Lord is telling us to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But what this word means is that your neighbor is the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore you should accept Him as your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since your neighbor is the good Samaritan, you must be the one wounded by the robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This shows us that while we were lying there, He came and saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Never say that we can do anything ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Never say that we have the way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is showing us that we have to let Him do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have to let Him pour the oil and the wine on our wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have to let Him bind up our wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have to let Him put us up on the beast and bring us to the inn.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have to let Him do the work of taking care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to be like the one wounded.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We do not have to be like the Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Man's greatest failure is to think that he should do something.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Man always wants to be his own savior.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He always wants to save others.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But God has not appointed us to be the savior.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God says that we are the ones to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hence, the Lord's word fully answered the lawyer's question.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It does not mean that one should not love God with his whole heart, his whole soul, his whole strength, and his whole mind.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The question is whether or not he can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We cannot do it either.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have a wounded life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Actually, our real condition is that we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Our body is living, but our spirit is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We need salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We cannot help God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Neither can we help man.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we think that we can do something, we will not experience the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The work of the cross and the work of the Holy Spirit will not come upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Hence, remember that Luke 10:25-37 never tells us that man is saved through loving God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>On the contrary, it says that the Samaritan was first moved with compassion before we could love.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He loves first, and then we can love.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Before He has loved, we cannot love.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is true that if any man does not love the Lord, he is accursed.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In Luke 7, the Lord Jesus told Simon that he who has been forgiven the most loves the most, and he who has been forgiven little loves little.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Love comes after forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is not a matter that he who loves much receives much forgiveness, and he who loves little receives little forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>However much a person is forgiven, that is how much he loves.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>A Christian loves the Lord because He has saved him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If you cannot even love the Samaritan, then I do not know what I can say of you.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>There is no such person on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>There is no one on earth who does not love the Lord at all; everyone has to love Him at least a little.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The Lord said that he who has been forgiven little loves little.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It does not say that there is no love.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Everyone loves Him to a greater or lesser extent.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>However, the condition of salvation is not our love.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If I am saved because I love the Lord, then one can see that this is very unreliable.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Within two or three days, I can change so many times.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I am one who has been wounded by the robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I am lying there.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>I can do nothing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I am at the end of myself.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I do not love God with all my heart, and I do not love my neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>But now I allow Him to save me.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>After He has saved me, I can love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We love Him because He has first loved us.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>It is God's love in us that has produced our love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>It is utterly impossible for us by ourselves to produce a love for God.</S>
