<h2 class=head2>In God’s Order and Government</h2><p>The Christian walk is also a walk in God’s order (5:22—6:9). In our human relationships there must be God’s order. Whether you are a wife or a husband, you must keep your position. Whether you are a child or a parent, you also must keep your position. Even masters and slaves have their own positions. All of these relationships were not invented by man. Rather, they were arranged by God. They are matters involving God’s government and God’s administration. The Christian walk is one that keeps God’s order in human relationships. This is very important. It is not merely a matter of ethics; it is a matter of obedience to God’s government. If we do not stand in our proper position to keep God’s order, we are rebellious against God’s government. If God created you as a woman and married you to a husband, you have to keep your position and stand in it. This maintains the right order. Then you will be obedient, not rebellious, to God’s government.<p>For wives to be submissive to their husbands is not a matter of mere ethics. We must have the highest viewpoint concerning these things. Human relationships are matters related to God’s government. The teachings of Confucius are from the human point of view, but the teachings in the book of Ephesians are from the heavenly point of view, showing us the order in God’s government. For a child not to honor his parents is against not only human ethics but even more against God’s government. The young brothers and sisters must see that to go against ethics may be a small matter, but to go against the divine government is very serious. If a child honors his parents, he will receive the blessing. If he keeps the order in God’s government, he will enjoy all that God has arranged. Otherwise, he will be grieved.<p>God’s order in His government expresses God Himself. Why are there husbands? It is to express Christ. Why are there parents? Parents are the expression of God as the Father. Similarly, why are there masters? Masters are the representatives of God as the Lord and the Master. In all of these relationships God is expressed and represented. God arranged these human relationships in order to express Himself. Therefore, if we are disobedient against God’s order, we damage God’s expression and representation. In a marriage relationship, the husband and wife are a representation of Christ and the church. If a wife does not keep her proper order and rises up to become the head, the representation of Christ and the church in their home is spoiled. This is not merely a matter of ethics and morality. It is a matter of God’s government and God’s representation.<p>The arrangement of the entire universe is a representation of God Himself. When all things keep their proper position in the right order, God is represented and expressed. But if any part of creation does not keep its position and breaks the order, the representation and expression of God is damaged in that part. We must see the book of Ephesians from this point of view.<p>We were created and arranged according to the order in God’s government to represent God and express God. The race of Adam failed the Lord in this matter, but the Lord by His redemption has brought us back and strengthened us with Himself as life within us. Now we must keep our position in the proper order to represent God and express God in our daily walk. Therefore, the walk of the church is by the Spirit, in the Body, and for the representation and expression of God.<h2 class=head2>In Christ</h2><p>The walk of the church is a walk not only in the Spirit but also in Christ. Christ is the essence, reality, centrality, and universality of this walk. Our walk must be a walk that expresses Christ, exalts Christ, testifies Christ, ministers Christ, releases Christ, and shares Christ with others. In summary, our walk today must be a walk by the Spirit, in the Body, in the order and government of God, and in Christ. This is the walk of the church today on this earth.
