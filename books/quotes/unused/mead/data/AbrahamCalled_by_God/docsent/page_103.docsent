   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ABRAHAM'S TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Abraham, one who had suffered the loss of his dear wife, had a very strong testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Hittites addressed him as lord and called him "a mighty prince" v. 6 . The Hebrew words translated "mighty prince" may also be rendered "a prince of God." In Hebrew, the word for "mighty" is the word for God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Abraham expressed God as a prince of God and was respectable as a mighty prince.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In his own eyes, he was a stranger, but in the eyes of the people, he was a mighty prince and a prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was truly a weighty man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all need to be weighty and have the same kind of testimony that Abraham had.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In our neighborhoods, occupations, and schools, we must not be light and allow others to look down on us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must be weighty, and others must estimate us very highly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although we should not estimate ourselves so highly, we must be high in the eyes of others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I hope that the teachers in the junior high schools will say that the young brothers from the church who are students in their class are mighty princes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Young brothers, do not just pray boldly in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You must also be weighty in school.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Simply having good behavior does not mean very much.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must have weight.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Gold and diamonds are weighty, but popcorn and cotton candy are light.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you are gold or diamond, you will have weight.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As God's called ones, we Christians should be so weighty that people are surprised and say, "Why is this young man so weighty?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is neither common nor abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although he is a normal young man, there is no lightness with him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He must be a prince."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are weighty because we have God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The called ones need to call on the name of Jehovah, El Olam.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more Abraham called on this title of the divine Being, the more weighty he became.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is gold.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we call on Him, we shall become golden.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The more we call on the golden God, the more of His golden element will be infused into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Consider the difference between wood and petrified wood.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Wood is light, but petrified wood is weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is even more weighty than stone, because weighty minerals have been wrought into it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all were born light, but we have been reborn to be weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In addition to our rebirth, we have the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The way in which wood becomes petrified is through the continuous flow of water.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This flow of water carries away the element of wood and adds in its place the element of various minerals, transforming the wood into a weighty, precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is insufficient for us merely to be good neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must be weighty children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As God's called ones, we are now under His infusion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must be so strong and weighty that people will say that we are a mighty prince, a prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a mighty prince, Abraham was respectable v. 6 . He respected others and received their respect in return.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was also wise vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>3-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this chapter we see that Abraham had a wise way of communing with people, speaking to them in a very tasteful and wise manner.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, Abraham was honest and did not take advantage of anyone vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His intention was to purchase the sepulcher.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When it was politely offered to him as a gift, Abraham, after learning that its value was four hundred shekels of silver, agreed to pay the full amount.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He did not seize the opportunity to take advantage of others, and he did not bargain about the price.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He gave Ephron the price he asked, paying the full amount, the full money.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Likewise, we should not impress people with our scarcity; we must show our riches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I feel badly about the low level of morality in today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What a poor standard of behavior there is!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must express God showing that we, as the children of God, are weighty, respectable, and honest.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should be willing to suffer loss, but not to take advantage of others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether we lose or gain means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we lose, we shall still live; if we gain, we cannot live any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How we must learn to be honest and respectable, expressing God in a weighty manner.</S>
