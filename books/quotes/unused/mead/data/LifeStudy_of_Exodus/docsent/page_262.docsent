   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF THE DIVINE ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The children of Israel, however, had absolutely no understanding of God s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But Moses was a man who knew God s heart and His intention.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, he enacted the law not according to the intention of the children of Israel, but according to the intention of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No matter how foolish and ignorant the children of Israel were, Moses nevertheless enacted the law according to God s way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God s way was to show the people that, in His sight, they were fallen, sinful, and corrupted and that they desperately needed God s redemption and forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God, of course, was willing to redeem the people and to forgive their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After they received redemption and forgiveness, the redeeming blood would bring them into God s presence where they could contact Him, receive Him into them, and be constituted into pillars as a living testimony of God, a reflection of what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a basic principle which operates in the universe unto this day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to this basic principle of the divine economy, the Bible first reveals to us what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, the Bible enables us to realize that we are fallen, sinful, corrupted, altogether hopeless and helpless.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, the Lord has accomplished redemption for us, and His blood is available to cleanse us and bring us into His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now He is waiting for us to repent, turn to Him, and receive His redemption and forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the revelation in the New Testament, we are not only brought into God s presence we are brought into God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Oh, the redeeming and cleansing blood brings us into God!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This gives us the ground and the standing to receive God, to enjoy God, and to eat and drink of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, by partaking of God in this way, we shall become pillars, His living testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE WAY TO BECOME PILLARS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do you have the confidence to say that you are a pillar of God?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all should be able to declare, Yes, I was a fallen, sinful, and corrupted person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hallelujah, the precious blood has redeemed me and brought me into God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now I am filled with God and I have become a pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you do not have the assurance to make such a declaration now, I am confident that in eternity you will have the boldness to declare that you are a pillar testifying what God is and reflecting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The way to become such a pillar is the way of enjoyment; it is the way of eating of Him as our life supply and drinking of Him as our living water.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By eating and drinking Him we enjoy Him and are constituted of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is God s economy according to the revelation in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The enactment of the law in Exodus 24 was fully according to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The principle is the same with the Bible as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just as the children of Israel were foolish in promising to obey all that the Lord had spoken, so many of today s Christians are foolish in thinking that they are able to obey what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When many believers read the Scriptures, they think that the commandments contained in the Word are for them to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, in Ephesians 5:22 and 25 Paul charges wives to submit to their husbands and husbands to love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, no husband is truly able to love his wife, and no wife can submit to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In my entire life, I have never seen one husband who genuinely loved his wife or one wife who truly submitted to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, every wife is stubborn and rebellious, and every husband is full of love for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, we simply are not able to observe the commandments found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead of trying to carry out these commandments, we should confess, in the light of the revelation in the Bible, that we are fallen, sinful, and corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to be convinced, convicted, and subdued so that we may repent and receive God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then the redeeming blood of Christ will bring us into the Triune God, and we shall be infused with Him to become pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only such pillars can love their wives or submit to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this message we have seen the basic concept of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This concept is not that God s people should keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The law was decreed by God not that His people might observe it, but that through it they might come to know God in a positive way and know themselves in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Having a proper knowledge of God and of themselves, they would then repent and receive God s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through the redeeming blood, they would be brought into the presence of God to receive the infusion of God to become pillars as a living testimony and reflection of what God is.</S>
