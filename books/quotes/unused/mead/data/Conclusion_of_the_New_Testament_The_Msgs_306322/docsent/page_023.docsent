   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED THIRTEEN EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE EPISTLES 19 34.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Grace of God</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 15:10 unveils that for our experience and enjoyment, Christ is the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Grace is the central thought of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul says in 1:4, I thank my God always concerning you based upon the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 9 Paul goes on to say that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that God has called us to participate in, or to partake of, the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fellowship, the enjoyment, and the partaking of Christ are grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>a. The Resurrected Christ Becoming</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>the Life-giving Spirit to Bring</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>the Processed Triune God in Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>into the Believers to Be Their Life and Life Supply</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That They May Live in Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First Corinthians 15:10 says, By the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Grace, mentioned three times in this verse, is the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit v. 45 to bring the processed Triune God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply that we may live in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, grace is the Triune God becoming life and everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Apart from the Triune God being processed in Christ, He cannot be enjoyed by us as the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Apart from the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit, the grace of God cannot reach us, and we cannot participate in it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the grace of God must be the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit for our participation in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The enjoyment of the processed Triune God is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Anything we eat must first be processed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Apart from being processed in resurrection to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, God cannot be eaten and enjoyed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our Triune God is not only God in creation, but, much more, He is God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God in creation is for our worship, but God in resurrection is not only for our worship but also for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Jews know how to worship God only as their Creator; however, we enjoy our Triune God as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God in resurrection is for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, the grace of God is altogether a matter in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The unprocessed God is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, grace is the Triune God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The God in Paul s ministry is not merely the God of creation He is God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Resurrection involves the process of incarnation, human living, and crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After passing through this process in Christ, the Triune God entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, when we speak of God as the God of resurrection, we imply the process through which He has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ passed through incarnation, through thirty-three and a half years of human living, and through six hours of crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After He died, He was placed in a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then He went into Hades and had a tour of the realm of death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Following that, He came forth in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now He is the God not only of creation but also of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This processed God is now our grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ, the grace of God, is now in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit, the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since He is in resurrection, we, His believers, should also be in resurrection and live in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Resurrection means that all the old, natural things have been terminated and that something new and spiritual has been germinated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is resurrection the termination of the natural and the germination of the spiritual, to transform the natural into the spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In resurrection we do not live a natural life but a life that was terminated in the old nature and germinated in the new nature to make us members of Christ.</S>
