   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Mingling of the Processed and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Consummated Triune God with the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>as the Unique Body in the Universe</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Body of Christ is the mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with the believers as the unique Body in the universe Eph 4:3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In November 1991 I gave six messages on "The Intrinsic View of the Body of Christ," which were later published as a book by that title.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In those messages I spoke on the high and deep view of the Body of Christ in the first four chapters of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The content of those messages shows that in one sense I do have a certain amount of understanding concerning the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, in some senses, I must say that even today I still do not know the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In his earlier ministry in China, Brother Nee spoke a great deal on the normal Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1938 he went to Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He stayed mainly in England, but he also visited Denmark, Norway, Germany, and Switzerland.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some of his messages spoken during that time were compiled by Angus Kinnear to form the book The Normal Christian Life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After returning to China in the summer of 1939, he gathered us for a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In that conference his emphasis was on knowing the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother Nee continued to speak on knowing the Body of Christ until 1942.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Immediately after those three years, a turmoil rose up in the church in Shanghai that caused Brother Nee to be unable to minister for six years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During the period of Brother Nee's speaking on knowing the Body, he conducted a four-month training.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In every meeting he asked one of the trainees to give a testimony concerning how he came to know the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nearly everyone was exposed by him for their inadequate knowledge of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Epistle of 1 Corinthians speaks first concerning the Body in chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then, in chapter fourteen, Paul used an interchangeable term, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul did not use the term the Body of Christ; he spoke only of the church vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>4-5, 12, 19, 23, 28, 33-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Body of Christ is somewhat abstract and far away to our senses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church, however, is practical and near to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church as the Body of Christ can be built up only by prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Merely to preach the gospel to get people into the church does not build the church as an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the end of the synoptic Gospels Matthew, Mark, and Luke the Lord commanded the disciples to go and preach the gospel Matt 28:19-20; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:46-49 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But in the Gospel of John the Lord told the disciples to go forth and bear fruit 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Bearing fruit is for the building up of an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This involves not only getting people saved but also bringing them into the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Ephesians 4:3-6 speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This depicts a mingling of the Triune God the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father with the church as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are divine, but the Body is human.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Four parties are mingled together: the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father three parties on the divine side and the Body one party on the human side .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is depicted in Ephesians 4 is not three-in-one but four-in-one one entity comprising the Spirit, the Lord, the Father, and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These four are mingled together to be one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This entity is a marvelous consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the whole universe there is such an entity: the Triune God the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father mingled with a group of men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the Triune God were not mingled with this Body, it would be a corpse, not a body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But because the Triune God is the life element to this Body, it is not a dead corpse but an organic entity, an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to build up such an organism, we must be able to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even today our prophesying is still not very much in the nature of prophesying, but very much in the nature of a testimony or in the nature of giving a word of exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To prophesy is to convey the divine element into people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we read Paul's fourteen Epistles, we sense that in every page there is the dispensing of life into our spiritual being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, Paul's writing was a prophesying.</S>
