<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Making an Eternal Covenant with Them<br>That He Will Not Turn Away from Them</H2><P>In Jeremiah 32:40-44 Jehovah said that He would make an eternal covenant with them that He will not turn away from them. He will do them good. He will plant them in the holy land, and fields will be bought there.</P><P>This eternal covenant is the new covenant (31:31-34). It is by this covenant that God will not turn away from us and will plant us in Christ, our good land, and Christ in all His aspects will be bought by us. To buy Christ is to pay a price to gain Christ by forgetting the things that are behind and pursuing Christ (Phil. 3:13-14).</P><P>God's answer to Jeremiah surely was wise and wonderful.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE WORD OF JEHOVAH<br>COMING TO JEREMIAH A SECOND TIME<br>AS A REAFFIRMATION OF HIS PROMISE<br>CONCERNING THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL</H2><P>While Jeremiah was still imprisoned, the word of Jehovah came to him a second time as a reaffirmation of His promise concerning the restoration of Israel (33:1-26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah Bringing the City of Jerusalem Recovery and Healing</H2><P>Jehovah promised to bring the city of Jerusalem recovery and healing. He said that He would reveal to them an abundance of peace and truth and would turn the captivity of Israel and build them up as in the former time. He also promised that He would cleanse them from their iniquity, by which they have sinned against Him, and forgive all their iniquities, by which they have sinned against Him and have transgressed against Him (vv. 6-8).</P><P>In verse 9 Jehovah made this further promise concerning Jerusalem: "It will be a name of gladness and a praise and a glory to Me before all the nations of the earth, who will hear of all the good that I am about to do for them; and they will fear and tremble because of all the good and because of all the peace that I am about to provide for it." In addition to being a promise concerning Jerusalem, this is also a picture of today's church life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. There Being Heard in the City of Jerusalem the Voice of Gladness</H2><P>According to verses 10 and 11, there will be heard in the city of Jerusalem the voice of gladness, the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, the voice of the bride, and the voice of those who say, "Praise Jehovah of hosts, for Jehovah is good, for His lovingkindness is forever." He will turn the captivity of the holy land.</P>
