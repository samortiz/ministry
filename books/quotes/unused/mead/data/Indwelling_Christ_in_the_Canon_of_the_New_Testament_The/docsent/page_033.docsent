   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TREASURE OF HIS FACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Corinthians also gives us another extraordinary verse.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us 2 Cor 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is not such a verse in any other book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul tells us that we are the vessels, and the Lord Jesus within us is the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the key to this verse is the verse preceding it: to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ 2 Cor 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Greek, the word for face is the same word used for person in 2 Corinthians 2:10, which means the index around the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that if we don t have the index of Jesus face, He can never be a treasure to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We will never sense that we have a treasure within until we see the face of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we are enjoying His presence, we sense that He is such a precious treasure within us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This can never be just a kind of saying.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all can say that we are the earthen vessel, and Jesus is the treasure within.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But we can say this without any sense of the reality within us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is only when we are living in His presence, looking at the index of His being, that we will sense that He is such a treasure to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the whole universe, there is nothing so precious as to behold the face of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is something of personal experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more we live in His presence, the more sense we will have of the preciousness of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is just the enjoyment of His indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This very Jesus indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a living reality, not merely a saying.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we would all learn to forsake our old person, taking Him as our person by looking at the index of His face while enjoying His presence, we would have a sweet sense of the preciousness of the indwelling Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This would make us so shining, a shining which is the reflecting of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I can assure you that if you ever have this kind of experience, others will see how shining you are.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not that you are merely happy, but you are shining.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Something from within shines out, and that is the reflection of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was Paul s experience of the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>CAPTIVES OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul also tells us that we are the defeated captives of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now thanks be unto God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savor of his knowledge by us in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For we are unto God a sweet savor of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: to the one we are the savor of death unto death; and to the other the savor of life unto life 2 Cor 2:14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God today leads us in triumph in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This phrase is difficult to translate.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It pictures a general who fought the battle and gained the victory, capturing many captives.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then he returns triumphantly to celebrate his victory, with a parade of all the captives behind him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today, Christ has gained the victory, and He has captured so many captives, including you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The procession is still going on in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all have been put into this procession.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God will lead us in the triumph of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, to be captured means that we must be defeated, conquered and subdued by Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is so good to be defeated by Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Undoubtedly, in the eyes of our unbelieving relatives and friends, we are just a captive to Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To their sense, we have just been captured.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Praise the Lord, we have been captured!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Jesus defeated us, conquered us, subdued us, and captured us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>So now we are so dependent upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We take Him as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the procession of His triumph.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have nothing to say and nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are fully captured by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A SWEET SAVOR OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the ancient times, while such a procession and celebration were going on, certain ones would scatter incense before the procession.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is what Paul means when he says that we are a sweet savor of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are defeated, conquered, subdued, and captured and now we bear the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The real gospel preaching is the scattering of the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>And the sweet savor of this incense is life to some and death to others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Praise the Lord that we are in such a procession to celebrate the triumph of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>THE CONTENT OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By looking into all of these points, we can see what we should be.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should be the ones attached to the Triune God, within whom Jesus is working all the time, transforming us into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>And we should be the earthen vessels to contain Him with His living face as the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then we will be the captives in His triumphant procession, celebrating His victory in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We can see that all these items are completely different from the teachings and doctrines which we received in a traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is because these are items of Jesus indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The indwelling Christ will do all these things, making these items so real, so living, and so practical in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord s recovery today is not just to recover the oneness and the church s testimony, but to recover the real content of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The content of the church life is just all these items of the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>THE SWEET CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is why the church life is altogether different from what we saw and experienced in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is in another category completely.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>And this is why the church life is so sweet to us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The indwelling Christ is working within all the brothers and sisters within the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we did not have the indwelling Christ, we would all go our own way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We love all the brothers and sisters because Jesus is living and working within them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the church life every member is so precious, and we do love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is not that we are so lovable; it is because of the treasure indwelling us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Of course, we are human, and some times we do have problems with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But how good it is when we turn back to the indwelling Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then we say, Brother, forgive me, I was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Let s turn to the Lord together.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>And when we touch the Lord together, everyone becomes so lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is not what we are; it is the sweet Jesus that indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Religion can confine us, but it can never give us a sweet savor.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Religion simply does not smell sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But Jesus is the very incense scattered among His captives.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is hard to explain the difference in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Others sing hymns, they have the Bible, they have one another, and they have their speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>What is the difference?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is just the sweet Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is why we have had the burden to share these messages on the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is to strengthen, enrich, and uplift the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The more we practice the indwelling Christ, the more Christ becomes so precious to us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we do not learn to enjoy the indwelling Christ, there is no incense in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He is not sweet if we study Him in an objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We cannot smell Him, and we cannot sense Him.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But He is so sweet subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When we learn to enjoy Him from within, we scatter the sweet savor to others.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This sweet smell is just something of the sweet nature and essence of Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>There is no other book like 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Paul covers all of these precious items in his autobiography because merely in teaching no one can utter such things.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is simply his experience, and he testifies to that effect.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Finally he says, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is the church life by the indwelling Christ.</S>
