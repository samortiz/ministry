<h2 class="head2">Six Villages (Rongho)</h2><p>We had a conference in Peizhuang of Rongho for seven days beginning on December 28, 1950. We invited a total of fourteen brothers and sisters from Yitang of Linjin to come preach His gospel in one accord with us. The nature and general information concerning the meetings were as follows: There was a prayer meeting in the early morning, an edification meeting in the late morning, and preaching the gospel in the neighboring towns in the afternoon. We went to six villages in seven evenings. Four hundred forty people repented and believed in the Lord. This was the power of God. We hope that you will praise the Lord with us when you read this letter. We had a three-day conference in Rongho immediately following the seven-day conference. God was very merciful and heard our pleas. He established His testimony (table) with forty-one brothers and sisters who break bread together. We hope you also will offer up thanks and praise for this matter.</p><p>Pei Fu-min, Sun Wen-yuan, Hsueh Shao-yi, and Lin De-ching<br />January 8, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">Back from Sian (In a Fellowship Meeting)</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Jeremiah 10:23 says, "I know, O Jehovah,/That a man's way is not in himself;/It is not in the man who walks/To direct his step." We experienced this verse when we went out this time. According to ourselves, we never planned to make this trip. However, a man's way is not in himself; it is not in the man who walks to direct his steps. We cannot direct anything; everything is God's arrangement.</p><p>We went out because the church in Sian had a need and invited us to help them solve a problem. Before the Lord, we felt that this was very serious, and we earnestly prayed, "Lord, how do we handle this great matter? Lord, go with us, and may we bring Your blessing." We prayed, but we did not have the assurance. Brother Yu also said this. We went without the assurance.</p><p>We left on June 29 and arrived in Hsuchow on the 30th. We stayed there for three days and had a few meetings. We went to Chengchow on July 3. We arrived in Sian on the 5th, which was a Thursday. There was an edification meeting for new believers, and they wanted us to speak. Brother Yu spoke something.</p><p>There was a fellowship meeting on Saturday. We wanted to see their condition and had not planned to speak anything. Therefore, at the meeting time we were waiting for them, and they were waiting for us. Then I was moved inwardly and felt that I should speak something about the attitude of the meeting. Just as I was about to stand up, Brother Yu stood up and spoke about "the attitude of the meeting." I marveled in my heart, for I had never had such a clear experience in my entire life. Brother Yu spoke on the inward aspect, and after he had finished speaking, I continued to speak something about the outward aspect. The condition of the meeting that evening was very good. Some of the brothers from Sian were able to testify. From that evening, we began to believe that the Lord Himself would work.</p><p>After two weeks of meeting, the difficulties had almost been resolved. When the conference was almost over, Lanchow sent us a letter inviting us to come. We did not make any decision. We prayed before God that we would go if He would make the arrangements (namely a car). Just as the conference was over, some brothers from Lanchow drove two cars to fill with cargo, and they wanted us to ride back with them. We felt that it was God's arrangement, so we did not refuse. We left on August 4 and arrived in Pingliang on the fifth. There were meetings for two days. We left Pingliang on the ninth and arrived in Lanchow on the tenth.</p><p>There was a two-week conference in Lanchow. After the conference, we were preparing to return to Pingliang. At the same time, the church in Pingliang sent a brother and sister to bring us back, but we did not have the inward peace to return to Pingliang. Although many things would have been convenient if we returned to Pingliang, there was an inward forbidding. After a few days, a telegram from Tiensui came inviting us to go there. Brother Yu asked me how I felt. I said that outwardly I was not willing to go, but inwardly I felt that I would not have the peace if I did not go. Brother Yu said, "I have the same feeling." Therefore, we could only set Pingliang aside and go to Tiensui.</p><p>We arrived in Tiensui on August 13. There was a week-long conference here, and the Lord did a marvelous work.</p><p>On September 10, we arrived in Mei County. We had a one-week conference in Mei County, during which we met in a cave. Those brothers are very good and pure. After going to Mei County, the brothers in Pingyuan province earnestly invited us to go there.</p><p>We left Mei County to return to Sian on September 18. On the train Brother Yu told me that he knew something was going to happen that day. This is what happened. As we were crossing a river, the donkeys we were riding fell and we fell off. Fortunately, we fell on to the sand.</p><p>When we arrived at the train station, we inwardly felt that it was not right to go to Pingyuan province because we had not thoroughly sought the Lord. We could only tell them that we could not go to Pingyuan. It seemed as though we had dumped a pan of cold water on them. But because we were forbidden inwardly, we could only return to Sian.</p><p>On September 25 we left Sian and arrived in Linjin on the twenty-eighth. There we had a one-week conference. The meetings were very good.</p><p>We arrived in Zhenzhou on October 4. We had not said that there would be a conference when we returned to Zhenzhou, but more than eighty brothers and sisters came from Pingyuan and Honan provinces. The meeting hall could only accommodate about ten people, so we really could not handle them. Since we could not have a conference in Zhenzhou, we had to ask them to go back. We said that if anyone wanted to come to Hsuchow, they could go with us. We said that we could take twenty people at the most, because the meeting hall in Hsuchow was also small, and there was a problem with hospitality. But to our surprise, the brothers in Hsuchow did a good job with the hospitality. There was a one-week conference in Hsuchow. Then a telegram from Nanking invited us there, and some brothers from Tsinan came to invite us. Since Brother Yu had promised the brothers in Tsinan earlier that we would go there if we had the opportunity, we could not refuse, and we were not forbidden inwardly. Therefore, we left Hsuchow on October 13 and arrived in Tsinan that afternoon. While we were in Tsinan, the church in Tsingtao also sent brothers to invite us. Outwardly, we were exhausted. Then we were dealt with before the Lord. If the Lord really wanted to go, we were willing to go. When we put everything aside, we saw clearly that we were right in not going. As a result, the brothers who had come for us were willing to put everything aside as we had.</p><p>We left Tsinan on October 20 and arrived in Shanghai the next day. On this trip we really saw that a man's way is not in himself and it is not in the man who walks to direct his steps.&mdash;Chu Chen</p>
