<h1 class="title">TOUCHING THE BIBLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">READING THE BIBLE BEING DIFFERENT<br />
FROM TOUCHING THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Reading the Bible is different from touching the Bible. Reading the Bible is for understanding the Bible, whereas touching the Bible is for contacting the Bible. Understanding the Bible and contacting the Bible are two different things. It is one thing to know and understand the chemical structure of water, but it is quite another thing to drink water, that is, to contact water. A child washes his hands and feet every day with water, but he does not know the chemical structure of water. A chemist knows the chemical structure of water because he studies water. A child who washes his hands with water contacts water. The child does not know the chemical structure of water, because he does not study it. This example shows the difference between studying water and contacting water. Here is another example. We eat rice every day; that is, we contact rice, but we do not necessarily know its nutritional content.</p>
<p>In a past training we spent much effort to explain how to read the Bible so that the saints can understand the Bible. We also spent several months to study the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible. However, our emphasis was on understanding rather than on contacting the Bible. We said that in order to understand a book of the Bible, we should know the general sketch, the central thought, the key words, the sections, the main themes, the types, and the prophecies in the book. If we read through a book according to these seven points, we will understand the book. These seven points of emphasis guide us through the difficult portions of the Bible. If we read Genesis in this way, we will understand its general sketch: God created, Satan corrupted, man fell, and God promised to save. If we study the Bible in this way, every book will become clear and transparent. However, these seven points are mainly for us to understand and know the content of the Bible. They do not help us to touch and contact the Bible. Hence, we must ask ourselves what is the proper way to touch the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO TOUCH THE BIBLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the Essence of the Bible&mdash;the Spirit</h2>
<p>In order to touch the Bible, we first need to know that the Spirit of God is the essence of the Bible (John 6:63). In order to contact something, we must know its essence and purpose. For example, we eat food because we know that it is edible, and we wear clothes because we know that they cover us. Similarly, we know that we should sit on a chair, not a table. These may seem to be superficial examples, but they reveal a principle. If we read the Bible as if it were a book of doctrines to be studied, it will be a book only on truth and doctrines. On the surface, the Bible is a book on truth and doctrines, but more importantly, the Bible contains the Spirit. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (6:63). Unbelievers may not agree with this, but we know that the essence of the Bible is Spirit and that the words of God are spirit and life. The Spirit of God is the essence of the Bible.</p>
<p>The words in the Bible are like seeds; they are a matter of life. We can say that seeds are the embodiment of life, the practical expression of life. Life is abstract, but in creation God caused life to be embodied in seeds. For example, the life of a flower is concealed within a seed. If we plant the seed, life will be manifested. But if we take the seed to a laboratory and conduct tests on the seed, we will not be able to find life. We will find many elements in the seed, but we will not find life. The most that any scientist can do is to determine the elements within a seed, but he cannot isolate the life within the seed in order to show others. Nevertheless, life is the most important thing in a seed. Similarly, we can find many things in the Bible, but there is something in the Bible that we cannot find when we use only our mind; we cannot find the Spirit in the Bible in order to show others.</p>
<p>The Bible presents many things. Genesis speaks of God creating the heavens and the earth and of the patriarchs living before God. Exodus speaks of the Israelites&rsquo; oppression in Egypt and of Moses&rsquo; being born and sent by God. Proverbs contains ethical instructions. Many people consider the teachings in Proverbs to be higher than the ethical teachings of Chinese families. Although these matters are presented in the Bible, they are not the life in the Bible. The Spirit and life are concealed within the Bible; nevertheless, we cannot show them to others.</p>
<p>Some people say that we are irrational because we say that the Bible contains life, but we say that the Chinese classics, such as <em>Four Books</em> and the <em>Five Classics,</em> do not contain life. When people argue and say that the Bible is only a book of black and white letters, we are not able to convince them otherwise. In such a situation it is best to be silent. A person who uses these Chinese classics to preach the gospel, however, will not be able to bring anyone to salvation. These two Chinese classics speak only of the development of a person&rsquo;s bright virtue, which cannot cause people to be regenerated. However, the verse &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life&rdquo; (John 3:16) can cause a person to repent and be regenerated. This is life. If we bury a seed in the earth, after a few days a green and tender shoot will break forth. Although we cannot isolate life, we can show people the issue of life.</p>
<p>Studying and understanding the Bible are similar to a chemist&rsquo;s studying and analyzing the elements within a seed. A chemist might be able to show that wheat, barley, and rice consist of different elements, but no matter how many tests he conducts, he will not be able to find the life within a seed. A seed must be nurtured in order for the life within it to be manifested. Seeds need soil in order for them to be nurtured and grow. We do not understand life nor can we isolate it, but the life within a seed is manifested when the seed sprouts.</p>
<p>The Bible has the aspect of &ldquo;elements&rdquo; and also the aspect of spirit and life. Even the most renowned biologist cannot explain life. A person can study the numbers in the Bible and learn that the number seven signifies perfection and the number three signifies resurrection. These are the elements that can be studied in the Bible. After studying Numbers and Deuteronomy, he can conclude that Numbers is a book on coordination and building but that Deuteronomy is a book on living and worship. However, this is not the way for a person to touch life in the Bible. Seemingly, the Word of God concerns only teachings, but the essential component of the Word of God is spirit and life. Our knowledge of the Bible must include these two aspects, both of which are related to us.</p>
<p>The Word of God contains the Spirit of God and the life of God, both of which cannot be explained. Hence, we may say that the Bible is the embodiment of the Spirit. Unless we know the Bible to this extent, we will spend all our time only studying the Bible. I am concerned that some saints cannot discern between the two aspects of the Bible, that is, between the outward elements and the inward essence of spirit and life. We must discern between these two aspects so that we not only understand the elements of the Bible but, even more, touch the spirit and life within the Bible. The Bible is the embodiment of the Spirit of God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
