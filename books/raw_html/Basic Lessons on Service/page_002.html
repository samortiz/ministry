Not only has Christianity spoiled the word service, but even among us this word has been spoiled to some extent. When we use the word service, we may think of our service groups in the church life or the service office. Actually in the New Testament, the Greek word for service really means ministry. To minister is to serve people with something. If I serve you without ministering something to you, that is wrong.</P><P>In the New Testament, the service, or the ministry, is the stewardship (1 Cor. 9:17; Eph. 3:2; Col. 1:25). A steward is always serving people with something. The stewardesses on the airplane are a good illustration of this. They serve people on the plane with food, with drinks, with blankets, with pillows, or with things to read. They serve you with something, which means that they minister something to you. A waiter in a restaurant is also a good illustration of one who serves people with something. We have to make this point clear to the saints. To serve is not just to come to clean the meeting hall. Service is ministry.</P>
