   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO GO ON AFTER SELLING ONE'S ALL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How should we serve in the church after we have sold our all?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to submit to the careful arrangement of the older, leading brothers who make decisions under the control of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These brothers should also give clear advice concerning proper occupations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We want all the consecrated ones to be able to work together, even for the gospel migration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the past our occupation was for our personal interest and livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the future we hope that we will offer up our occupation to God for the accomplishment of His gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We hope that we can say that any occupation is acceptable as long as it benefits the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have no choice of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We do not want to take our own way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, we will go where the gospel goes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we can do this, we can send some to Sinkiang province or to Tibet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the whole church can send out five thousand, ten thousand, or even fifty thousand people, how much the Lord will bless His church!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If everything we have is offered up for the gospel, the church, and the Lord's service, the Lord and the gospel will have a free way through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother Liu was a very good doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He and his wife were sent to Yi-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They had a good place to live in Chung-Shan Hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When they arrived in Yi-Yang none of the walls of the saints' houses were made of solid material.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They did not even have tiled roofs; many lived in tents.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Liu and his wife did the same.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They did not have their own choice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His job at Chung-Shan Hospital was not bad, but for the sake of serving God, they chose to live in these unbearable conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thousands of people throughout church history have forsaken everything for the sake of serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother Liu and his wife gave up their good living and moved to Yi-Yang for one purpose only to join the other brothers and sisters in serving our God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>FORSAKING EVERYTHING TO SERVE OUR GOD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I hope that no one in Hong Kong will hold back anything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I hope that everyone will be absolute and forsake everything to serve our God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must be this kind of people before God will allow us to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to be clear about what we are doing here.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not believe there is another force as powerful in preaching the gospel as the whole Body rising up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet there are not many places where men dare to say that they will forsake everything to serve our God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, no one wants to say such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A man is willing to say such a word only after God has worked on him and dealt with him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brother Witness, Sister Wang, and myself have considered this matter for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We dared not say this word because we felt that we had not been dealt with enough.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today we have not lost our sanity when we say such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord has brought us to a point that we cannot hold back this word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to realize that we have to bear the responsibility for what we are saying here.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Indeed, this is not something that we love to speak in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I know the consequence of saying such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But this is the only way we can serve our God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No cheaper way will work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let me say this again: Only those who have forsaken everything can serve our God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I know the serious responsibility I am bearing for saying such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Perhaps you would rather be a spectator in this meeting, but we have to fulfill our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I can only say what Paul said to Agrippa when he testified that he was not insane.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He had not lost his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the way that God has put in front of us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we take the way God has laid before us, the glorious church in Ephesians 4 and 5 will be before our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May God open our eyes, and may such a glorious day be hastened through our absoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>PRAYERS</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brother Weigh: Lord, in Hong Kong everything is loose, but everyone has a tight grip on mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everyone is building up his Babylon and Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These are the things the world boasts of.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But You will destroy them all.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How easy it is for us to follow the world.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Unless You deal with all these things by Your mighty power, Your great glory, and Your love, we will have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Lord, grant us the grace to willingly destroy what we have built and to give ourselves to You entirely for Your service.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A sister: Lord, apart from the cleansing of Your blood, no one can be accepted by You.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Unless we consecrate ourselves absolutely to You, we are not qualified to serve You.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May Your glorious face on the throne attract us once more so that we can run after You.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Brother Luk: Lord, grant us a persevering faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We want to put this word into practice immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not want to have any compromise from our head to our very toes.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Watchman Nee: Lord, do a work in Hong Kong as You have never done before.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Clear out the situation here entirely.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We want to give ourselves to You unconditionally and gloriously.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We desire to consecrate ourselves to You absolutely and thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the past we built up many things for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Work in us today to destroy them all.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Clear out everything until nothing is left.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Work on us again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Have a way among us and then have a way here in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>May we see the whole Body rising up to serve in Hong Kong, and may many other places follow in its footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We consecrate ourselves to You.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We offer ourselves to You so that You will have a way to go on in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When You have a way to go on in the church, the gospel will have a way to go on in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Be merciful to us and be gracious to us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Send us the heavenly fire.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Accept our offering so that Your gospel will have a free way among us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Amen.</S>
