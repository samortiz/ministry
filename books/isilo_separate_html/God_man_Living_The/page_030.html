<p>In His crucifixion He prayed for those who were crucifying Him, that the Father would forgive them their sin of ignorance (Luke 23:34a).</p>
<h2 class="head4">m. Extending His Salvation to One of the Criminals</h2>
<p>Even in His suffering and dying, He extended His salvation to one of the criminals who were crucified with Him (23:42-43).</p>
 <h2 class="head4">n. Being Tempted but without Sin</h2>
<p>Although Christ was tempted, He was without sin (Heb. 2:18; 4:15; 1 Pet. 2:22).</p>
<h2 class="head4">o. Doing Nothing from Himself</h2>
<p>The Lord said that He did nothing from Himself (John 5:19, 30a; 8:28). This is because He considered Himself a buried person.</p>
<h2 class="head4">p. Not Speaking Any Word from Himself</h2>
<p>The Lord did not speak His own words. He spoke the Father&rsquo;s words (John 14:10a).</p>
<h2 class="head4">q. Not Seeking His Own Will but the Will of God</h2>
<p>He did not seek His own will but the will of God (John 5:30b; 6:38). In Matthew 26:39 He said, &ldquo;My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will.&rdquo; Then in verse 42 He said, &ldquo;My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head4">r. Being Obedient to God Even unto Death</h2>
<p>Philippians 2:8 says that the Lord was obedient unto death, and that the death of a cross.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Having No Freedom to Live according to Himself</h2>
<p>The Lord had no freedom to live according to Himself. He said to His brothers, &ldquo;My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready&rdquo; (John 7:6). In verse 8 the Lord said, &ldquo;You go up to the feast; I am not going up to this feast, because My time has not yet been fulfilled.&rdquo; The Lord lived on earth as a man, being limited even in the matter of time. This shows that before doing anything, we need to contact the Lord. We may pray, &ldquo;Lord, I have a burden to go and see a certain brother. Is this the right time?&rdquo; Often when I prayed in this way, the Lord told me that I should wait. I had a burden to help a brother, but the Lord would not allow me to do it then. We must learn the lesson of timing. We must learn not to act according to our preference.</p>
<p>Stanza 1 of <em>Hymns,</em> #501 says concerning Christ: &ldquo;God infinite, in eternity, / Yet man in time, finite to be.&rdquo; He was God in eternity without limitation, but He became a man on this earth limited by time and space. He was limited to the village of Nazareth in His living for about thirty years. Can we be limited in such a way? We may have the burden to visit many places, but the Lord may not want us to. We must learn the lesson to be limited.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Coordinating with the Father</h2>
<p>Everything that the Lord Jesus did was in coordination with the Father who abode and worked in Him for the accomplishment of His economy. In John 14:10b the Lord said, &ldquo;The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works.&rdquo; This was a coordination with the Father who lived and worked in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Manifesting God to Express God&rsquo;s Attributes<br />
in His Human Virtues</h2>
<p>He was on this earth living a life totally for the manifestation of God to express God&rsquo;s attributes in His human virtues (1 Tim. 3:16a). When people saw His virtues, they saw God&rsquo;s attributes, and that was a manifestation of God. We need to apply all of these points to our daily living in our contact with everyone.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> </body></html>
