   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE HARVEST OF GROWTH, TRANSFORMATION,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND BUILDING Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:6b, 17, 18; Rom 12:2, 5; Eph 4:22-24; Rev 4:2-3; 21:10-11, 18a, 19a</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have seen in the last chapter, 1 Corinthians 3 covers the matters of growth, transformation, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The same items can be seen in the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesians 2:20-22 and 4:12-16 are related to growth, transformation, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE GIFTED ONES</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>PERFECTING THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The gifted persons mentioned in Ephesians 4:11, the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers, are for the perfecting of the saints v. 12 . The gifted persons themselves are not the direct builders of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are the perfecters, perfecting the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the result of their perfecting work, the saints will be qualified and equipped to function as members of the Body to build the churches directly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Neither the Lord Jesus nor the gifted persons such as the apostles and evangelists build up the churches directly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, the members who have been perfected, that is, equipped and qualified to function, build up the churches directly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>PERFECTED BY</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>GROWING IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What does it mean to perfect the saints?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In my early ministry I thought that perfecting the saints meant to give them some ability or spiritual art, so I trained people in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually I learned that this was not the proper training.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ephesians 4:12 speaks of the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 13 mentions a full-grown man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 14 speaks of being no longer babes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 15 tells us to grow up into Christ in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All of these verses are related to the matter of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To perfect the saints means to help them grow into a full-grown man, to be no more babes, and to grow up in all things into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the context in Ephesians 4, to perfect the saints is simply to help them to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As living members of the Body of Christ, the saints need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The same is true concerning the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a child is born, he is complete with all his organs.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has ears, eyes, a tongue, lips, and all the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is unnecessary and even impossible to add more organs to a baby; organically speaking, he is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whatever organs the parents have, the baby also has.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Still, although he is complete organically, he is not complete in his function and ability.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, the baby needs perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To perfect him means to cause him to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After growing for a year he will be able to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After another period of time, he will begin to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was born with two feet and a mouth, but he lacked the ability to walk and speak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more he grows, the more he is perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In other words, he becomes equipped and qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although the baby has all the necessary organs at birth, he needs the proper amount of growth before the ability of these organs can be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, a baby's eyes are not very useful immediately after birth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although the baby has eyes, their ability to function is limited because of the lack of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With the proper growth, the eyes begin to function after a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The seeing organ is present at birth, but the seeing ability develops with the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What then does it mean to perfect the saints in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It does not mean to add something to them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not and in fact cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, we should help them grow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All of the saints must grow into a full-grown man and no longer be babes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They must grow up into Christ, the Head, in all things.</S>
