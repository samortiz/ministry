<h2 class="head1">FOUR KINDS OF SONSHIP<br>WHICH THE WORLD DOES NOT HAVE</h2><p>The Bible has shown us four aspects of sonship in which the people of the world have no part. Just by looking at these four aspects of the doctrine of sonship, we can see that the people of the world are different and that not all people are sons of God.</p><h2 class="head1">1. Our Lord Jesus Christ Is the Son of God</h2><p>His being the Son of God is very special and unique; He has something different from the other sons of God. This is why the Bible says, “the only begotten Son” (John 1:18). He is so holy, pure, and special that no one but He can be called the only begotten Son of God. Here the phrase “only begotten” excludes all other people of the world.</p><h2 class="head1">2. The Angels Are Also Called the Sons of God (Job 38:7; Gen. 6:2-4)</h2><p>The angels are those who directly inherit the word of God (John 10:35). Of course, it is evident that we are not angels. Obviously, we have no part in this aspect of sonship.</p><h2 class="head1">3. The Israelites</h2><p>The Israelites are also called the sons of God. Moses said to the children of Israel, “You are the children of Jehovah your God” (Deut. 14:1). Since we are not Israelites, we cannot claim to be children of God in this position.</p><p>The first time in the Bible that God is referred to as the Father is in Exodus. When God sent Moses to deliver the Israelites, He said, “And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my son, even my firstborn: and I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me” (Exo. 4:22-23a). God is not the Father of the whole world. He only called out the Israelites and called them His sons; the people of the world are not included. The fatherhood of God mentioned by Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the other prophets only refers to the Israelites. The people of the world are not allowed to participate in this sonship. Although Malachi said, “Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us?” (2:10), the word “we” does not refer to all the people in the world. This is made clear by looking at what follows: “Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?” God’s covenanted people were the Israelites, not any other people. God made a covenant on Mount Sinai only with their forefathers, not with the forefathers of the people of the world. Therefore, besides the Israelites, no others are considered sons of God. Furthermore, the prophet said, “The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi” (1:1). Malachi’s prophecy is directed only to the Israelites. When our Lord was on earth, two of the parables He gave were based on the fact that the chosen Israelites are the sons of God. “A man had two children. And he came to his first son and said, Child, go today and work in the vineyard....And he came to the other and said likewise” (Matt. 21:28, 30a). Does this parable prove that God is the Father of everyone in the world? No. This parable was spoken by our Lord to warn the priests and the elders because they did not receive the preaching of John and because they loathed and rejected Christ. The younger son here refers to the repentant tax collectors, sinners, and prostitutes; though they were unclean, they were willing to repent and obey the gracious call. Therefore, they were the obedient sons. The parable of the prodigal son has the same meaning. It was spoken to reproach the Pharisees and the scribes because they murmured against the Lord Jesus for receiving the sinners and eating with them. The older son refers to the Pharisees and the scribes, whereas the younger son refers to the repentant sinners.</p><p>Since we are not Israelites in the flesh, the rights bestowed on the Israelites as the sons of God do not involve us. We cannot be the children of God in this regard.</p><h2 class="head1">4. Adam</h2><p>Adam was directly created by God and was also called the son of God: “The son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God” (Luke 3:38). Besides Adam, nobody was directly created by God; hence, the people in the world cannot be called the sons of God as Adam was. In the genealogy in Luke 3, there are seventy-five people including Adam (in verse 36 Cainan is not counted). These seventy-five people were all created by God, but only Adam was created directly. The other seventy-four people were called the sons of men; only Adam, God’s direct creation, was called the son of God. So, this genealogy is sufficient to prove that the people in the world are not the sons of God simply because they were created. “...Adam, the son of God”; but “...Seth, the son [not of God] of Adam.”</p><p>Men are created by God and are also born of Adam. Even though the Bible does not call them the sons of God, they are nevertheless referred to as God’s kind. When Paul was preaching in Athens, he said that God “made from one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, determining beforehand their appointed seasons and the boundaries of their dwelling, that they might seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, even though He is not far from each one of us; for in Him we live and move and are, as even some poets among you have said, For we are also His race. Being then the race of God, we ought not to suppose that what is divine is like gold or silver or stone, like an engraving of art and thought of man” (Acts 17:26-29).</p><p>The original Greek word for “race” is yevos. This word is also translated in the Bible as kind, tribe, and nation. Only here is it translated “race.” This word is very different from “son”; the only thing it has in common with “son” is that it is also a noun. Thus, this verse only refers to men as God’s kind, not to men as the spiritual sons of God. When looking at the context, we further realize the point Paul was making is that man was created by God. Since God is so great and full of lovingkindness, man should not worship idols as God. This verse does not prove that all people are sons of God.</p><p>Man should never claim God’s creation to be the basis of sonship. If creation can prove sonship, then are cows, sheep, dogs, and horses, which were also created by God, the sons of God?</p><p>Since the people of the world are neither (1) Jesus Christ, nor (2) angels, nor (3) Israelites, nor (4) Adam, they can never claim to be the sons of God as those in the four categories mentioned above. Since the people of the world cannot find a basis among these four kinds of sonship through which they can be called the sons of God, they should therefore seek a way outside of these four that they might become children of God. However, the Bible does not give us any other way to call a person a son of God except to believe in the Lord. Since the Bible does not give any basis for the people of the world to be considered children of God, they are therefore not children of God.</p><p>Among these four kinds of sonship, we find that only the Israelites are still existing on the earth. However, the Israelites have lost their rights according to the flesh since the New Testament age began (John 8). It is because “it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are accounted as the seed” (Rom. 9:8). If the Israelites, who were originally called children of God, have been deprived of their rights, then do the other people of the world who are not called children of God have the right to call themselves children of God? In this age God does not differentiate between Israelites and Gentiles; they are all the same to Him. The people of the world, whether Israelites or Gentiles, are not the sons of God.</p>
