Acts 5:31 says, "This One God has exalted to His right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins." We see here that repentance is given by God in the same way that forgiveness is given by God. In the Bible a few times repentance and forgiveness are joined together. Acts 2 says that repentance is for the forgiveness of sins (v. 38). Acts 3 says that repentance results in our sins being wiped away (v. 19). Two other places mention repentance without forgiveness. In two of these four instances, repentance and forgiveness are joined together. Repentance is linked to salvation. Forgiveness is something God initiates. Repentance is also something God initiates. The gift of forgiveness is given by God. A heart of repentance is also given by God. Therefore, repentance is a part within faith and a part of salvation. Both of these are something that God initiates. God gives man repentance in the same way that He gives him forgiveness. It is God's word that comes to us. It is God that enlightens us and tells us that our past was wrong. It is God who gives us a heart of repentance, who commands us to repent. I marvel at this. This is salvation. Because we do not see our past, God shines His light on us. This is God's way of working.</p><p>If a child's face is dirty, his mother would not ask him to earn some money to buy a towel to wipe it clean. Instead, the mother would find a towel and tell the child to use it. When God wants us to repent, He Himself gives us repentance in the same way that He gives us forgiveness. God Himself gives us repentance so that we would see our past and realize how low, weak, and corrupt we were. After this, He tells us to repent.</p><p>Luke 24:45-47 is a most amazing passage. It says, "Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures; and He said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day, and that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name." The ones mentioned here preached repentance for forgiveness. We should preach forgiveness in His name. We also should preach repentance in His name. Today we can repent in the Lord's name because the Lord has given us repentance. It is similar to God's creating two eyes for us and then asking us to see. If we did not have two eyes, it would be difficult for us to see. Thank the Lord that He first gives us eyes and then asks us to see. First, He gives us feet and then asks us to walk. It is the same with repentance. First, He gives us repentance, and then He asks us to repent. All of this is done by God. Hence, when we preach the gospel, we can say that as we have forgiveness through the Lord Jesus, in the same way we have repentance through Him. If a man says that he cannot repent, that he still considers sin attractive, and that he does not feel that he is a sinner, we can tell him, "This is all right. I am now preaching the gospel to you in the name of Jesus. God will give you repentance. It is a part of salvation. Just as you receive life and are justified before God, in the same way you receive repentance."</p><p>How did we repent? When we heard the preachers telling us of the evilness and loathsomeness of sin and the redemption of the Lord Jesus, we wanted to repent and believe in Jesus. We were not sitting in a corner, telling ourselves how corrupted we were or what sinners we were. Even if we were to repeat this over and over again, this speaking would not make us feel that we were sinners. Would you feel that you were wrong by merely speaking about it? No one among us repented this way. When we first heard the gospel, we opposed it and criticized it; we did not want to accept it. If we chose to argue, we could have put forth many arguments. On the day that we were saved, the gospel that was preached to us may not have been that prevailing. But while we were there or after we had returned to work, or while we were walking on the street or reading a book, we were convicted. Spontaneously we repented, and then we were saved. We ourselves repented; no one forced us, reminded us, or pressured us to repent. It was God who gave us the repentance, and it was we who said, "I repent." Hence, this is God's work. This is why the Bible says that repentance is given by God.</p><p>In Acts 11, after Peter preached the gospel in the house of Cornelius, the Jewish brothers rebuked him for going to the house of a Gentile. Peter then related to them how he had preached the gospel. Verse 18 says, "And when they heard these things, they became silent and glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also God has given repentance unto life." Please notice that God has given the Gentiles repentance unto life. Hence, we see that repentance is a part of God's grace. It is a part within God's salvation. This is something done by God.</p><p>Second Timothy 2:25 says, "In meekness correcting those who oppose, if perhaps God may give them repentance unto the full knowledge of the truth." Many oppose the truth and will not accept God's truth. We can ask God to give them repentance so that they would come to the knowledge of the truth. This is also something that God has done.</p><p>What then is repentance? After reading all of these Scriptures, we must draw a conclusion. The question of repentance is not as clear-cut as other truths in the Bible. It seems to be quite ill-defined. On the one hand, a man is not saved through repentance but through faith. This is the truth shown to us by the Gospel of John, the book of Romans, and the book of Galatians. We cannot make any mistake about this. But on the other hand, without repentance a man cannot believe. So, in our preaching, many times we tell people to repent. It does not mean that repentance alone will save us. Rather, it means that repentance will bring forth faith. If a man has not repented, he will not be able to believe. But repentance is not works. The Bible says that repentance is given by God. God tells us to repent. We do not sit in a corner thinking that we have to repent, that we have to hate our sins and judge ourselves. We have to realize that no one can do this. I am afraid no one in the entire world can do this. Even if some are able to do this, it is not worth anything. Repentance is a gift from God. Even in the Gospels, when the Lord Jesus came to preach the gospel, not only did He preach forgiveness but repentance as well. He is the One who enables us to repent. Those who repent are the believing ones and the saved ones. If there are those here who have not yet been saved and who do not know how to receive God's grace, we must say that God desires to give you grace. He desires to give you repentance. He is leading you into salvation through repentance.</p><p>Lastly there is another verse telling us that it is God's goodness and kindness that is leading us to repentance. The last clause of Romans 2:4 says that "God's kindness is leading you to repentance." May God grant us a spirit of repentance. May God be gracious to us and show us the meaning of repentance and make known to us whether we are saved through repentance or through the Lord Jesus.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> </body></html>
