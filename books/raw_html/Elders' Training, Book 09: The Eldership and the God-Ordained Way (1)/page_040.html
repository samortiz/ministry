<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ORGANIC WAY<br>TO CARE FOR THE CHURCH<br>AS THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</H1><P>In this chapter we want to see the organic way to care for the church as the organic Body of Christ. The spiritual things in the divine revelation are very mysterious, so God used physical things as symbols and figures to help us see them. In Ephesians 3:4 the church is called the mystery of Christ. Furthermore, Colossians 2:2 says that Christ is the mystery of God. God is a mystery. If we are going to know God, we have to know Christ. Christ Himself is also a mystery. If we are going to know Christ, we have to know the church. God is a mystery, Christ is a mystery, and the church is a mystery. If the church were an organization, it would not be a mystery. What can give us a definition, an understanding, and an apprehension of this mystery? In the Bible, God uses our human body as a figure and as a picture of the church (Rom. 12:4-5). Because the spiritual things are mysterious, pictures are needed to describe them. A picture is better than a thousand words. This is why the New Testament uses our human body to illustrate the church as the mystery of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ORGANIC CARE FOR THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>If we want to know how to take care of the church as the organic Body of Christ, we have to consider how we take care of our physical body. Surely we do not take care of our physical body in an organizational way. Let us come back to the New Testament to see what it says concerning the organic care for the Body of Christ. Ephesians 5:29 says, "For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church." Just as we nourish and cherish our physical body, Christ nourishes and cherishes the church. A person loves his physical body by nourishing and cherishing it.</P><P>Some have asked me why I am so healthy at my age and why I have lived so long. The first thing I exercise to do is to eat the proper thing and to eat well. We should not eat roughly or quickly, nor should we eat when we are angry. We have to learn to eat the right thing by the right way. This is what it means to nourish and cherish our body. We have to nourish and cherish our body in order to live. Every day we nourish our body with at least three meals.</P><P>Eating nourishes us, but eating the wrong thing in the wrong way can also kill us. Alexander the Great died when he was thirty-three because of overeating and overdrinking. The proper eating nourishes, but improper eating can gradually kill us. To eat roughly and wrongly is a kind of gradual suicide. Long life, of course, is a gift from the Lord. The length of our life is up to Him, but we still must cooperate with Him. During my life, the Lord allowed me to have certain illnesses. These illnesses taught me a lot. By being ill, I learned how to keep myself healthy. We all have to learn how to nourish the church in a proper way to keep the church healthy. We should not try to govern the church. This is organization. To nourish the church is organic.</P>
