   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>39 When speaking about Christ, whether it be in what He is, in what He has accomplished, in His person, in His work, or in any other aspect, the Bible always shows us that He is all-inclusive and infinite.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>40 What He is, is so much and so limitless.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is why even though the Bible uses sixty-six books to depict Him, it still cannot describe Him fully.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the word of the Old Testament, it was Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the quotation in the New Testament, it becomes the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that the Lord in the New Testament is a substitute for Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Another Greek word, Despotes, is used to denote either God or the Lord Jesus as the Master of the slaves Luke 2:29; Acts 4:24; Rev 6:10; Jude 4; 2 Pet 2:1; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1 Tim 6:1-2 .</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, Jesus was a God-given name.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Luke 1:31 says, Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua Num 13:16 , which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, Jesus is not only a man but also Jehovah, and not only Jehovah but Jehovah becoming our salvation.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is God s anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is a title of commission.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Emmanuel</S>
