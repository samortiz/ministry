   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BRIDEGROOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The last point which John testified for Christ is that He is the Bridegroom John 3:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is something related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John was clear concerning who the Lord was, but John s disciples were not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They became quite concerned when they saw that more and more people went to Jesus instead of to John; therefore they came and told John what was happening.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was their feeling that the people should come to John.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, John told them, I said, I am not the Christ....He who has the bride is the bridegroom....He must increase, but I must decrease John 3:28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What John was saying to his disciples was that Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only should others go to Jesus, but his own disciples should go to Him also.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was as if John was saying, Do not come to me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am not the Christ; He is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am not the Bridegroom; He is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I must decrease, but He must increase to have the bride, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When John said, He must increase, but I must decrease, this means that Christ must have the church as His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The bride is the increase of the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all must decrease in order that Christ might increase to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today it is as if many would not allow Christ to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we keep our work for the Lord in our own hands as our own increase, we will not allow Christ to have the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, He who has the bride is the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church must be for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>DECREASED TO NOTHING</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The ultimate issue of John s ministry was the increase of Christ, but John was decreased to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Throughout the centuries, all the genuine servants raised up by the Lord have eventually been put away.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Apostle Paul labored abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His ministry was indeed wonderful, but eventually he was put into prison and then martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was simply cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ received the increase, but the Apostle Paul was decreased to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All of us today know the name of Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His ministry has been very much blessed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nevertheless, where is he now?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He has been in prison for over eighteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From his ministry, Christ has the increase!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Watchman Nee was simply decreased to nothing, and Christ has increased quite much.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is completely different from the way of those who glory over their own ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the Christian workers receive the increase themselves, Christ is forced to decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more we work for the Lord, the more we will be put away, and even the sooner we may be put away.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose there are two brothers here who are planning to migrate to Chicago to spread the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They need to be willing to be put away after something has been brought forth in Chicago.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all need to learn the lesson of being decreased.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our work should not be our increase, but Christ s. Our work must be His increase and our decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to consider what happened to John the Baptist after he said that he must decrease and Christ must increase.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First he was put into prison, and then he was tested.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Matthew 11, he sent some of his disciples to Jesus to ask Him if He was really the Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>John was somewhat challenging Jesus by saying, in effect, If You are the Messiah, why do You not rescue me from prison?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Neither the disciples of John nor the disciples of Jesus knew the intent of John s inquiry.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>John s question was, Are You the coming One, or should we expect someone else?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Matt 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No one else understood, but the Lord Jesus understood.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore He answered, Go, report to John what you hear and see: The blind receive sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised, and the poor have the gospel preached to them; and blessed is he who shall not be stumbled in Me Matt 11:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord was telling John that He did many miraculous things; yet He would do nothing for John.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Blessed is he who shall not be stumbled in Me. The Lord was telling John to be careful, and not to be stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What John asked, no one understood but Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When Jesus answered, no one understood but John.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All the others were messengers, sending and bringing the messages back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They simply could not understand what these two were talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Jesus understood what John meant, and John understood what Jesus meant.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore John, in a sense, could have said, Lord, I understand.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You must increase, and I must decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A little later, John was beheaded.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the Lord s way to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to tell people to repent for the kingdom of heaven and to be under the heavenly ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need to testify also that Jesus is the Son of God, the Lamb of God, and the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Furthermore, eventually He becomes the Bridegroom, and whatever we have worked out will become His bride, the church, which is His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He must increase, and we must decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Are you willing to serve the Lord in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the way to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should not labor with some expectation of a reward at our retirement, for the church will reward us with a decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He must increase, and we must decrease.</S>
