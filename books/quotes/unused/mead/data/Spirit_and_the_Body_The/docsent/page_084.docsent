   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FALSE PROPHECIES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1963 a so-called prophecy was given in Los Angeles that there would be a great earthquake and that Los Angeles would fall into the ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As a result of this prophecy, some people left Los Angeles and moved to other parts of the country.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, nothing happened.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The next year the same prophecy was given again, and an article regarding it was printed in a San Francisco paper.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Again nothing happened.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although so many prophecies given among the Pentecostal people have not been fulfilled, they still stubbornly insist upon practicing that kind of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the Old Testament, however, a false prophet was to be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But today's Pentecostal and charismatic circles are filled with such false prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet, no one seems to care whether the prophecies are true or false.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>KNOWING THE COUNTERFEIT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we all know, the charismatic movement has penetrated the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Fearing the loss of members, the pope allows it to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, the charismatic movement became mixed with the mass and even with the worship of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because we in the Lord's recovery are concerned about the practicality of the Body, I must present the real situation to you all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is much falsehood in the Pentecostal-charismatic movement.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The real and the false are mixed together, but the false outweighs the true.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The leaven is greater than the flour.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This mixture is the most damaging counterfeit to the Lord's recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord's recovery faces both fundamental Christianity and Pentecostal-charismatic Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we need to pray, to be clear, and to be on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must know what the counterfeit is.</S>
