   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED OF THE TRAINING WITH THE HOSPITALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One other thing needs to be mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Among us, some want to serve the Lord, but there is no place where they can receive any training.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In two places brothers wanted to learn to serve the Lord and were sent to seminaries.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Presently, the brothers in all the places can surely learn something in their own church regarding how to take care of affairs and how to participate in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, at the same time, they need some specific trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Presently, we have two hundred mous a Chinese acre of land in Kuling.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are some houses there, but the preparation work is only half complete; there are still many things that are not yet ready.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we had a few dozen co-workers meeting there, hospitality was a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some had to sleep in a nearby hospital, like patients on hospital beds, because the hospitality was not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is too poor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to consolidate the hospitality before we can meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>GRASPING THE BEST OPPORTUNITY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>TO OFFER UP EVERYTHING FOR THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today we have to offer up all our time for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once I was at a meeting, and I asked the attendants if there were over fifty young people among them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I discovered that all of them were middle-aged and I could not go on with what I was going to say.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today if we have six hundred young people raised up among us, we will be busy all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, we are short of people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the same time we need a few hundred or even a few thousand brothers who are holding jobs to provide the support.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do not do this, we will have no way to take care of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today our work has to be done in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the past we thought that as long as we would find full-time brothers and would commit the responsibility of the gospel work to them, all the problems would be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But this is not the way today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today we need to take care of the work together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No other period of time has been as easy as today for the gospel to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The opportunity for the gospel will be over in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Manchuria there are only two places left where the gospel can still be preached.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although North China has not yet fallen completely to the Communists, other than along a few railway lines, all the other places can no longer afford us the liberty to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If there are people who are strong enough and if we have enough money, we can bring three or five thousand people to the Lord in Foochow within a month.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once a person touches the gospel, he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once a person touches the gospel, he is subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we want to give our all, now is the best time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why are we not able to send out more people?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In these days we are eager to go on in a fast way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I hope that some would rise up from among us immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am not asking a little from you; I am asking everything from you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Lord's Word, there is no such thing as half-hearted Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a man wants to serve God, he has to offer up everything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If there is a group of people who will rise up to truly offer up everything, the world will see the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Unless we serve in this way, God will have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we want to serve, we have to be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are not absolute, we may as well not serve.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God wants everything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord requires everything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All those who are in their jobs, in their occupations, in their schools, or in their homes have to offer up themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need all the people and all the money to be spent on China.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today is the best opportunity for the gospel to be preached.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>CONCERNING THE MONEY RECEIVED</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the local brothers and sisters can put their offerings into the church offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Personal offerings can be given to the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The rest should be put in the fund for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If anyone wants to inquire about the accounting of the money for the work, you can go to Brother Lee and Brother Tang.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The accounting of the church can be found in the church business office.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The out-of-town brothers should first set aside an amount for their local use from their monthly offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If any money is designated for the work, it should be sent to Brother Witness and Brother Tang if it comes from the north, and should be sent to Brother Chen Ke-san and Chen Si-wen if it comes from the south.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>MAINTAINING A BALANCE</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Before God there are principles to everything we do, and we cannot do anything in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are not like the missionary societies, who practice corporate faith.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For over twenty years we have not dared to be tough in the matter of money.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today everything else may be soft, but if we are soft in the matter of money, God's Word will be softened.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we have a wrong attitude toward money and do not take care of it properly, God's Word will be sacrificed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the one hand, we do not want to see anyone taking godliness as a means of gain.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the other hand, we have to maintain God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We do not want to annul personal faith through corporate moves.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But at the same time, we wish to see all the needs met.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We hope that as long as there is prayer, there is answer to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In this matter we hope to maintain a proper balance before God.</S>
