   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEW THE GRACE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In typology Hermon signifies the heavens, the highest place in the universe, and the dew signifies the grace of life 1 Pet 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without the New Testament, it would be difficult for us to realize that dew signifies grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every Epistle written by Paul opens with a word about grace and closes with some mention of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was a young Christian in the denominations, I was told that grace denotes unmerited favor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to this understanding of grace, to receive grace is to receive something that we do not deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many Christians regard such unmerited favor as all the material blessings they receive from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, at the end of the year, some may count all the blessings God has given them that year: a good job, a bigger home, a late model automobile.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, according to Paul's word in Philippians 3:8, everything apart from Christ is "dung."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He would regard things such as a job, a house, and an automobile as nothing but "dung" in comparison to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The grace spoken of in the Scriptures does not refer to mere material blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As many verses in the New Testament make clear, grace is the processed God as the life supply to be our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Strictly speaking, grace is a New Testament term.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When used in the Old Testament, it has the meaning of favor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to John 1:17, grace came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, grace came also.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that grace came with the incarnated God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before the incarnation of Christ, grace had not come.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Grace came through incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many verses in the Acts speak of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts 4:33 says, "And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This verse indicates that the great power in resurrection was the great grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ in resurrection is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a grace is not a good house, job, or automobile.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is God experienced, received, enjoyed, and gained by the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Acts 11:23 we are told that in Antioch Barnabas saw the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He, of course, did not see material blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He saw that the believers in Antioch were experiencing God in Christ as their life supply for their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul said, "But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may compare this verse to Galatians 2:20, where Paul says, "Not I, but Christ liveth in me."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was not Paul himself who labored more than the other apostles; it was the grace of God which was with him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This grace by which Paul labored more than others was no doubt Christ Himself as the life power and life supply to Paul in his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Romans 5:2 Paul says that through Christ "we have the access by faith into this grace in which we stand."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The standing about which Paul is speaking here certainly is not something such as a house or a job.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is the Triune God who has been processed to become the all-inclusive Spirit as His ultimate consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Through Christ we can stand in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Romans 5:17 Paul goes on to say that "those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we have abundant grace, we shall be able to reign in life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This verse implies that grace is life and that life is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 1 Peter 3:7 Peter speaks of the grace of life, the inheritance of both a husband and wife.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Romans 5:21 Paul speaks about grace reigning unto eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All these verses indicate that grace is nothing less than Christ as our life power and life supply for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are clear about this, we can have a greater appreciation of the dew as a type of Christ in Psalm 133.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As the dew, the grace, becomes our enjoyment, we share in the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, if we are not under the dew that waters, refreshes, and saturates us, we cannot be one with other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is on the mountains of Zion that we experience this dew.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we would enjoy the dew which typifies the all-inclusive grace, we must be on one of the peaks, the mountaintops, of Zion.</S>
