<h2 class="head1">NOT PERSONAL SPIRITUALITY<br />
BUT THE BUILDING UP OF GOD&rsquo;S HOUSE</h2>
<p>Therefore, I am burdened to show the saints that those who serve the Lord should not focus only on spiritual matters. If we focus only on being spiritual, eventually we will not be spiritual. It is not a matter of whether we are spiritual. The issue is whether we let God open our eyes to see a vision and whether we receive a burden. If we focus on our spirituality and learning instead of receiving a vision, burden, and revelation from God, we will eventually fall. God&rsquo;s revelation, vision, and burden are great. They can uphold us and make us stand. Then even if we stumble, we will not fall down.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul said that he was not disobedient to the heavenly vision (Acts 26:19). This vision followed him and continually upheld him. If we are caught in the trap of being spiritual, we will have a tragic end and become useless to God. Such spirituality is manufactured and does not necessarily have its source in God. We do not learn to be spiritual. We can read <em>The Spiritual Man</em> ten thousand times but not become spiritual.</p>
<p>A person who pursues God and enjoys God will be spiritual. Only God can make a person spiritual. Hence, if we are in God, in His hand, plan, and move, we do not need to pursue spirituality. We will be spiritual. We cannot make ourselves spiritual; only God can make us spiritual. I have been considering what being spiritual means. My understanding of spirituality is different from what it was in the past. What we thought was spirituality is not spirituality. Genuine spirituality depends on our learning to receive God&rsquo;s burden.</p>
<p>Hudson Taylor received a burden that was different from his spiritual learning. If he had been zealous for the gospel, like Billy Graham or John Sung, it would not be strange that he received a burden to evangelize China. However, Hudson Taylor was not such a person. He learned to live in the presence of God and to fellowship with the Lord. He then received a burden that differed from what he had learned. He was neither trapped nor limited by his learning.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING ONLY TO WORK AND TO HELP OTHERS</h2>
<p>I usually do not expect a result in whatever I do, nor do I care for the result. I know only to labor. I also do not hold many opinions. This characteristic was recognized by the senior co-workers. I do not wish to speak about myself, but I want to fellowship with you. Whenever there was a crucial matter to be decided, the senior workers would first fellowship with others before they fellowshipped with me. When it was time to carry something out, they fellowshipped with me to ask me to carry it out. They would first fellowship with others to hear their opinions, then they fellowshipped with me to ask me to carry it out. They did this because I did not have many opinions. This is one thing I can boast of. I am a person who knows only to work; I do not give opinions or care for results.</p>
<p>May the Lord cover me to testify that I do not covet anything. From the day I began to serve full time, I have not coveted anything. I know only to immerse myself in the work, and I do not care who is credited with the result of my labor. Therefore, I find it difficult to make a plan and instruct others how to carry it out. It is not that I do not wish to take the lead but that I do not have many opinions or care for results. I know only to work. When the Lord led me to northern China, I knew only to work hard and let go of any results. I did not care about any gain or loss. When the Lord led me to Shanghai, for about three years I knew only to immerse myself in the work and nothing else. I was still working the day before I boarded an airplane to come to Taiwan. I did not know what would be the result of my labor, because the result was not in my hand.</p>
<p>I say this so that no one will depend on me to push them or to make plans and arrangements for them. On the one hand, there are still things that I need to learn, but on the other hand, for the past seven or eight years I have tried my best to help the brothers in Taiwan serve the Lord. I did not express any opinions. I knew only to work and help others to work. I never had the thought of controlling anyone or lording it over anyone. I do not care for this. I know only to take care of my responsibility. This has always been my practice.</p>
<p>Brother Sparks once testified concerning me and said that Brother Lee does not know anything but to work. This comment may be too much, but it is true that I know only to work. In my relationship with the saints I try my best to assist, encourage, and admonish without assuming a position. Therefore, I hope that we can learn to be before the Lord and coordinate for the building, instead of waiting for someone to motivate us.</p>
<p>We also need to see that coordination for the building is the secret to being blessed. I thank the Lord for His mercy that I have not had problems with any workers in the service. This is especially true in regard to coordination with the senior workers. I learned that the good points, faults, strengths, and weaknesses of the saints are not my business. I do not work with the saints because of their strengths or weaknesses. I work with them for the Lord&rsquo;s interest, testimony, and glory. As long as the Lord&rsquo;s interest, testimony, and glory are not hindered or damaged, I will coordinate with the saints by complementing what they can do. I will not step on them. We have to learn to work in this way and not oppose or step on others. Everyone&rsquo;s work has its place and its value. We should learn to work with others by adding our portion to theirs. The workers should learn to serve in this way before the Lord.</p>
