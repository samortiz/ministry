   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD DOING THE WORK OF TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH PATIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although we are God s reproduction, this reproduction God s hobby is not so complete or perfect, because many of us who have God s life do not live by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some do live by God s life, but they do not live by His life continually.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perhaps in the morning they live by God s life, but later in the day they may lose their temper and live like a scorpion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that in the morning they are gods, but later they are scorpions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the evening they may become even worse, living like the devil, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not too much to say that a believer in Christ can live like Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One day the Lord Jesus turned to Peter, someone who loved Him, and said to him, Get behind Me, Satan!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Matt 16:23a .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because Peter had become Satan, he needed to bear his cross so that Satan could be put on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In our daily living we may be God at one time, a scorpion at another time, and Satan at yet another time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because this is our actual situation, we surely need to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you know what our God is doing today?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is doing the work of transformation in us with patience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>REVOLUTIONIZED BY REALIZING WHO WE ARE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since the ministry began in the United States in 1962, I have actually ministered only one matter God becoming a man that man may become God in life and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, it was not until February 1994 that I received such a clear view with a heavy burden to tell God s people that we all are God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To know who we are and to realize who we are revolutionizes us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose a certain brother who has been living like a scorpion realizes that, as a child of God, he is God in life and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Immediately this brother will be radically changed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The atmosphere and everything related to him will also be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If all of today s Christians realized that they were God in life and in nature, the whole world would be different.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During the past ten months, I have often checked with myself: Is a God-man like this?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have spoken that the believers have become God in life and in nature, yet what are you now?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Are you God or are you something else?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My answer has been to repent and ask for the Lord s forgiveness because at least some of the things I did were not in Him or according to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This realization has revolutionized me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE STALENESS OF FUNDAMENTAL CHRISTIANITY</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the one hand, outwardly God as the Ruler of the universe has done many things so that people from everywhere in the world can be blended.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the other hand, God has a recovery on earth, and His recovery has been under His leading for seventy-two years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During these years He has released thousands of printed messages, and these messages are in thousands of homes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These messages have been received in many countries around the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On a regular basis I receive letters of appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Recently someone wrote to me saying that he had been listening to lies about us, but when he read the Life-study of Galatians, his eyes were opened and he could see the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such publications have reached many nations, and we believe that the Lord will use them to gain what He desires.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christianity has been on earth for more than nineteen centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It has kept and continues to teach the fundamental faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But its fundamental faith has not reached the peak of the divine revelation that God became a man through incarnation and then passed through human living, death, and resurrection in order to have a mass reproduction of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because fundamental Christianity has not reached this peak, the fundamental teachings have become stale.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As a result, many in the denominations do not have a goal, and they do not know where they should go.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even many leading ones in today s Christianity do not know how to go on; they have nowhere to go.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Visit the Christian bookstores and see what kind of books are being sold there.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many books are filled with old, stale fundamental teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because fundamental Christianity has become stale, it has lost its impact and effect, like salt which has become tasteless Matt 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Who is the salt among the Christians in the United States?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Salt is supposed to kill corruption, but where is this killing power among today s Christians?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In most communities it is hard to tell who are Christians and who are not Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the people are about the same.</S>
