   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Mrs.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Penn-Lewis once said, "Many believers say that they have encountered a lot of pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The battle now seems to grow thicker day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It seems as if we are the only target of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the question now is whether you can persevere through the final half-hour.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Daniel 7:25 says, And he will..wear out the saints of the Most High.'</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To wear out is to consume.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now the work of consuming the saints has already begun.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is harder to recognize Satan as the one who consumes the saints than to recognize him as the roaring lion."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I was in Kuling, I often strolled by a stream and saw a rock as big as a washbasin with a hole in its middle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The hole was formed by the daily grinding of the many small pebbles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Satan acts likewise with God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He does not kill you with one stroke.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, he will try to consume you day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After a while, without knowing it, you will be seriously wounded by him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brothers and sisters, although you are suffering, can you not persevere just a moment?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Can you not persevere with the Lord in this final half hour?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Is it really true that you are not able to watch with the Lord a moment?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Oh, today is our time, the time when we ought to stand firm.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a person has never experienced adverse winds, he is most pitiful!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a person has never reckoned that the world is bitter, corrupt, and can persecute people, this person has never started his journey!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You will encounter hardship and realize that the wind is contrary only when you are faithful in your walking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only then will you hear a voice telling you, "It is too hard.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why not loosen up a little and rest a moment?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But it is foolish to rest now because much of the way has been covered.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"And He was alone on the land.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And seeing them distressed as they rowed, for the wind was contrary to them, He came toward them about the fourth watch of the night, walking on the sea, and He intended to pass by them."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord wants to see if we will keep our faith or renounce it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He wants to see if we will advance or retreat.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His eyes are on you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He pays attention to every step we take.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He knows how great our temptations are and how difficult our circumstances are.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He will not let us endure beyond the fourth watch.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the night is far advanced, He comes to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He has died for us and ascended to the heavens to pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the same time, He sees our hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the night is far advanced, He will come.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is something special in verse 48: the Lord "intended to pass by them."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many have found this difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It seems as if the Lord had no intention to go to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if we consider what the Lord is doing today, we will not have any problem understanding this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since the Lord had commanded His disciples to go to the other side to Bethsaida, He descended the mountain and went forward to Bethsaida.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Could the Lord go to another place to wait for them?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord was looking for the disciples along the same path which He had commanded them to take.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If they had turned at a corner, the Lord would not have met them when He came.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If they had gone on a wrong course, the Lord would not have gone on a wrong pathway to wait for them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is very sobering!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have always considered that if the Lord commanded me to go to Shanghai and I went instead to Nanking, I would miss the rapture when He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is because the rapture takes place only along the pathway that the Lord has ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you are not there, you will miss the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Each one of us has to bear his own responsibility as to which way he should go.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verse 51 says, "And He went up unto them into the boat, and the wind ceased."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As soon as the Lord comes, everything is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thank and praise the Lord, the wind may be contrary, but it will not remain contrary forever.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Though rowing is a toil, we will not need to row forever.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Perhaps the Lord is on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brothers and sisters, we can suffer hardship on this earth because the Lord has died for us in the past and will come back again in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord's constraining love is behind us, and the hope of His coming is before us and drawing us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One missionary said, "I have the Lord as my portion; this is why I can forsake all."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord's eyes are on us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not fear hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we change direction now for fear of hardship, all the hardship we have endured in the past will come to naught.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A person who is very deep in the Lord once said, "When we read 2 Thessalonians 2:3 and 2 Timothy 3:1-13, we can realize that before the Lord's coming, there will be a falling away, and perilous times, and evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These apostasies do not refer to education, religious activities, able pastors, splendid worship halls, or intellectual and material progress.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Rather, they refer to the denial of faith and the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Presently, some famous denominations are inclined towards the Higher Criticism which is actually low-class unbelief , which denies God's supernatural work, such as regeneration, sanctification, definite answers to prayers, and the revelation of the divine things to men through the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the days before the Lord's coming, there will be great deceit and delusion.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If it has its way, even the elect will be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Furthermore, the "form of godliness" will exceedingly increase.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The decrease of faith will be due not only to the love of the world and the denial of God's Word, but will also be due to the false faith fashioned by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>One brother said, "These works of Satan will become an invisible influence in the air surrounding us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They will become a form of godliness, which will be inhabited by the evil spirits and which will be occupied with the oppression of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>These evil spirits will do their utmost to harm, deceitfully lead, confuse, and oppress God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They will affect our bodies, suppress our mood, and darken our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Various strange feelings and trials unheard of in the past will come upon us and will strip us in a surprising way of all willingness and ability to incline toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Our spirit will be tired and weak, our mind will be dull, and our will will slumber.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We will be strangely covetous of the things which God forbids and will surprisingly love the amusement and customs of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We will find it difficult to preach with full freedom and power and will find it hard to listen attentively to a message or kneel down to give ourselves to prayer continually.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>At such a time as today, when the evening is at hand, we must quell this kind of atmosphere!"</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Oh, let us be strong in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Satan will certainly endeavor with unthinkable power to deceive our mind and our will; he will make it difficult for us to carry on an intimate walk with the Lord, and we will find it easy to live according to the flesh and harder to faithfully serve God and give ourselves to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It will seem as if our entire being is stirred up to oppose our following the Lord Jesus to the end and seduce us to make a covenant with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The atmosphere around us wants to distract us from God, so that we would be cold in prayer, dull in our spiritual senses, and blind to the reality of the heavenly things and to the glorious presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It also causes us to neglect our fellowship with God and think that it is difficult to maintain a constant fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We sense that all these things are beginning to affect us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The lusts of the world are knitting a stretched-out net through many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This knitting has become stronger and more powerful in many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Many things which were prohibited in previous generations are not only done today but practiced without any sense of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Many places of worship have not only rejected spiritual things and ceased from having revival but are introducing all sorts of entertainments and dubious activities.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Generally speaking, everywhere on earth, we see a waning of faith and a departure from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We admit that there are exceptions and there are places which are blessed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But taken as a whole, the condition of all the churches on earth gives us a mournful picture.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>As we behold this situation, we cannot help but call upon the churches of God to rise up, strengthen themselves, and return to fellowship with God, so that in the remaining days, they will please the Lord and be prepared to "be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ" 2 Cor 5:10 and give an account of what they have done.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Brothers and sisters, what we have spoken are true words.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I do not know what your feeling is toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Every day I sense that the whole world is against us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We can only have one of two attitudes: stand fast or relax.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The world still welcomes us and so does Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But the Lord has compelled us to go to the other side to Bethsaida.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If, at this time, we are not faithful, we will never be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Many of God's children have suffered for the Lord and have taken the lonely journey.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Shall we be like what one British brother wrote in a poem, which says that while others go to the Lord through a sea of blood, we go to Him on a bridal sedan?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Moses said unto the sons of Gad and sons of Reuben, "Shall your brothers go to the war while you stay here?"</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Num 32:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Brothers and sisters, while others are faithful and suffering, can we sit still in peace?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Surely there is hardship, but that is far better than drifting.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Every one of us ought to faithfully serve the Lord and every one ought to take the journey that He has ordained until we reach the other side.</S>
