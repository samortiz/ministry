   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-ONE SIX QUESTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING ROMANS 8:10</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You that we have come again to Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We come to Your Word even through Your precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, we come also to Your oracle, to Your today s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, we praise You for Your mercy, and we praise You even the more for Your grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, how much we need Your further mercy, Your fresh mercy, and the sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, we thank You that You are really one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, we pray that tonight we may enjoy Your oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, be one with us in our listening, in our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, grant us the deeper understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Oh, grant us the proper apprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, we need You.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need You in the hearing of Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, especially in the speaking we need You.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do like to practice the one spirit with You in the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lord, do speak Your Word in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Make our speaking Yours.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Make Your speaking one with ours.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lord, do cover us with Your prevailing blood and defeat the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Destroy the power of darkness and take away all the deceit of the evil spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Lord, do cover our mentality; cover our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We thank You for Your cleansing blood, and we thank You for Your covering blood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lord, we do enjoy Your anointing under this blood.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Grant us the light, the enlightenment, even the revelation with Your vision, that we may see the secrets of the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>May we see the secret of how to enjoy You and how to experience all the deeper truths revealed in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lord, tonight You know that we have come to these two verses: nine and ten.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are deep, and they are profound.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Lord, we need You to open up these two verses.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Show us the depth of all these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Grant us Your thought, even Your way of thinking that we may get into the depths.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Grant us a clear understanding, not the natural understanding or the ethical religious understanding, but the understanding in You and in Your Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Again, we say that we need You.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thank You that You are so available.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You are one with us all the way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Your precious name, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this message we need to consider Romans 8:9-10.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 9 the words if indeed actually should be since.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let us read the two verses with that change.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, since the Spirit of God dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 9 begins with a conjunction but indicating a contrast.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 8 says that those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 9 presents the contrast by saying, but you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then you have the word since.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is a big difference between the terms if indeed and since.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If indeed mainly refers to a condition that has not been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But since refers to a condition which has already been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If is a kind of subjunctive, but since refers to a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The fact becomes a condition for something to be done to you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to the Greek lexicons, the word used here primarily means since rather than if indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since the Spirit of God dwells in you indicates a fact, but this fact is a term, a condition.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since you have this fact, you are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since the Spirit of God dwells in you, you are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Suppose the Spirit of God didn t dwell in you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then you would not be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Two facts are here: the Spirit of God dwells in you, and you are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The first fact becomes a condition to the second fact.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As you have the first fact, then you have the second fact.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In other messages I have pointed out that the Spirit of God dwelling in you is a term, or a condition, for you to be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You have to realize both of these facts are progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Spirit of God dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is a fact which is not accomplished once for all, but is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In like manner, our being in the spirit is not a fact once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is a kind of fact accomplished and still going on progressively.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On the one hand, it is accomplished, but on the other hand, it is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then in verse 9 there is the matter of the Spirit of God dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Greek word used here has as its root the word house.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is altogether right to translate the word dwells as houses.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The same root word is found in Ephesians 3:17 where it says that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In Ephesians, however, it has a prefix kata, which strengthens the meaning of making home.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is a strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We all know that to get yourself settled in your home is not a once for all matter.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You get settled, and from then on you get more settled.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should let the Spirit of God get more and more settled within us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>On the one hand, fifty years ago the Spirit of God got settled within me.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But on the other hand, today He is more settled in me, and I believe that if I could live on this earth longer, He would become more settled.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>So this is a fact, yet with progression.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>First, it is an accomplished fact as a term or condition for your being in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then this fact will grow or progress and your being in the spirit will also progress.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We have mentioned previously the difference between the two prepositions of and in. Of indicates position, and in indicates condition.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We all are of Christ, but what about our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>To be of Christ is our position.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But according to our condition today, we may not be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We may not be in the spirit.</S>
