<h2 class="head2">Praying with Authority</h2>
<p>We will now fellowship a few matters concerning preaching the gospel. When we preach the gospel, we first need to pray. Preaching the gospel is a matter of spiritual warfare. Merely preaching doctrine cannot turn a person. People do not believe in the Lord, because they are completely deceived by Satan. Even though unbelievers realize that there are benefits to believing in Jesus, they still oppose the gospel and reject the Lord. Their refusal to believe in Him is the result of Satan&rsquo;s activity within them. Satan deceives, blinds, usurps, and controls men. For this reason, we must pray. We must pray to touch the throne of God, rather than pray merely for a powerful message. We must pray to shake the gates of Hades, that is, to shake the authority of Satan.</p>
<p>We should bow our knees and pray that the Lord would shake Satan&rsquo;s kingdom and men&rsquo;s hearts. Instead of asking the Lord and pleading with Him, our prayer should release people&rsquo;s souls. This is more than asking. We belong to Christ who is victorious; therefore, we are also victorious. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations&rdquo; (Matt. 28:18-19). The Lord charges us to go and preach the gospel to all the people in the nations so that they may become the Lord&rsquo;s disciples. Therefore, this is a time to exercise authority, not to cry and plead. We can exercise authority because all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to us. This authority was given to the Lord. Now the Lord has commissioned us to use this authority to deal with the authority of darkness. We should pray in this way. Every one of us should have such prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Cleansed</h2>
<p>When we preach the gospel, we also need to be cleansed. However, we cannot cleanse ourselves. Being cleansed means that we should go to the Lord and receive His shining, confess our sins, and ask for cleansing. If our conscience is not clean and our spirit is not fresh, we cannot preach the gospel. In order to preach the gospel, we must go to the Lord and consecrate ourselves to Him so that He can shine on us. Then we can deal with our sins and empty our entire being to clear out everything of the world inside and outside of us. Any connection with the world is a link to Satan, and if we are in communication and collaboration with the enemy, we cannot fight against him. We must cut our ties to the enemy by dealing with our sins and the world in us. Then Satan will be fearful when we pray.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Satan will accuse us before God when we pray. When Joshua the high priest stood before God in Zechariah 3:1-4, Satan was there also. Satan seemed to say to God, Joshua is clothed with filthy garments. On Joshua&rsquo;s behalf, God said, &ldquo;Jehovah rebuke you, Satan!...Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?&rdquo; God then asked the angels to remove Joshua&rsquo;s filthy garments and clothe him with stately robes. Thus, Joshua could stand before God to deal with God&rsquo;s enemy and lead the people to build God&rsquo;s temple.</p>
<p>If we want to preach the gospel in a prevailing way, we should not remember other people&rsquo;s souls but neglect our own soul. This is not merely to have good behavior before men. It is a matter of dealing with Satan&rsquo;s usurpation within man. We preach the gospel to chase out Satan from within men. To preach the gospel is to cast out demons. In order to cast out demons, we cannot have any connection or be in collaboration with them. They must not have any ground within us. Therefore, when we pray, we must be cleansed by allowing the Lord to enlighten us, deal with us, and cleanse us from our sins.</p>
<p>On the night that the Lord Jesus was betrayed, Peter publicly denied the Lord with an oath and said, &ldquo;I do not know the man!&rdquo; (Matt. 26:71-72). Fifty days later Peter could stand in the same city of Jerusalem, preach to the Jews, and say to them that they had denied Jesus (Acts 3:13-14). The word <em>denied</em> in this passage is the same word used in relation to Peter when he denied the Lord. But after fifty days Peter was able to say to the Jews that they denied the Lord. If Peter did not receive the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness and have a clear conscience, he could not have spoken to the Jews in this way. Instead, he probably would have said, &ldquo;I denied the Lord fifty days ago. I cannot hold you accountable for the same sin.&rdquo; Peter did not say this, because he was cleansed.</p>
<p>Formerly we were sinners, but if we still live in our sins and do not deal with them, we will not be able to speak. Moreover, when we speak with others concerning the gospel, our conscience will accuse us of not being qualified to preach the gospel if we are still connected to the world. Consequently, we will lack the boldness to speak strongly. In order to have a good conscience so that we can speak with boldness, we must be cleansed in the precious blood of the Lord. When our conscience is strengthened and our spirit is filled, we will be living and our words will be fresh, even if we only say, &ldquo;Jesus is our Savior,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Repent and believe in Jesus.&rdquo; When people hear us, they will feel the power of the Holy Spirit. Hence, if we want to preach the gospel, we must deal with the Lord.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> </body></html>
