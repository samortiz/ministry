<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Imparting All His Riches into Us<br>for Our Enjoyment</H2><P>While God is dwelling in us and operating in us to perfect us, He is dispensing, imparting, all His riches into us for our enjoyment in His love through the grace of Christ and the fellowship of the Spirit (2 Cor. 13:14). While He is working, He is imparting and dispensing Himself bit by bit in all His riches into our being. When He is imparting Himself into us, He is making Himself us that we may become Him. Athanasius, one of the church fathers, said concerning Christ, "He was made man that we might be made God." God's move in man is to make man God in His life and nature but not in His Godhead. He is the unique God for people to worship in His Godhead, but we are made God only in life and in nature, not in the Godhead. This is God's move within us to write His sweet and pleasant history.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. As the God of All Grace</H2><P>In Christ's ascension God moves within us as the God of all grace, perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding us that we may participate in His eternal glory, into which He has called us in Christ (1 Pet. 5:10). Even though Peter was only a fisherman without any kind of scholastic attainment, he was able to write such a marvelous word. Actually, however, the very God who was moving in Peter was the One who wrote this. Eventually, through God's move in us, we will participate in His eternal glory. The eternal glory will not come to us by accident. The coming glory is being built up today by God's move in us. He is now perfecting us to build up that glory. He is now establishing us to build up that glory. He is now strengthening us and grounding us to build up that glory. Eventually, that glory will be a building, the holy city, the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:10-11). The place where we should be is the divine glory, which is now being built up by God's perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding. This is all God's move in us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. As the Father of All of Us, Being over All of Us,<br>through All of Us, and in All of Us</H2><P>God's move within us in the ascension of Christ is as the Father of all of us, being over all of us, through all of us, and in all of us for the constituting and building up of the Body of Christ in the oneness of His Divine Trinity (Eph. 4:3-6, 12). Ephesians 4:6 shows us that even the Father is triune because He is in three directions. Over all refers to the Father, through all to the Son, and in all to the Spirit. This is for the constituting and building up of the Body of Christ with the Spirit as the essence of the Body, with the Son as the element of the Body, and with the Father as the source of the Body. This is all God's move in us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. SUCH A MOVE OF GOD IN CHRIST WITHIN US<br>BEING ALSO A PART OF GOD'S HISTORY<br>IN HIS UNION WITH MAN</H2><P>As we have seen, such a move of God in Christ within us in His offices and ministries in ascension is a part of God's history in His union with man.</P>
