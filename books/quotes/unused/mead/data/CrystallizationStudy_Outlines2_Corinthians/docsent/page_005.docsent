   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Five The Essence and Glory of the New Covenant Ministry Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:7-11, 18; 4:4, 6 The new covenant ministry has an essence in two aspects the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of righteousness 2 Cor 3:8-9: The ministry of the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit who gives life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>8, 6 , because the new covenant brings in God s righteousness unto life Rom 5:18, 21 ; hence, the new covenant ministry is also a ministry of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As the old covenant ministry was of death and condemnation, so the new covenant ministry is of the Spirit and of righteousness; death is versus life, which is embodied in the Spirit, and condemnation is versus righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit and righteousness are the two aspects of an essence which is inscribed into us by the ministry of the new covenant; this Spirit and this righteousness are the essence of the new covenant ministry 2 Cor 3:8-9.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul s view of the Spirit in 2 Corinthians 3 is that of an essence used for inscribing letters of Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2-3: As indicated by with in verse 3, the spiritual ink, the Spirit of the living God, is an essence used in the writing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A divine essence has been written into our being, and this essence is the Spirit: The unique essence which needs to be inscribed into the saints is the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The new covenant ministry inscribes the Spirit into us, that is, this ministry adds more of the essence of God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The essence of the Spirit inscribed into us is life v. 6; 4:12.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Based upon the principle that the Spirit in 2 Corinthians 3 is an essence, righteousness is also an essence v. 9; 5:21.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The ministry of the new covenant inscribes an essence into our being, an essence that has an inner aspect and an outer aspect; the inner aspect is the living Spirit moving in us, and the outer aspect is righteousness as our expression 3:3, 8-9.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The goal of the new covenant ministry is to minister Christ as the life-giving Spirit inwardly and as the living righteousness outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit and righteousness are both related to our expressing the image of God v. 18 ; the reason for this is that the Spirit and righteousness are both God Himself: The central vision of the Bible is related to the image of God expressed by the life of God Gen 1:26; 2:9; Rev 4:3; 21:10-11; 22:1-2, 14.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God as the Spirit is moving in us as a substance and living in us as an essence, for He Himself has been added into our being by the new covenant ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The righteousness we express outwardly is also God Himself, for we have God as our righteousness, and this righteousness becomes our appearance, our expression.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Righteousness is the outward expression of the Christ who lives in us as the life-giving Spirit: This righteousness is God s image Eph 4:24; Col 3:10.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The new covenant ministry is a ministry of the Lord s image 2 Cor 3:9, 18.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To say that the ministry of the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness is equal to saying that the new covenant ministry is a ministry of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>8-9: The Spirit is God within us living, moving, and acting, and righteousness is God expressed to become our appearance outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since the Spirit inwardly and the righteousness outwardly are God Himself, the ministry of the new covenant, a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness, is a ministry of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whereas the old covenant ministry came about in glory and was through glory, the new covenant ministry is in glory and abounds in glory vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>7-11: In 3:7-11 we see the inferiority of the glory of the Mosaic ministry, the ministry of the old covenant, a ministry of condemnation and death, and the superiority of the apostolic ministry, a ministry of righteousness and the Spirit: The glory of the new covenant ministry is the glory of God manifested in the face of Christ, which is God shining Himself in the hearts of the apostles v. 8; 4:6.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With the old covenant ministry, there was glorification; with the new covenant ministry, there is the glory itself, even the surpassing glory 3:10.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The apostolic ministry of the new covenant not only has glory but also abounds with the glory of God v. 9.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The glory of the new covenant ministry does not come to visit us it comes to remain in us and to shine out from within our being; this glory comes first to invade, pervade, permeate, soak, and saturate us and then to shine forth from within us 4:4, 6; 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The glory of the new covenant ministry is the resurrected Christ Christ as the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17-18: The resurrected Christ is Himself the glory of the new covenant John 7:39; 17:1, 5; Luke 24:26; Acts 3:13; Rom 6:4.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Glory, which is an essence, is intimately related to the Spirit 2 Cor 3:18: The glory in verse 18 is equal to the Lord Spirit; thus, the glory actually is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ in resurrection is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The glory of the new covenant, being the resurrected Christ, is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The glory, the Spirit, and resurrection all refer to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit the glory of the new covenant ministry is now shining in us all 2 Cor 4:4, 6.</S>
