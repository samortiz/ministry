   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE TWO THE CHURCH IN PHILIPPI Scripture Reading: Phil 1:1-11, 19, 27; 2:1-2; 4:2, 14-18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider certain features of the church in Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Philippi was the chief city in the province of Macedonia of the old Roman Empire Acts 16:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through Paul s first ministry journey to Europe Acts 16:10-12 , a church was raised up in this city, the first church in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. ESTABLISHED IN GOOD ORDER</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Philippians 1:1 Paul says, Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse indicates that the church in Philippi was established in good order.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Notice that Paul speaks of the saints...with the overseers and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the only place in the New Testament where such an expression is found.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is significant that Paul speaks of the saints with the overseers and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In every local church the unique group consists of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The saints are the components of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Among the saints there are leading ones, which the New Testament describes as elders or overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Overseers are the elders in a local church Acts 20:17, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Elder denotes the person, whereas overseer denotes the function.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When an elder functions, he exercises oversight.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, he is an overseer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here overseers are mentioned instead of elders to indicate that the elders were proper in their responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the second century, Ignatius taught that the overseers, or bishops, are higher than the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He claimed that the elders are local and that the overseers, bishops, exercise authority in an area greater than a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ignatius concept, however, is altogether contrary to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The New Testament indicates clearly that the elders are the overseers and that the overseers are elders.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Both titles refer to the same people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When an elder is carrying out his responsibility in the church, he is functioning as an overseer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The overseers, therefore, are not a group of people different from the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1:1 Paul also mentions the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Deacons are the serving ones in a local church under the direction of the overseers 1 Tim 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The English word deacon is an anglicized form of the Greek word diakonos, which means a serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Philippians 1:1, which shows that a local church is composed of the saints with overseers to take the lead and deacons to serve, indicates that the church in Philippi was in good order.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul did not say to all the saints and the overseers and deacons ; he said all the saints with the overseers and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Greek preposition rendered with actually means together with.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If Paul had used the conjunction and instead of the preposition with, this would indicate that in a local church there should be three groups of people the saints, the overseers, and the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But his use of with indicates that there are not three such groups in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The concept of today s organized Christianity is to have various distinct classes of people within the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is against the Bible, however, to have different classes of believers in a local assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The New Testament reveals that in a local church there is a unique group, and this group is composed of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Writing under the leading of the Holy Spirit, Paul wrote in a deliberate, cautious way, using the preposition with and not the conjunction and.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul s use of the preposition instead of the conjunction is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It indicates that in any locality there should be just one church, which must include all the saints in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We thank the Lord that in spite of all the divisions, we have been recovered to the original standing of the church: that of one church in a locality including all the saints as the unique group of people.</S>
