   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In eternity future there will be people who are not regenerated believers.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the nations look at the way the Lord Jesus lives and acts, His deeds will become a source of healing to them, and this healing will maintain their human life forever.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, in the consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the believers will be the royal family, the ruling ones, but the nations will be the common people, the ruled ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We thank the Lord that in His mercy He first made us vessels of mercy unto honor and then unto glory.</S>
