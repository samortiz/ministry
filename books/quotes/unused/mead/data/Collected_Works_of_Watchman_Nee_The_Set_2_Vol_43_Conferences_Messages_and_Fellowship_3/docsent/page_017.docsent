   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPHERE OF THE LOCAL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God only establishes local churches in various localities.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We cannot see any unit that is bigger or smaller than the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The local church is the biggest as well as the smallest unit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The local church is the one and only institution of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Bible all the churches were local.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There were the church in Corinth, the church in Ephesus, the church in Jerusalem, the church in Antioch, and the church in Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All these churches were named after localities.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although there might have been many meeting places in Jerusalem, there was only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although the meetings might have been held in various places, there was one and only one fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although there were many divisions in Corinth, they met only in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The sphere of the church is based on the boundary of the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the Christians in a locality are in the church in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, all the believers in Shanghai form the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God takes the city, the town, or the village as the unit for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can only read of "the church in Ephesus"; we cannot read of "such and such church in Ephesus," because "such and such church" is not qualified to be the church of God in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE FORMATION OF DENOMINATIONS AND SECTS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church includes all the believers in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, on the earth today there are many so-called churches that are not based on locality as the unit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They cannot be called the church, because they are not qualified to be considered as a unit of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are at least three thousand such units in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In China alone, there are over one hundred such units, and over seventy such units in Shanghai alone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because they cannot form a unit for the church, they are not qualified to be called the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, they are called sects or denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If I tear my Bible into five parts and give one part to you, can you say that it is the New Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No, you can only say that it is a part of the Bible because it cannot represent the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a person's work in a particular locality is not big enough in its representation, it is not big enough to represent the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The unit of the church is based on the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One problem is that man makes the unit of the church smaller than it should be.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Another problem is that man makes the unit of the church bigger than it should be.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Revelation 2 and 3 speak of seven local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The local church is the largest entity in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He does not combine several local churches together; they are all separate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Revelation speaks of the seven lampstands which represent the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is not one lamp with seven branches, but seven lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The local churches in Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea were no bigger than their respective localities.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A local church cannot be subdivided into smaller units, nor can it be united to form bigger units.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There were seven churches on the earth, and there were seven lampstands in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In other words the number of local churches on the earth was represented by an equal number in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every locality has its own administration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The failure of one church cannot be blamed on another church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The local church is the unique unit for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Having a local church in smaller units is the same as having divisions cf.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>1 Cor 1:10-12 ; combining several local churches together is the same as forming a denomination or a council.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Divisions and denominations are produced because man will not work according to the practice of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some people try to be our spokesmen, saying that our testimony is "anti-denominational."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If this is our only objective, we have betrayed the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are here because we want to do what the apostles did establish local churches, not because we are against the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Too many believers today have not seen the work of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They have not seen that the apostles did not establish their own meetings; rather, they set up local churches in various localities.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once they established a local church, they left the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The local churches were not under their hands, nor did the local churches belong to them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today many are sent by mission boards of certain denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After they establish a meeting in a locality, the meeting belongs to that denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is like flying a kite; a string is attached, and the kite moves by a pull of the string.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Last summer I read the biography of Hudson Taylor once again.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the third time I have read his biography.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I received much help from him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The China Inland Mission was a mission, yet the result of its work was China Inland Mission churches.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In order to avoid offending anyone, I will not mention the name of a brother I once met from the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the course of our conversation, I said, "Mr. So-and-so, you are an Englishman.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You and your wife have suffered a great deal and have gained quite a few Miao natives.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Are you setting up the church in Dali, or are you establishing the China Inland Mission in Dali?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Today I do not oppose the China Inland Mission to which you belong.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Although I cannot join, I do not oppose it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What I do oppose is the China Inland Mission church which you established.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I would not comment on you as an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But the work produced by your mission is wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He said, "Mr. Nee, I understand what you mean."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The apostle Paul was sent from Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Suppose he came to Ephesus and set up the Antioch Church in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Suppose Peter, who also traveled much, came to Ephesus and saved fifty or one hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Suppose he said, "I will not put my people in Paul's Antioch Church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>That church is not related to me.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I am from Jerusalem, and I will call my church the Jerusalem Church in Ephesus."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Suppose Barnabas and Philip also arrived, did their own work, and established their own churches.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In this way different kinds of work would result in many divisions among the people.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God cannot tolerate this kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Brothers!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I can work together with you, but I have to ask you one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is not a matter of cooperation among co-workers but a matter of the result of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Where can we place those who are saved?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We are servants of all but masters of none.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The relationship I have with the assembly in Shanghai is the same as the relationship you have with Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The local assembly exercises complete authority over itself and is absolutely not related to the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Bible only teaches the establishing of local churches; it does not teach the establishing of churches that are based on an organization to which one belongs.</S>
