   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Consummating in Babylon Signified by Babel</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Out of the nations, Babel came up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This signifies that out of the denominations, Babylon came out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the divisions and denominations will consummate in the great Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Babylon is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you read the New Testament, you can see that from among the divisions of Christianity, that is, from among all the denominations, Babylon comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the nations in ancient times issued in Babel, and all the denominations in Christianity eventually will consummate in the great Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once again we see that Genesis is a book of seeds, for here in Genesis 10 we have the seed of Babylon and in Revelation 17 and 18 we have the harvest of Babylon the great.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1 From the Line of the Curse</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Babel came out of the nations that were along the line of the curse 10:6, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The cursed line was with Ham.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Cush, the builder of Babel, was Ham's son, and Nimrod, the son of Cush, became the first king over the kingdom of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a type of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christianity is altogether typified by the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Out of the nations Babel came out of the cursed line.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What was the cause of the curse?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ham was cursed because of his rebellion against God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The descendants of Ham, under God's curse because of Ham's rebellion against the divine government, were utilized by Satan to set up his satanic system, Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The same is true today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Babylon has been built by Christians who do not care for God's government but for their own kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In every denomination, including the Roman Catholic Church, there are real, saved Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They are God's people belonging to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the organization of the denominations in which they are is not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The denominational organizations have been utilized by Satan to set up his satanic system to destroy God's economy of the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All real believers, regardless of where they are, in the denominations or even in the Roman Catholic Church, are saved, but the system, the evil organization, is under God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>2 Nimrod Being the First King of Babel</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>and Bringing in Idolatry</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nimrod was the first king of Babel who, according to history, brought in many idolatrous things 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That idolatrous worship invented a most demonic emblem, the Madonna with her child.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the book, The Two Babylons, the Madonna was the mother of Nimrod and also his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This emblem, invented by the Babylonian worship, spread throughout the earth to Egypt, India, Greece, pagan Rome, Tibet, China, and Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It even has pervaded Roman Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Roman Catholic Church sent missionaries to China a few hundred years ago, those missionaries found the same emblem in the Buddhist idol temples and sent a report about this back to the Vatican.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is documented in The Two Babylons.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before I was saved, I went, as a child, to a Catholic cathedral in China and saw this emblem.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the same period of time, I visited a Chinese Buddhist temple and saw the same picture there.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After I was saved, I told people in my preaching that, in some things, Catholicism and Buddhism are of the same source.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The same emblem of a mother embracing her child is found in the Catholic cathedrals and in the Buddhist idol temples.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This exposes the source of some of the things in today's Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As the nations issued in Babel, the denominations eventually will issue in the great Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These are not pleasant words to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But do not be troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the nations became Babel, God intervened to call out Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He did something better than what He had done before.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The history of Abraham is much better than that of Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Who are today's Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In a sense, we are today's Noah; in another sense, we are today's Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Concerning this evil generation, we are today's Noah and concerning denominational Christianity, we are today's Abraham who has been called out of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We shall see more of Abraham's life in the following messages.</S>
