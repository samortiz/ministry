[1]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Seattle, Washington on September 4-7, 1992.
[2]  CHAPTER ONE GOD'S ECONOMY AND MAN'S FAILURE Scripture Reading: 1 John 3:24; 4:13; Gen 1:26-27; 2:7; 1 Thes 5:23; 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15; Gen 13:16; 15:5; Rev 12:5, 11; 14:1-5; Gen 6:3a; 11:4-9; Jer 2:13; 11:10; 2 Cor 13:14; 1 John 3:8; Matt 16:24; 1 John 2:15; Gal 1:4; 6:14; Rev 11:15 OUTLINE God's economy: To be one with man 1 John 3:24; 4:13: Creating man in His image Gen 1:26-27.
[3]  Making man of three parts body, soul, and spirit Gen 2:7; 1 Thes 5:23.
[4]  This book concerning the overcomers is a continuation of our fellowship in the book entitled The Satanic Chaos in the Old Creation and the Divine Economy for the New Creation.
[5]  The burden for the messages in this book can be expressed in the following four sets of statements concerning the overcomers from the book of Revelation:
[6]  To him who overcomes, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God Rev 2:7.
[7]  The Lord will reward the overcomers in this age with what they are in Christ.
[8]  Our God has an eternal economy Eph 1:10; 3:9; 1 Tim 1:4 .
[9]  C. To Have a New Creation out of His Old Creation
[10]  God will take at least seven thousand years to finish His project of gaining the new creation out of the old creation.
[11]  CHAPTER TWO TO OVERCOME THE LEAVING OF THE FIRST LOVE Scripture Reading: Rev 2:1-7; 12:17b; 20:4, 6; 1 John 4:8, 16; John 3:16; 1 John 4:9; Rom 5:5; 2 Cor 13:14; Eph 2:4-5; John 1:12-13; 3:3-6, 29-30; Rev 19:7; 21:2, 7; Eph 5:25; Rev 21:9; Rom 8:35-39; 2 Cor 5:14-15; Rom 14:7-9; Rev 2:10; 12:11; 22:17; Jer 2:2; 31:3 OUTLINE In a church: Being orderly and formal Rev 2:2-3.
[12]  To overcome the leaving of the first love v. 5a: The first love the best love: The love which is God Himself 1 John 4:8, 16: To give His only begotten Son to us as our portion John 3:16.
[13]  God's regenerated children become the members of Christ to constitute the Body of Christ, the bride of Christ, as His increase for Him to love John 3:3-6, 29-30; Rev 19:7; 21:2, 7.
[14]  Christ as the Husband loves the church as His wife with the Father's love as the love of affection Eph 5:25; Rev 21:9; Rom 8:35, 39: Christ's love of affection constrains us to live and to die for Him 2 Cor 5:14-15; Rom 14:7-9.
[15]  In the first chapter we saw God's economy and man's failure.
[16]  In this chapter we want to begin to fellowship concerning all of the things which we need to overcome.
[17]  Then God came in to call another man by the name of Abraham.
[18]  Through Abraham God gained a people whom He brought out of Egypt to Mount Sinai.
[19]  Recent statistics say that the Roman Catholic Church has fifty-five million members in the United States, nearly half of all those in Christianity.
[20]  This shows us that millions have been deceived by Catholicism.
[21]  The Lord charges us to overcome all kinds of religion, and in these seven epistles He also charges us to overcome some other matters.
[22]  The first thing we are charged to overcome is the leaving, the missing, the losing, of the first love Rev 2:4-5a .
[23]  This is why the Lord Jesus in Revelation 2 says that Jezebel calls herself a prophetess and teaches and leads His slaves astray v. 20 . This indicates that the Roman Catholic Church is a self-appointed prophetess, one who presumes to be authorized by God to speak for God.
[24]  TO MAINTAIN THE EATING OF CHRIST AS THE TREE OF LIFE
[25]  In such a good, orderly, and formal church like the church in Ephesus, we need to first overcome the loss of the first love.
[26]  It is in the epistle to the Ephesians that the Lord says, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God" Rev 2:7 .
[27]  The Lord Jesus charged us to overcome the leaving of the first love and to maintain the eating of Christ as the tree of life.
[28]  We need to continue in the enjoyment of the life supply of Christ in the present church life so that we can be rewarded with the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the Paradise of God, the New Jerusalem, in the millennial kingdom.
[29]  CHAPTER THREE TO OVERCOME PERSECUTION, WORLDLINESS, AND SPIRITUAL DEATH Scripture Reading: Rev 2:8-13, 17b; 3:1-5 OUTLINE To overcome persecution, comprising tribulation, poverty, trial, imprisonment, and the slander of the deformed religion of Satan Rev 2:9-10a: By being faithful unto death, not loving the soul-life 2:10b; 12:11b.
[30]  The reward: To receive the crown of life 2:10c.
[31]  In the previous chapter, we saw that we need to be those who overcome the loss of the first love by giving Christ the first place, the preeminence, in everything.
[32]  The loss of the first love is seen with the church in Ephesus.
[33]  There are four main points in the Lord's epistle to the church in Ephesus love, life, light, and the lampstand Rev 2:4-5, 7 .
[34]  I. TO OVERCOME PERSECUTION, COMPRISING TRIBULATION, POVERTY, TRIAL, IMPRISONMENT, AND THE SLANDER OF THE DEFORMED RELIGION OF SATAN
[35]  To overcome such worldliness is to hold fast the name of the Lord and not deny the faith concerning the Lord v. 13 . If we are faithful to overcome, the Lord will give us to eat of the hidden manna Christ for our particular nourishment , and He will give us a white stone for the building in the Body of Christ , upon which a new name is written according to our new experiences of the particular Christ , which no one knows except he who receives it v. 17 . God's work of building the church depends on our transformation, and our transformation issues from the enjoyment of Christ as the hidden manna, our life supply.
[36]  CHAPTER FOUR TO OVERCOME THE THREE DEFORMED RELIGIONS Scripture Reading: Rev 2:9b; Exo 20:8-11; Gen 17:10-14; Lev 11; Luke 24:44; 2 Cor 3:6; Gal 1:6-16; Phil 3:2-3; 2 Tim 1:14; Matt 13:33; Rev 2:20, 24; 17:1, 5-6, 16; 14:8; 2 Tim 4:7c; Rev 2:26, 6, 14-15; Col 1:18; 1 Cor 14:23a, 24, 26, 31, 3-5; Phil 3:10; 1:19b OUTLINE Judaism: A religion set up, though not fully, according to the decree of the law of God, but deformed by man and becoming a satanic religion "a synagogue of Satan" Rev 2:9b: Mis-positioning the law given by God as a side line to Christ as the main line in His economy.
[37]  Thus far, we have seen that we need to overcome the leaving of the first love, to overcome persecution, to overcome worldliness, and to overcome spiritual death.
[38]  In this chapter we want to see that we need to overcome the three deformed religions Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism.
[39]  We Christians have one Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[40]  Mis-positioning the Law Given by God as a Side Line to Christ as the Main Line in His Economy
[41]  B. Disregarding Christ as the Embodiment of the Triune God, Ordained by God to Be the Centrality and Universality of His Economy
[42]  The Jewish religion missed Christ and also disregarded Christ.
[43]  In the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible, there are many prophecies and types concerning Christ.
[44]  The Jews missed all these prophecies and types because they regarded only the law and disregarded Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 .
[45]  Outside of Christ and without Him, we do not have the Triune God.
[46]  The entire Triune God is in Christ, so outside of Christ we cannot find God.
[47]  CATHOLICISM A. A Woman Having Leavened the "Three Measures of Meal" the Entire Teaching concerning the Element of Christ in His Person and in His Work
[48]  In Matthew 13:33 Catholicism is typified by a woman who leavened the "three measures of meal," the entire teaching concerning the element of Christ in His person and in His work.
[49]  The Catholic Church is built up as a religious hierarchy with the pope as the head.
[50]  In today's Protestantism there is also a disregard for Christ's headship in His Body Col 1:18 .
[51]  In today's Protestant churches there is hardly any teaching concerning the Body of Christ and concerning Christ as the Head of the Body.
[52]  In our teachings throughout the years, we have strongly stressed the building up of the Body of Christ and the headship of Christ.
[53]  CHAPTER FIVE TO OVERCOME THE TREND OF NOT KEEPING THE LORD'S WORD, THE TIDE OF DENYING THE LORD'S NAME, AND THE LUKEWARMNESS IN THE LORD'S TESTIMONY Scripture Reading: Rev 3:7, 8b, 10-13, 14-21; 2:20; 3:2; 1 Pet 1:7; Exo 25:11; Rev 1:20; 21:18; 1 John 2:27; 1 Cor 15:45b; Eph 3:8; Rev 20:4, 6 OUTLINE To overcome the trend of not keeping the Lord's word: In Catholicism the Lord's word is put aside and even locked; they keep the word of the prophetess Jezebel's teaching of heresies Rev 2:20.
[54]  To buy at a cost Rev 3:18: Refined gold, signifying the living faith 1 Pet 1:7 for the gaining of the Triune God embodied in Christ as the pure gold Exo 25:11 , that we may be the pure golden lampstand Rev 1:20 for the building of the golden New Jerusalem Rev 21:18 to make us truly rich.
[55]  By reading the Lord's epistles to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3, we can see what we need to overcome.
[56]  The epistle to Ephesus shows us that we need to overcome the leaving of Christ as our first love that we may eat Him as the tree of life to be the lampstand, corporately shining out the divine light 2:4-5, 7 .
[57]  Furthermore, we have to overcome the worldliness of Pergamos so that we can eat the Lord Jesus as the hidden manna for our nourishment, for our supply, and for our support so that we can become a white stone, justified and approved by the Lord for His divine building 2:13, 17b .
[58]  B. In Protestantism the Lord's Word Being Unlocked but Not Being Kept with Absoluteness
[59]  B. The Strong Tide of Denying the Lord's Name in Protestantism
[60]  In Protestantism there is a strong tide of denying the Lord's name by replacing it with many other names, such as Lutheran, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, etc. Many Christians say that they go to the Lutheran church, the Methodist church, or the Presbyterian church.
[61]  D. The Reward for Keeping the Lord's Word and Not Denying the Lord's Name
[62]  Thus, those who overcome the trend of not keeping the Lord's word and the tide of denying His name will be raptured before the great tribulation, will receive the crown, and will be made a pillar for the building of God, having the name of God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and the new name of Christ.
[63]  D. To Open Ourselves to the Lord, Who Is Shut outside the Door of the Church
[64]  Revelation 3:20 reveals that the Lord is outside the door of the church in Laodicea.
[65]  CHAPTER SIX THE FINAL CONSUMMATION OF THE OVERCOMERS Scripture Reading: Rev 6:9-11; 12:1-6; 14:1-5; 15:2-4; 13:7a; 11:3-12; 2 Cor 5:10; Rev 11:18c; 19:7-9; 17:14; 19:14; Joel 3:11; Rev 19:19-21; 11:15; 20:4, 6; Matt 5:20; 19:23-30; 1 Cor 6:9-10; Gal 5:19-21; Eph 5:3-5; 2 Pet 1:11; Matt 19:28; Rev 22:3b; 2:26-27; 12:5; 2:7; Matt 13:43; Dan 12:2-3, 13; Rev 21:1-3, 9-12, 14; 22:17 OUTLINE The composition of the overcomers: The overcomers crying to the Lord for His avenging at the fifth seal, comprising all the martyrs from Abel to those before the fifth seal Rev 6:9-11.
[66]  The man-child born of the universal woman Rev 12:1-5: Comprising the martyrs who cry at the fifth seal and the additional martyrs before the great tribulation.
[67]  To be resurrected and raptured to the throne of God before the three and a half years of the great tribulation vv.
[68]  In this chapter we want to see the final consummation of the overcomers.
[69]  If we read the Bible thoroughly, we can see that the overcomers are the life-line, the pulse, of the entire Bible.
[70]  Starting from Abel the Lord has continued to gain overcomers to ultimately consummate His economy and bring in the kingdom of Christ and of God Rev 11:15 .
[71]  In Genesis 2 the material was just lying there, but at the end of the Bible the gold, pearls, and precious stones are built into a city.
[72]  In the beginning there was a garden created by God, but at the end the garden becomes a city.
[73]  The city is something created by God which has been transformed and built up.
[74]  In His economy God would not accomplish anything merely by Himself.
[75]  In His economy He has determined to do everything in and with humanity.
[76]  God's old creation was carried out in six days, but to accomplish His economy to gain the New Jerusalem takes God at least seven thousand years.
[77]  The composition of the overcomers is the categories, the different kinds, of overcomers.
[78]  E. The Two Witnesses Martyred, Resurrected, and Raptured to the Heavens in the Cloud at the Close of the Great Tribulation
[79]  B. To Be Rewarded at the Judgment Seat of Christ
[80]  Christ will judge His believers not concerning their eternal salvation but concerning their dispensational reward 1 Cor 4:4-5; 3:13-15 .
[81]  H. To Consummate and Complete the New Jerusalem in Full, as the Tabernacle of God and the Wife of Christ in the New Heaven and New Earth for Eternity
[82]  In the universal scene, there are mainly two persons God and man.
[83]  God loves beauty because He is a God of beauty.
