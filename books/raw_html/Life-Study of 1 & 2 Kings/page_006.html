<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. THE CENTRAL THOUGHT</H2><P>The central thought of the books of Kings is God's governmental dealing, in God's economy, with the devastation and ruin of the divine kingship on the earth by the kings and the tragic issue of the just dealing of God, that is, the loss of the holy land, which was the base of God's kingdom on the earth, and the capture of the holy people who maintained the lineage of Christ's genealogy.</P><P>God desired to have a people for the bringing of Christ into humanity, and God needed a land for Christ to set up God's kingdom. Satan instigated the king of Babylon to conquer Israel to devastate the land and to carry away the people. It seemed that these two lines had ended, but in the genealogy in Matthew 1 we see that these two lines were continued even through the captivity. Eventually, Christ came into humanity through this lineage.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI. THE SECTIONS</H2><P>There are only two sections to the books of Kings: the old age and decease of David (1 Kings 1:1&#151;2:11) and the reign of the kings (1 Kings 2:12&#151;2 Kings 25:30).</P>
