<h2 class="head1">RECKONING OURSELVES DEAD IN CHRIST</h2><p>Since this is the case, what should our attitude be today? Romans 6:11 provides the best answer. This verse says that we should reckon ourselves dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus. If the words "in Christ Jesus" were taken away from this verse, there would not be any Christian faith. Many people believe that being a Christian is a matter of "counting everything from yesterday as being dead and everything from today as being alive." But the death and life we talk about are in Christ. I have read Romans 6:11 many times and have spoken on it many times, but often I forget the words "in Christ." If we are not in Christ, we can never reckon ourselves dead, and we cannot die. We die in Christ, not in ourselves.</p><p>We should say to the Lord, "In myself I am still not dead; I am still alive to sin. Today I still want to sin. But thank You because You have said that I am dead in Christ. I do not believe in myself; I believe that I am dead in Christ. I believe that I am dead in Christ already!" This is faith. Death comes by faith, not by works. We should not seek to die or try to die when temptations come. No! We are dead when we are in Christ. We have died in Christ, and God has crucified us in Christ. When we are in ourselves, we are alive, but when we are in Christ, we are dead. Our death in Christ is not something that will happen tomorrow or something that is happening today. Our death in Christ is an accomplished fact. We died in Christ long ago. This is an accomplished fact.</p><h2 class="head1">RECKONING OURSELVES LIVING<br />TO GOD IN CHRIST JESUS</h2><p>On the one hand, Romans 6:11 says that we should reckon ourselves dead to sin. This is the negative side of our being in Christ. On the other hand, it says that we should reckon ourselves living to God in Christ Jesus. This is the positive side of our being in Christ. First we die in Christ, then we are made alive in Christ. When we are made alive, we bear the fruit of the Spirit, which are the various virtues. Yet we cannot live out these virtues by ourselves; we can only live them out as we live by the life of God. If we live by the life of God, we will spontaneously overcome sin and bear the fruit of the Spirit. There is no need to pray much. It is better to praise instead. When temptations come and Satan tells us that we are still living in ourselves and that we have not died, we should say to him that we are no longer in ourselves, that we are in Christ, and that we are alive unto God in Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">VICTORY BEING IN CHRIST</h2><p>A victorious life does not depend on the so-called reckoning. We overcome when we are in Christ. We may do a wonderful job of reckoning when we are in the meetings. But when we go home, it would not work to try to continue to reckon in ourselves. Victory can only be found in Christ. Let me illustrate this by the example of the lamp. A lamp shines when it comes in contact with electricity. The source of the lamp is the electrical power plant. A lamp shines as long as it is in touch with electricity. The lamp cannot shine in itself; it shines because it is connected to the electrical power plant. Furthermore, consider the difference between the Shanghai electric street trolley and the automobile. Neither the trolley nor the automobile can move by themselves. A trolley moves when it is in contact with electricity, whereas a car moves by the power of combustion. It is possible for the power of a car to run out. When the fuel runs out, the car will not run. However, our life is not like an automobile with a limited supply of fuel. Our life works in the principle of the trolley. As long as we are connected to Christ, all the riches of Christ will be transmitted to us continuously. There is no need to worry if the supply will run out.</p><p>The whole matter today is whether or not we are willing to be in Christ. If there are unsaved friends in the audience here, you only need to enter into Christ and to be joined to Him. All of His riches will flow into you. This is God's grace; you do not have to do anything, yet you can receive everything.</p><p>Death is a termination; it is negative. It terminates our life in Adam and buries everything that is old. Resurrection is the beginning of the new life; it is positive and initiates our new life in Christ. In Christ's resurrection, we receive His life. Hence, we die in Christ and also resurrect in Christ. Both death and resurrection are in Christ. Everything is in Christ.</p>
