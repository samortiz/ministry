<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee at a conference in Whittier, California, on January 2-8, 1963. These messages have not been reviewed by the speaker.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">A PICTURE OF THE ENTIRE SCRIPTURES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:7-12, 16-17, 21-24; John 1:4; 4:10, 13-14; 7:38-39; Exo. 28:9-11, 17-20; 26:29; 1 Cor. 3:9, 12; 2 Cor. 4:7; Eph. 5:31-32; Rev. 21:2-3, 9-12, 14, 21-23; 22:1-2</h1>
<p>In this introductory chapter, with the help of the Lord&rsquo;s grace, I wish to point out a wonderful picture that is in the entire Scriptures. To do this, we will consider all the Scriptures from the very beginning to the very end. This picture, which has been drawn by God Himself in His Word, reveals to us what is in His mind and what He is seeking. It is our aim in this message to see this picture. In order to see this picture, we must pay attention to the principles, that is, the main items in this picture. We must see the principles in this clear picture if we are to be able to understand what is in the Lord&rsquo;s mind and what He is seeking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEVEN FIGURES IN GENESIS TWO</h2>
<p>First, we must realize that the Bible, from the beginning to the end, is the complete revelation of God. God is wise, and in order to show us the picture, He in His wisdom gave us such a revelation. In the Bible we have the start, the continuation, and the completion of this revelation.</p>
<p>At the very beginning of this revelation in Genesis 2, there is a picture. When I was young, I wondered about the second chapter of Genesis for two reasons. First, it seemed that Genesis 1 contains a full record of the creation and recovery of the earth, from the first day to the seventh. I asked myself why, after this account, there was yet another record of creation. I could not understand this. Some said that Genesis 2 is simply a more detailed account of man&rsquo;s creation. Although this is true, we now know that the second chapter of Genesis is something much more than mere details. The second reason I wondered about Genesis 2 was that I thought that all of God&rsquo;s work was important and economical. Yet to me, this chapter did not seem very important. I was unable to understand this chapter. Eventually, the vision of the picture in Genesis 2 became clear and complete to me.</p>
<p>This picture is very simple. If we can see the seven major figures that are contained within this picture, it will become clear and complete to us. The first figure in this picture is a man whom God made of clay&mdash;an earthen man (v. 7). The second figure is a tree that has a wonderful name&mdash;the tree of life (v. 9). There is then the tree of knowledge (v. 9), a figure which we will not count among the seven figures and which we will not consider until the end of the message. The third figure is a flowing river (v. 10). From that river three items come forth: gold, bdellium, and onyx stone (vv. 11-12). These three precious and costly items are the fourth, fifth, and sixth figures respectively. The seventh and final figure in this picture is a woman. This woman, a bride, came into being to be married to the man and to become one flesh with him (vv. 21-24). I would ask you to remember these seven figures: the man of clay, the tree of life, the river of water, gold, bdellium, onyx stone, and the bride.</p>
<p>We must see the picture that the Bible shows us with these figures. God created the earth as the center of the universe. On this earth God created a man of clay. After creating him, God put this man into the garden of Eden, most likely in front of the tree of life. This garden in which man stood was the center of the universe. Before him was the tree of life and the river of living water flowing near the tree. Out of that flow came forth pure gold, bdellium, and onyx stone. Finally, there was the bride who came into being to be married to the man.</p>
<p>Certainly, all the figures presented in this chapter must possess some figurative meaning. As figures, they must signify something. In order to understand these figures and the meaning of the picture in which they appear, we have to study the remainder of the Holy Scriptures. All the books of the Old Testament and the New Testament reveal the correct meaning of each of these figures, item by item.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Man of Clay</h2>
<p>The first figure is a man of clay. According to the Scriptures, the man of clay is a vessel to God. The earthen man is an earthen vessel, as indicated in 2 Corinthians 4:7: &ldquo;But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.&rdquo; Romans 9:21 tells us that every chosen person is an earthen vessel for God&mdash;a &ldquo;vessel unto honor.&rdquo; A vessel is simply an object into which we can put something. For example, cups and bottles are both vessels. Since we are earthen vessels to God, we are meant to contain something. What are we to contain? We will return to answer this question later.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Tree of Life</h2>
<p>The next figure we find is the tree of life. The tree of life is a symbol of our Lord Jesus Christ. Christ is the tree of life. John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life.&rdquo; Life is in Christ, and Christ is the source of life. Hence, He is the tree of life. The tree of life signifies Christ as life to us (10:10b; 14:6a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The River of Water</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus tells us in John 7:38-39 that if any man believes into Christ, out of his innermost being will flow rivers of living water. This living water will spring up within us and will flow out of us. In light of these verses, we can see clearly that the flowing river in Genesis 2 is a figure of Christ as the life-giving Spirit gushing up within us as a fountain and flowing out of us as a stream (John 4:14b).</p><h2 class="head2">Gold, Bdellium, and Onyx Stone</h2>
<p>The Scriptures also show us the significance of gold, bdellium, and onyx stone. At a certain time, the Lord asked His people to build a dwelling place for Him and for His service. This dwelling place was the tabernacle, which was made of wood overlaid with gold (Exo. 26:29). If we were to enter the tabernacle and look around, we would see gold all around us. The tabernacle was full of gold. This shows that in principle, gold is the material for the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place among His people, His children.</p>
<p>With the tabernacle there is the high priest, who serves the Lord. This high priest had a certain kind of clothing called an ephod (28:6-8). On the shoulder pieces of this ephod were two onyx stones on which were engraved the names of the twelve tribes of Israel (28:9-11). Moreover, there were twelve more precious stones on the high priest&rsquo;s breastplate (vv. 17-20). If we were to enter into the tabernacle at the time when the high priest was serving the Lord, we would see gold, onyx stone, and precious stones. This shows us that these precious items were not only for the building of the Lord&rsquo;s dwelling place among His children; they were also for the priestly service. The New Testament causes us to realize that the Lord&rsquo;s building and the Lord&rsquo;s priests are the same. First Peter 2:5 says that we are both a holy priesthood (hence, the priests) and the living stones which are being built up as a spiritual house to the Lord. We are both the priests and the stones. Thus, the gold and the precious stones are the materials for the Lord&rsquo;s building and service among His children.</p>
<p>Next, we need to see the significance of bdellium. Bdellium is a difficult word, for in the entire Scriptures, it is used only twice: in Genesis 2:12 and in Numbers 11:7, where it is used to describe the manna. Some Hebrew scholars translate this word as &ldquo;pearl.&rdquo; Other Hebrew scholars translate this word as &ldquo;resin&rdquo;&mdash;a substance produced by a certain kind of tree. Some kinds of resin are in the form of a pearl. Thus, bdellium is a pearl-like substance.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 3, the apostle Paul tells us how to build the church and with what material we should build it. Writing that the foundation of the church is Christ Himself (v. 11), Paul tells us that we, being the co-workers of God, are now working on the building of God (v. 9). The church, composed of the Lord&rsquo;s people, is the dwelling of God. Paul says that we must be very careful as to whether we build with gold, silver, and precious stones or with wood, grass, and stubble (vv. 10, 12). Rather than building the church, the building of God, with the negative things, we must build with gold, silver, and precious stones. Although here Paul mentions silver in place of pearl, silver and pearl both signify the Lord&rsquo;s redemption. Gold, pearl (or silver), and precious stones are the materials for the Lord&rsquo;s building with the Lord&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>At the end of the Scriptures, a city comes into being. This holy city is built with gold, pearls, and precious stones. The city proper is of gold, the wall of the city and its foundations are of precious stones, and the twelve gates are twelve pearls (Rev. 21:18-21). Based upon this knowledge and according to the principle set forth in the Scriptures, we may conclude that these precious materials are for the Lord&rsquo;s building with the Lord&rsquo;s service.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Bride</h2>
<p>The final figure in Genesis 2 is a bride. The holy city, New Jerusalem, built of the three kinds of costly materials, is actually the bride, the wife of the Lamb (Rev. 21:2, 9). The bride in Genesis 2, who signifies the church, was to be married to Adam, who typifies Christ (Rom. 5:14). This is stated clearly in Ephesians 5, which reveals that Adam and Eve are types of Christ and the church (vv. 31-32; Gen. 2:24).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THESE SEVEN ITEMS IN OUR EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>We can now see a very simple picture of the entire Scriptures. In His creation, God created a man of clay according to His image (Gen. 1:26). Because this man was made of clay, however, his nature was not precious. Although the image he bore was wonderful, his nature was worthless. Such is man&rsquo;s condition at the beginning of the Scriptures. But at the end of the Scriptures, God has gained a group of people who are pure gold, precious stones, and costly pearls in His sight.</p>
<p>Today, are we men of clay or are we precious stones? On the day that Peter received the revelation that Christ was the Son of the living God, the Lord changed his name, saying to him, &ldquo;You are Peter&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). In Greek the name <em>Peter</em> means &ldquo;stone.&rdquo; Having received such a speaking from the Lord, Peter told us that we, having been saved, are living stones (1 Pet. 2:5). We should not hesitate to say that we are no longer clay but living stones. If you ask me whether I am a piece of clay or a living stone, I will happily reply to you, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! Formerly I was a piece of clay; now I am a living stone. Something happened to me. I was regenerated. There has been a transformation of my nature from clay to living stone. Now I am a living stone!&rdquo; Everyone who has been saved by the Lord is a stone. According to God&rsquo;s creation, we were men of clay. According to God&rsquo;s new creation through regeneration, we have become living stones.</p>
<p>How can a man of clay change in nature to become a living stone? To answer this question, we must consider the picture shown to us in the second chapter of Genesis. I would illustrate this in the following way. Suppose I were Adam, a man of clay. As a man, I would see all these figures around me. I would no doubt appreciate the gold, the bdellium, and the precious onyx stone. Realizing how wonderful these items are, I would, as a man of clay, desire to become as precious as they are. I believe that God would tell me, &ldquo;Adam, if you want to be as precious as those items are, you have to be transformed.&rdquo; Then I would perhaps ask the Lord, &ldquo;How can I be transformed?&rdquo; I believe that in answer to such a question, the Lord would tell me, &ldquo;If you are going to be transformed from a man of clay into those precious items, you have to eat the tree of life and drink the living water. If you eat this tree and drink this water, you will receive into yourself a life that you do not yet have. Once you receive this life, it will work within you and transform you from a man of clay into something precious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the very same concept that we encounter later in the Scriptures. The Lord is the tree of life who came to offer Himself to men of clay. He said to them, &ldquo;I am...the life&rdquo; (John 11:25) and told them to come to Him, eat Him, and receive Him as life to be regenerated (6:47-48, 57; 1:12-13). To be regenerated means to be transformed with the life of Christ from a man of clay to a man of stone. The more we eat and drink Christ, the more we will be transformed. This process of transformation spreads from our spirit into the parts of our soul and eventually, when He returns, into our body (2 Cor. 3:18; Phil. 3:21). At that time we will be fully transformed into the image of the Lord from the center to the circumference of our being. No longer will we be people of clay. We will be the precious treasure of God.</p>
<p>We are transformed by experiencing and enjoying Christ as life. We enjoy and experience Him by eating Him as the tree of life and drinking Him as the river of water of life. The more we enjoy Him, the more we will experience Him and the more we will be transformed. Furthermore, the more we are transformed, the more we will be built up together. If we remain in our old life, old man, and old nature, the genuine church will never be built up. If we are going to be built up as the church, as the Body of Christ in reality as a real expression of Christ, we must be transformed in our mind, in our emotion, and in our will. The more we are transformed, the more we will be built up together. At the conclusion of this building work, we will be the bride of Christ. This bride is the dwelling place of God, the real tabernacle of God among His people (Rev. 21:2-3).</p>
<p>I believe that this is a very clear picture that shows us what is in the Lord&rsquo;s mind and what He is seeking. God is seeking a group of people who, having originally been made of clay, will receive Him as life by eating and drinking Him so that they will be transformed in their nature from men of clay into precious stones. Then by being transformed, they will eventually be built up together to be the Body of Christ, the tabernacle of God, the bride of Christ, built with gold, pearls, and precious stones. This is the picture of the entire Scriptures, and this is the eternal purpose of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE&mdash;<br />
THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF<br />
THE PICTURE OF THE SCRIPTURES</h2>
<p>On the positive side, all the Scriptures show us how we as people made of clay accept the Lord as our life, feed on Him, and drink of Him, and by so doing are gradually transformed into His image and built up together as an organism to be His Body for His expression and His bride for His satisfaction. There is, however, a negative side, signified by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 2:9). The tree of the knowledge of good and evil brings in death. This tree is the tree of knowledge, good, evil, and death. The Scriptures tell us that this tree signifies the one who is the source of death, the devil, Satan. Instead of receiving the Lord as his life in the garden of Eden, man received the tree of knowledge. Through this, sin entered into man. As a result, death came in (Rom. 5:12), followed by judgment and eternal perdition (Heb. 9:27; cf. John 3:16). All these negative matters sprang from this one source, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Together, these positive and negative matters present a full picture of the entire Scriptures. Although this picture is very basic and simple, it includes all the major things recorded in the Scriptures.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE&mdash;A BOOK OF GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<p>By seeing this picture, we see how both ends of the Scriptures reflect each other. In a certain respect, the Bible is like a book of architecture. At the beginning we have a &ldquo;blueprint,&rdquo; and at the end we have a picture of the entire building. Between these two ends, between the blueprint and the picture of the building, there are many specifications giving the details of how the building work is to be accomplished. This is the Bible. If we are clear about this picture, it will be easy to know the Lord&rsquo;s mind and eternal plan. Moreover, by seeing this picture, we will be able to realize what we are, where we are, what we will be, where we should go, and what our responsibility is today&mdash;matters that we will cover in the ensuing chapters. May the Lord open our eyes and be merciful to us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">TRANSFORMATION AND<br />
THE THREE PARTS OF MAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:6; 4:24; 6:63; Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Cor. 3:17-18; 1 Thes. 5:23; Heb. 4:12</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw the picture that God has presented to us throughout the Scriptures. After creating the heavens and the earth, God made a man from the dust of the earth&mdash;a man of clay (Gen. 2:7). God&rsquo;s intention in making this man of clay was to transform him into something very precious, as implied by the figures of gold, bdellium (pearls), and precious stones (2 Cor. 3:17-18; Gen. 2:11-12). According to the picture in the Scriptures, God is seeking for a group of men of clay to be transformed into His image, that is, transformed into something precious to Him, and to be built together as a living organism to be the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 3:9, 12; 1 Pet. 2:5; Eph. 4:16).</p>
<p>Now we must go on to see how this man of clay can be transformed, figuratively speaking, into gold, pearls, and precious stones. Second Corinthians 3:18 says, &ldquo;But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; Those who know something about chemistry are familiar with how transformation takes place. For instance, let us say we have a cup containing chemical matter. If we want to cause this chemical matter to be transformed into something else, we must add something to it. Only when some other matter is put into the cup does the original chemical matter begin to be transformed. As men of clay, we all bear the name Adam. Since we are all Adam&mdash;men of clay&mdash;we need to be transformed by having another element&mdash;Christ&mdash;added into our being.</p>
<p>We who have been saved by the Lord cannot deny that we have already been transformed to at least some degree. This means that our name is no longer Adam but Christ. Perhaps you may hesitate to say this. Let us therefore turn to another illustration&mdash;a cup of tea. Although we call tea simply &ldquo;tea,&rdquo; what we call tea is actually tea put into, mingled, and blended with water. In the same way that we do not hesitate to say that this is tea, we who have Christ in us and Christ mingled with us should not hesitate to say that we are Christ (cf. Phil. 1:21; 1 Cor. 12:12). Perhaps the reason you still hesitate to call yourself Christ is that, since you have only recently believed, there is not much Christ in you. According to the tea example, whether it is strong or weak, it is still called tea. Even though it is tea-water, we still call it tea. We are men made of clay. Yet the moment we believed in the Lord Jesus and accepted Him as our Savior, the Lord Jesus came into us as the Spirit. Now Christ is in us (Col. 1:27; Gal. 2:20), and we are Christ. Therefore, to a certain extent, we men of clay are now pieces of transformed stone. Although formerly we were only men of clay, Christ has been put into us and become mingled and blended with us. Just as tea is no longer just water but tea-water, since we have received Christ into us, we are no longer just men&mdash;we are Christ-men.</p>
<p>Since Christ has been added into us, a spiritual reaction has taken place within us in the same way that a chemical reaction takes place. Something divine, heavenly, and spiritual was added into us. By being mingled and blended with Christ in regeneration, we were transformed from men of clay into men of gold, pearl, and precious stones. This is a wonderful, divine, and glorious fact.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRIT, SOUL, AND BODY</h2>
<p>At the time of our salvation, Christ was added into us. But we must go on to see to which part of us He was added. As human beings, we have three parts: a spirit, a soul, and a body (1 Thes. 5:23). Our body is our physical organ and is the most outward part of our being. Our soul is more inward and is composed of the mind, emotion, and will (cf. Psa. 139:14; Prov. 2:10; Job 7:15; 1 Sam. 18:1; S. S. 1:7). Our mind is for thinking, our emotion is for feeling, and our will is for choosing and deciding. Our innermost part is the spirit.</p>
<p>Hebrews 4:12 says, &ldquo;For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&rdquo; According to this verse, the soul and the spirit are two separate parts of our being, since they can be divided. An illustration may help us know how we can actually discern the difference between the spirit and the soul. Once, a brother I knew lost his son. The day that his son died was exceedingly sad for him. Because I wanted to do something to comfort and help him, I went to his home. When I arrived, even before I said anything, the brother said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, praise the Lord! On the one hand, I am deeply sorrowful. On the other hand, in my inmost part, I am so happy.&rdquo; This brother was sad in his soul. At the same time, he was happy in the spirit. Because he had such a close, intimate relationship with his son, his emotions, a part of his soul, were very much involved with him. Thus, when his son died, he became very sad in his emotions. Yet this brother also had another part, the deepest part of his being, his spirit. In that part he was happy. Miss M. E. Barber once wrote a hymn in which she expresses a similar thought: &ldquo;Let the spirit praise Thee, / Though the heart be riv&rsquo;n&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #377). The heart is composed of all the parts of the soul (mind, emotion, and will) plus the conscience (Matt. 9:4; Heb. 4:12; Acts 11:23; John 16:22; Heb. 10:22; 1 John 3:20). Because the spirit and the soul are distinct, although our soul may be in one condition, our spirit can be in a very different condition. This shows us how the spirit is distinct from the soul.</p>
<p>With the three parts of our being&mdash;body, soul, and spirit&mdash;we contact three worlds. With our body we contact the physical world. With our soul we contact the psychological world, in which we appreciate such things as music and art and feel emotions such as sorrow or happiness. With our spirit we contact the spiritual world, where God, who is Spirit, is (John 4:24). If we want to contact the physical world, we must use our body. If we want to contact the psychological world, we must use our soul. If we want to contact God as the Spirit, we must use our spirit. Here we see a principle: In order to contact something in any of these three worlds, we must use the corresponding part, or organ, of our being. Only the corresponding organ is the correct organ for touching those things. If we close our eyes and attempt to appreciate colors with our ears, the colors seem to disappear. Although the colors still exist, we cannot substantiate them because we are not using the right organ. Similarly, we cannot substantiate music if we do not use our ears. Also, our nose functions to smell things. Yet when we have a cold, our nose&rsquo;s function is hindered, and we cannot smell, even though odors are still present. Thus, in order to substantiate any particular substance, we must exercise the proper organ.</p>
<p>There is a God, and this God is Spirit, but because human beings in general do not know how to exercise their spirit, they ask, &ldquo;Who is God?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Where is God?&rdquo; These questions are as foolish as those of a man who, having closed his eyes, questions the existence of color. Regardless of how strongly the man believes and feels that there is no color, color continues to exist. God is here, but we cannot use our eyes to see Him, our ears to hear Him, or our nose to smell Him, because they are the wrong organs. The only organ by which we can substantiate God is our spirit. John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&rdquo; Since God is Spirit, if we want to worship Him, we must do so with our spirit.</p>
<p>One day when one of my daughters was very young, I gave her something sweet to drink. When she attempted to drink it, however, some of it got in her nose. Consequently, instead of enjoying the drink, she suffered. Her suffering was not caused by the drink itself; she suffered because the wrong organ was used in her attempt to drink it. Similarly, our soul, specifically our mentality, is the wrong organ to use if we wish to sense God directly. Despite this fact, many people use only their soul when considering God. Some who study science say that they cannot find or contact God. Eventually, they may say that there is no God at all. Because they use the wrong organ&mdash;their soul&mdash;they cannot find God, for God is not in the psychological realm and therefore cannot be found there. If these same scientists were to use their spirit to contact God, who is Spirit, they would sense Him. In order to sense the presence of God, we must use the right organ; we must use our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Having a clearer understanding of the three parts of man, we can now consider into which of these three parts the Lord Jesus has come. When the Lord Jesus entered into us at the time of our regeneration, He came into our spirit. The Scriptures are very clear on this point. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Since we have been joined to the Lord, He and we are one spirit. This shows us that when the Lord came into us, He came into our spirit. Also, Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&rdquo; In this verse we see that the two spirits&mdash;the divine Spirit and the human spirit&mdash;work together and that the Spirit of God works in our spirit. As these two spirits work together, they are mingled together as one spirit. They are mingled to the point that it is difficult to discern which spirit is which. These two verses show us that the divine Spirit has come into our human spirit, and these two spirits have been mingled together to become one spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SOUL</h2>
<p>Now that Christ is in our spirit, we must consider what is taking place in our soul, that is, in our mind, emotion, and will. This is a matter of critical importance. Once Christ our Savior came into our spirit, our spirit was transformed. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that our mind, emotion, and will have not been transformed. Christ is in our spirit, but He may not be in our soul. We all need to be transformed in our soul (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2).</p>
<p>Sometimes we may enjoy praying to the Lord and exercising our spirit. Then after praying, we feel that we can love all the saints. But before long it becomes clear that we are not actually able to love all the saints. Such an experience may be confusing to us. After all, when we were praying, did we not sense Christ and experience Him? When we prayed, we exercised our spirit to contact Him as the Spirit, and this resulted in our touching our spirit and experiencing, enjoying, and sensing Him. Nevertheless, even after we pray, it is still possible for us to use our natural man&mdash;our natural thought, natural emotion, and natural will&mdash;to make decisions without Christ. This is possible because although we have Christ indwelling our spirit, we do not have Christ in the organ of our soul, and the functions of our soul have not yet been transformed. This kind of experience is very typical in the Christian life.</p>
<p>For the sake of illustration, let us suppose that I am a single brother who lives with another young brother. It is a fact that in my innermost being I love this brother and that the more I pray and contact Christ in my spirit, the more I love him. Nevertheless, I have peculiar thoughts, and the brother with whom I live has peculiar habits. My peculiar thoughts are incompatible with his peculiar habits. As a result of our conflicting peculiarities, I may become disgusted with this brother. Not only so, his peculiarities may cause me to become angry. Even though I genuinely love this brother and wish that there were no difficulties between us, it is difficult for me to bear him, and I feel that I cannot go on living with him. My struggle is an indication that although I have been regenerated in my spirit, I am not yet transformed in my mind, emotion, and will. Although I have Christ in my spirit, I do not have Him in my soul. In my spirit I am completely transformed into the image and likeness of Christ, but in my mind, emotion, and will, I am still like the people in the world. Figuratively speaking, although in my spirit I am gold, in my mind, emotion, and will I am full of dust and clay.</p>
<p>Were it not for the Lord&rsquo;s giving us such tests, we might think that our condition is proper and might not realize that we remain untransformed. For instance, perhaps I love the brother with whom I live and we get along very well together. Even if I feel that I love that brother so much and there are no problems between us, I still have the old man, the natural man, the man of clay. It is only when tests come that we realize the true nature of our &ldquo;clay&rdquo; condition. When the Lord sends peculiar brothers to us, it is as if He were causing water to be poured on a lump of clay. In the same way that the lump of clay cannot bear the water and becomes mud, we cannot tolerate certain ones. When we are tested, we realize that we are still the old man and have the old mind, old emotion, and old will.</p>
<p>We are natural men, men of clay, until, by the grace of God, the Christ who is in our spirit increases and expands within our being to spread outward from our spirit and saturate our soul with all of its parts. After Christ spreads within us and saturates the parts of our soul, we will love the brothers without effort. At that point, it simply will not matter how peculiar a brother is. We will even tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I praise You. This dear brother is very precious to me.&rdquo; We must be full of faith in this matter.</p>
<p>When I was young, soon after I was called by the Lord, I went to Shanghai and stayed there with some young brothers. What I experienced there was very similar to what I have described above. Before I went to Shanghai, I had prayed, &ldquo;Lord, I am aware that when I arrive in Shanghai, several other brothers will stay with me. Lord, help me love them. Regardless of who they are or how they behave, enable me to love them.&rdquo; After I arrived, I asked the Lord every morning to help me love the brothers. Before long, it seemed that all the brothers who were staying with me were peculiar. There was nowhere I could go to escape them. After one incident in which I became upset at a brother, I went to my lodging, knelt on the floor, and prayed, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. I really cannot love these brothers.&rdquo; I was an example of a man who was regenerated in his spirit but not transformed in his soul. Even though my spirit loved the brothers, my soul remained old and natural.</p>
<p>When we contact other Christians, we may have the feeling that they are all peculiar. Generally, we feel that while everyone else is peculiar, we ourselves are quite normal. Based upon this, we may feel that we cannot love them. Their odd habits or character flaws often give rise to our becoming disgusted with them. Eventually, we may dislike and even despise them. If this problem is left unchecked, it may even cause us to become very unhappy in the church life.</p>
<p>After being in Shanghai for about two and a half years, the Lord increased and spread within me. When I had another opportunity to stay with some brothers and a situation arose that would have previously caused me to become angry, I was not moved. I was able to love them not only in my spirit but even in my mind, emotion, and will. I genuinely loved them. One week after I had been dealt with, the brother whose peculiarity had been so bothersome to me was delivered from his peculiarity as well.</p>
<p>Even though we have the image of God, in our natural state we have nothing precious within us; we are only men of clay. God&rsquo;s intention is to transform us men of clay into His image in a full way so that we will be as precious as gold, pearls, and precious stones. The way this happens is very simple. First, the Lord Jesus comes into our spirit to be the inward element, thereby transforming our spirit. From that time onward, as long as we cooperate with Him, He will increase within us and spread from our spirit into our soul. On the day He returns, even our physical body, the very outer part of our being, will be saturated with His element (Phil. 3:21). At that time our very body will be saturated with the Spirit. When He returns, He will be glorified in us, we will be manifested with Him in glory, and we will be like Him (Col. 3:4; 2 Thes. 1:10; 1 John 3:2). This is the intention that God has planned to fulfill with us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SOUL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:17-18; Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23; Rom. 8:6; 1 Cor. 2:14-16; 2 Cor. 4:16</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we want to continue our fellowship concerning the Lord&rsquo;s transformation work within us. Let us read several verses that speak of the transformation of the soul.</p>
<p>And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit. (2 Cor. 3:17-18)</p>
<p>And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect. (Rom. 12:2)</p>
<p>And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind. (Eph. 4:23)</p>
<p>For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace. (Rom. 8:6)</p>
<p>But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually. But the spiritual man discerns all things, but he himself is discerned by no one. For who has known the mind of the Lord and will instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ. (1 Cor. 2:14-16)</p>
<p>In these verses we should take notice of three terms. The first term is <em>a soulish man.</em> A soulish man is a man of the soul. Such a man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God. The second term is <em>the spiritual man.</em> Hence, there are two kinds of men: the soulish and the spiritual. The third term is <em>the mind of Christ.</em></p>
<p>Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day. (2 Cor. 4:16)</p>
<p>In this verse, the word rendered &ldquo;decaying&rdquo; can be translated also as &ldquo;being consumed.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">REGENERATION AND TRANSFORMATION</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter, we saw that as God-created human beings we have three parts: a physical body, a soul, and a spirit (1 Thes. 5:23). The spirit is the innermost part of our entire created being, and the body is the outermost part. Between the spirit and the body is the soul, which consists of the mind, the emotion, and the will. With the mind we think, with the emotions we sense joy and sorrow as well as other feelings, and with the will we make decisions. Moreover, we also saw the function of each of the parts of our being&mdash;with the physical body we contact the physical world, with the soul we contact the psychological world, and with the spirit we contact the spiritual world. In order to touch any of these three worlds, we must use the corresponding organ. Because God is Spirit, if we want to worship God, we must worship Him with, in, and by our human spirit (John 4:24).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus came into us, He came into our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). The Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), and as the Spirit He came into our human spirit. Now we are joined to the Lord and have become one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). The divine Spirit and the human spirit are mingled and blended together to form one spirit. We are one with the Lord not in the body or in the mind; we are one with the Lord in our spirit. When the Lord came into our spirit, a reaction took place in our being. That reaction was our regeneration. Regeneration is the transformation of the spirit. At the moment we believed, our spirit was transformed by Christ as the divine life.</p>
<p>Because we have been regenerated, our spirit is fully transformed. Now we must undergo the continual transformation of the rest of our being, particularly of our soul (2 Cor. 3:17-18; Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23). The soul is a very important part of our being. For our soul to be transformed means that our mind, emotion, and will are transformed. If we are transformed in our spirit but not in our soul, that means that although we have Christ as life in our spirit, we do not have much of Christ in our soul. Our need is for Christ to increase within us all the time, that is, to spread from our spirit into the three parts of our soul. When the Lord spreads fully into our mind, emotion, and will, we will be transformed into His image. When we are transformed into His image, we will think, feel, and decide just as Christ thinks, feels, and decides. When we consider matters, we will consider them as the Lord does; when we love or hate, we will love or hate as Christ does; and when we choose, we will choose as the Lord does and give up and reject what the Lord gives up and rejects. When our entire soul has been transformed into the image of Christ, we human beings will have the image of Christ in our daily life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SOUL</h2>
<p>Regrettably, the typical Christian is transformed in his spirit but remains untransformed in his soul. In a great many believers, there are scarcely any signs that Christ has entered into their mind, emotion, and will. For example, there may be a brother who, having been saved by the Lord, is regenerated. This means that his spirit is transformed. But this brother may have a soul that is very slow in everything. Even though the Lord may want to do something quickly, that brother can only do things slowly. Although the Lord is in this brother&rsquo;s spirit, he remains slow because the Lord has not yet spread into his soul. It may be that even when the Lord inspires him in his spirit, he remains very slow in his soul and does not respond to the Lord&rsquo;s inward inspiration. While some persons are very slow, others are very quick in everything they do. They are fast in their thinking, feeling, and action. They suffer the same problem as the slow brother but in reverse. The situation of such persons indicates that although they may be transformed in their spirit, in their soul they remain quite natural.</p>
<p>When I was young, I frequently went to listen to an elderly preacher who was very slow in his soul. In one message he said, &ldquo;Brothers, look at the Scriptures. There is not one instance of God ever doing something quickly. The Lord is always slow.&rdquo; This brother thought that because he was slow, God also was slow. Not long after hearing this brother speak, I met a young minister who was very quick. He told me, &ldquo;There is at least one time that the Lord acted so quickly that He had to run to do it.&rdquo; He then referred to Luke 15:20, where the father ran to meet the prodigal son. This young preacher used this verse to prove that the Lord is quick. These two preachers were two different kinds of persons; one was slow in nature, and the other was fast in nature. The preacher who was slow in nature insisted that the Lord was slow, and the one who was fast in nature insisted that the Lord was fast. By this we can see that regardless of our individual characteristics, our soul is natural and must be transformed. We should never remain in our natural thought. Our natural mind, emotion, and will must be transformed so that we will be able to have the image of Christ.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:26 tells us that God created man in His own image and according to His own likeness. An illustration of this is a glove made in the image of a hand. A glove is made in the image of a hand for the purpose of containing a hand. In like manner, man was made in the image of God for the purpose of containing God. Just as a hand fits into a glove, the Lord&rsquo;s intention was to put Himself into man. A glove has five fingers because our hand has five fingers. In the same way, since the Lord has a mind, emotion, and will, He created us with a mind, emotion, and will (Phil. 2:5; Rom. 9:13; Rev. 4:11). It is because we were created in God&rsquo;s image that we have a soul with a mind, emotion, and will.</p>
<p>On the day that we received Christ as our life, He came into us. First, He came into our spirit. This is like a hand coming into the part of the glove that is fashioned according to the palm of the hand. When the Lord came into us initially, He was limited to our spirit. Now, day by day the Lord wants to spread gradually from our spirit into all the parts of our being. He wants to spread from our spirit into our mind, from our spirit into our emotion, and from our spirit into our will. The Lord&rsquo;s spreading into the different parts of our soul can be likened to the fingers of a hand entering into the fingers of a glove. After this gradual spreading of Christ within our being has taken place, we will be able to say that we have the mind of Christ (1 Cor. 2:16). Although we can all say with assurance that at present we have the Spirit of Christ in our spirit, not many of us can say that we have the mind of Christ in our mind, the emotion of Christ in our emotion, and the will of Christ in our will. One day, however, we will be able to say this with assurance. Our mind, emotion, and will were made so that the mind, emotion, and will of Christ could enter into them.</p>
<p>The reason most of us cannot say that we have the mind, emotion, and will of Christ is that these parts of our being remain in their fallen condition and have not yet been transformed. The Lord desires to spread Himself from our spirit into all the parts of our soul. The Lord spreads into these parts by our growing up into Christ in all things (Eph. 4:15). This growth is not the accumulation of knowledge about doctrines and teachings. For a Christian to grow means that Christ continually expands from his spirit into his mind, emotion, and will.</p>
<p>Once, a sister&rsquo;s husband died. The sister was quite mature and had grown up into Christ in many things. She had the Lord not only in her spirit; she had Him also in her mind, emotion, and will. Usually when people experience such loss, they become very sorrowful and inconsolable. Yet this sister was able to thank and praise the Lord. When the saints were with her at that time, they could sense that the Lord was not only in her spirit but also in her soul, particularly in her emotion. In contrast to this sister, there was another sister who lost her husband. She was rather young in the Lord and was not very mature in Him. After her husband&rsquo;s death, although we went to fellowship with her, she could not listen to us and could only weep bitterly. It did not matter how much we talked with her; she simply could not listen. In her we saw a person who, no doubt, had the Lord in her spirit but at that time did not have the Lord in her emotion even to a small degree. In these two sisters, both of whom had lost their husband, we see a great contrast. Whereas the mature sister had undergone much transformation of her soul, it was clear that the younger sister&rsquo;s emotion had not yet been transformed. This shows that although the Lord entered into our spirit at the time we were saved, we still need to experience the transformation of our soul.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRANSFORMED THROUGH<br />
DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The Scriptures tell us that the soulish man, the man of the soul, cannot receive anything spiritual (1 Cor. 2:14). It is impossible for such a man to receive the things of the Spirit of God. Hence, the soulish man, with his natural mind, emotion, and will, must be transformed by being put to death and resurrected (John 12:24-26; Matt. 16:24-25). This is transformation by the renewing of the mind (Eph. 4:23). Only through death and resurrection can our mind with the rest of our soul be renewed. It is not enough to be regenerated and transformed in our spirit; we must be transformed in our soul. Not being transformed in our soul is our great problem.</p>
<p>The way we can be delivered from the soulish man and transformed in our soul is to always look to the Lord to strengthen us to do one thing&mdash;to stop. Whenever we are about to think, to love, or to make a decision, we must stop. Oh, brothers and sisters, I want to give you this one little word: Stop! We must stop! When we are going to love something, we must say, &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; When we are going to think about something, we must say, &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; To stop is to put ourselves to death.</p>
<p>Sometimes it may be that immediately after praying in the morning, you recall what a brother said to you the day before. As you think about it, you may become offended. When this sort of thought comes to you, do you go along with it? If you go along with this thought and give it ground in you, it proves that your mind has not yet been transformed. It indicates that your mind, like an empty finger of a glove, does not yet have the content for which it was created. When you go along with such thoughts, you can be sure that there is very little of Christ in your mind. Instead of going along with these thoughts, you must stop. You must put your mind to death. At such times, you should pray, &ldquo;Lord, strengthen me to put my mind to death.&rdquo; Please remember that where there is the death of the cross, there is the resurrection life of Christ. When you put your mind to death, be sure that the resurrection life of Christ will follow. When we stop and allow our mind to be put to death, our mind will become a resurrected mind. A resurrected mind is a renewed mind. When we have a renewed mind, there will be a change in our thinking. This change is actually the transformation of the mind. Because your mind has been transformed by renewing, that is, by being put to death and resurrected, you will testify that this brother is a grace and a gift to you from the Lord. Your having this thought is an indication that your mind has been transformed. This transformation is actually the Spirit of Christ spreading into your mind to fill it with Himself.</p>
<p>Some saints are very emotional. When they are happy, they are happy to the extent that they forget about everything, including Christ Himself. Also, when such ones are sorrowful, they may forget about the Lord. Emotional people must learn to tell their natural man to stop. When you are about to be happy and laugh, it is best not to laugh too much and instead learn to tell yourself to stop. Learn to put your soulish man to death by the strengthening of the Holy Spirit. Some people are quick to lose their temper. Such people are also too emotional. When you are about to lose your temper, you have to say, &ldquo;Lord, strengthen me to stop my emotion.&rdquo; If you put your emotion to death, resurrection will follow. Your emotion will be resurrected and filled with the Holy Spirit. Then when you are happy, the image of Christ will be in your happiness, and when you love something, the image of Christ will be in your love. We will eventually have the image of Christ in our mind, emotion, and will because we will have been transformed in our soul into the image of Christ, and He will have spread into every part of our being.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO APPLY CHRIST</h2>
<p>We must all practice this fellowship and learn to apply Christ. When you first learned to drive, you were instructed concerning many things. After learning, you needed to practice what you had learned. When you first began to practice, perhaps what you learned did not seem to work. Yet despite your failure, you continued to believe the instructions and went on to practice driving. After perhaps one week, you became quite accustomed to driving. To learn to drive, you simply had to practice driving. It is the same with practicing to stop our natural soul.</p>
<p>We must realize that it is not a small thing that Christ came into our spirit when we were regenerated. Since Christ is in our spirit, all we must do is apply Him. It is here in the application that we encounter a problem. To continue the illustration given above, we may have a car with a full tank of gasoline, and the car may run; but we must still operate the car correctly. Pushing the car is not the right way to operate the car, and to do so is to act foolishly. Rather than pushing the car, we must learn to drive by practicing. In our practicing to stop and apply Christ, I am afraid that many of us ask the Lord to help us to &ldquo;push the car.&rdquo; We may pray, &ldquo;Lord, help me in this matter. It is so easy for me to lose my temper and very difficult for me to overcome this weakness. But, Lord, You are almighty and You can help me.&rdquo; If we pray in this way, the Lord will not help us. The more we pray in such a way, the more we will realize that the Lord does not hear this kind of prayer. In fact, the more we pray, &ldquo;Lord, help me not to lose my temper,&rdquo; the more we will lose it. To pray in this way is to &ldquo;push the car.&rdquo; If we pray in this way, it is an indication that we have forgotten that we have Christ within us and are not applying Him. We have Christ within us; let us simply exercise to apply Christ.</p>
<p>Exercising to apply Christ is like learning to apply the gasoline that is in our car. It is so easy. Just as there is gasoline in our car, there is power within our spirit. I know this because I have learned how to practice this. For the first ten years after I was saved by the Lord, I did not know this. Then one day, the Lord opened my eyes to see that there was something powerful in me. Moreover, I realized that I had to use and apply that supply of power. This power within me and within all of us is nothing less than Christ Himself (2 Cor. 13:3). Christ is in our spirit; all we must do is learn to apply Him. We should no longer cry, &ldquo;Lord, help me.&rdquo; If we do, the Lord will answer, &ldquo;No. I am not going to help you in this way. I am dwelling in you. Practice to apply Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before we can learn how to apply Christ, we must realize that Christ is in us. Then we must always deny our self, that is, our natural man and natural character. Matthew 16:24 says, &ldquo;If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.&rdquo; This means that we should put ourselves to death and put ourselves under the death of the cross. Always deny your natural mind, your natural emotion, and your natural will. Learn to always put yourself to death. Give the Lord a chance within you. Whether you are a person who is too fast or too slow in your nature, you must put yourself under the death of the cross. If you do this, the Lord will honor you and will resurrect you. After you are resurrected, your mind, emotion, and will&mdash;your entire soul&mdash;will be in the spirit. Then you will be transformed into Christ&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p>In many situations in our daily life, we must put ourselves to death. We must tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, in this matter, I deny myself. In thinking, in loving, and in choosing, I deny myself. I commit myself into Your hands. I wish to have Your mind as my mind, Your emotion as my emotion, and Your will as my will.&rdquo; We must remember to put ourselves to death and let the Lord raise us up in His resurrection power. Then our whole being will be filled with the Spirit of Christ.</p>
<p>These things are not mere doctrine or teaching; they are instructions on how to apply Christ. If you take these instructions, this experience will be real to you. Applying Christ is very simple, as simple as driving a car. You may not believe me when I say this. Nevertheless, to practice this is even more simple than what I have described. You have Christ within you. Forget about your old way of praying to the Lord. Do not pray any longer that He would help you to do anything. The Lord will not answer that kind of prayer. If we have a car with gasoline and we ask the Lord to help us push the car, the Lord will respond, &ldquo;Do not be so foolish. Stop! Start to use the gasoline, and the car will move easily.&rdquo; We must believe the Lord. When we finally stop and learn to apply Christ in this way, we will experience the Lord&rsquo;s deliverance.</p>
<p>When I was young, because there were not many cars in my country, we commonly used bicycles for transportation. One day I decided that I needed a bicycle and bought one. Then I went to a brother and asked him how to ride it. He simply answered, &ldquo;Go and ride it.&rdquo; I protested, saying, &ldquo;Please tell me how to ride.&rdquo; Again, he answered &ldquo;Go and ride it.&rdquo; I took his word and went out to practice. After only two or three hours, I was riding the bicycle effortlessly. I learned by practicing.</p>
<p>We need to accept this simple word. After having served the Lord and having contacted the Lord&rsquo;s children for many years, I have learned something. Messages and doctrines are very good, but they only present to us a very beautiful &ldquo;building&rdquo; while giving us no &ldquo;entrance&rdquo; into it. Without a &ldquo;door,&rdquo; we will never be able to enter into the reality of those teachings. I am not giving you mere teachings. You may see that the Lord is life to you. The problem is that you have no entrance into what you have seen. Now I am giving you instructions on how to enter. You have believed in the Lord Jesus. You have received Him. Now He is within you.</p>
<p>The problem is that we do not practice applying Christ in our daily life. By practicing, we will enter into the experience of transformation. Christ is life, light, and power, but is Christ real to us in these aspects? We must learn to apply Christ. The way to apply Him is first by denying our self&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;and simply stopping. We must simply come to the Lord who is within us and contact Him. Then we will learn to apply Him. After many years of experience, I can testify that no matter what happens to me, it is so easy for me to apply Christ. It is as easy as switching on a light.</p>
<p>I would ask you to take my simple instructions to practice to apply Christ. If you do, you will experience Christ more and more every day. He will never be exhausted by your experience. You will realize how rich He is. Whatever you need, He will be. All you must do is learn to deny the self. Then your soul&mdash;your mind, emotion, and will&mdash;will be renewed. By this kind of renewing, you will be transformed. If you deny your self, the Spirit of the Lord within you will honor you. He will strengthen you and cause you to experience His resurrection power and life. Then day by day you will taste Him and enjoy Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RENEWING OF THE MIND</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 4:19; Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:17-24</h1>
<p>In this chapter we go on to consider the renewing of the mind. In the previous chapters we saw that in our Christian life we are transformed gradually into the Lord&rsquo;s image (2 Cor. 3:18). We were made in God&rsquo;s image (Gen. 1:26). God has a mind, emotion, and will (cf. Eph. 1:11; Rom. 9:13; Rev. 4:11), and because He created us in His image, He also gave us a mind, emotion, and will. The image of God in which we were created, however, is simply outward and is not the image which Paul refers to in 2 Corinthians 3:18. Until we have been regenerated by the Lord coming into our spirit to be our life, the image we share with God remains superficial. Before we are regenerated, although we may bear the outward image of God, He is not our inward content. Only when we are regenerated does the Lord come into our spirit and begin to spread into every part of our being to become the content of our entire being, particularly our soul. When He comes into our spirit, our spirit is immediately transformed into His image. Then as the Lord dwells within us, He gradually transforms us by becoming the content of our inward being, particularly our mind, emotion, and will. Today God is waiting for a chance to spread into every part of our entire being so that we may be transformed into His image in a full way. We must cooperate with God&rsquo;s desire by practicing to give Him a free way to spread Himself into every part of our being.</p>
<p>In our daily life the mind is the controlling part of our being. Regardless of its condition, the mind controls our life and being. In the fourth chapter of Ephesians, Paul speaks of the Gentiles, who &ldquo;walk in the vanity of their mind&rdquo; (v. 17). For us to walk in the vanity of the mind is to allow the vanity of the mind to control us. To walk in the vanity of the mind is to be under the rule, direction, and control of a mind that is full of vanity. People who have such a mind love the world, money, and other vain things. Such persons&rsquo; daily lives are under the control of the mind of vanity. We must realize that it is possible for us to remain under the control of the old man even after we have been regenerated. Although our spirit was renewed and became a new creation at the time we were regenerated, it is quite possible that we are still old in our mind. If this is our case, that is a sign that our mind has not yet been transformed or renewed.</p>
<p>In this chapter we want to consider the question, &ldquo;How can our mind be renewed?&rdquo; The answer to this question is critical, because the renewing of the mind affects the entire Christian life. For example, most Christians desire to overcome their sins. Yet they may not realize that overcoming sin is closely linked with the renewing of the mind. If we neglect the experience of the renewing of the mind, it will be difficult for us to overcome sins. On the other hand, if we experience the renewing of the mind and are transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image, it will be easy for us to overcome all kinds of sins. If we will simply be renewed in our mind and transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image, so many things in our Christian life will become easy to us. Hence, the kind of Christian life we have depends largely upon whether our mind is being renewed day by day.</p>
<p>When we love a person with the deepest love, we eventually walk, act, and think like that person. After a husband and wife have loved each other for an extended period of time, they are of the same mind, attitude, and desire. This is an indication that real love causes two people to be of one mind. If a wife truly loves her husband, that love will constrain her to think as her husband thinks, act as her husband acts, and do things as her husband does. If she never thinks, acts, and does things as he does, that is a sign that the love she has for him is probably not real. This illustration, however, is limited, for no matter how much the husband loves his wife and she loves him, they cannot actually enter into each other as the Lord has entered into us. The Lord has entered into us and is now in us (2 Cor. 13:5). We are joined to the Lord, and He and we are one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Our indwelling Lord is waiting for us to be renewed, transformed, into His image by Himself with His resurrection life. We must come to the realization that nothing is as important as the renewing of our mind. If we are going to have a real Christian life&mdash;a life in which we easily overcome all negative things and follow the Lord to do His will&mdash;we must be renewed in the mind, in the emotion, and in the will. Because the mind is the leading part of our soul, it is especially important that we be renewed in the mind.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING FORMED IN US</h2>
<p>Galatians 4:19 says, &ldquo;My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you.&rdquo; To have Christ formed in us is to have our mind, emotion, and will renewed. When our entire soul is renewed in this way, we will not only have the mind of Christ to think as He thinks; Christ Himself will be the one who thinks in us. When Christ is formed in us, at the very moment we think about something, He spreads from our spirit into and through our mind to become the content of our mind. Then, as He spreads, He becomes the one who thinks within us. Apparently, we are the ones thinking; actually, Christ is the One who is thinking within us. It will be the same with our emotion. When we love something or someone, we will not be loving alone; Christ within us will also be loving. Regarding our will, when we decide to do something, it will not be just we ourselves who decide; Christ within us will decide. If we experience Christ being formed in us, we will be &ldquo;double people.&rdquo; Although we will still be ourselves, within us another person, Christ, will be in the process of being formed within us. As this person is formed in us, He will spread into every part of our inner being. Consequently, when we think, we will have the mind of Christ, when we love, we will have the love of Christ, and when we decide, we will have the will of Christ. Christ will be not only in our spirit; He will have spread into our mind, will, and emotion. As Christ is formed within us, we are gradually transformed into His image.</p><h2 class="head2">Loving the Lord</h2>
<p>Whether or not Christ is formed in us and we are transformed in our soul depends on at least three things. First, we have to love Him. When a husband and wife walk together, they often walk hand in hand. Although they are two persons, they are one in action and gesture. This indicates that they love each other. In the same way, if we love the Lord in a real way, we will desire to be the same as He is in everything. When we are about to do something, we will ask ourselves, &ldquo;Is this the way the Lord loves things? Is this the way the Lord acts?&rdquo; By checking ourselves in this way, we will naturally be adjusted in our thinking, feeling, and deciding. When we discover that our thinking is not the Lord&rsquo;s thinking and that our mind is not His mind, we will give up our thinking and be adjusted by the Lord&rsquo;s mind. We must submit our mind to the Lord&rsquo;s mind, our emotion to the Lord&rsquo;s emotion, and our will to the Lord&rsquo;s will. Let us simply submit to Him. If we love the Lord in such a way, we will give Him the liberty, ground, and opportunity to occupy one part of our being after another. Our problem is that although we have been regenerated and have a heart that loves the Lord, we do not love the Lord to the fullest extent. As a result, it seems that the Lord does not have the chance to do anything in our mind, emotion, and will. The reason the Lord does not have the ground to occupy our mind is that we simply do not love Him much.</p>
<p>Frequently, although we do love the Lord to a certain degree, we are not one with Him. Having visited many homes throughout the years, I realize that between husbands and wives, even those who love each other, this kind of situation often exists. Although these couples often act and think as one, I have noticed that very often the husband and the wife are not one. I have seen the wife determine to do the exact opposite of what her husband does, and vice versa. Many times, we have this kind of relationship with the Lord. How many times have we told the Lord, &ldquo;You go Your way; I will go mine&rdquo;? If this is the state of our relationship with the Lord, not only will we fail to be renewed in our mind; our mind will become increasingly independent of the Lord, and we will shut the Lord out of our mind. If we love Him in an absolute way, however, in every situation we will look to the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, I just love You. I want to know how You consider my situation. What is Your mind concerning this? I want to take Your mind as my mind and have Your mind spread into my mind. Because I love You so much, I want to have my mind saturated by and mingled with Your mind.&rdquo; If we love the Lord in this way, we will give Him much liberty, ground, and opportunity to deal with us regarding our mind. We must love Him so that gradually our mind can be renewed, filled, saturated, and mingled with the Lord&rsquo;s mind, that is, with the Lord Himself. Then when we think and consider things, people will sense that within our thinking and consideration there is the savor of Christ (cf. 2 Cor. 2:14). If we want Christ to be formed in us and if we want our minds to be renewed, we must love the Lord more.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fellowshipping with the Lord</h2>
<p>Second, in order to be renewed, we need to remain in fellowship with the Lord. Not only should we stay in fellowship with the Lord during our times of prayer; we should keep in contact with Him even in the midst of our daily activities and conversations. When we converse with people, we should fellowship with the Lord simultaneously. Even during the busiest of times, we should remain in fellowship with the Lord. This needs our practice. Many years ago, I knew a young brother who was brought to the point where he was constantly in fellowship with the Lord. This brother told me that as he walked, he would stop every block or two in order to stay in communion with the Lord. If we remain in constant fellowship with the Lord, we will give the Lord much opportunity to take possession of our mind, emotion, and will.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Praying</h2>
<p>Third, for Christ to be formed in us, we must pray. It is not adequate for us to pray simply because we have many things to ask of the Lord. We must pray for the simple purpose of contacting the Lord and exercising our spirit.</p>
<p>When we listen to things, we automatically exercise our ears. When we walk or run, we automatically exercise our legs and feet. According to the same principle, if we pray, we will automatically exercise our spirit, because to pray is to exercise the spirit. Even though many times when we begin to pray, we are not in the spirit, after maybe five or ten minutes we get into the spirit. When toddlers first try to walk, they do not use their feet and legs much. But the more they practice walking, the more they use them. In the same way, if day by day we pray more, we will automatically exercise our spirit more as well. I believe that many of us have experienced that the more we pray, the more we are in the spirit and the more we grow accustomed to exercising our spirit. The more we exercise our spirit to pray, the more we open the way for the Lord as the Spirit within us to spread into all the parts of our inward being. Although we may pray to ask things of the Lord, the most important reason why we pray is to exercise our spirit to keep in contact with the Lord. If we exercise our spirit by praying in this way, our entire being will be gradually renewed, and we will be transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p>Christ being formed in us and our being renewed in the spirit of our mind depends very much on these three matters&mdash;we must love the Lord, remain in fellowship with Him, and exercise to pray. The more we do these things, the more we will be renewed.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING CHRIST</h2>
<p>Many of you have learned many Christian teachings and doctrines. The burden in my heart in these messages, however, is to fellowship with you about definite ways in which you can experience the things you have learned. In other words, I am burdened that you come into the reality of what you already know.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:20 says, &ldquo;But you did not so learn Christ.&rdquo; We must pay attention to the phrase <em>learn Christ</em> and understand it in the proper way. To learn Christ does not mean that because Christ loved people, we also should love people. When I was a child, I was taught that because Jesus loved poor people, we must love poor people as well. I was wrongly taught that such imitation is what it means to learn Christ. To learn Christ does not mean that we imitate Him; it means that we, within whom Christ dwells, have Christ as our life in everything that we do. It means that when we think about things, we take Christ as our life subjectively and live Him out. Learning Christ is not objective&mdash;it is not simply taking the Christ who is outside of us and following His example. Rather, learning Christ is very subjective. It has everything to do with Christ being in us, dwelling in us, and being life to us. For us to learn Christ means that His mind becomes our mind, His love becomes our love, and His heart becomes our heart. We must take His mind as our mind and therefore give up our own mind. This is the right way to learn Christ.</p>
<p>In the next verse, Paul says &ldquo;If indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus&rdquo; (v. 21). All the reality that is in Christ must be enjoyed by us and must become our portion. For example, love and light are realities. These realities are in Christ. Since we have been regenerated, Christ is in us. Therefore, whatever He has within Himself&mdash;in this example, love and light&mdash;has become our portion. Hence, we need to enjoy all the realities that are in Him. The way for us to enjoy these realities is given to us in verses 22 through 24. First, we must &ldquo;put off...the old man.&rdquo; The putting off of the old man is something that we did once for all when we were baptized. Second, we must &ldquo;be renewed in the spirit of [our] mind.&rdquo; This is something we must experience constantly. Third, we must &ldquo;put on the new man.&rdquo; Like putting off the old man, this has already been fully accomplished. Hence, we have three matters: the putting off of the old man on one side, the putting on of the new man on the other side, and the renewing of the mind in the middle. Whether or not the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man are real in our daily experience depends upon whether or not we experience being renewed in the spirit of our mind. Our being renewed in the spirit of our mind is the central matter.</p>
<p>We may know the fact and the doctrine that in Christ we have put off the old man and put on the new man, and we may realize that we are a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17) and that the old things have passed away and have become new. But in our experience, are these facts a reality to us or merely doctrine? We may frequently speak of how we were crucified with Christ, how our old man was put to death on the cross, and how we have put on Christ and are therefore in Him (Gal. 3:27). But it is quite possible that these things are merely teachings to us. It is possible that we do not know how to make these things real in our living. We must challenge ourselves and concerning these facts ask ourselves, &ldquo;Is this real to me? Is it real to me that I as the old man have been put to death? Is it real to me that I have put on the new man?&rdquo; Again, whether or not these things are made real to us depends solely upon whether or not we experience being renewed in the spirit of our mind.</p>
<p>The way for us to be renewed in the spirit of our mind is very simple. First, we must love the Lord. We must simply love Him with our whole being. If we love the Lord to the uttermost, He will gain the ground in us and have the full liberty to occupy our entire being. Then our mind will be very much renewed by Him. Second, we must fellowship with Him; that is, we must remain in contact with Him. Day by day and moment by moment, we should never stray out of the Lord&rsquo;s presence. Rather, we should always be in His presence.</p>
<p>Third, we need to learn to exercise our spirit by praying. The more we pray, the more we will exercise our spirit. In the physical realm, the parts of our body that we exercise the most become strong, and the parts we rarely use remain weak. A number of years ago, I became seriously ill and was confined to my bed for six months. Because I was in bed, I was unable to use my legs and feet during that time. It never occurred to me that I might not be able to walk at the end of my illness. I took for granted the fact that I could stand and walk. To my surprise, when I attempted to leave the bed, I was unable to stand up. Because I had not used my legs and feet for such a long period of time, those members of my body had become so weak that I was unable to stand. It is the same with our spirit. If you do not pray, be assured that you will remain weak in your spirit. The reason that many of you are weak when you come to the prayer meeting and the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting is that you rarely pray. If you pray much day after day, when you come to the meeting, your spirit will be very strong, and it will be easy for you to pray in the meetings. We need to pray and exercise our spirit so that our spirit will become strong. In this way, the Lord as the Spirit will have an open way to spread into all the parts of our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO CONDITIONS OF THE MIND</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 4 there are two expressions that describe the mind. Verse 17 speaks of the vanity of the mind, and verse 23 speaks of the spirit of the mind. These two verses describe two conditions in which it is possible for our minds to be. We can either have vanity in our mind or the spirit of our mind. What is the condition of your mind&mdash;vanity or spirit? In the minds of the people in the world there is nothing but vanity. Vanity occupies the minds of the people in the world; their minds can even be characterized by vanity. If the vanity of this world occupies our mind, our mind will remain in oldness and will never be new. Moreover, if our mind is full of vanity, it is absolutely impossible for us to grow in life even to a small degree. However, when our mind is occupied by the spirit, which, as we have seen, is expanding into our mind, we will have the spirit of the mind. When our spirit expands into our mind, our mind will no longer be occupied with vanity but will be occupied with the spirit.</p>
<p>Let us consider the passage of the Scriptures that concerns the two conditions of the mind, Ephesians 4:17-24. Please pay attention to the fact that this passage is divided into two parts. The first part, composed of verses 17 through 19, deals with the vanity of the mind. The second part, beginning with the word <em>but</em> in verse 20, deals with the spirit of the mind:</p>
<p>This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk in the vanity of their mind, being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness. But you did not so learn Christ, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus, that you put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.</p>
<p>When vanity occupies a person&rsquo;s mind, his understanding is darkened, his heart is hardened, he is alienated from the life of God, he casts away all feeling (meaning he casts away all consciousness of his conscience), and he gives himself over to sinful things. When our spirit spreads into our mind, however, our mind is renewed. With that renewing comes the reality of putting off the old man and putting on the new man. When we are renewed, we are transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image (Rom. 12:2). If we have vanity in our mind, it is possible for us to commit any kind of sin. If, on the other hand, we have the spirit in our mind, we will be renewed, transformed, into the Lord&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p>May the Holy Spirit show us the two ways of conducting ourselves in our daily life. The first way is to be controlled and directed by the vanity of the mind, that is, by the mind of vanity. The second way is to live and walk in the spirit of our mind, that is, by a mind that is of the spirit. If we take the way of being renewed in the spirit of our mind, we will be led to a point where we will be very much like the Lord&mdash;we will be transformed into His image. This wonderful and beautiful transformation takes place through our being renewed in the spirit of our mind. Our mind needs to be renewed from being a mind that is full of vanity to a mind that is full of the spirit. Then we will be delivered from all sinful things, transferred into the kingdom of His marvelous light (1 Pet. 2:9), and transformed into the image of the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">FOUR LAWS AND THREE LIVES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 7:15-23; 8:1-2</h1>
<p>In this chapter we come to Romans 7 and 8 to see a matter that is both basic and important to our spiritual life&mdash;four laws and three lives.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR LAWS</h2>
<p>For what I work out, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do. But if what I do not will, this I do, I agree with the law that it is good. Now then it is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me. For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not. For I do not do the good which I will; but the evil which I do not will, this I practice. But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me. I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me. For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man, but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members. (7:15-23)</p>
<p>There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death. (8:1-2)</p>
<p>Verses 17 and 20 speak of the &ldquo;sin that dwells&rdquo; in us. Sin, here, is very particular. This sin is not something dead. Rather, it is something that actively dwells. Only something living can dwell. Hence, sin here is something that is living. Verse 18 says that &ldquo;in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells.&rdquo; Here, <em>me</em> does not mean the entire tripartite being; it means only the flesh.</p>
<p>In verse 22 we find the expression <em>the law of God.</em> Paul wrote that he delighted in this law according to the inner man. In the next verse he speaks of a &ldquo;different law&rdquo; which was in the members of his body. While the law of God is outside of us, this &ldquo;different law&rdquo; is within our members. Paul identifies this &ldquo;different law&rdquo; as &ldquo;the law of sin which is in my members&rdquo; (v. 23). This law is not a good law but an evil law. He wrote that the law of sin was warring against the law of his mind. In this phrase he introduces yet another law&mdash;the law of our mind. The mind is the most important part of the soul. This third law is therefore in our soul. The law of sin in the members of the body fights against and defeats the law in our mind and brings us into captivity. Then in Romans 8 we see a fourth and final law&mdash;the law of the Spirit of life, or the law of life. This law frees us in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.</p>
<p>After reading this passage, it should be clear to us that four laws are related to us&mdash;the law of God, the law of sin, the law of good, and the law of life. The first is the law of God, which is outside of us and is objective to us. The other three laws are within us and are subjective to us. We as human beings have three parts&mdash;body, soul, and spirit. Within each part of our being there is a particular law. In the body there is the law of sin, in the mind (the leading part of the soul) there is the law of good, and in our spirit there is the law of life. The laws that are in our body and soul (the law of sin and the law of good, respectively) always war against one another. When we do not try to do anything, the law in the members of our body does not operate. In other words, when the law of our mind &ldquo;sleeps,&rdquo; the law in our members also &ldquo;sleeps.&rdquo; However, when the law in the mind tries to obey the law of God and do good, the law in the body rises up to fight against and defeat that law, to bring us into captivity, and to make us do what we do not want to do. The law in our mind may say, &ldquo;I want to do something good.&rdquo; But as soon as we say that, the law of sin in our members may reply, &ldquo;You say that you are going to do something good, but I do not agree. I will fight against and defeat you, for I am a stronger and more powerful law than you are.&rdquo; The law of sin in the body inevitably defeats the law in our mind that is trying to do good. Once it has defeated the law of good, the law of sin always brings us into captivity and makes us do what we hate doing. Yet we cannot help it; we do the things we do not want to do because we have been captured by the law of sin in the members of the body.</p>
<p>Besides these three laws, there is a fourth law&mdash;the law of life. Because this law is of the Spirit of life and the Spirit of life is in our spirit, the law of the Spirit of life is in our spirit. This law is the strongest and most powerful law. As such, this law can free us from the law of sin and of death. Whereas the law of good in our mind is always defeated by the law of sin in our members, the law of life in our spirit always overcomes the law of sin and frees us from it.</p>
<p>We must remember these four laws and understand how they are related to us. The first law is the law of God, and it is outside of us. The other three laws are in the three parts of our being, respectively: the law of sin in the members of our body, the law of good in our mind, and the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit. As men created by God, we know something about the law of God. Because we know the law of God, we make up our mind to keep that law. Our deciding to do the law of God is actually the operation of the law of good in our mind. When, however, the law of good in our mind tries to do good and keep the law of God, a stronger law, the law of sin in the members of our sinful body, the flesh, rises up. Because the law of sin in our flesh is stronger than the law of good in our mind, the latter is always defeated by the former. Since that is the case, we have become captives to sin. However, there is deliverance! This deliverance comes through the fourth law&mdash;the law of life. This fourth law, which is in our spirit, is the strongest and most powerful law&mdash;stronger even than the law of sin in our members. It subdues the law of sin and sets us free from it. When it does, we are delivered from captivity and gain the victory.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE LIVES</h2>
<p>Now we must go on to consider the three lives. As with the four laws, each of these three lives is related to us. God created us to be human beings. First, because we are humans, we have the human life, which is the created life. This is on our side. On God&rsquo;s side, He has the uncreated, eternal, divine life. Because we have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit of God, we now have the divine, eternal life. The third life is that of the devil. This life is also very much related to us, for through the fall, the devil himself has become related to us. We cannot say that just because we are creatures of God, we do not have anything to do with the life of the devil. On the contrary, we must admit that because of the fall, the life of Satan is related to us.</p>
<p>Because we are regenerated believers, three tremendous things have happened to us. First, we have been created. Second, we have fallen. Third, we have been regenerated. Because these three things have happened to us, there are three lives in us. When we were created by God, we received the created life, the human life. Then when we fell, we received the life of the devil. Whether we realize this or not, it is a fact. When we partook of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, something of Satan came into our being; it was not Adam alone who ate of that tree&mdash;we were included in Adam (Rom. 5:12; cf. Heb. 7:9-10). When Adam ate of that tree, he not only committed an act of sin; he also received the life of Satan into his being. We can see this in a simple illustration. Let us say that there is a bottle of poison, which a mother warns her child not to touch. One day when the mother goes out, the little child takes the bottle and drinks the poison. In doing so, he disobeys his mother&rsquo;s command. However, disobedience is a small concern compared to a much greater problem which has arisen&mdash;the deadly poison is now inside the child. When the mother discovers that her child has drunk the poison, she is concerned not mainly with his disobedience but with getting the poison out of him. On the day that Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he did not merely do something that was contrary to God&rsquo;s command; something of Satan came into his being. From that day onward there has been something evil in our flesh. First John 3:10 says that we are &ldquo;children of the devil.&rdquo; In the very same way that we are the children of Adam because we have Adam&rsquo;s life, the human life, we are the children of the devil because we have Satan&rsquo;s life. However, we have not only been created and have not only become fallen; we have also been regenerated. Praise the Lord that when we received the Lord Jesus as our life, the Holy Spirit came into our spirit, bringing the divine life into us! At that point, we became the children of God possessing the life of God (5:12; John 1:12-13).</p>
<p>We must realize that as created, fallen, and regenerated men, we have three fathers. Our first father is the first man, Adam. Our second father is the devil, Satan. Our third father is God the Father. The Lord Jesus told the Pharisees, who represent us, that they were the children of their father, the devil (8:44). This verse clearly tells us that Satan is our evil father. But praise the Lord, we have been regenerated by God! We have become His children, and He has become our Father (20:17; 1 John 3:1; 5:18). Our being the children of Satan is a thing of the past. We are now the children of God. We must realize that these three lives&mdash;the human life, the satanic life, and the divine life&mdash;are all related to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERY KIND OF LIFE HAVING A CERTAIN KIND OF LAW</h2>
<p>We must see the principle that with every kind of life there is a corresponding law. We may illustrate this with the example of a bird. Inherent in the bird life is the law of flight. As long as a bird is a bird, it will naturally fly. Although we can confine a bird to a cage and thereby keep it from flying, the moment we set the bird free, it will fly. That birds fly is a law of the bird life. Similarly, the law of the fish life says that in order for a fish to live, it must remain in the water. Because the bird life and the fish life have certain laws, if we were to put a bird under water or take a fish out of the water, both the bird and the fish would die. Even the vegetable life has a law. Hence, we can see that with every kind of life there is certain kind of law. This is also true related to us. With the human life there is a law, with the satanic life there is a law, and with the divine life there is a law. The law of the created human life, since that life is good, is the law of good. This law of good is in our soul. The law of the satanic life, since that life is evil, is the law of sin. This law of sin is in the members of the body. The law of the Spirit of life is the life of God, and it is in our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FOUR LAWS AND<br />
THREE LIVES IN OUR EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>Let us consider the life of Satan and the law of sin in greater detail. When Adam took the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he took something of that tree into his body. From that moment, something was added into the body, causing it to become flesh. We must realize that there is a difference between the body and the flesh. The body was the original creation of God (Gen. 2:7a), whereas the flesh is the body with Satan added into it (Rom. 8:3; 6:6). When Satan entered man&rsquo;s body with his satanic life, man&rsquo;s body became sinful. Because we have the life of Satan, we have the law of sin in our body. Romans 6:6 speaks of &ldquo;the body of sin.&rdquo; Our body is called the body of sin because sin dwells in the body. Hence, our body is the flesh. Romans 8:3 refers to the body of sin, the flesh, as &ldquo;the flesh of sin.&rdquo; The expressions <em>the body of sin</em> and <em>the flesh of sin</em> both denote the same thing.</p>
<p>This body of sin always works through the soul. When the soul is living, active, and in motion, the body of sin works. When, however, the soulish life is put to death, the body of sin is made &ldquo;jobless,&rdquo; for there is nothing left for it to do. This is essentially what Paul says in Romans 6:6. When our old man, the life of which is the soul-life, is crucified, the body of sin is annulled. Hence, when the soul-life is killed, there is nothing for the body of sin to do. Sin is not in the soul; it is in the body. But the body of sin works through the soul. If therefore the soul-life is dead, the body of sin has no way to operate. The more living and active our soul-life is, the more actively the body of sin will operate.</p>
<p>Let us use an illustration. Since people use their body when they gamble, only when their soul-life is killed will their gambling bodies cease gambling. If those gamblers were stripped of their soul-life, the sinful members of their bodies would no longer be able to gamble. Those members would no longer have the soul-life as their &ldquo;employer&rdquo; and would therefore be &ldquo;jobless.&rdquo; Romans 6:7 says, &ldquo;For he who has died is justified from sin.&rdquo; Some translations render the word <em>justified</em> as &ldquo;freed.&rdquo; The gamblers&rsquo; bodies will never be able to be freed from gambling until their soul-life, the life of the old man, has been put to death. Only when their soul-life has been put to death will their gambling body, their body of sin, be jobless.</p>
<p>We all desire to be delivered from the law of sin, but we may not know how to experience this deliverance. The law of God is outside of us and is objective to us. Everyone who has been stirred up by the Holy Spirit has the intention to live and act according to the law of God. However, in dealing with the law of sin, if we mind the law of God and try to use the law of good in our mind to overcome the law of sin, we will experience much trouble. Instead of actually doing good, we will only be able to try to do good and will inevitably fail. In order to be delivered from the law of sin, we must forget about the law of God and give up the law of good in our mind. We must simply pay attention to the law of the Spirit of life and go along with it. As long as we continue to contact the law of life, remain in fellowship with the Lord, and stay in His presence, the law of life will operate within us. This law is the most powerful of the three laws that are within us. This law releases us and sets us free from the law of sin.</p>
<p>The law of good in our mind can be likened to a broken-down automobile. If we drive such a car, we will experience much trouble and encounter many problems. The law of the Spirit of life in our spirit, on the other hand, is like a jetliner. If a jetliner is available for our transportation, there is no reason for us to depend on the broken-down car. The law of the Spirit of life is powerful. Rather than focusing on the law of God or struggling to keep the law of good that is in our mind, we should simply remain in fellowship with God and go along with the law of the Spirit of life within. If we do this, we will be transcendent over the law of sin and will at last gain the victory. This is the simple way to victory.</p>
<p>We can illustrate these four laws in our experience in the following way. One item of the law is that we must love our brother (1 John 4:21; John 13:34). Let us say that two brothers meet each other. The first brother knows that according to the law of God he should love the other brother. Within him there is the law of good, which corresponds to the law of God outside of him. According to this inner law, he tries to do good, please God, and keep God&rsquo;s commandments. Therefore, when this brother sees the second brother, the law of good within him responds to the law of God outside of him, and he tells the Lord that he will love his brother. It is at that very moment that he will experience the law of sin rising up within him to fight against his keeping the law of God. As a result, he will be unable to love the brother. Inevitably, the law of sin will capture this brother. Although he intends to love his neighbor and keep the commandment of God, the result of his intention is inevitable defeat and capture by the law of sin. Eventually, he may do something evil to his brother even though it is not only against God&rsquo;s law but also against his own intention, desire, and the law of good within him. I believe that we have had similar experiences.</p>
<p>Implied in Paul&rsquo;s thought in Romans 7 and 8 is the thought that we should forget about the law of God, give up on the law of good within ourselves, and simply remain in fellowship with the Lord, for only our fellowship and contact with Him in our spirit will allow the strongest law, the law of life, to operate. When we follow the law of the Spirit of life and align ourselves with the divine life, we will love our neighbors even without intending to do so. Our love for them will be the result of the divine life being lived out through us. In other words, the law of life within our spirit will strengthen and energize us to love others.</p>
<p>Let us consider another illustration. There was once a man who was very proud. One day he came to a preacher to talk about his problem of pride. The preacher, who knew about the law of God and the law of good but nothing about the law of the Spirit of life, advised the man in this way: &ldquo;Try your best to be humble. God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.&rdquo; This bit of advice scared the proud man because within him the law of good had already been operating as he attempted to be humble. Nevertheless, he took the preacher&rsquo;s advice and prayed to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I wish to be humble. Help me to be humble.&rdquo; The result of his prayer should be clear to all of us. The more we pray in such a way, the more proud we will be. Despite our prayers we cannot help but be proud. As a result of our proud thoughts we may be full of regret and tell the Lord, &ldquo;O Lord, I am very evil. No matter how hard I try, I simply cannot be humble.&rdquo; The apostle Paul has solved this problem for us. He tells us to simply remain in fellowship with God so that the law of the Spirit of life can operate. We need to forget about the law of God, give up on the law of doing good, and realize the fact that the divine life is within us. God is so near and dear to us. We must simply keep in contact with Him as the living and powerful law of the Spirit of life within us. Once we align ourselves with this law, we will be full of rest and satisfaction and will be humble automatically and unconsciously. Even if people admire us for our humility, we will not be aware of the fact that we are humble. The cause of our being humble in such an automatic and unconscious way will not be an act on our part but the life of Christ being lived out through us by the energizing of the law of life. Such a living corresponds absolutely with the law of God and fulfills the requirement of the law of God perfectly (Rom. 8:4). If we follow the Holy Spirit, we will be in line with the law of life, and we will naturally and automatically fulfill the requirements of the law of God.</p>
<p>I ask you all to practice this. Forget about the law of God and give up the law of good. Instead, always keep in contact with the Lord and go along with the law of the Spirit of life that is in your spirit. Then you will have a daily living that perfectly corresponds to the law of God and absolutely fulfills all its requirements.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S DELIVERANCE IN THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 5:18-19, 21; 6:3-11, 14; 7:4-6, 8-11, 14-24; 8:1-11, 26-30, 16</h1>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the Romans can be divided into several parts. The first part is from chapter 1 through 5:11. The second part is from 5:12 through the end of chapter 8. The third section is from chapter 9 through chapter 11. The fourth section is from chapter 12 through the end of the book. The first two sections deal with man&rsquo;s need for God&rsquo;s redemption and deliverance through Christ, respectively. The third section speaks of the divine grace in God&rsquo;s selection. The fourth section tells us how to act in accordance with our redemption and deliverance.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION AND DELIVERANCE</h2>
<p>The first section of Romans speaks of God&rsquo;s redemption, and the second part deals with God&rsquo;s deliverance in Christ. We have to see the difference between redemption and deliverance. Redemption is something done by God in Christ for us, yet it is outside of us. Deliverance, on the other hand, is accomplished by God in Christ not only for us but also within us. Hence, redemption is objective, whereas deliverance is subjective.</p>
<p>God accomplished redemption for us and delivers us because we have two great problems. First, we have many sins, that is, sinful deeds, before God. As a consequence of our committing these sins, we are condemned by God according to His righteous and holy law (cf. Rom. 3:23). Our sinful deeds, however, are not our only problem before God. Our other problem is that we are sinners with the sinful nature. Not only do we commit sins; we ourselves possess the sinful nature and are therefore sinners. Because of our two great problems, God had to do two things for us. First, He had to redeem us from the law; He had to do something for us so that the requirements of His righteous and holy law would be met and He could release us from it. God in Christ accomplished redemption on the cross. On the cross Christ bore all our sins and died for us. All the requirements of God&rsquo;s law have been met by the redeeming death of Christ (Matt. 5:17; Rom. 10:4; Heb. 9:14; 1 Pet. 1:19). Because of Christ&rsquo;s redeeming death, we have been redeemed and released from the condemnation of God&rsquo;s righteous and holy law (Gal. 4:5). When we heard these glad tidings, the Holy Spirit worked within us and imparted faith into us, causing us to believe in Christ&rsquo;s redeeming death and receive Christ as our Savior (Rom. 10:17, 14). When we believed into Christ, we were justified by God (Acts 13:39) through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, who died on the cross to redeem us from the condemnation of God&rsquo;s law. We are no longer under God&rsquo;s condemnation; we are justified by God (Rom. 5:18). This is redemption (3:24; 5:1).</p>
<p>We have been justified by God and are therefore no longer under God&rsquo;s condemnation according to His righteous and holy law. Even though our problem of sins has been solved, we have a second problem&mdash;we possess the sinful nature. In order to deliver us from the sinful nature, God has to do something further. It is not enough for Him to redeem us; He must also deliver us in Christ from the sinful nature. Whereas His redemption is objective to us, His delivering us is subjective and more vital and important to us in our experience. Suppose that there were no deliverance to accompany our redemption by God. If there were only the redemption of God, there would be no way for us ever to be delivered from the sinful nature that is within us. Although we could be justified by God, we could never be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God (8:29). Hence, we must not only be redeemed and thereby rescued from the condemnation of God&rsquo;s righteous law; we must also be delivered from our sinful nature, our natural man, and be conformed to the image of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN ADAM, IN CHRIST, IN THE FLESH,<br />
AND IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The second section of Romans presents four very important figures. The first figure is Adam, who is presented in Romans 5, especially beginning from verse 12. Chapter 6 presents the second figure, Christ. The third figure, presented in chapter 7, is the flesh. The fourth figure is the Spirit, whom we see in chapter 8. If we add the preposition <em>in</em> before each of these figures, we have four <em>in</em>s which could be considered as headings for these four chapters in Romans: &ldquo;in Adam&rdquo; (ch. 5), &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo; (ch. 6), &ldquo;in the flesh&rdquo; (ch. 7), and &ldquo;in the Spirit&rdquo; (ch. 8). These four figures also form two pairs that oppose one another: Christ versus Adam and the Spirit versus the flesh. Christ solves the problem of Adam, and the Spirit is the only One who can solve the problem of the flesh.</p>
<p>What does the flesh have to do with Adam, and what does the Spirit have to do with Christ? We can begin to answer these questions by asking another pair of questions: Where is Adam today, and where is Christ today? These questions should cause us to begin to realize that the flesh has something to do with Adam and that the Spirit has something to do with Christ. Adam is in the flesh, and the flesh is the expression, the very living, of Adam. In other words, the flesh is the reality of Adam lived out through us. Likewise, Christ is in the Holy Spirit, and the Spirit is the manifestation of Christ. Expressed differently, the Spirit is the reality of Christ manifested, lived out, by us and through us. The reality of the fifth chapter of Romans is therefore in the seventh, and the reality of the sixth chapter is in the eighth. Romans 5 gives a record of sinful Adam, but we must look to chapter 7 to see the reality and living of Adam. In the same way, although Romans 6 gives a record of Christ, we must go to the eighth chapter to find the reality of Christ&mdash;the Spirit. Hence, the reality of Adam is in the flesh, and the reality of Christ is in the Spirit.</p>
<p>The more we live in the flesh, the more we will manifest Adam. If we see a person live in the flesh from morning to evening, we are actually seeing Adam from morning to evening, for to live in the flesh is to manifest Adam. By the same token, the more we live in the Spirit, the more we express and manifest Christ. If we live in the Spirit, people will see Christ within us and upon us. In principle, if we simply live in the Holy Spirit, we will be conformed to the image of Christ and transformed into the likeness of Christ, and we will manifest Christ in our daily living (Rom. 8:29; 2 Cor. 3:18; Phil. 1:20).</p><h2 class="head1">DELIVERANCE BEING REALIZED IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We are redeemed and justified by God, yet if there is the redemption and justification of God and nothing more, God remains outside of us. In addition to being redeemed by God, God Himself in Christ as the Spirit has come into us. This is why at the end of the second section of Romans, we find the phrases &ldquo;Christ is in you,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Spirit of God dwells in you,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you&rdquo; (8:10, 9, 11). When Christ delivers us, the God who redeemed us is no longer only objective to us. Rather, the God who redeemed us becomes the subjective God to us. He is now not only the God in the heavens but the God in us. God is now able to come into us in Christ as the Spirit. Now we are mingled with God as one. He as the Spirit can bear witness with our spirit (v. 6). His Spirit and our spirit&mdash;two spirits&mdash;can be joined as one (1 Cor. 6:17). Deliverance is in the Spirit; it can never be realized outside the Spirit.</p>
<p>We must learn how to realize God&rsquo;s deliverance in the Spirit. This is the central point I would like to fellowship with you. Deliverance is not in teaching or correction; it is in the Spirit. The book of Romans stresses the point that God the Spirit is now in our spirit to be the living deliverance to us. If we are going to realize the deliverance of God, we must be in the Spirit, know the law of the Spirit of life, know how to walk according to the mingled spirit, and know how to cooperate with the Spirit (8:2, 4-6, 14).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Inheritances in Adam and in Christ</h2>
<p>Now let us see this matter of our deliverance in greater detail. All children inherit certain things from their parents. As those who are the sons of Adam and who are in Adam, we have inherited primarily two things&mdash;sin and death (5:12; 1 Cor. 15:22). Sin is under the condemnation of God, and it always brings in death (Rom. 6:23). Because we are sinners and are sinful, we are under death and are doomed to eventually die. Not only so, the Bible tells us that we are dead already (Eph. 2:1, 5). Hence, as those who are the descendants of Adam and who are in Adam, we are sinners and we are sinful. Moreover, we are under death, we are dead, and we are going to die. The two main items in our inheritance from Adam are sin and death.</p>
<p>Just as in Adam we receive a certain inheritance, in Christ also we gain an inheritance. Christ is versus Adam. Accordingly, our inheritance in Christ is versus our inheritance in Adam. Whereas in Adam we inherit sin, in Christ we inherit righteousness (Rom. 5:12, 19); and whereas in Adam we inherit death, in Christ we inherit life (1 Cor. 15:22; Rom. 5:18). Righteousness is versus sin, and life is versus death. Righteousness brings us redemption, and life brings us deliverance from the sinful nature. We are now redeemed by Christ as our righteousness and delivered by Christ as our life. We must realize that we are not redeemed by the righteousness of Christ. Rather, we are redeemed by Christ Himself as our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30; Jer. 23:6). In like manner, we are delivered by Christ as our life. In Christ we inherit righteousness and life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Transferred from Adam into Christ</h2>
<p>Because we are born as humans, we are in Adam. We are transferred out of Adam into Christ by death and resurrection. By death we are able to be transferred out of Adam, and by resurrection we are enabled to be transferred into Christ. We could say that by death we &ldquo;died out of Adam&rdquo; and by resurrection we were &ldquo;raised up into Christ.&rdquo; Our transfer from the realm of Adam into the realm of Christ can be accomplished only by a process of death and resurrection.</p>
<p>How then can we die and be raised up? To die and be raised up is not a simple or small matter. Here we have to see something wonderful. Both this death and this resurrection have been accomplished by Christ. If we are united with Christ and are identified with Him, what He experienced in the past will be our experience, our history. Once we become united and identified with Christ, we have a long history. Once we are in Christ, our background involves far more than it did before we were in Christ. Since we are now in Him, we must realize that we were crucified on the cross outside of Jerusalem, buried in a tomb, and resurrected from death and the grave. What Christ experienced is now your history. His history is your history. When He died on the cross, you died in Him. When He was buried, you were buried in Him. When He resurrected, you resurrected in Him. You are in Him. You are united with Him. You are identified with Him. Because this is the fact, the apostle Paul could proclaim that &ldquo;our old man has been crucified with Him,&rdquo; that &ldquo;we have been buried...with Him,&rdquo; and that God has &ldquo;raised us up together with Him&rdquo; (Rom. 6:6, 4, cf. 8-9a; Eph. 2:6). In Christ, we have been crucified, buried, and resurrected. We need to have the vision, the revelation, that this fact has been completed in Christ. If you realize this fact by seeing it in the Scriptures, this will be a standing for you from which nothing and no one will be able to move you. Always reckon that you have died, been buried, and resurrected. Be assured that what has happened to Christ has happened to you as well. Take this fact as your standing.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s history being our history can be rather hard for our natural mind to understand. When I was in my twenties, I read these things in Romans but was not able to understand them. I said to the Lord, &ldquo;You died on the cross nineteen hundred years ago. How is it possible that I could have died then too?&rdquo; Although at first I could not understand this, one day the Lord opened my eyes. It is quite simple. Today it is possible for events that take place in America to be seen on television in the Far East at the same moment they take place. This is possible because of electricity. We could say that the Spirit is like the electricity in this illustration. It is in the Spirit that things which happened long ago can be realized by us today. According to the illustration, the events that are recorded in America can also be stored by electronic means and then be retrieved and played back in the Far East many years later. In the same way, all the things wrought by Christ so long ago can be transmitted to us in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>With the Holy Spirit there is no problem of space or time. Whether or not we experience Christ&rsquo;s history depends upon whether or not we are in the Holy Spirit. If we are in the Holy Spirit, the death and resurrection of Christ will be very real to us. This is because these facts are transmitted to us by and in the Spirit. It is only in the Spirit that we can realize the reality of the death and resurrection of Christ. Just as it is impossible for people in the Far East to see the things that happen in the United States without electricity and television, it is impossible for us to experience the reality of the death and resurrection of Christ without the Spirit. Just as electricity makes viewing distant events natural and easy, the Holy Spirit makes everything that Christ has experienced our history, our story. The day that I saw this vision, I was very happy. I said to the Lord, &ldquo;O Lord, now I know that I am in You. I am one with You. What You have experienced is my history. You died, and I died. You resurrected, and I resurrected. Now by Your death and resurrection I am out of Adam and in Christ.&rdquo; This is the practical experience of Romans 5 and 6.</p><h2 class="head2">Dead to the Law</h2>
<p>It is a fact that we are no longer in Adam but in Christ. However, we must realize that our history is very complicated. In our history, in addition to the cross of Christ and the death and resurrection of Christ, there is the history of Moses. Moses was the law-giver. Through him the law of God was given (John 1:17). Adam gave us sin and death, and Christ gives us righteousness and life. But between Adam and Christ, there was another man named Moses, through whom the law was given.</p>
<p>The law is a complication. Although the law of God is very good, we need to forget about it. I have the boldness to tell you to forget about the law of God because according to God&rsquo;s Word it has nothing to do with us and is in fact foreign to us as believers (Rom. 6:6; 7:4; Gal. 2:19). We have been brought out of Adam and are now in Christ. Anything that is outside of Christ we should not try to touch. Since the law is something that is outside of Christ, we should not try to touch it.</p>
<p>Forgetting about the law, however, is not so simple. The fact of the matter is that although we may try to forget about it, we simply cannot do it. Perhaps we were able to forget about it yesterday, but today someone may come to us and remind us that according to the law we must love our neighbor. Such a teaching causes us to remember the law. We ourselves often remind ourselves of the law. Our prayer to the Lord in the morning may bring us back to the law. We may pray for the Lord to help us keep such laws as doing good, honoring our parents, submitting to our husband, and loving our wife. You may remind me that such laws were taught by the apostle Paul. But I in turn would remind you that while Paul tells the children to obey their parents, he tells them to do it &ldquo;in the Lord&rdquo; (Eph. 6:1). Whether it is obeying our parents, loving our wife, or submitting to our husband, we must never do these things outside of Christ. Rather, we must do them in Christ, in the realm of Christ. Today the biggest problem with us is the problem of trying to keep the law.</p>
<p>There is one thing in my life that is particularly difficult for me to overcome&mdash;my being proud or my tendency to look down on others. Pride is my most difficult problem. When I was in my late twenties, every day I prayed to the Lord that He would help me to be humble. Nevertheless, I would always have to repent to the Lord for my pride and ask His forgiveness. Morning after morning, day after day, I petitioned the Lord concerning my pride. Yet sometimes, even immediately after breakfast, I would have to repent to the Lord for my pride. Sometimes I would pray, &ldquo;Lord, I was proud again just now after breakfast. I looked down on the brothers. Forgive me. Lord, help me to not be proud from now until noon.&rdquo; But my experience proved that the Lord never helped me in this regard. Not only did He never answer my prayer, He frequently sent someone to me to arouse my pride. Sometimes I was successful in not being proud until nearly noon and would happily tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, there are only several minutes left until noon. With Your help I will be successful.&rdquo; But before I had finished uttering such a prayer, a very peculiar brother would come to me, and my pride would be stirred up. Soon I realized that I could not help myself and that I would never have success in the matter of pride. My story was one of failure instead of success. Although I always tried, I always failed. Then one day when I was reading Romans, the Lord showed me that we are dead not only to sin but also to the law. Romans 7:4 says, &ldquo;You also have been made dead to the law.&rdquo; Dead persons are neither able to commit sin nor able to keep the law. Keeping the law is not the duty of dead people. There is no obligation for dead people to keep the law, because, being dead, they have nothing to do with the law. Dead persons have nothing to do with sin and nothing to do with the law. The day that the Lord spoke to me in this verse, my eyes were opened. I praised the Lord that I had died not only to sin but also to the law.</p>
<p>According to Romans 7, whenever we try to keep the law, that is an indication that we are exercising our self and are still living in the flesh. In other words, it means that we have forgotten that we are dead. Always remember that if you are trying to keep the law, you are in the flesh, which means that sin will revive and you will die (v. 9). While it is good to die in the sense that we have died with Christ (6:6), it is not good to die as a result of sin reviving. Whenever you try to keep the law and live in the flesh, sin will revive and will fight with you. Sin will always overcome you and make you a captive (7:23). The Lord has to open our eyes so that we can see that we are dead persons who have nothing to do with sin and the law. Such a death has released us not only from sin but also from the law.</p>
<p>By death and resurrection, we came out of Adam and are now in Christ. Not only so, we have nothing to do with the law. Never try to keep the law. Just remember that you have died and resurrected with Christ and that now the Spirit of the Lord lives within your spirit. Simply follow Him, walk with Him, and get in line with Him. Then the strongest, most powerful law, the law of the Spirit of life within you, will take care of you and will bring the victory to you.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING CONFORMED<br />
TO THE IMAGE OF CHRIST BY COOPERATING WITH THE INDWELLING SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 5:20; 6:14; 7:4-11; 8:2-11, 16, 26-30, 37</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we continue the fellowship that we began in the previous chapter. Let us first read some verses that will be a foundation to our fellowship.</p>
<p>And the law entered in alongside that the offense might abound; but where sin abounded, grace has super-abounded. (Rom. 5:20)</p>
<p>For sin will not lord it over you, for you are not under the law but under grace. (6:14)</p>
<p>So then, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ so that you might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God. For when we were in the flesh, the passions for sins, which acted through the law, operated in our members to bear fruit to death. But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, so that we serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter. (7:4-6)</p>
<p>Please notice the phrase <em>the law entered in alongside</em> in 5:20. This means that the law came in alongside, or in addition to, Adam and Christ. Romans 6:14 goes on to tell us that we are not under the law. Then in 7:4-6, we encounter two more thoughts: being dead to the law and having been discharged from the law. We must remember the following four sentences: &ldquo;The law entered in alongside Adam and Christ&rdquo;; &ldquo;we are not under the law&rdquo;; &ldquo;we are dead to the law&rdquo;; and &ldquo;we are discharged from the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What then shall we say? Is the law sin? Absolutely not! But I did not know sin except through the law; for neither did I know coveting, except the law had said, &ldquo;You shall not covet.&rdquo; But sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, worked out in me coveting of every kind; for without the law sin is dead. And I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died. And the commandment, which was unto life, this very commandment was found to me to be unto death. For sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me. (7:7-11)</p>
<p>For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death. For that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit. For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit. For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace. Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be. And those who are in the flesh cannot please God. But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him. But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness. And if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you. (8:2-11)</p>
<p>The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God. (v. 16)</p>
<p>Moreover, in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness, for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. But He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to God. And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose. Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers; and those whom He predestinated, these He also called; and those whom He called, these He also justified; and those whom He justified, these He also glorified. (vv. 26-30)</p>
<p>But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us. (v. 37)</p><h2 class="head1">DEAD TO THE LAW</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter, we learned that in Romans chapters 5 through 8 there are four important figures: Adam, Christ, the flesh, and the Spirit. We also saw that these chapters speak much concerning a matter that is quite troublesome to many believers&mdash;the law, which was given through Moses.</p>
<p>We must realize that according to Romans 5:20, the law is something that came in alongside Adam and Christ. The word <em>alongside</em> indicates that something is not in the original plan but is in addition to it. Besides Adam and Christ, there is the law. Romans 7:6 tells us that in Christ we are no longer under the law. In light of this truth, I have the boldness to tell you to forget about the law. Do not remember it or pay any attention to it. We have been made dead to the law (v. 4), and we have been discharged from it as well. We have been discharged from the law much like an employee is discharged from an employer. If we have been discharged by an employer, and he tells us to do something for him, we can rightfully deny him his request because we have been discharged from him. We must see that since the law is something that came in alongside, in Christ we are no longer under the law. We no longer have anything to do with the law, for we have been made dead to it and have been discharged from it. We must nevermore be employed by the law.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the enemy, Satan, always bothers us with the law. It is not simple for us to forget about the law. Even if we try our best to forget the law, the enemy always tries his best to remind us of it. Although you may have read in the previous chapter that we are dead to the law, that we have been discharged from the law, and that we therefore have nothing to do with the law, what has been your attitude toward the law? Can you really say that you have had nothing to do with the law? I am afraid that you are still very involved with the law&mdash;not only the law given to us through Moses but the law that you have made for yourself. Moses is not the only law-giver; we too are law-givers. We are the strongest proponents of the law. The laws that we give ourselves&mdash;to be humble, to love our neighbors, to love the Lord more&mdash;are good laws. Yet we must realize that such laws are troublesome and will in fact take us nowhere. We need to arrive at the destination of being conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God, but the law is not the &ldquo;train&rdquo; that will take us there. We have to get off the wrong &ldquo;train&rdquo; and board another &ldquo;train.&rdquo; What is the other &ldquo;train&rdquo;? At the time we were saved, we received the living Christ as our personal Savior. At that time, He came into our spirit. Christ as the Spirit is now dwelling within our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:11). This indwelling Christ as the Spirit is the &ldquo;train&rdquo; which will bring us to our destination. We must forget about the law and instead have fellowship with the Spirit, go along with the Spirit, and align ourselves with Him. Forget about the law. Do not follow it anymore. You have been discharged from the law, so you should no longer think and behave as if you continue to be employed by it. We have nothing to do with the law. Instead, we have everything to do with the living Spirit who indwells us.</p>
<p>Many times, the enemy comes to us under the guise of a &ldquo;good angel&rdquo; (cf. 2 Cor. 11:14). As such, he may suggest to us that we should love the brothers, do good, and try to have a right way of living. In other words, he gives us laws. Although these laws are apparently good, do not believe that they are from the Holy Spirit. They are from the enemy. You should therefore have the boldness to resist them. Whenever the thought comes to you that you should love the brothers or be humble, you must right away say, &ldquo;Satan, go away! I do not accept any word from you.&rdquo; Forget about all the good doings, and forget about all the laws. Instead, keep in line with the Holy Spirit and in the fellowship and presence of the Lord. Tell the enemy, &ldquo;I do not understand what it is to be humble or proud. I do not understand what it is to do good or to do evil. Such things are a foreign language to me. In my &lsquo;country,&rsquo; such things do not exist. In my &lsquo;country&rsquo; the only thing is Christ. The only thing is the Holy Spirit. I do not receive any foreign things&mdash;things not of my &lsquo;country.&rsquo; I receive things only of this &lsquo;country,&rsquo; and all the things of this &lsquo;country&rsquo; must be, and are, Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even if you try by yourself to keep the law of being humble, you will be proud. Although you may be humble outwardly, you will be proud within. You may say to yourself, &ldquo;Although the worldly people are too proud, I am humble.&rdquo; In this light, it is not good to be humble or to love others as a result of striving to keep the law. When you go along with the Holy Spirit and remain in fellowship with the Lord, you will not know what it is to be humble or proud or to be loving or full of hate. You will simply know that you are going along with the Lord in the Spirit. If you take this way, you will be very humble unconsciously. Others may see your humility, but you will not sense it in yourself. All that you will feel is that you are living in Christ. Then you will declare, &ldquo;I do not understand what it is to love, and I do not understand what it is to be humble. I only understand that I am contacting Christ moment by moment.&rdquo; Christ will be your love, and Christ will be your humility. This is the right &ldquo;train&rdquo; to be on. This is what Romans 5&mdash;8 tells us. We are not under the law; we are dead to it. We are living to God in fellowship with Christ in the Spirit (Rom. 6:10; Gal. 2:19).</p><h2 class="head1">BEING CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF CHRIST<br />
VERSUS KEEPING THE LAW</h2>
<p>In the Christian life there are two things that are very different from each other. One is keeping the law; the other is being conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:28-29). Of these two things, only the latter is the eternal purpose of God (Eph. 1:5). The eternal purpose of God&mdash;His mind, His eternal thought&mdash;is not that we would keep the law. Even if we were able to keep the law perfectly, keeping the law would still not be the eternal purpose of God. The law is at best something that is only &ldquo;alongside&rdquo; God&rsquo;s intention. God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is that we would be conformed to the image of His Son so that His only begotten Son would become the firstborn Son among many brothers. Originally, God had only one Son, the only begotten Son (John 1:18). But His intention, His eternal purpose, is to produce many sons so that His only begotten Son would become the Firstborn among many sons.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have been a Christian for many years. What is your general idea of what it means to be a Christian? Is it your idea that the meaning of being a Christian is to be a person who keeps the law and does good in order to please God? Or is a Christian a person who needs to be conformed to the image of Christ? According to typical Christian thought, a &ldquo;good Christian&rdquo; is actually a Christian who keeps the law. In other words, if you are trying to be a &ldquo;good Christian,&rdquo; in actuality you are not trying to be a man of Christ but a good man of Moses. If this is your case, in regard to your living you are a Christian in name only, for in reality you are trying to be something else.</p>
<p>Before we came into the recovery, very few among us would have been able to declare the following: &ldquo;I have been regenerated by God for the purpose of being conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God. Therefore, I have nothing to do with the law and desire instead to stay in line with the Holy Spirit, for it is only in this way that I will be conformed day by day into His image.&rdquo; Most of us could have said only that as those who had been saved by God, our duty was to be good Christians who did good and kept the law. May the Lord open our eyes to see that the eternal purpose of God is not that we would do our best to keep the law. We must give up this thought. The eternal purpose of God is that we be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<p>I wish that in the course of this chapter I could remind you thousands of times to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God. But I am afraid that even after so many reminders, you will forget everything after you put down this book. I fear that even after I contrast keeping the law and being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s image, tomorrow morning you will kneel down to pray, &ldquo;Lord, this is a new day. I do not want to be wrong anymore. I wish to do right. I wish to do good. I wish to be humble and nice to my spouse. Lord, help me do all these things.&rdquo; If you pray in such a way, it shows that instead of being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s image, you are trying to be a good man of Moses. Years ago I prayed similar prayers day after day because I had not received the vision of conformation. Even today I am sometimes drawn back to the old deceit by the enemy. We must cease praying in such a way. To pray in this way is to live according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead of by the tree of life. Rather than trying to keep the law, we need to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING CONFORMED TO CHRIST&rsquo;S IMAGE<br />
BY KNOWING THE INDWELLING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>How then can we be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God? The way is very simple. The Spirit of the Son of God is now in us (Rom. 8:9). We need to stop trying to keep the law and stop trying to do good. Be simple. Simply keep yourself in contact with the Spirit who indwells you. Simplify the whole situation by realizing that the Spirit of the Son of God dwells, works, and acts within you all the time. Simplify the situation by no longer trying to do good and trying to be a good Christian. Simplify yourself to just one item: knowing the indwelling Spirit of Christ and keeping in contact with Him moment by moment. To take this way is to take the tree of life (cf. Gen. 2:9). The tree of the knowledge of good and evil is complicated, for with it there are many things, including good, evil, death, and knowledge. The tree of life, however, is simple, for with it there is only one thing&mdash;life. The tree of life is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself as the Spirit (John 14:6; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17).</p>
<p>The more we simplify things, the better. We even need to forget about all the teachings we have heard in the past. It would be good if we could simplify our prayer. Instead of praying that the Lord would help us keep the law and do good, it would be good if every night, we were to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I praise You. You are my life. You are my all. Now You are in my spirit. How great this is, Lord! The Spirit, who is Your reality, now dwells within me. Now I am going to bed, and I know that You are going with me.&rdquo; Then the next morning, it would be wonderful to offer some praises and thanks to the Lord: &ldquo;Lord, here I am. I know that You are in my heart and spirit. I appreciate Your presence, Lord. I am in You and You are in me. O Lord, how wonderful this is. What a joy and blessing! Lord, I worship You. Thank You, Lord. Hallelujah!&rdquo; This is the best way to pray in the evening and in the morning. I am not giving you another law or a different law. Rather, I am telling you to make the Christian life simpler. Simply know the indwelling Spirit of Christ and remain in contact with Him moment by moment. Rather than doing a lot of things to complicate ourselves, let us pay attention to the working of the Holy Spirit within us. Aspects of this work can be seen in a number of verses in Romans 8.</p><h2 class="head2">The Law of the Spirit of Life</h2>
<p>Romans 8:2 says that the law of the Spirit of life has freed us in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death. The only thing we have to do for the law of the Spirit of life within us to operate is to &ldquo;switch it on&rdquo; in much the same way that we would switch on a light. Have we not been saved? Is not the Spirit within us? Why then would we not be simple enough just to &ldquo;switch on&rdquo; the law of the Spirit of life within us? With a lamp there is the current of electricity. In order to appropriate that current and cause the lamp to shine, there is no need for us to do anything beyond simply switching on the lamp. It is the same with the law of the Spirit of life. There is nothing for us to do except &ldquo;switch it on&rdquo; and never &ldquo;switch it off.&rdquo; If we are going to visit a brother, we need to learn to tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I praise You that You are within my spirit. That is good enough. Now I am going to visit my brother. I know that Your presence goes with me.&rdquo; Then as we talk with the brother, the Lord will be with us, and we will talk, fellowship, and act in the mingled spirit.</p>
<p>The law of the Spirit of life within us is very powerful. We can illustrate this with the law of gravity. When we throw something into the air, it comes down naturally because of the law of gravity. There is no need for us to struggle to bring down an object that we have thrown upward; the law of gravity will bring it down for us. The law of gravity is so powerful that an airplane needs much power to overcome it. If the law of gravity is strong, how much stronger must the law of the Spirit of life be? The law of the Spirit of life sets us free from the law of sin. Although the law of sin is strong, the law of the Spirit of life is more powerful. If we simply follow the Lord and go along with Him, the law of the Spirit of life will work powerfully for us. All we must do is &ldquo;switch it on.&rdquo; Whatever we need, whether humility or love, the almighty, omnipotent Christ will supply us. If we live in this reality, our Christian life will be very simple. It is possible for us to be a powerful Christian. The most powerful Christian is the simplest one. The most complicated Christian, however, is the weakest. Make yourself simple by &ldquo;switching on&rdquo; the law of the Spirit of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Mind of the Spirit</h2>
<p>Romans 8:27 speaks of the &ldquo;mind of the Spirit.&rdquo; When we align ourselves with the Holy Spirit, our mind is filled up by the Spirit and controlled by the Spirit. As a result, our mind will become a mind of the Spirit. However, sometimes our mind is not a mind of the Spirit but is instead a mind of trying to do good&mdash;a &ldquo;mind of love&rdquo; or a &ldquo;mind of humility.&rdquo; With such a mind, we try our best to do good, to love others, and to be humble. Instead of having such a mind, however, our mind must be a mind of the Spirit. Nothing but the Spirit should control and direct our mind. Our mind must be under the control, the direction, of the Holy Spirit. This results in our mind becoming the mind of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Romans 8:6 says that the mind set on the spirit is life and peace. When our mind is occupied by and filled with the Holy Spirit, life and peace fills our entire being. Within, we will sense that there is life and that everything is living, satisfying, and full of light. Moreover, there will be peace, comfort, and joy. When our mind is occupied, directed, and controlled by the Spirit, we will experience and sense the reality of life and peace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Leading of the Spirit</h2>
<p>Romans 8:14 says, &ldquo;For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.&rdquo; We need to be led by the Holy Spirit. Rather than making any kind of decision to do this or that, we should simply sense the Spirit&rsquo;s leading and follow the Spirit as He leads us from within.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Witnessing of the Spirit</h2>
<p>Romans 8:16 speaks of the Spirit witnessing with our spirit. It is not only that the Spirit witnesses and our spirit witnesses also. Rather, it is that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. This indicates that our spirit must take the initiative to witness first; then the Spirit will witness with our spirit. The fact that the word <em>our</em> is used in reference to the human spirit reveals that the Spirit of God today, the all-inclusive Spirit of the Triune God, dwells in our regenerated human spirit and works in our spirit. These two spirits are one; they live together, work together, and exist together as one mingled spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Help of the Spirit</h2>
<p>Romans 8:26 says, &ldquo;Moreover, in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness, for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.&rdquo; We may not know how to pray, but the Holy Spirit knows. Because He knows, He helps us pray. What we say when we pray out of our own knowledge cannot come close to matching what we utter when the Holy Spirit prays within us. When the Holy Spirit prays within us, He intercedes with unutterable groanings within our being. Such prayer has no words; it is only groaning. This is the best prayer.</p>
<p>We see that there are a number of things related to the Spirit in Romans 8. There is the law of the Spirit of life, the mind of the Spirit, the leading of the Spirit, the witnessing of the Spirit, and the help of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, causes these things to operate within us day by day. However, we must give Him the opportunity, the chance, and the ground to operate in such a way. If we try to keep the law and do good, the Holy Spirit will be disturbed by us, and we will interfere in His conformation work within our being. Hence, we have to cease all our doings, forget about the law, and simply give the ground, the liberty, the chance, and the opportunity to the Holy Spirit to let Him work in us and take care of us. Then we will sense the life and the peace.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF THE INDWELLING SPIRIT&rsquo;S WORK&mdash;<br />
CONFORMATION</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s goal, His ultimate aim, is to conform us to the image of Christ. His goal is not simply that we go along with the Holy Spirit and sense life and peace; He desires that we be conformed gradually, and eventually completely, to the image of Christ. Because we need to be conformed to the image of Christ, there is the need not only for the Spirit within us but also for many things outside of us. Romans 8:28-29 tells us that all things work together so that those who love God and are called according to His purpose can be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s image. Hence, we have the Holy Spirit within us and the &ldquo;all things&rdquo; outside of us.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>all things</em> implies all persons, all matters, and all things. All these things work together for good to us to conform us into the image of Christ. When we cook, we use water and fire. The water is within the pot, and the fire is outside the pot. In this illustration, we are the pot, the Holy Spirit is the water, and &ldquo;all things,&rdquo; including our spouse, children, and circumstances, are the fire. The Lord knows just what level of fire we need, whether low, medium, or high. In other words, the Lord knows our need and measures &ldquo;all things&rdquo; to us accordingly. Never complain about your environment. Do not think that your wife is not the best one. Actually, she is the wife you need and is therefore the best one. The Lord will measure all these things to us. These things will work together for good, that is, for our conformation.</p>
<p>A brother once reported to me that through an unforeseen change in his circumstances, he was able to sit in a second class seat on the train rather than the third class seat for which he had paid. In light of this, he said to me, &ldquo;Oh, Brother Lee, praise the Lord! All things work together for good for us.&rdquo; When he said this, I inwardly knew that this brother had to learn something more concerning the &ldquo;good&rdquo; mentioned in verse 28. Some time later, the same brother was struck by an automobile as he was riding a bicycle. He was hurt to the extent that he had to go to the hospital. When he was in the hospital, he was heard saying, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! All things work together for good. If I had been riding my bicycle a little faster or slower on that day, I would be dead. But the Lord cared for my life, and I am still alive. Surely all things work together for good.&rdquo; I am afraid that many of us hold this brother&rsquo;s concept. This brother&rsquo;s concept was erroneous; he did not realize the true and accurate meaning of all things working together for good. Not many days later, when he was still in the hospital, he received light on this point and realized that his accident had been arranged by the Lord for his conformation, and he submitted himself to the Lord.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s goal in giving us &ldquo;all things&rdquo; is not that we would have comfort or profit. Rather, His goal in giving us all things is that we would be conformed to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God (v. 29). This conformation is the &ldquo;good&rdquo; that is spoken of in verse 28. The Lord has given us a wife or husband, children, parents, the brothers, our job, and our circumstances, and He causes these &ldquo;all things&rdquo; to work together for the purpose of dealing with us and causing us to be conformed to the image of Christ. This is the unique purpose, the ultimate goal, that God seeks to attain. The Holy Spirit within us and the &ldquo;all things&rdquo; outside of us work together, like the water in the pot and the fire under the pot, to conform us to the image of Christ.</p>
<p>The eternal purpose of God is not that we would be able to keep the law. Remember, the law is only something that came in alongside. The eternal purpose of God is that we would be conformed to the image of His Son that His Son would be the Firstborn among many brothers. How does God complete this work? On one hand, His Son&rsquo;s Spirit dwells within us. On the other hand, He assigns to us a certain amount of &ldquo;all things.&rdquo; These &ldquo;all things&rdquo; outside of us cooperate with the Holy Spirit within us to work together and conform us to the image of Christ. This is the way to be matured in the life of Christ.</p>
<p>Now I believe that we are impressed with a clear picture. Formerly we were in Adam; now we are in Christ. The reality of Christ, which is the Spirit of Christ, is indwelling us. Now we have nothing to do except go along with the Spirit, follow Him, and be in line with Him. The Lord is so wise. He assigns to us a certain amount of &ldquo;all things&rdquo; that cooperate with the Holy Spirit who is within us to cause us to be conformed to the image of His Son.</p>
<p>I hope that in the future, whether it be in one week or five years, we will see more of the image of Christ in one another. It would not be good if after a number of years we have only a larger mentality and a greater degree of Christian knowledge and doctrine. Rather, may we see something more of Christ in one another. Our need today is that Christ would increase and grow within us. This is what the Lord is seeking after. Let us be simple and just follow the Holy Spirit. In all the other things the Lord Himself will take care of us. Then we will be matured in the life of Christ and conformed to His image day by day.</p></body></html>
