   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Tripartite Man</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the early years of his Christian life, Watchman Nee came to see that man is composed of three parts: spirit, soul, and body 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He came to see that the soul is the personality of man; the body is the outward part of man for contacting the physical world; and the spirit is the inmost part of man for contacting the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since God is Spirit, we must worship and serve Him in our spirit Rom 1:9; John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Believers are regenerated by the Spirit of God in their spirit, the Spirit of God witnesses with their spirit Rom 8:16 , the Lord Jesus is with their spirit 2 Tim 4:22 , and they are one spirit with the Lord 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The spirit must be divided from the soul Heb 4:12 so that believers can walk, live, and work in their spirit Gal 5:16, 25 and be spiritual men 1 Cor 2:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>27.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sanctification by Faith</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some time prior to 1925, Watchman Nee came to see the matter of sanctification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He received light concerning the holiness teaching of John Wesley and said that what Wesley taught was not really holiness but sinless perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through his study he came to realize that the Brethren surpassed Wesley in their vision of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet while their teaching on holiness was accurate, it was too objective and consisted merely of a sort of positional change.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Brethren taught that gold in the world was common, while gold built into the temple was sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a further example, the Brethren taught that sheep and cattle in flocks and herds were common, but when offered upon the altar, they were sanctified Matt 23:17, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition, the Brethren illustrated sanctification by pointing out that food in the market is common, but food on the table of Christians becomes sanctified with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Watchman Nee pointed out that all these examples refer to an outward change of position, but none involves an inward dispositional change.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He taught that sanctification is not merely a positional change, but that it must also be dispositional Rom 6:19, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>28.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ as Life</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To His believing ones Christ is life Col 3:4 , and this life is the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whatever the believer does must be done out of this inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every believer should live by this divine life within Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>29.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Law of the Spirit of Life</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The divine life that believers receive from the Lord is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This divine life has its own law and characteristics, and its function is to regulate and supply us with God's divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not the mere outward letter of the law but the law of life Heb 8:10 enforced by the Spirit of God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Watchman Nee received a full revelation concerning this inner law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is by this inner law, called the law of life, that we are freed from the law of sin and death and are able to live a righteous and holy life.</S>
