   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I will say something to the young people as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In all the Gospels God requires that we love the sinners and the poor from the bottom of our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the reason the Lord said in Luke 4:18 that the poor have the gospel preached to them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this world there are many poor people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are not as poor as those who are genuinely poor.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the past we could say that we were the middle class, but there are not many people who now belong to the middle class anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are many people who are much poorer than us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we preach the gospel to them, we will find a great difference between us and them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This will make our preaching ineffective.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A Christian must learn to take the way of voluntary poverty before he can preach the gospel effectively.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to volunteer to forsake everything.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When our Lord came to preach the gospel, He became poor.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not become poor, we cannot preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today you are becoming poor for the first time for the Lord's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a sanctifying time for you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Tonight you are standing on new ground.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Building Up a Character of Giving</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A problem with human beings is our tendency to build up our preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The children of the devil walk according the desires of their heart Eph 2:3 , but, as Christians, we have to learn to break down what we once cherished.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to learn to give up what our heart loves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>People in the world are worried that they have not taken enough from the world, but we must learn to drop what we love.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We want to build up a proper Christian character gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we continually drop what we love, we will become more like a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to build up a Christian character, we have to learn to give up everything for the Lord at a young age.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to learn to say, "I give this and that up because I love the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to give away things again and again.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Learn to give everything away.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only this kind of people will be able to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Learning to Buffet the Body</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we go to the villages, we have to dress like the villagers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not say anything about their filthiness or lowliness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should be able to live in the cities as well as in the villages.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we cannot stand the villages, we are loving ourselves too much.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have disqualified ourselves from the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to preach the gospel, we have to learn to deny ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some people dare not touch the tea offered to them in the villages.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They wash and rinse the bowls that are offered to them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such ones cannot preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord cannot use anyone who is selfish or self-loving.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we think that living in the villages will wear us out, we should move back to our original place; there is no need to stay there reluctantly and claim that we are preaching the gospel for the Lord's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to learn to live in a lowly way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Budgeting Our Need and Offering Up the Rest</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who are living by their parents' income should learn to do one thing: They should find out before the Lord how much they actually need every month.</S>

   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All of your things are returned to you for your own use.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We believe that your consecration before the Lord has been accepted by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, if there are any items which your heart cherishes, you should give one or two of them to other sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is for your own good.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you have extra clothing, you can ask the church to help you to send them to Yi-Yang or Kuling.</S>

   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you do not need something, do not develop a habit of buying it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I say this because none of the things you consecrated are particularly valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The church is handing these things back to you.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You should do your best to keep this principle month by month.</S>
