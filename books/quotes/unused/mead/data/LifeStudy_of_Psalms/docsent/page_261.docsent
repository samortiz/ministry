   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE THE SAINTS' DEEPER EXPERIENCE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE IDENTIFICATION WITH CHRIST Scripture Reading: Psa 90 92</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Psalms, the most difficult book in the Bible to read and understand, is divided into five books.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Book 1 is composed of Psalms 1 through 41; Book 2, of Psalms 42 through 72; Book 3, of Psalms 73 through 89; Book 4, of Psalms 90 through 106; and Book 5, of Psalms 107 through 150.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The division of the Psalms into these five books is not according to chronological order, that is, it is not according to the time of writing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Neither is the arrangement of the books according to the nature of the teaching found in these books.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In each book there are psalms that are a mixture of the revelation concerning Christ and the complex sentiments of the psalmists, sentiments that are according to the writers' thought regarding good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this message we come to Book 4, which, like Book 3, has seventeen psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The seventeen psalms in Book 4 are in three categories.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Psalms 90 92 are in one category; Psalms 93 101 are in a second category; and Psalms 102 106 are in a third category.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is hard to say how the Psalms were divided into five books, but we can be sure that this arrangement was not made by the human mind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of course, certain persons made the arrangement, but the Spirit was also involved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the Lord showed us during our study of the Psalms in 1969, the five books of the Psalms were divided by the Spirit according to four crucial words: Christ, house, city, earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although Psalm 1 is on the law, in Psalm 2 the psalmist turns from the law to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 7 we have Jehovah's decree concerning His Son: "You are My Son;/Today I have begotten You."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that God does not care for the law but for His Son, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Psalm 27:4 we have a word concerning the house: "One thing I have asked from Jehovah; /That do I seek:/To dwell in the house of Jehovah/All the days of my life,/To behold the beauty of Jehovah,/And to inquire in His temple."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Psalm 36:8 speaks of being saturated with the fatness of God's house and of drinking of the river of His pleasures, for with Him is the fountain of life v. 9a . Psalm 46:4a says, "There is a river whose streams gladden the city of God." In Psalm 48 we find expressions such as "the city of our God" v. 1 and "the city of the great King" v. 2 . In Psalm 72, the last Psalm in Book 2, we have a word about the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 8 declares, "He will have dominion from sea to sea/And from the River unto the ends of the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Psalm 89, the last psalm in Book 3, unveils Christ as the unique Possessor of the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, in the Psalms we see Christ, the house, the city, and the earth.</S>
