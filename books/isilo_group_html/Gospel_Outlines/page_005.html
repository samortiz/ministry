<h1 class="title">THE EVIL ONE OF THE UNIVERSE&mdash;<br />
THE DEVIL, SATAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Gen. 2, 3</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The dark side of the universe<br />
<span class="normal">Disasters, disease, death, divorce, killings, murders, sufferings, wandering, smoking and drinking, gambling, whoring, corrupted hearts, disordered families, dark societies, and all kinds of corruption everywhere&mdash;these are the dark side of the universe. Originally the universe was beautiful and life was lovely. Now, however, the universe has so much darkness, misfortune, misery, and death that many even feel that living is futile; consequently, they become depressed and commit suicide. <em>Here is the point that can touch people the easiest.</em><br />
The ability of a gospel preacher is in portraying the real situation. Present all the real stories of human living in such a way that people will be moved and prepared to accept the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. Speak weightily and descriptively.</span></li>
<li>The source of darkness&mdash;Satan<br />
<span class="normal">From where did all this darkness come? Did it come from God? From men? It came neither from God nor from men but from the Devil, Satan. The Bible speaks clearly about Satan. Genesis 2 says that after man was created, God asked man to guard the garden. The reason the garden needed to be guarded was that someone was coming. In Genesis 3 that one came&mdash;the subtle one, the evil one.<br />
He is the adversary of God. Often he transmutes himself into something that looks good and hides himself there. (Anything that looks good has Satan hidden in it.)</span></li>
<li>The aim of Satan (his main work)<br />
<span class="normal">You need to explain how Satan opposes God, how he damages God&rsquo;s purpose and God&rsquo;s work. It has been mentioned before that he is God&rsquo;s enemy. His aim is to gain men. You need to point out that all that men do today is not by themselves. Men cannot help themselves; they are absolutely under Satan&rsquo;s control. Sin, wrongdoing, and loving the world are not of men&rsquo;s own will. Satan gains men by means of fame, position, scholarship, money, love, and business&mdash;all the good things and bad things&mdash;so that men could not help but obey Satan. (1 John 5:19, &ldquo;...the whole world lieth in the evil one.&rdquo;)</span></li>
<li>Satan&rsquo;s way of working is in two main categories
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The world.</li>
	<li>Sins.<br />
	Satan gains men by means of the world and sins.<br />
	Do not present the world and sin in the way they would be presented in meetings for new beginners, but illustrate with factual stories so that the unbelievers will understand.</li>
