   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>UNDERSTANDING THE DIVINE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I have discovered that without the proper help, it is very difficult to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The secret to understanding the Word is like a master key that opens the door of a large house.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you have the key, you can use the key to open every door in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I did not get such a key until I began to have direct personal contact with Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I began to correspond with Brother Nee in 1925, the first year of my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then in 1932 the Lord brought the two of us together.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After I had begun to serve the Lord full time, I went to see Brother Nee, and he asked me to remain there with him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During that time with him I received the key to understanding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more I stayed with Brother Nee, the more of the secret to understanding the Word I received.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before being with Brother Nee, I did not know the crucial things of the church, the Spirit, life, and identification with Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But from 1933 I began to know these crucial things, and my entire being began to be occupied with them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I found out that the church, the Spirit, life, and identification with Christ are bottomless mines.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more I have dug into these things, the deeper they have become.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have discovered that the spiritual, heavenly, and divine significances of these things in the Bible can never be exhausted.</S>
