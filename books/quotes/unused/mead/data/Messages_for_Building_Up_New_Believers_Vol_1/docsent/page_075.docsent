   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. THE MEETING FOR THE PREACHING OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fifth type of meeting may not be as crucial as the other meetings, but it is used equally by God to release His word to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If an apostle passes through our place or if we have apostles, teachers, prophets, or ministers of the word permanently residing among us, we should have a meeting for the release of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are not saying that this kind of meeting is unimportant.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are saying that this kind of meeting is the simplest of all meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A meeting where people come to listen to the word is the simplest kind of meeting, but like other meetings, there is much to be learned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not be late for the meeting and cause others to wait for you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Obey the ushers, and sit where you are told; do not choose your own seat.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you have some physical handicap in listening or seeing, explain to the ushers so that they can choose a suitable seat for you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Bring your own Bible and hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the spiritual side, your heart must be open when you come to such meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Prejudiced ones need not come to this meeting, because the word will be useless to them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a man shuts up his heart to God, he cannot expect to receive any grace from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every listener of the word should pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Half of the responsibility of a message rests with the speaker, and the other half rests with the listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is impossible for a speaker to try to deliver a message to closed hearts or to those who purposely reject the message.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The spirit, as well as the heart, needs to be open.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is important for the spirit to be open in such a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When a genuine minister of the word speaks, his spirit is open.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if he touches more open spirits in the meeting, his spirit will become strengthened when it is released.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the spirit of the meeting is stifled, indifferent, or closed, the spirit of the speaker will be like the dove outside the ark, flying around the ark only to return to it later.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The spirit of the meeting needs to be open, and the spirit of the minister needs to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more open the spirit of the meeting is, the more released the spirit of the prophet will be.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the spirit of the audience is not open, the spirit of the prophet cannot be released.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to learn to be pliable and to open up our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let the Holy Spirit be released.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not surround ourselves with cold and stubborn opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should be a plus to the meeting instead of a hindrance to the spirit of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our spirits should draw out the spirit of the speaker instead of frustrating it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If every brother and sister would learn this lesson, our meeting would become stronger and stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These are the biblical patterns of the different kinds of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to learn how to behave in every one of these five kinds of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>May God have mercy on us!</S>
