   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Concerning Man s Sin</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some heresies try to deny the matter of sin altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible clearly tells us that man has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In saying that man has sinned, the Bible means two things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, man has sinned in his conduct; this is sin in conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, man has sinned against God; this is sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both are sins in the Bible, and both are facts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some people have more agreeable dispositions, yet they are still sinful before God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Any teaching that denies these two facts of sin is a heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some have tried to prove man s sinlessness by philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Others have tried to prove it by human physiological constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christian Scientists as well as Russellites, or Jehovah s Witnesses, fall into this category of people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are heretics.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Saying that man has not sinned annuls the work of redemption and the need of a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Saying this is the same as saying that the gospel we preach is a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All those who deny the fact of man s sinfulness are heretics.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>D. Concerning Christ s Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible clearly says that our sins are washed away by the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The redemption of Christ is a biblical truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are two cardinal facts in the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first involves Christ s person, and the second involves His work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His work redeemed man through the shedding of His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The denial of either one of these two aspects is a denial of the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Concerning the redemption of Christ, man s mind has been deceived by Satan into formulating many strange and devious teachings that lead to unimaginable results.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Men try to overturn the work of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some try to overturn it by overturning the reality of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They deny the fact of man s inherent sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This nullifies the need of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Others try to overturn the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They do not recognize the redemptive nature of Christ s blood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This also nullifies the work of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second Peter 2:1 speaks of those who deny the Master who bought them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is surely heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>E. Concerning Eternal Judgment</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some people believe in the person and work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They believe in man s sinfulness and in Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But they overturn the fact of eternal judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They deny this by promulgating two kinds of teachings concerning death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, they say that a man is simply sleeping when he dies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His body is asleep and his soul is also asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Neither the body nor the soul is conscious of anything anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Lord resurrects him, he will wake up once more.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His death today is merely a gap in time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, the Lord tells us that after a man dies, he is still conscious of many things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the cross He told one of the thieves that he would be with Him in Paradise that very day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Luke 16 the Lord relates the story of Lazarus and the rich man; both went to Hades after they died.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Clearly they were conscious of many things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is true that the Bible refers to man s death as a kind of sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But this refers only to man s body; man s soul has not gone to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Men came up with this theory in order to reduce the consequences of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Second, there are those who say that the second death is not an eternal judgment but a total annihilation or perdition, in which a man ceases to exist entirely.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yet the word used in the Bible for destroy Matt 10:28 is the same as the word used for ruined in the bursting of the old wineskins 9:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The wineskins are broken and ruined, but they are still around; they have not ceased to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ said that there are those who can kill the body but not the soul 10:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He also said that in Gehenna the worm does not die and the fire is not quenched Mark 9:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A man in perdition is a man who suffers eternally in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This proves that after a man dies, he does not cease to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For any man to nullify the second death is for him to preach heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Such preaching does not honor the redemptive work of Christ.</S>
