   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN BEING CREATED WITH AN INNATE ABILITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO LOVE THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man has an innate ability to love the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are clear indications of this in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Lord Jesus began His ministry, He mostly preached the word on the mountains and in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There were no luxurious or comfortable facilities, yet people came in flocks.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When John Wesley was raised up in England, he preached on the streets.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One of Wesley s contemporaries, George Whitefield, who was considered to be more powerful than him, preached in the open fields.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In those days there were no microphones or proper facilities.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The preachers simply raised their voices and spoke loudly, and people went in crowds to listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today our speaking is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot compensate for this weakness with money, knowledge, or capability.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>People do not want our knowledge, eloquence, or capability.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, they desire the supplying word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This innate ability to love the truth was created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God created man, He put in man a longing to seek after knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why people have a desire to know about the things around them from their youth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A wise mother will not force her children to do things or punish them by beating them when she teaches them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, she will speak to them a great deal, and by her speaking, she will transfuse knowledge into them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Westerners are not necessarily better than the Chinese in educating their children, but one good point about the Westerners is that they often read a story to their children at bedtime.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, sometimes when a mother finds that her little boy is being naughty, instead of spanking him, she will read him a story.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once the boy begins to listen to the story, he calms down, behaves properly, becomes obedient, and stops being naughty.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is because within him there is a desire to obtain more knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more a child learns, the more he is happy and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>SETTING OUR HEART TO LEARN THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During my stay this time I have observed that the churches everywhere are lacking in the ministry of the word, not only in the big meetings but even more so in the small meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In a sense, our meetings abound in every aspect except the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a great shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I had stayed here for a year, I would not have let this matter go lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The truths and the riches among us are all being stored in the bookroom with no effect.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a very regrettable matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The co-workers who received my training thirty years ago and who were trained for as long as ten years have done quite a good job during all these years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the other hand, however, their ministry of the word has been merely average.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The truths and the riches given to us by the Lord have all been released, but they have been put on the shelves and are not being used.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps you may say, Oh, we use them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are all using them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to my consideration, however, using them improperly is equivalent to not using them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is similar to someone having a ball but not knowing how to use it to play a game.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the reason I encouraged hundreds of you to rise up and serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have responded, and the churches are willing to cooperate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What I am afraid of the most, however, is that you will fall into the same trap.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, I hope that you can complete at least one course of the training in the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This does not mean that when you graduate, your brain will be filled with knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, it means that you will know how to use the Lord s word, how to study the truth, and how to preach the word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This should not be too difficult for you since you are all at least college graduates.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It all depends on whether or not you set your heart on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nothing is too difficult for someone who sets his heart to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is nothing that you cannot do; it all depends upon whether or not you put your heart into it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you put your heart into something, you can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is what we mean when we say, Where there is a will, there is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The problem is that by nature man loves ease and hates work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Laziness is second nature to man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I am very concerned about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have a considerable amount of human experience, and I realize that all humans tend to be easygoing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, you should not be loose in any way during your first five years of full-time service because these are the most crucial years of your service.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You must lay hold of these five years.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What matters is not what you do but how much you learn.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The most important thing is to learn the truth and the experiences of life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You need to try to advance as quickly as possible in these two matters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For your sake I would use myself as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When I began corresponding with Brother Watchman Nee in 1925, I mostly asked him questions concerning the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It was not until 1932, when I invited him to speak in my hometown of Chefoo, that I met him for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As a result of his visit, a church was raised up in Chefoo in July of the same year.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Through the Lord s blessing, the number of saints meeting in the church exceeded a hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I had to give a message five times a week.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This forced me to drop my job and serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Afterward I went to Shanghai to see Brother Nee, and later he asked me to move to Shanghai with my whole family.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>From then on I became his co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Two years later in October of 1935, Brother Nee held a conference in Kulangsu, Amoy, which is in the province of Fukien, but I did not go with him then.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Fifteen years later in 1950, I went to the Philippines.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One of the responsible brothers there who had attended the conference in Kulangsu told me that in that conference Brother Nee had told a group of seeking saints, We have a brother, Witness Lee, whose progress in the truth and in life can be likened not just to running but to flying.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Actually, at that time I had not been satisfied with my condition.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although those of you who are serving full time have already graduated from college, you are still under thirty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Your prospects for the years ahead are bright, and you still have much potential to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, you must treasure this period of time and endeavor to enter into the truth and to learn the experiences in life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What is important now is not how much you read every day but how much you learn and enter into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You can never finish studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I have been studying the Bible for sixty and a half years, and the more I study, the more I receive, and the more I sense that there is more to study.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If time allows, I would like to have another life-study of the Bible that would be different from what we had in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Our study of the truths in the Bible will never end.</S>
