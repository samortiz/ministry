[1]  CONTENTS Being Neither Good Men Nor Evil Men but God-men Being Dead to Law but Living to God Christ Being Everything Experiencing the Reality of the Truth Only God Being Able to Satisfy Man's Inner Being Christ Being the Offerings Willing to be Broken, not Acting Independently, and Perfecting Others for the Service
[2]  This book, composed of seven messages given in 1954 by Brother Witness Lee, uses Galatians 2:19 to explain the true meaning of being dead to law but living to God.
[3]  This ushers the saints into the knowledge of Christ as everything in God's salvation so that they may go on to experience the reality of the truth, take Christ as the offerings, and have proper service.
[4]  CHAPTER ONE BEING NEITHER GOOD MEN NOR EVIL MEN BUT GOD-MEN
[5]  This means that the requirement of the law upon us as sinners is that we should die and that according to that requirement Christ died for us; hence, our obligation under the law, our relationship with the law, was terminated.
[6]  In addition to not knowing God and not having God, they have the evil power of Satan within them that incites them to sin and to do evil.
[7]  GOD DESIRING US NEITHER TO DO EVIL NOR TO DO GOOD
[8]  On the surface, it seems that it is much better to keep the law than to break the law, because it appears that breaking the law alienates us from God while keeping the law might bring us closer to God.
[9]  Galatians 2:19 says, "For I through law have died to law that I might live to God."
[10]  Then in verses 9 through 11 Paul said that he was found in Christ, not having his own righteousness which is out of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith, so that he might know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, if perhaps he might attain to the out-resurrection from the dead.
[11]  TWO GOALS AND TWO KINDS OF DEALINGS Being Dead in Relation to Law and Living in Relation to God
[12]  Galatians 2:19 says, "Died to law live to God."
[13]  To live to God is to be filled with God and to have fellowship with God by putting aside all the ordinances of our human life as well as all our hopes, resolutions, and longings, so that God can have the ground in us to reign and operate in us, thereby living in us.
[14]  If we fellowship with God day by day and allow Him to live in us moment by moment, then we are dead to law, our relationship with the law is severed, and we are living to God.
[15]  CHAPTER THREE CHRIST BEING EVERYTHING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SALVATION AND RELIGION
[16]  THE ORIGINS OF RELIGION Man Seeking for Material Blessings
[17]  THE LORD DESIRING THAT MAN GAIN HIM INSTEAD OF RELIGION
[18]  NOTHING BEING ABLE TO SATISFY US BESIDES CHRIST HIMSELF
[19]  In brief, anything that is outside of Christ yet appears to be rendering worship to God is religion.
[20]  In the universe, only Christ Himself is not religion; only Christ Himself is the salvation of God.
[21]  If our worship to God is not related to Christ, is not mingled with Christ, and is not Christ doing it with us from within, then it is religion.
[22]  The real worship to God is the Christ who is in us, who puts us upon Himself, and who fills us with Himself, worshipping God with us.
[23]  CHAPTER FOUR EXPERIENCING THE REALITY OF THE TRUTH SPIRITUAL REALITY BEING THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN US
[24]  We may have listened to very good messages and may have a thorough understanding of the truth, but what we have gained is merely the understanding of spiritual matters and the knowledge of spiritual truth, not the spiritual reality itself.
[25]  OUR FAITH BEING A MATTER NOT OF BEHAVIOR BUT OF LIFE
[26]  After we hear a certain truth and before we have the spiritual reality, we may think that we already have it.
[27]  CHAPTER FIVE ONLY GOD BEING ABLE TO SATISFY MAN'S INNER BEING CHRIST BEING ALL
[28]  Colossians 2:9-10 says, "For in Him Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and you have been made full in Him, who is the Head of all rule and authority."
[29]  First it says that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily; then it says that we who belong to Christ have been made full in Christ.
[30]  RELIGIOUS CULTIVATION BEING UNABLE TO SATISFY MAN'S INNER EMPTINESS
[31]  In the same way, God's intention in man is to mingle Himself with man and to fill man with Himself, thereby producing a God-man, one who is not only man but also God, not only God but also man.
[32]  CHAPTER SIX CHRIST BEING THE OFFERINGS THE OFFERINGS BEING FOR ENJOYMENT AND MINGLING
[33]  Christ as the tabernacle is for us to experience and to pass through; Christ as the offerings is for us to enjoy that we may gain Him and become one with Him.
[34]  This is because Christ wants us not only to be joined to Him and to pass through Him but also to receive Him into us.
[35]  First, we are not for God; second, our living and conduct are not acceptable to God; third, there is no peace between God and us; fourth, our very being is sin, and we ourselves are just sin; and fifth, we have wronged and transgressed against both God and man.
[36]  The trespass offering, the last of the five kinds of offerings, denotes the Lord Jesus who bore our sins.
[37]  All our sins including lying, coveting, and all other actions by which we offend either God or man were borne for us by the Lord Jesus.
[38]  Moreover, Christ became God's food to satisfy God's need; He also became our food to satisfy our need.
[39]  God is fully satisfied in Christ, and we too are fully satisfied in Christ.
[40]  We have a sense that Christ is so good and so precious and that He is our peace, our reconciliation, and our acceptance to God.
[41]  At this moment he will see that just as Christ was absolutely for God, he also ought to be for God; just as Christ offered Himself to live for God, he also ought to present himself as a living sacrifice.
[42]  THE RESULTS OF EXPERIENCING THE FIVE KINDS OF OFFERINGS
[43]  The children of Israel first offered the trespass offering, the sin offering, and then the peace offering, the meal offering, and the burnt offering.
[44]  He put everything to death, giving up His all on the cross for God, so we also must be like Him, putting our all on the altar to live for God.
[45]  CHAPTER SEVEN WILLING TO BE BROKEN, NOT ACTING INDEPENDENTLY, AND PERFECTING OTHERS FOR THE SERVICE SERVICE BEING THE ISSUE OF THE GROWTH IN LIFE
[46]  The service that we have before the Lord is the issue of our growth in the spiritual life.
[47]  THE SERVING ONES NEEDING TO KNOW THE WAY OF THE CROSS AND TO RECEIVE THE BREAKING OF THE CROSS
[48]  Today many do not know the way of the cross, they do not know what the breaking of the soul means, and they do not understand what it means for the flesh to be dealt with.
