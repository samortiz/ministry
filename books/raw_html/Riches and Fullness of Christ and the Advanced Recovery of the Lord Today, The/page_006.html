This all-inclusiveness and limitlessness of Christ become the riches of Christ. Unfortunately, our time was too short, and we did not cover the matter thoroughly. Nevertheless, we need to remember that the person and the nature of Christ, all that He has experienced, all His works, and all that He has attained and obtained are all-inclusive and limitless. In His work, He has solved the problem of sin, Satan, the self, the flesh, the old creation, the world, and all the negative things in the universe. All these have been taken care of by Him. Positively, He has accomplished redemption, salvation, justification, resurrection, and sanctification.<p>Finally, He ascended to the heavens, and He has attained the kingship, the throne, glory, and honor. All these are all-inclusive and limitless, and they are excellent beyond comparison. Today, all these items have become His riches. In these riches are divinity and humanity as well. All these are there for us to experience. Although we cannot understand them in full, we can enjoy them day by day. This can be compared to the rice that we eat every day; very few people understand the composition of rice, but we can enjoy it every day. This is truly a mystery.
