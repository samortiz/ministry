   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW THE CHURCH COMES INTO BEING AND IS BUILT UP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we have to see how the church comes into being and how the church can be built up as an increase to Christ, a living bride to match Christ, a counterpart of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to see this, we need to pay full attention to how Eve, the wife of Adam, came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God took a part, a rib, out of Adam, and God built that rib, that piece of bone, into a woman, the increase of Adam to be his wife Gen 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After God created Adam, He saw that Adam as a bachelor, as a single person, was not good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Adam needed someone to match him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God had the intention to make a wife for Adam, but He first put Adam to a test.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God wanted Adam to realize his need, so He brought all the living creatures to Adam to test him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Adam, by his wisdom, gave every creature a name, but he did not see anything that was good enough to match him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Adam did not find his helpmate among the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>None of the created things was qualified to match Adam, because none of them was something out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They were outside of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God caused Adam to sleep, took a rib out of his side, and built that rib into a wife for Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Adam awoke, he looked at Eve and said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh" Gen 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, Adam found a wife to match him, and the two became one flesh, one body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the whole universe, there are thousands of items created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is as if God brought all these things to His Son, Christ, and Christ said, "There is none good enough to match Me. I have to go to the cross and be broken by God." When He was nailed on the cross and broken, blood and water came out of His side John 19:34 . Blood is for redemption, and water is for giving life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, He redeems us by His blood, and on the other hand, He generates us, gives life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The bone taken out of Adam signifies the resurrection life of Christ, a life that can stand any kind of opposition or attack.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the cross none of the Lord's bones were broken John 19:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His flesh, which typifies the human nature, was broken, but His bone, which typifies the divine life, the resurrection life, could never be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is from this resurrection life, from this bone, that the church comes into being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This resurrection life of Christ becomes the church, just as the bone of Adam became the wife of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church is something produced out of the resurrection life, the divine life, the eternal life, the uncreated life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is not of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is of the crucified and resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church is something out of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The resurrection life has been imparted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Within us there is a part of Christ, and that very part is a part of the church of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the parts of Christ in the real believers added together equal the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church is something out of Christ, a part of Christ, the increase of Christ, the counterpart of Christ, the one who can match Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church must be like Christ because the church is a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to realize, by this revelation, that the church is nothing less than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Anything that is less than Christ cannot be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is a part of Christ increased as the Body to match Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Anything in the old creation, regardless of how good it is, cannot be added to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is foreign to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>None of us has the right to bring anything that is outside of Christ into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The real church is something of Christ as a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This vision will control us and keep us from trying to bring anything outside of Christ into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever you are going to suggest or bring something to the church, you have to ask yourself before the Lord, "Is this something of Christ as a part of Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If it is not, you have to forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is vital.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church has been corrupted and divided by foreign elements.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many foreign things that were brought into the church have damaged, spoiled, and even disembodied the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No foreign, inorganic element can be put into our physical body or it will damage our body, yet this is what many have done to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church is something out of Christ and a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>None of us has the right to bring something which is not Christ or which is less than Christ into the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we try to bring something foreign into the Body of Christ, that will damage, kill, and divide the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to bring Christ as the life supply, the food, to feed the members of the Body for the growth, the building up, of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church will be increased in life by feeding on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church is absolutely something out of Christ, as a part of Christ, so the church is the increase of Christ, a counterpart, a bride, a wife, to be married to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to pray for the Lord to show us the central thought of God and how the church comes into being.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we are going to allow the Lord to recover His testimony, we have to see all these things in the spirit.</S>
