   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE BIBLE OPENING UP</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE MYSTERY OF THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A gospel booklet entitled The Mystery of Human Life tells us that the human life is truly a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The mystery of human life, however, is only a part of the mystery of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is a mystery in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>People who are knowledgeable and reasonable, regardless of their national backgrounds, all share the same feeling and all acknowledge that the universe is difficult and even impossible to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even to this day no one has been able to clearly explain what exactly the universe is, where it came from, and what stories it holds.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why is it that only on the earth there exist human beings, animals, plants, the birds of heaven, the beasts and cattle of the earth, and the fish of the sea?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What are the stories behind all these things that exist in the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some say that these things are merely the phenomena of nature, that such changes have been going on for countless ages in the natural world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This kind of explanation at best can give us a little anesthetic ; it cannot really answer our questions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In my reading from my youth until now, I have read not only textbooks, the Holy Bible, and Bible-related books; I have also read certain secular books.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to my understanding, while there are many books in the world, there is only one book the Bible that is the most complete, clear, and useful in explaining the very truth behind the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It may be said that the Bible is neither too much nor too little in its contents, because it has a total of sixty-six books, which were written by more than forty writers over a period of at least one thousand six hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With such a book that was written over such a long period of time by a group of completely different individuals, its contents would naturally be multifaceted.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, whenever I consider this book, the more I meditate on its contents, the more I sense the transparency and clarity of this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even though in the world there are many scholars, experienced statesmen, and entrepreneurs, they may not have as much understanding concerning the universe as we do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The sphere of their knowledge is limited to what they see with their eyes and what they read from books.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Under this situation, they are likely to have a narrow view and also become nearsighted.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, even though they are great statesmen and entrepreneurs, some of them give the impression that they are quite confused.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is because they have an incomplete understanding of the mystery of the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>KNOWING THE MYSTERY OF THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>IN THE DAYS OF OUR YOUTH</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This message is mainly for those who are under twenty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The earlier a person gets to know the mystery of the universe, the earlier he takes hold of the direction for his life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, if you are over this age, please do not lose heart, because you can be rejuvenated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I truly thank the Lord that He laid hold of me when I was nineteen years old so that I also could lay hold of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I regret that I believed so late; if I had been saved a few years earlier, it would have been even better.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some people wish to marry early, but actually the earlier a person gets married, the more troubles he brings upon himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All those who marry early are very regretful because the loss they suffer is incalculable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you want to get married, it is preferable to do it when you are thirty; do not do it when you are twenty-eight, although twenty-eight is still better than twenty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Early marriage puts you at a disadvantage.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, you should also not marry too late.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To delay until you pass the appropriate age is also not suitable.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is concerning our human experience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Concerning the knowledge of the universe, since man is the beginning of the mystery of the universe, for a man to wait until he is forty before he knows the mystery of human life is to be too late.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I was saved at nineteen, and since then I have grasped every opportunity to love the Lord and know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, I hope that all the young people can absorb this message in a good way, because the earlier you get to know the mystery of the universe and the earlier you receive the Lord, the more blessed you are.</S>
