   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The next part of verse 6 says, "Crucifying again for themselves the Son of God and putting Him to open shame."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some have said that to fall is to crucify the Son of God again.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Who can crucify the Lord again?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The work of the Lord Jesus was accomplished once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was not like the bull and the goat, which must be slaughtered when they are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On your side, you cannot renew your repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the Lord's side, He cannot renew the crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you have to renew your repentance, that means that the Lord Jesus will have to renew His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If that were the case, then you would be putting the Lord to open shame.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You would be saying that the Lord Jesus' onetime crucifixion was not enough, that there have to be more crucifixions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, this is not a question of salvation and perdition here.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the previous messages, we have seen that eternal salvation is a fact that cannot be overturned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there is a fallen and backslidden Christian among us, who was once clearly saved and was clear about God's salvation, for him to rise up again does not require a fresh start.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as he would rise up today, that is all that is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no possibility of crucifying the Lord Jesus again and putting Him to open shame.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the last section in verses 7 and 8, not only was the apostle saying that there is no need and that there is no possibility, but he went on to say, in a more serious way, that there is no right.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why do we not have the right?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is because a laying again of the foundation would crucify again the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If one does that, there would be serious danger ahead of him; he would suffer great punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"For the earth, which drinks the rain which often comes upon it and brings forth vegetation suitable to those for whose sake also it is cultivated, partakes of blessing from God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if it brings forth thorns and thistles, it is disapproved and near a curse, whose end is to be burned."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We will leave the detailed discussion of this passage until later.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After one reads Hebrews 6, he can see that this chapter speaks of the matter of progress.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not on the question of salvation or perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hebrews 6 never tells us that a saved person can perish.</S>
