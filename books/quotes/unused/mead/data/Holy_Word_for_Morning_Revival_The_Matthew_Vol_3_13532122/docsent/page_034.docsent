   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This chapter marks the beginning of the Lord's last week on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord purposely went back to Jerusalem not to minister, preach, teach, or perform miracles, but to present Himself as the Lamb of God to be slaughtered, to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A warm welcome to the meek King is covered in verses 1 through 11.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The way He came into Jerusalem fulfilled the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The term "the daughter" of Zion in 21:5 denotes the people of Jerusalem cf.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Psa 137:8; 45:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This prophecy was being fulfilled to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 5 says that the King came "mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, a foal of a beast of burden."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This signifies the humble and lowly state in which the King of the heavenly kingdom was willing to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The heavenly King came not with haughty splendor, but with gentle, humble meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This impression of meekness is strengthened by the colt accompanying a donkey to bear the meek King.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus did not ride into Jerusalem proudly on a horse.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He came mounted upon a little donkey, even a small colt.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No earthly king would do this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He came not to fight or to compete, but to be a meek King.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The presence of the baby donkey testified that the Lord did not care to fight or compete with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The people honored the Lord with their clothing, that is, with whatever they had.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to honor the Lord, the meek King, with whatever we are.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No matter what our condition may be, we have something with which to honor Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore , the people shouted out a quotation from Psalm 118: "Blessed is He who comes in the name of Jehovah" v. 26 . According to Psalm 118, only the One who came in the name of the Lord was qualified to be praised in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, the spontaneous praise of the people sovereignly indicated that this meek King came not in His own name, but in the name of Jehovah.</S>
