FOR THE MANIFESTATION OF THE ONE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>Human history is under God&rsquo;s sovereign authority. On the surface, every country is autonomous and independent, but in reality, the Bible reveals that the rise and fall of a country depends on God; it is under the sovereignty of the God of the heavens (Dan. 2:21; 4:26). Historians write history from their perspective, but we consider history from our perspective, which is the divine revelation. More than two thousand years ago, according to human history, there was not much communication between countries. Nations had different languages, and there was no advanced means of transportation. If what we now see concerning the one new man had been revealed during that time, there would have been no way for the manifestation of the one new man to be realized. However, under God&rsquo;s sovereignty, there have been four major events over the past two thousand years of human history, from the birth of Christ until today. These major events were for the producing of the one new man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The First Major Event&mdash;<br />
the Establishment of the Roman Empire</h2>
<p>In 27 B.C. Caesar Augustus officially established the Roman Empire and ruled over the entire area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. The Roman Empire made Greek the common language around the Mediterranean Sea. Hence, when the Lord Jesus accomplished God&rsquo;s salvation through His death and resurrection and the Holy Spirit sent out the apostles to preach the gospel, the language and the politics of the Roman Empire were unified, sea transportation was developed, and highways had been built throughout the land. In the apostle Paul&rsquo;s time, Greek was used in every country and city. Because the Roman Empire unified the territories around the Mediterranean Sea, Roman citizens had free access to every area. They did not need to have an identification document or passport. All these things were beneficial to the spread of the gospel. Within less than one century, the gospel spread throughout the area around the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Second Major Event&mdash;<br />
the Reformation<br />
and the Discovery of the New Continent</h2>
<p>The second major event was the Reformation and the discovery of the new continent. According to church history, the Reformation led by Martin Luther was an exceedingly great matter. Martin Luther&rsquo;s Reformation and Columbus&rsquo;s discovery of the new continent freed the minds of people who had been under the bondage of degraded Catholicism during the Dark Ages. This brought in a great leap forward in human thought and subsequently gave birth to the growth of science and the development of industry. Capitalism, socialism, and imperialism emerged one after another because of the problems caused by mass production.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Third Major Event&mdash;<br />
Britain Defeating Spain</h2>
<p>After Columbus discovered the new continent, Spain became the leading power in the world. Spain was under the influence of the Catholic Church. If God had allowed Spain to remain the leading power, the entire world might have fallen under the degraded and dark power of Catholicism. However, God raised up Britain to defeat Spain, and the entire world fell under the dominion of Britain. Consequently, Britain was able to send Protestant missionaries to preach the gospel everywhere, particularly in Africa and Asia.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fourth Major Event&mdash;<br />
the Rise of the United States</h2>
<p>God used the British Empire to maintain the world situation so that the gospel of God could be preached everywhere in the world. However, the British Empire was not faithful to God. The British Empire was significantly weakened by the two world wars, both of which were brought to an end by the United States. After World War II God raised up the United States to be the leading power in the world. Due to the inventions and advancements in transportation and technology, mankind has nearly reached the highest level. This has led to much communication between nations, involving exchanges related to culture, the military, and politics.</p>
<p>One hundred years ago it took six months for an American missionary to reach China by boat and another six months for him to return. It took exactly one year for a round trip. Today it takes about twelve hours to travel from Taiwan to the United States by airplane. The distance between places on the earth has decreased because of the modern technology of advanced transportation. Formerly, the Chinese called the Westerners &ldquo;foreign devils,&rdquo; and the Chinese were not welcomed in the United States. Hence, it was virtually impossible for the Chinese to visit the Americans. However, this situation is totally changed. There can be communication between the English, the Americans, the Germans, the French, and the Chinese. We need to see that the progress in human history is for the manifestation of the one new man.</p>
<p>We can genuinely say that in Christ, in the church, in the Body, and in the one new man, there is no East and no West. Formerly, the East was the East, and the West was the West; the two sides could not become one. But today we can say that not only have the East and the West become one, but the East, the West, the North, and the South have also become one. Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty the world situation has connected mankind through science, commerce, and culture. Hence, Christians from every continent can gather in Taiwan and declare in different languages, &ldquo;Hallelujah, praise the Lord!&rdquo; All the progress in technology and transportation is for the producing of the one new man.</p>
<p>Two thousand years ago, no one would have dreamed of the manifestation of the one new man. But today we are not only dreaming of the one new man; we are seeing the one new man. This is the age of the one new man. We see the revelation of the one new man in the Bible, and we also have the practice of the one new man on the earth. We have the joy of salvation on the first level, the joy of the church on the second level, the joy of the Body on the third level, and the joy of the one new man on the fourth level. Hallelujah!</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
