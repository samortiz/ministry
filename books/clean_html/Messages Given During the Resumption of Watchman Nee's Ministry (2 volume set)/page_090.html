<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Submitting to Authority and<br>Receiving the Riches of the Members</H2><P>God's work today is the recovery of the testimony of the Body. This Body testimony is not a doctrine, but a reality. In this Body, there is the perfecting ministry (Eph. 4:12), and there is spiritual authority. A close relationship exists between ministry and authority. Where there is ministry, there is authority. In fact, ministry is authority. In Ephesians 4, we see that the Body requires all kinds of gifts, the goal of which is the perfecting of all the saints. In order for the members to be perfected, there is the need to submit to authority. To submit to authority is to submit to the Head. Today, the sisters cover their heads with respect to the brothers. Actually, everyone should cover his head with respect to Christ. We do not have individual heads; only Christ is the Head. Those who want to retain their heads are trying to practice individualism. Those who promote individualism in the Body are troublemakers. Only Christ is the Head; on the other hand, Christ covers His head before God. Although my hands and my feet are far away from my head, they are still under the direction of the head. Hence, for us to submit to the members is in reality for us to submit to the Head.</P><P>The mouth may be very important, but it still needs help from the other members. Without the eyes and the ears, the mouth alone will be useless. This is why I do not believe in the so-called personal revelation. In the Bible, there are such things as individuals receiving grace from the Lord, and there are such things as individuals being sanctified. Yet at the same time, there is the aspect of our relationship with the other members. What do we have today that is not received from others? The greatest heresies in the world came from those who received so-called direct revelations from the Lord. If an individual can receive revelation alone, then a person needs only to be a Christian individually; there is no need for us to come together to meet any longer, and all the "one another's," the "we's," and the "they's" in the Bible can be cut out. A man has to humble himself and has to receive what others have already received. When a person has received something, it is much easier for another to receive from this one. For example, twenty years ago, it was difficult to find a person who was clear about his salvation. But after we met one person like that, it became easier to meet more. This is true with the understanding of the truth of salvation. It is equally true with the understanding of all the other truths.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A STANDARD CHRISTIAN BEING<br>ONE WHO BEARS THE BODY TESTIMONY</H2><P>The Bible reveals one great truth: the kind of Christian God wants is one who is after a Body testimony. In other words, He wants Christians who will act as members of the one Body of Christ. What we need today are standard Christians. What does it mean to be a standard Christian? A standard Christian is one in whom others can detect certain characteristics. For example, when you sit down with a Presbyterian, he will tell you about God's predestination and will tell you that our salvation, regeneration, and justification are all based on God's predestination. However, if you sit down with a Methodist, he will tell you that everyone has to work out his own salvation, that repentance is an act of one's free will, that salvation is a result of one's willingness to be saved. Everything depends on ourselves; if we do not do anything, we cannot even be saved. Among certain kinds of Christians, you can find certain kinds of characteristics.</P><P>Christians today are not standard. They lack a few basic characteristics, such as selling their possessions, consecrating themselves, repentance and confession of sins, and experiences of deliverance from the power of sin. In addition, there is one characteristic that is lacking the most among them, which is the realization of the Body of Christ. We have to help the believers to experience these things as soon as we can. A newly saved person will do whatever you tell him to do at the initial stage of salvation. If he is allowed to go on for too long, he will become set, and it will become difficult to deal with him. Hence, we have to speak to the believers some of these truths as soon as possible. Everybody likes to be nice and to say nice words; everyone likes to be polite to one another. But a person cannot be an up-to-standard Christian this way. In the future we have to spend much time to study how to be a standard Christian, so that our next generation can become a brand-new breed of Christians.</P>
