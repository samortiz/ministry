[1]  CONTENTS The Ministry of the New Testament The Teaching and the Fellowship of the Apostles PREFACE
[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee to the elders and co-workers on January 2 and 3, 1993 in Anaheim, California.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE MINISTRY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:1; 3:6-9; 2 Tim 4:5; Eph 3:9-10; 4:12; Acts 2:42; 1 Tim 1:3-4
[4]  Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for this merciful and gracious gathering.
[5]  Based on the old covenant of the law, there was an old covenant ministry, and based on the new covenant of the New Testament, there is the ministry of the new covenant 2 Cor 3:6 .
[6]  The old covenant ministry of Moses was a ministry of death and condemnation, but the new covenant ministry is the exact opposite: it is a ministry not of death but of the Spirit, that is, of life, and not of condemnation but of righteousness for God's justification.
[7]  To Accomplish God's New Testament Economy concerning the Church in
[8]  Ephesians 4:12 says that all the saints need to be perfected "unto the work of the ministry."
[9]  However, this does not mean that in the New Testament there is one ministry, and then in addition to this one ministry there are many other ministries.
[10]  This includes the works of the Judaizers, who still taught genealogies from the Old Testament, and also the law v. 7 . Such things are not part of God's economy and were considered by Paul as different things v. 3 . Thus, the works of the teachings of things other than God's economy should not be considered a part of the ministry.
[11]  In the turmoil among us, the intention of the dissenting ones is to condemn me; therefore, they say that the ministry is Witness Lee's ministry.
[12]  In my response to the brothers, I asked them whether they considered all the churches raised up by my ministry denominational churches, and whether they considered my ministry a denominational ministry.
[13]  OF THE APOSTLES Scripture Reading: Acts 2:42; Matt 28:19-20; Heb 2:3; John 16:12-15; Col 1:25-28; Rev 22:18-19; Heb 1:2; Gal 1:6-9; 1 Tim 1:3-8; Col 2:4, 8, 16-18, 20-23; 2 Pet 3:15-16; 2 Tim 2:15; 1 John 1:1-3, 7; Phil 2:1; 2 Cor 13:14; Eph 4:3-4a; 1 Cor 5:9-13; 2 John 7, 9-11; Rom 16:17; Titus 3:10
[14]  In the recent turmoil the first item damaged by the dissenting ones is the New Testament ministry.
[15]  in the Son at the Last of These Days,
[16]  Not to Be Twisted by Anyone in Any Way
[17]  From Peter's word in 2 Peter 3:16 we can learn one lesson, that is, that God's holy writing should not be twisted by anyone in any way.
[18]  The Bible does need some expounding and some interpretation, but we must be careful when we expound the Word of God not to twist it.
[19]  and Do Not Abide in the Teaching of Christ, Especially concerning Christ's
[20]  The heretics who go beyond and do not abide in the teaching of Christ, especially concerning Christ's divine and human person, should be rejected from the fellowship of the Body of Christ 2 John 7, 9-11 .
[21]  As we pointed out earlier, in their rebellion the dissenting ones in the recovery today have damaged the matters of the teaching of the apostles and the fellowship of the apostles.
