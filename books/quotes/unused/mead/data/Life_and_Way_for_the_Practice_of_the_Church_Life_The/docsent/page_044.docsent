   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG THE CO-WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now I want to add a little word concerning the relationship among the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Scriptures, in Acts and in the Epistles, you can see many people working for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But they were not organized together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There was no organization for the churches or for the co-workers, the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Peter and some brothers worked in Jerusalem, in Judea, and Paul and others worked in the different places of the Gentile world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There was no organization of the co-workers, and there was no central control over them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They were all sent by the Lord and all worked for the local saints, for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>None was organized with others and none would keep any work in his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So there was no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As long as we have organization, the problems will come.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Peter worked for the Lord, and Paul also worked for the Lord, but they were not organized together.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes Paul went to Jerusalem to help the church there, and sometimes Peter came to other places where Paul worked to help the churches there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Peter and Paul, however, never formed an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, we realize that Peter had a group of co-workers with him, and Paul had another group of co-workers with him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But their grouping was not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They just went together to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There was neither financial control nor central control.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul received the supply from the Lord for his own living, and his co-workers received the supply from the Lord for their own living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They just took care of one another in love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since there was no organization among them, everything was so clear, free, and simple.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as we do not have any kind of organization, everything will remain simple and without trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose I go to a certain locality to work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, I leave the results of my work in the hands of the local saints there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then another brother goes there and works in the same way, and a third brother goes there and works in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church in that locality is not in the hands of any one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, we three even do not have any kind of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are just working together for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By the Lord's guidance at the present time, we have to stay here to work together and go on together, but this is not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not give either of them a salary, nor do they give me a salary.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you feel led by the Lord to work with me, let us go on together.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If I feel guided by the Lord to work with you, let us go along together.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do not have any guidance from the Lord to work together, we just go on with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the saints also come together on their own within their own jurisdiction to go on with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Maybe they feel they have to invite me to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then they just do it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When they invite me and I feel guided by the Lord, I just go to them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Maybe they feel to invite another brother.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then they just do it, and this brother can go if he feels led of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>So we see there is nothing organized and nothing is kept in the hands of the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the results of the work are in the hands of the local saints meeting together as the local expression of the Lord's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is according to the New Testament teaching and pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Finally, I would speak a little word concerning the ministry meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The ministry meetings are meetings of the ministry to help the saints and the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These meetings are for the local churches, but they are not local church meetings and are not in the hands of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to the pattern set up in the book of Acts, there are three ways for the servants of the Lord to work and minister to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One is that, as a servant of the Lord, you can go to any locality to help the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You can attend the church meetings and take the opportunity to minister to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Another way is that you can be in a place where there is a local church, yet at the same time you can rent a place for your ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul did this when he was in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Acts 28 we are told that while Paul was in Rome, for two years he rented a house for himself to work and "welcomed all those who came to him, proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul did not form another group by his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The fruit of his ministry was for the church in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Remember that you should not form anything of your own to keep the results of your ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All the results of your ministry must go to the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The third way is that if you stay in a locality for a long time, spontaneously you become a member of the local church there and serve the Lord as a local member.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Peter was an example of this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He stayed in Jerusalem for a long time, so he automatically served the Lord in the church in Jerusalem as a local member.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I hope this simple word may make the situation and the way clear to us.</S>
