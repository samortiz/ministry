   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>TEXT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is crucial that believers have the best attitude toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are in the church, but the church is among human society.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot live a life outside human society.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, there is the need for us to know what kind of attitude we should hold toward unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this message we will see that the believers experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in having the best attitude toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>HAVING THE BEST ATTITUDE TOWARD OTHERS A. Being Subject to the Government</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In having the best attitude toward others, the believers first need to be subject to the government.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is strongly charged in Romans 13:1-7.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verse 1 Paul says, Let every person be subject to the authorities over him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A natural character is a rebellious character, and man s natural response to authority is to rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But a transformed character is submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, subjecting ourselves to the government requires a certain amount of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our being submissive to God s appointed authorities in the government is an indicator that we have a certain amount of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such transformation is the issue of the growth in life through the experience of the dispensing of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Recognizing That the Authorities</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Are from God, Appointed by God,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>as Servants of God</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The authorities are from God, appointed by God, as servants of God to the believers for their good.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to recognize this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul says that the authority is a servant of God to you for good.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if you do what is evil, fear; he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to him who practices evil v. 4 . The New Testament clearly teaches that all authorities are from God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Human government with its authority was established by God during Noah s time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the flood God gave man authority to rule over others Gen 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was by this ruling authority among men that the nations were set up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, as Christians, we must recognize that the authorities are from God and respect them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Authorities have been appointed to the believers for their good.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that through the authorities God allows us to live on the earth in peace to be His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We surely need a peaceful situation while we are living on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to maintain a peaceful situation there is the need of a government with authority to rule over the people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Through this ruling, a good environment and a peaceful situation can be maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Not Resisting Them</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since authorities are from God, we should not resist them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He who resists the authority opposes God s ordination, and those who oppose will receive judgment to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For the rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil Rom 13:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we resist authority, either judgment will descend upon us from the authority, or it will come to us directly from God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul also says, It is necessary to be subject, not only because of wrath but also because of conscience v. 5 . This indicates that our subjection should not only be out of fear of punishment; even more it should be for the sake of our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because of our conscience, we need to learn, by being transformed through the divine dispensing, to be subject to authorities.</S>
