   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Fulowen ?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When this brother was brought before the judge, the judge tried to persuade him to recant his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But he said to the judge, "I have told you all that I wanted to say.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You can do whatever pleases you."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His friends tried to persuade him to change his decision, but he said, "I cannot change what I have said.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>May all men forgive me, and I forgive all men."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>While he was being burned, he stretched out his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The executioners tried to cut off his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because there was not enough wood to burn him to death, the executioners decided to finish his life instead.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Wichill ?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Wichill was another person persecuted by the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A few cardinals condemned him and were ready to put him to the stake.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They erected a scaffold and were ready to burn him upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On his way there, many soldiers surrounded him and bound his hands behind him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One beggar met him along the way and begged for something.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He replied, "How I wish I could give you something with my hands.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>May the Lord meet your needs."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Two other Catholic believers met him and said, "Pray to the holy mother."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He replied, "Do not tempt me any longer."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After he was tied to the stake, he knelt down and prayed, "May the Lord receive my soul."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then he turned to the sinners and said, "Do not stumble because I have suffered for my faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You should receive salvation, which comes from the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Receiving Him is untold comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have received the grace today to suffer this persecution and tribulation which will not be long.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If I preach man's teaching, I will receive man's approval.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But I am preaching God's salvation, and for this I receive joy, peace, and comfort from the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am able to face death fearlessly for Christ's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not fear those who can destroy the body but not the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This night I will be supping with my Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then he prayed, "Father, forgive them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I forgive them from my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May You forgive them also."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the end he exhorted the crowd to warn their priests to depart from sin or else judgment would come upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One executioner came forth and knelt before him, asking for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He replied, "Come," and he kissed him, saying, "This is the mark of one who forgives."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>FUTURE GLORY OF THE MARTYRS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There has never been a break in the Christian lineage of martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For two thousand years all of God's children who have suffered this way believed that they would reign in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Revelation 20:4 says, "And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and of those who had not worshipped the beast nor his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Please note that it says that every throne is occupied by a person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are four kinds of people who are on the thrones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first are those who have overcome; judgment will be given to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The second are those who are beheaded for the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The third are those who are killed because of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This refers to the saints in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The fourth are those who have not worshipped the beast nor his image.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These are the martyrs during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These four kinds of people will reign with Christ; they will receive the crown of life and inherit the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Receiving the crown means to be kings and to reign.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we place ourselves willingly in the Lord's hand, great sufferings will await us on the one hand, but we will inherit a surpassing eternal weight of glory on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In addition to Revelation 20:4, verses 2:7 and 3:5 also speak of overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Overcomers are those who confess the Lord's name before the Father and the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Matthew 10:32 and Luke 12:8 show us that all those who confess the Lord's name before men will be confessed before the Father and His messengers in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Bible shows us that at the end of this age, brothers will kill brothers, fathers will deliver their sons to death, and children will be enemies of their parents and will kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christians will face unprecedented and severe persecutions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to show new ones that even though the martyrs died, each one testified to the Lord's grace with his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How hard is the way of the martyrs, yet how glorious is their end!</S>
