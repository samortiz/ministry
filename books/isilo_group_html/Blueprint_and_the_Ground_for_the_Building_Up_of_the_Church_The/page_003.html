<p>Although the first and last sections are a reflection, there are still considerable dissimilarities. First, in the first section the tree of life is outside man, outside Adam; however, in the last section the tree of life is inside man. Revelation 22:2 says that the tree of life grows in the New Jerusalem. We must understand that the New Jerusalem is a corporate man, and Adam in Genesis 2 is also a corporate man. Adam represents not only Adam but also all his descendants, those who come out of him. Therefore, Adam is a corporate man. The New Jerusalem is also a corporate man. Inscribed on the gates of the New Jerusalem there are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel, and on the twelve foundations there are the names of the twelve apostles (Rev. 21:12, 14). These two groups of people represent God&rsquo;s chosen people in the Old Testament and all those saved by grace in the New Testament. At the beginning of the Bible the tree of life is outside this corporate man Adam, but at the end the tree of life is inside this corporate man, the holy city. Ultimately, the tree of life is mingled with man. The tree of life is in man and grows in man.</p>
<p>Second, the gold, bdellium, and precious stones in Genesis 2 are in contrast to Adam, a man of clay. However, at the end of Revelation, all the Old Testament and New Testament saints, represented by the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel and the twelve apostles, are no longer earthy; they have become gold, pearl, and precious stones (21:12, 14, 18-21). It is more accurate to say that the man of clay is transformed; the earthy nature is gone, but the person remains.</p>
<p>Third, in Genesis 2 the three kinds of materials&mdash;gold, bdellium, and precious stones&mdash;are merely materials; they have not yet been built together (vv. 11-12). However, in Revelation 21 and 22 these three materials have been built up as the New Jerusalem (21:18-21). On one hand, this building is the tabernacle and dwelling place of God among men (v. 3), and on the other hand, this building is the bride and counterpart of the Lamb (v. 2).</p>
<p>If we see a clear picture of the beginning and the end of the Bible, we will be greatly helped in knowing the Scriptures. When we look at the Bible with this view, we must acknowledge that the very beginning of the Bible brings out God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire. Genesis 1 and 2 present a clear picture. If we see this picture, we will be able to fully understand God&rsquo;s heart and know what God is doing in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONTENT OF<br />
THE FIRST TWO CHAPTERS OF GENESIS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God Creating Man<br />
with His Image and Dominion</h2>
<p>There are four crucial points in Genesis 1 and 2. Genesis 1 clearly indicates that God created the heavens, the earth, and all things. In creation God&rsquo;s focus was on life. There are millions of wonderful, colorful things that exist in the universe, but only one chapter in Genesis gives a record of their creation, and this record is very brief. The opening statement of the Bible is, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&rdquo; (v. 1). Then the record concerning God&rsquo;s work of six days is wholly on life, beginning with things without life to things with life. The record of the things with life begins with the plant life, the lowest form of life without any consciousness, and goes on to animal life, a higher form of life with consciousness. The record of the animal life begins from the lowest consciousness to the highest consciousness. At the end of this record man, possessing the highest form of life among all creatures, was created. However, this man is a corporate man. God did not create many men; He created one man&mdash;Adam. Even though man became fruitful and multiplied, all men come from this one man. God did not create many scattered men but one corporate man. God wants this man to express Him in His image and represent Him with His dominion (v. 26). God created a corporate man so that man with God&rsquo;s image and dominion may express Him and represent Him in the universe.</p>
<p>Although God created man in His image and with His authority, man still needs God to enter into him to be his life and to live in him. Therefore, the first crucial point in Genesis 1&mdash;2 is that man is the highest form of created life, because he was made in God&rsquo;s image and given God&rsquo;s dominion. However, in these two chapters God&rsquo;s intention was not accomplished, because God did not enter into man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Creating Man with a Spirit<br />
So That Man Can Receive Him as Life</h2>
<p>The second crucial point in chapter 2 is that God created man with a spirit and placed man in front of the tree of life, a symbol of God Himself as life (vv. 7-9). This means that God wants man to receive God, who is Spirit, in his spirit. The tree of life has many significances, but its main significance is that God in the Son can be received as life. The tree of life is actually Christ (John 15:1, 5). God formed man from dust and breathed the breath of life into him to form a human spirit within him (Gen. 2:7; Prov. 20:27). This human spirit is for man to receive God into himself as his life. God can enter into man as life in the Son. First John 5:12 says, &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&rdquo; Life is in the Son of God. As the Spirit, the Son of God enters into man (John 20:22). Hence, the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;wants to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Blueprint and the Ground for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
