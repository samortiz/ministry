   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ASSIMILATING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However much we "worship" God, He is still God and we are still ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What He wants is that we receive Him; to drink Him is to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is not satisfied with an outward relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we drink Him, He is assimilated into us, just like our food.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we eat a stone, we shall not be able to digest it, because it is not organic.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when we take something nourishing into us, it is organically assimilated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>So it is with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we receive Him, He becomes part of us in an organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is Spirit and life, and we can assimilate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After we have eaten our food and it has been digested and assimilated, even a surgeon cannot remove it from us!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After we receive the Lord, we may want to get rid of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may resolve not to believe in Him any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But it is too late!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has been assimilated into us and is part of our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is no way for us to expel Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The idea of worshipping God in silence and awe is not to be found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His people are to shout for joy Psa 5:11; 132:9, 16; Isa 12:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are to sing Psa 30:4, 12; 98:4-5; Isa 12:5 and praise Him 2 Chron 5:13; Psa 135:1-3; 150:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we shout for joy and praise with singing, we are eating and drinking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more we do this, the more He is assimilated into us and the more we are joined to Him in one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our relationship with God, then, is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is a union of spirit and of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are one spirit and one life with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This life relationship between God and us has five great functions or processes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Of course, our human life has its functions too.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are ill, for example, the doctor may perform surgery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But nothing he could do would be of any help if we were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is only because we have life that the techniques the doctor applies can restore us to health.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This life in our physical body carries on its functions and thus sustains us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first function of the divine life is to regenerate us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When this life comes into us, we are born again and receive "a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father" Rom 8:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This spirit of sonship, which is the Spirit of life, enters into us and makes us sons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It then becomes quite natural to call God our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Someone once went to Brother Nee to ask how he could be sure that he was truly a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brother Nee asked him if he was married.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yes, he was.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"What did you call your father-in-law the first time you met him?" was the next question.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"Well," the brother replied, "I forced myself to call him Dad, but it felt very awkward."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brother Nee then asked, "How do you feel at home when you call your own father Dad?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Does that seem awkward to you?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"No," was the reply.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"That is sweet to me."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brother Nee then pointed out to him that the awkward feeling when he called his father-in-law Dad was evidence that he was not born of his father-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The tender feeling he had in saying Dad to his own father was proof that he had indeed been born of him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"How do you feel," Brother Nee then asked, "when you call God Father?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"That is also sweet to me," was the brother's response.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"This is an evidence that you are saved and a son of God," Brother Nee told him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Romans 8:15 has the two terms, Abba and Father; not only Abba, but also Father.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is doubly sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because we have been regenerated, it is natural to us to call God Father, Abba Father.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God" v. 16 . Before we were born again, we were not God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We were only creatures, higher perhaps than dogs or cats, but still not His children.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We were created by Him and had His image and likeness, but we nonetheless did not have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now praise Him! we have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The spirit of sonship has entered into us to become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are no longer only His creatures, but His children, with His life in us.</S>
