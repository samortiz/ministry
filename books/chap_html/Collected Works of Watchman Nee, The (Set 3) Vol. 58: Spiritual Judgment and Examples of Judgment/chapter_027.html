<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(23)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 24, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER Y. G.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. When I was young, my village had over ten workers of the Lord. I was baptized at the age of eighteen and worked as a teacher for a girls' elementary school under the China Inland Mission. Later I went into business and did fairly well. Once I got sick and was able only to take a little food. My body was completely immobile. The doctor said that I was going to die. However, without knowing how, eventually I got better. When I was twenty-eight years old, a classmate of mine gave me a copy of Issue No. 24 of The Christian while I was attending a teacher's training course in Foochow. After I read it I became very clear within. I asked a brother concerning the matter of taking this way. He introduced me to a brother who is a worker for the Lord. I received much help from this brother and left the denomination where I was. Then all kinds of crosses came to me. There was criticism, slander, poverty, and suffering. Two or three of us brothers began to work and serve the Lord in one accord. Neither personal affairs nor material attraction could touch us in any way. In 1935 I attended Brother Nee's Overcomer Conference. Afterwards, I returned to Wu-Li-Pai County, Chekiang, to preach the gospel for three weeks. Over fifty people were saved. During the past few years, my condition before the Lord has not been good at all. I have had thoughts of spending the rest of my life farming and planting potatoes. While I was considering this, a cable came and told me to attend a conference in Shanghai. It is the Lord's arrangement that I can come to the mountain to be trained. I do thank and praise the Lord for this.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>I do not know this brother too well. But from his testimony I can tell that he is an intelligent, articulate, and frank person. God has no use of the foolish, and He has no use of the wise. We have to realize that in the spiritual journey, our work is not the main thing. God pays more attention to our personal history before Him. Our brother should no longer put an emphasis on human wisdom and work. It is a great grace from God that you feel that your condition is not that good today. Day by day and time after time we should develop a hidden history before God. For years you worked in the P'ing Yang, Chekiang area. You felt dry and had no history before God during this time. This means that your pathway was not straight. The parts of the human body have their proper proportions. Whether or not a man looks well depends on the proportions between the different parts of his body. To look well means to have the proper proportions. If a man's ears were five times larger and his eyes half as big as those of other men, he would look ugly and would be like a monster. The same is true with the spiritual condition of man. There must be the proper balance. If a man is clever and frank, he must have a strong spirit to match these attributes. Our brother is strong in thoughts and eloquence, yet his spirit is weak. Things are out of proportion to each other. He has taken the outward way. No brother's disposition should be stronger than his spirit. No one should have a mind, emotion, or will that is stronger than his spirit. If he does, his pathway will not be straight.</p><p>Our brother's strong mind is far stronger than his spirit. You have to ask the Lord to break down your cleverness and quickness. Otherwise, your strong mind and your quickness will become problems to your spirituality. I am not saying that we do not need cleverness and quickness. I am saying that we should have the stamp and wound of the cross upon all of our cleverness and quickness. Such a wound marks our way. Paul was intelligent, but we do not touch his intelligence; we touch his person. When we touch his intelligence, we also touch the wound of the cross. He had no confidence in himself, and it was easy to take others' word as well as change his own ideas. His knowledge of God's way made him a fearful and trembling man. The outer man must be broken, or else we will be useless.</p><p>One brother testified how he used to be naughty and how he used to play pranks on his teachers. Every time he spoke about this, he would condemn it and say that it was wrong. Yet while I was listening to him, I did not feel that he considered them as mistakes. I did not feel that he was condemning his naughtiness and pranks. Instead, I felt that he was showing off his naughtiness. His spirit was taking pride in his pranks. There was no mark of the cross on him. The same can be said of our brother's testimony. There is no wound of the cross upon his intelligence. Naturally speaking, he is sharp and clever, but these attributes are to be rejected and accursed. You should be ashamed of them. You must have the wound of the cross. Your quickness and cleverness must bear the mark of a knife-wound that causes you pain when you touch it. This does not mean that a clever man should become foolish, or that he should deny all his natural attributes. Rather, it means that he should feel pain even before he moves. This will spontaneously humble him. Once the light shines, a man falls to the ground spontaneously. If a man truly condemns himself, his spirit will always refresh others. Everyone who has come under the light is clear in one sense and foolish in another sense. After Paul saw the great light, he was blind for three days. For years you have been taking the way of cleverness and quickness. This has frustrated you from taking the straight course of the Lord. The Lord will bring you through failures, and these failures will be more profitable to you than victories. If you realize that we are all proud by nature and that everything we do amounts to nothing, you will find the knowledge of God's ways, and you will learn the proper lessons in the work of the Lord.</p><p>In Philippians 3 Paul said that he counted all things as loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus. He also told us what he was like. His words certainly nourish our spirit. In reading Paul's Epistles, we sense his talents and his wisdom, but at the same time, we realize that he was a man wounded by the cross. He dared not be self-confident or boastful; he was always in fear and trembling. We have to take the same way. We must have the mark and the scar of the cross. It is not wrong to be clever or quick. Yet these things must pass through the cross, and there must be wounds upon them. If there are wounds upon them, a man will not glory in them or boast about them. He will consider them a spiritual hindrance, and he will abhor and part with them. He will no longer be proud of them. In fact, all pride will disappear. He will fall in the dust and set his eyes on God alone. The self will be put down, become useless, and be exposed to its foolishness. He will have no way to go on. When he has no way to go on, then he will be ready to take the straight course.</p>
