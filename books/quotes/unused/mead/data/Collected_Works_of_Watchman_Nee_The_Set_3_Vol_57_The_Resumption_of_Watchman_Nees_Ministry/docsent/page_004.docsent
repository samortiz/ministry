   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TALKS IN FOOCHOW,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>SEPTEMBER 1947 CHAPTER ONE THE MERCY OF GOD Date: September 5, 1947</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Place: Foochow, Fukien EVERYTHING DEPENDING ON THE MERCY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we read Romans 9, we have to pay attention both to its principle and to its application.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This chapter reveals the principle that everything depends on God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The apostle applies this principle to the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He shows us that everything that happened to the Israelites was of God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only do we need to pay attention to the application today, but we also need to pay attention to the principle behind the application.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 9:16 says that "it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Zeal and pursuit are of no use.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Neither is the absence of zeal and pursuit of any use.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Waiting too long, not waiting long enough, being too quick, or not being too quick none of these is of any use.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Being in one place or another, hearing much or hearing little none of these is of any use either.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everything depends on the mercy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only the Holy Spirit is able to lead men to a proper standing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There must be at least one time that a person sees God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Concerning this matter, our eyes must be opened at least once.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Of course, it is good if our eyes can be opened more than once.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But there must at least be one time when we see that everything depends on God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether we see this matter all at once or realize it through a process, the minute we touch this matter, we touch the fact not a feeling, but the fact that everything depends on God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's mercy is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A fact is not dependent on feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Take the matter of regeneration as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We often tell sinners that they must have a one-time definite experience of repentance and believing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To believers, we say that they must have a one-time definite consecration of themselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is the same in principle in regard to man's understanding of God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There must be at least one time when a person definitely touches God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE NEED TO DEAL WITH</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE MIND, THE EMOTION, AND THE WILL</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>BEING TEMPERED UNDER</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Three kinds of people need God's dealings: those who are strong in their will, those who are strong in their emotion, and those who are strong in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many people are controlled by these three conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These three things must experience God's breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God deals with man's strong points more than He deals with his weak points.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Man's strong points often hinder him from spiritual progress even more than his weak points.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Unless a man is dealt with in these three areas, he cannot know God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After a man has been dealt with by God, he will be tempered in his spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In many things it is inappropriate to be either too much or too little.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some people wait too long, while others do not wait long enough.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All these require tempering.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some people are not strong enough in their inner man; their outer man is too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is like a man's head taking up one-fourth of his body or one-sixteenth of his body; neither is proportionate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The right proportion should be one-seventh of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some people are too strong in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Others are too strong in their emotion or their will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Their inner man is not strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These conditions require tempering.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once I took a leader of the China Inland Mission to hear Brother T. Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After the message, others usually would ask about the message that had just been given.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But on my way home with this brother, I did not ask him anything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the end he opened his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He felt that Mr. Austin-Sparks was too strong in his will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I told him that my will was also quite strong.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This leader, Mr. Baker, asked, "Then how are you able to get along with him?" Those who are outwardly strong in their will do not easily get along with others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But this brother did not realize that we are one because of our inner man, not because of our outer will.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today, in order for our inner man to match our outer man, our inner man must grow.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the inner man grows, it can control the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some people are too strong in their minds.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Their minds need to come under the control of the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I have read the New Testament a few hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although I cannot say that I have read it more times than everyone else, at least I can say that I have read it more than many people.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I could find over one hundred passages that contradict each other.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, I have not done this, because my mind has been under the control of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we want our spiritual life to be well-tempered, we need to attune our condition to a proper balance.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must neither be too much nor be too little.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This can be compared to shooting on a pinball machine; there are pins to the left and to the right, and the balls must be directed at the optimum angle before they can score.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There are many pitfalls in our spiritual journey; our mind, emotion, and will can all become hindrances to us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we are too much or too little, we fall into danger.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Everything depends on God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Before I was saved, I planned to go to America.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If I had left two months earlier, I would not have met Sister Dora Yu, and I might never have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Even if I had been given the chance later, I might not have believed.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It was God's mercy that I met Miss Dora Yu at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It was neither too early nor too late.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Only God can do things in just the right proportion.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We are prone to speak either too much or not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>No one can preach a message that will meet everyone's need.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Even the apostle Paul and the apostle Peter faced the same problem.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When words come out of a person's mouth, it is difficult for the words to come out just right.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is why it is easy for people to misunderstand.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Only God can bring man to a state of true humility.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Sometimes a little cross and a little dealing make a person proud instead of humble.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Only severe crosses and severe dealings will make a person humble.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Some people are too spiritual; they think that the Lord dwells only in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But Ephesians 3 says that Christ dwells in our heart through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He dwells not only in our spirit, but also in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is something that a person can feel.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>John 15 says that Christ abides in the believers, but it does not say that Christ abides in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Only Ephesians 3 speaks of Christ dwelling in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Some people are too spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>They think that the heart does not mean much.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>However, many of the Psalms speak of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In order to be tempered in spiritual matters, we need to pay attention not only to the spirit, but to our heart as well.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>THE WAY OF THE CHURCH LOOKING TO GOD'S MERCY</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The way of the church during the past two thousand years is a way of looking to the mercy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Only God's mercy can temper us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I have often told the young people that they may have to wait for five years before they will realize that everything is of God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>A person has an average of one hundred forty thousand hairs.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The Bible says that God has numbered every one of our hairs.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He knows us more than we know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>When God wants to save us, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If God did not show mercy, no one could be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Once D. L. Moody was preaching the gospel, and a lady was about to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>At that moment an umbrella fell and caused a distraction.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In the end the lady was not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Whether or not a man can be saved is not the responsibility of the preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The responsibility of the preacher is simply to present the way to others.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Only God's mercy can put a person on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>It is God's work that puts a person on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>It is also God Himself who takes men forward on the way.</S>
