<p>I have spoken about being offended. Now I wish to say a word about natural affection. In the church life there should not be any natural friendships. If you regard certain ones as your special friends, it also is an indication that you are full of self. Certain ones match your taste, and you fit their taste. You feed one another&rsquo;s taste. This is very damaging, and it hinders the building. Among the brothers and sisters in the church, there should be a pure divine love, but there should not be any personal affection. If any personal affection creeps into your relationship with the saints, it proves that you are full of self. In the church life there should be no such affection. To me, all the brothers and sisters are the same. To have a favorite among the brothers and sisters is to be full of self. It is not to be a Peter, but a son of Jonah. This damages the building.</p>
<p>We need to receive the mercy of the Lord to regard all the saints as our brothers and sisters, but none as our friends. For the Lord&rsquo;s building in the church life, everything natural must be extracted. There should be no natural affection, relationship, or feeling. Rather, we all must be fearful of natural affection and shun it. Whenever a brother loves me in a naturally affectionate way, I am frightened. That is the time for me to exercise the key to deny the self. I will lock myself and avoid that brother&rsquo;s affection. Whenever you discover that you are feeding a brother&rsquo;s self and that he is feeding yours, you must use the key to lock the gate of the self. If you do not lock up the self, Satan will come out through the door of the self. Then you and others will remain sons of Jonah. You will not be Peters, and it will be impossible for the Lord to build the church with you.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HIDDEN SELF</h2>
<p>More than nineteen hundred years ago, the Lord Jesus prophesied that He would build the church. But why, after so many centuries, do we not yet have the building? It is because the key of self-denial has been neglected. In these messages I have no desire to talk about doctrines. But I do have a heart to fellowship with you all. Oh, the hidden self! Peter had a good heart, but within him there was the hidden self that became the gateway for Satan to come out. I appreciate the Lord&rsquo;s discernment. If I had been the Lord, I would not have had the discernment, but would have appreciated Peter&rsquo;s concern. However, the Lord Jesus immediately discerned that Satan had come out through the gate of the self.</p>
<p>I am glad that in the churches we have the brothers&rsquo; houses and the sisters&rsquo; houses. But, through experience, we have realized that there are two kinds of results from living in such a house. Some form natural friendships; others become dissatisfied and disappointed. However, no matter what the situation may be, you should not be disappointed. To be disappointed is a proof that you are in the self. The self of those who live in the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses must be locked up. If the self is locked up, we shall have the building. If you exercise the key of self-denial, others may be offended, but you will not be offended. Instead, you will be built up because the self in you has been locked up. We all need to use the prevailing key of self-denial to lock the self, the soul, and the mind. Otherwise, the building up of the church will be frustrated.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CRUCIFIED AND RESURRECTED<br />
FOR THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Verse 24 says, &ldquo;If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Me&rdquo; in this verse means a great deal. This &ldquo;Me&rdquo; is the pattern, the pathway. Furthermore, this &ldquo;Me&rdquo; is the crucified and resurrected &ldquo;Me.&rdquo; If we are not crucified and resurrected, there can be no church. The church comes into existence through the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ. Not only our self, which is defiled, but even the Lord&rsquo;s pure, sinless self had to be denied. If the Lord had not denied Himself and gone to the cross, He could not have been resurrected, and there would have been no church. We must follow after Him. This means that we must deny ourselves as He did and must allow ourselves to be crucified as He did. Without this, it is impossible for the church to be built up. Whenever we sense that we are feeding the self life of another, we must say, &ldquo;Lord, I will follow You. I will stop having so much contact with this brother.&rdquo; If you do this, the building of the church will proceed.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise of the Kingdom for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
