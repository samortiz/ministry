Before we were saved, we were in an upside-down situation. We were collapsed in death and darkness. But the Spirit in His seeking sanctification brought us back to God. We believed into Christ, and the Spirit continued to sanctify us by regenerating us. Then this Spirit, who is Christ Himself, continues His sanctifying work to transform us every day, making us right-side up.</P><P>A brother may talk to his wife apart from the Spirit in an upside-down way. But gradually the Lord transforms this brother to make him realize that his way is not the Lord's way. The Lord's way is not in our flesh or in our American way of thinking. His way is in our spirit. Eventually, the Lord will work in this brother again and again to turn him to his spirit. There the Holy Spirit meets him to shine over him, enlighten him, and speak to him in a personal way. The Spirit may say, "From now on don't talk to your wife without My speaking." This will make this brother right-side up.</P><P>Bit by bit the transforming Spirit is making us upright. We are not merely corrected or adjusted outwardly but transformed inwardly. The very Christ who is living in us, working in us, and making His home in us is transforming us day by day. When a person moves into a new house, he makes many adjustments. Christ is making His home in us and making many adjustments within us.</P><P>In our marriage life, we are upside down much of the time. The wife's attitude toward her husband may not be proper. It is upside down. But every day the indwelling Christ is fixing His dwelling place. He is transforming us, making us right-side up. This transformation makes us a treasure. God is making us His treasure by transforming us.</P><P>As we are being transformed, we are being made right-side up, that is, we are being headed up under Christ. It is a beauty to see this. In the Lord's recovery, we should be Jesus lovers who have been headed up under Christ. When we are headed up, there is no turmoil, no fighting, no debating, no confusion, and no collapse. Instead, everything is in a good order. We Jesus lovers should take the lead to be headed up in Christ. Then eventually Christ will have all things in heaven and on earth headed up under Him.</P><P>God has given Him to be the Head over all things, but all things today would not be headed up. But we, His lovers, should take the lead to be headed up in Christ. Today's whole universe is in an upside-down situation. The whole universe needs to be made right-side up, to be headed up. We are the Jesus lovers, who are willing in Christ's redemption to be transformed by the sanctifying Spirit to be made right-side up. This is why the Lord needs a recovery. Among us there should be no struggling, no fighting, and no debates. There should just be fellowship and submission.</P><P>This is all due to the dispensing of the Son. The Son's dispensing in His redemption and His transformation through the sanctifying Spirit issues in the heritage prepared as a treasure to God. The Father's dispensing results in a group of sons. The Son's dispensing results in all of us being made a treasure. Now God not only has a group of sons, but also has all the sons becoming His treasure, His heritage. Many of us came to this conference from a long distance because we want to be right-side up. What is the Lord doing today in His dispensing? He is making us right-side up by transforming us in our soul. This transformation includes our being renewed and conformed to the image of Christ, resulting in a heritage produced for God.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Issue of the Dispensing of the Processed Trinity and the Transmitting of the Transcending Christ &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
