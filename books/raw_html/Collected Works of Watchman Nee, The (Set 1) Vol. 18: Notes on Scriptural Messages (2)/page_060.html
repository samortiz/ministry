<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. Robbing</H2><P>Verse 2 says, "Or through robbery." Robbing, taking things away by violence, and usurping belong to the same kind of sin. To gain by force or to gain by improper means is to rob. Suppose someone asks you to be the executor of a will. After he dies, are you going to execute his will, or are you going to keep some for yourself? He has died, and the things are in your hands. If you willfully change the will, this is robbing. Some may have been soldiers or may have worked in the customs office. If you have used improper means to gain some possessions, this is robbing.</P><P>It is a fact that one receives life by believing in the Lord. It is also a fact that everyone who is saved through the blood of the Lord has his sins forgiven before God. However, when you sin against someone, God cannot forgive you on that person's behalf. For example, if I offend Brother Wang and I confess before God, God cannot forgive me on behalf of Brother Wang. If you offend man and do not deal with it properly, this sin will not cause you to lose your life, but it will cause you to lose your fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. Deceiving One's Fellowman</H2><P>Verse 2 says, "Extorted from his fellowman." "Fellowman" in the Old Testament denotes other people; it does not necessarily mean the person next door. This is a kind of Jewish idiomatic expression. The fellowman denotes other people. How many mothers-in-law have deceived their daughters-in-law? How many parents have deceived their children? How many teachers have deceived their pupils? How many in high positions have deceived those under them? All of these are deceiving their fellowman, and all these matters displease God. None of us can act foolishly or live our lives foolishly. We must deal with these matters. Many are harsh husbands, harsh wives, or harsh mothers. Many mothers use improper ways to deceive their children. In our daily life, we deceive others in many ways. We often speak words that deceive others on the street. We often resort to force with the cab drivers or rickshaw drivers. We often are too harsh in dealing with others. These all deceive our fellowman. Servants and drivers were all created by God, and we cannot treat them in a harsh way. Very often they may be wrong and unreasonable. But do they have your kind of background? Do they have your kind of position? Do they have your kind of education? They do not have your background, position, and education. How can you expect them to be as reasonable as you are? Even if they are wrong, you do not have to oppress them. Christians ought not to be unrighteous toward others. For Christians to deceive others is displeasing to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>5. Taking What Others Have Lost</H2><P>Verse 3 says, "Or has found what was lost and lied about it." We may think that this matter is not very important, but this is deceitful. We may think that picking up things left behind by others is not unrighteous. But God says that this is deceitful. No Christian can claim what others have lost as his own. If we are on a tram and we see others deceiving, that is not our business. We cannot control them. We have no way to change the morals of society; the Lord will take care of it when He comes. Many pick up money and put it into their own pocket because they are afraid that the money would otherwise go into someone else's pocket. This is unrighteousness. Once I saw a man counting coins in a tram, and he dropped one. Another man stepped on the coin so that the owner would not see it. When the owner got off the tram, the other man also got off. I do not know if he paid the fare for the two additional stops just to get that one coin.</P><P>Whether it is a handkerchief, hat, fountain pen, or someone's letter, anything that is left on the street can never be claimed as our own. This is unrighteousness. In the past we may have picked up others' possessions. But whether it is money or objects, something big or small, as long as it is not ours, we cannot have it as our possession. If at all possible, we must return it. When we see something left on the street, we should wait for the owner to come and find it, or we should hand it to the local officials. Otherwise, God will say we have sinned.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>6. Swearing Falsely</H2><P>Verse 3 says, "And has sworn falsely." Swearing has two aspects in the original language. One is in the context of the previous trespass, and the other is independent of it. In the context of the previous trespass, it means that when after picking up another's thing and being caught and questioned, one lies and swears that he has not picked it up and that if he had, he would have done such and such. It is wrong for you to pick up another's thing and to lie and swear that you did not do it. This is condemned by God. We can never lie this way to avoid trouble.</P><P>Generally speaking, lying is a way of avoiding being blamed for sin. I have said that there are three big reasons for lying. One reason is pride. Lying may keep one's pride intact. After one has done something wrong and people ask him about it, he either says that he did not do it or says something else to cover it up in order to save his face. Another reason for lying is that one fears that others may become too strict toward him. An overly strict mother will have lying children. An overly strict teacher will have lying pupils. An overly strict master will have lying servants. Being too strict will cause others to lie. If you can tolerate the mistakes of others, they may be willing to tell you the truth. But if you have a whip in your hand and cannot forgive the smallest matter, others cannot help but lie because lying may help them avoid difficulty and save them. The third reason for lying is what we have been speaking about today, that is, lying in order to gain profit. If I can gain one hundred dollars by just a little lie, why should I not lie? It is possible to gain some benefit or money by lying. Some lie because of pride; some lie because others are too strict. These are lesser sins. But lying in order to gain a profit is a more serious sin. God condemns any lie that is done for profit. Lying is condemned already; but lying for profit is condemned even more.</P><P>Some who work as nurses may take some cotton swatches and medicine from the hospital. Their intention may be to bring them home for their own use. But when the pharmacist asks them what they are doing, they may say that these are for their patients. They may be successful in taking those things, but this is lying for profit. It is very easy for us to acquire things that belong to the government by way of lying. This is wrong. As Christians, we cannot do this. I have no objection to man giving you something or allowing you to take something. If others have the authority to give something to you, I have no objection.</P><P>Some may be working in an organization where everyone is allotted papers, envelopes, pencils, etc. If you conserve some of them and give them to your children, that is all right because they are your portion. But if you tell the one allotting the stationery that you do not have enough and need more, it is a sin. You are profiting by improper means, and this is not pleasing to God.</P>
