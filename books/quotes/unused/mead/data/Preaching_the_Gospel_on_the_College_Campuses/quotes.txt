[1]  CONTENTS The Spirit and the Body Prayer, the Word, and the Homes A Proper Daily Living and a Universal Love
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE SPIRIT AND THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4a; 1 Cor 12:13; Acts 4:8, 31; 6:10; 7:55; 13:4, 9; 15:28; Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 12:27; Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6; 22:17
[3]  This book covers some important matters concerning the young people going to the college campuses to preach the gospel.
[4]  When saints of all ages stand together in an excellent coordination, we will have an effective and fruitful work of preaching the gospel on the campuses.
[5]  In contrast, I have to point out the shortcomings of the present situation in the charismatic movement.
[6]  If we have the real power of the Spirit, we do not need any gimmicks.
[7]  Some of you may have been saved for less than a year.
[8]  You may think that you are too young, that you do not know very much, and that you do not have much experience in life.
[9]  If we behave and work in the Spirit, the Spirit will direct us to the Body.
[10]  CHAPTER TWO PRAYER, THE WORD, AND THE HOMES Scripture Reading: Acts 1:14; 2:4; 3:1; 4:17-18, 31; 5:20, 25, 28, 32, 42; 6:4; 10:9; 11:5; 12:5, 12; 13:3; 16:25; 18:11, 26; 19:8, 20; 28:23, 30-31
[11]  In chapter one we saw that to preach the gospel on the campuses we need the revelation of the Spirit and the Body and the experience of the Spirit and the Body.
[12]  In this chapter we want to go on to see the ways that the early apostles and disciples took for the preaching of the gospel.
[13]  No doubt, they prayed for the baptism in the Holy Spirit, but I also believe that they offered much prayer for the preaching of the gospel.
[14]  A PERSONAL TESTIMONY CONCERNING THE GOSPEL WORK IN TAIPEI
[15]  In 1948 and 1949, when we were forced to leave mainland China and go to the island of Taiwan, we were very disappointed.
[16]  After much prayer, however, we picked up the burden to fill the city of Taipei with the preaching of the gospel.
[17]  The work of preaching the gospel is not a quick, mushrooming work.
[18]  Without the basics of prayer and the Word, our gospel preaching will be ineffective.
[19]  However, we still need another practical help to make our gospel preaching work prevailing.
[20]  CHAPTER THREE A PROPER DAILY LIVING AND A UNIVERSAL LOVE Scripture Reading: 2 Pet 1:2-8; Matt 5:14-16; Phil 2:15-16; 1:27; Matt 5:44-46; 22:37-40; John 13:35
[21]  In the previous two chapters, we have seen some crucial matters relating to the preaching of the gospel on the campuses.
[22]  In chapter one we saw the importance of the revelation and experience of the Spirit and the Body.
[23]  In this chapter, we still need to cover two other important matters related to our gospel preaching.
[24]  For our gospel preaching we need not only the words spoken out of our mouth, but also a life that shines before men.
[25]  It is a shame to the Lord, to His name, and to His gospel when Christians preach the gospel while their living is not according to the gospel.
[26]  According to 2 Peter 1:2-8, partaking of the divine nature issues in fruitfulness.
[27]  Then verse 8 says, "For these things, existing in you and abounding, constitute you neither idle nor unfruitful unto the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[28]  When the young people go to the campuses to preach the gospel, they need not only a proper daily living but also a universal love.
[29]  We should be those who love the Lord, love all our brothers in the Lord, and love all men.
[30]  In addition to brotherly love, we also need love toward all men.
[31]  In 2 Peter there is a progression from the divine nature to brotherly love and eventually to the divine love, a love that is toward all men 2 Pet 1:4-7 .
