Last night we saw one thing that is accomplished in Christ&mdash;death. Christ has died on the cross, and those who are in Christ have also died. We do not have to die ourselves; there is no need for us to seek to die or to think of ways to die. In Christ we are all dead. Through the death of Christ, those who are in Him are dead already.</p><p>We have a brother who was an officer in the army. He told me that if anyone retreated during a battle and ran away from the army, he would be executed immediately. He talked about this with the other officers. The military law was stricter than any civil law, and many soldiers could not take it. The officers were cruel and constantly harassing them. Yet once a soldier dies, he is free from the authority of the officers, and the officers can no longer do anything to him. An officer can abuse a soldier only to the point of death, after which the officer can do nothing more. The same principle is involved with our being in Christ. Adam's sin dominates us. Through sin Satan often harasses and overpowers us. But once we die in Christ, we are free from its domination.</p><p>This is God's way of dealing with our problems on the negative side. But what has He done for us on the positive side? God has appointed Adam to be the head of the human race. After Adam fell, everyone became a sinner by birth, because everyone is in Adam. How can God deliver us out of sin? His way of salvation is to appoint a new Head&mdash;Christ. Christ is the Head of the new human race, just as Adam was the head of the old human race. God has put us into Christ. We become persons in Christ, just as we were persons in Adam. Man is never independent; either he is in Adam or in Christ. If he is not in Christ, he is in Adam. There is only one man in heaven, and there is only one man in hell. As we are sitting here today, we should ask ourselves whether we are in Adam or in Christ. We must realize that we leave Adam and enter into Christ through His death. The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of everything in the new creation. It is interesting to note that the Bible never tells us to believe in the death of Christ. It only tells us to believe in His resurrection. In 1 Corinthians 15:14, Paul said, "And if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is vain; your faith is vain also." The death of Christ takes care of the negative things; it terminates everything in the old creation. The resurrection of Christ is positive; through resurrection we receive a new life. We are delivered from sin and enabled to serve God. When Christ resurrected, those who died in Him were also resurrected. They became a new man in God's eyes through the new life they received.</p><h2 class="head1">REGENERATED THROUGH<br />THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</h2><p>First Peter 1:3 mentions a very wonderful thing. It says that we have been regenerated through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. Many people in the church today talk about regeneration, but they do not understand how regeneration occurs. Many say that we have been regenerated through the cross. But Peter said that we have been regenerated through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. We have been regenerated through Christ's resurrection. In other words, if Christ had not resurrected, we would not have been regenerated. When Christ died and resurrected, we died and resurrected with Him as well (Eph. 2:6), and we received His life into us. Regeneration brings us the life of Christ. This life was imparted to us at the time of Christ's resurrection. He first had to die before He could resurrect. If He had not died, He could not have resurrected and would not have been able to impart His life to us. Thank the Lord that He has died and lived again. Therefore, He can dispense His life to us.</p><p>We need to consider Christ's death and resurrection before we can understand the overcoming life that we have received in Christ. When the Lord was on earth, He spoke of the parable of the wheat. This is recorded in John 12:24. The Lord said that if a grain of wheat does not fall into the ground and die, it abides alone. But if it dies, it bears many grains. Verse 33 shows clearly that the death of the grain of wheat, as mentioned by the Lord, refers to His death. A grain of wheat is different from a grain of sand. A grain of wheat has life, whereas sand does not have life. But if the grain of wheat does not fall into the ground and die, it will remain as grain even after millions of years. The Lord Jesus as the grain of wheat fell into Bethlehem and died at Golgotha. Then He resurrected, and in resurrection He regenerated us, giving us the same life as His. If Christ had not left heaven to come to earth, there would only be one person, Himself, today. The Bible says that Christ is God's only begotten Son (1:18). This means that He is the unique Son. God loves His only begotten Son, but He wants to have many sons (Heb. 2:10). He desires to see His only begotten Son become the firstborn Son so that He can have many sons.</p><p>In the Gospel of John, Christ is God's only begotten Son. But in Romans 8 and Hebrews 2, He has become God's firstborn Son. We cannot call a person a firstborn son and an only begotten son at the same time. Being a firstborn son means that there are other sons to follow, but being the only begotten son means that there are no more sons. Yet God wants His only begotten Son to become the firstborn Son. How can Christ as the only begotten Son of God become God's firstborn Son? If the only begotten Son remained in heaven all the time, there would forever be an only begotten Son. In order for Him to become the firstborn Son, there is a need for Him to "fall" from heaven to the earth. One day Christ "fell" from heaven to Bethlehem and later died. There are two aspects to His death: the first is the redemptive aspect, which is for the purpose of taking away our sins. The second is the non-redemptive aspect, which is for the purpose of releasing His life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> </body></html>
