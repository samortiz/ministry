   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE BEING EDUCATED IN THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND ELIMINATING OPINIONS LAYING A FOUNDATION OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: How do we have a deeper study of the truths that require further development, such as the twelve precious stones in the New Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And how can we be kept from pursuing the truth in a natural way so that we are not led astray?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Answer: It is a terrible thing when a person does not know the flesh, yet he pursues the truth and sees visions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have continually emphasized the importance of the truth, hoping that all the saints would know the truth, but the truth can be useful only in the hands of a person who knows the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To those who do not know the flesh, the truth is merely a tool.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the prerequisite to knowing the truth is to know the flesh, the natural life, and the self and to deal with these things seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In pursuing the truth, the younger saints should not begin with studying the twelve precious stones in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You should begin by reading what is already published in our books concerning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This must be your foundation, your base.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you would study the twelve precious stones without a foundation, you will get lost.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You should begin with the basics.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You should be able to give a clear word concerning justification before you can speak concerning the twelve precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are approximately forty-five thousand saints in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, of these forty-five thousand, are there even four hundred fifty who can give a clear, thorough, and logical word concerning the truth of justification that would supply light and life to others?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am afraid that not even forty-five saints can speak such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may think that I am being too pessimistic and that instead we should be optimistic and appreciative of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we think this, can we say that there are forty to fifty saints attending the training who can speak concerning justification?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet we still may consider this to be too elementary and instead want to speak on something higher, such as the twelve precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to lay a firm foundation in our education in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must begin with the most basic spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose we are asked to describe the condition of man according to the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Can we speak about the nine different kinds of people who are in need of Christ as life?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In learning the truth we must first lay a solid foundation before we can begin to build.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to complete elementary school before we can go to junior high school and then high school; otherwise, we will lack a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In everything that we learn, we must be realistic and start with a good foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When someone who knows how to develop an educational system arrives at a certain place, he will begin by starting an elementary school; after an elementary education becomes widespread, he will start a junior high and then a high school.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This takes a minimum of twelve years.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A work must have a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He will not teach some physics today and mathematics tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Regrettably, the work in Taiwan is done almost entirely in a scattered way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We teach a little of this here and a little of that there, and this is the reason that it is difficult to have results.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During the long period that I have been away from Taiwan, you should have managed to accomplish some great successes in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Who would have imagined that the population of Taipei would increase, but the number of saints in the church would decrease?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before I left Taipei, there were about four thousand saints who attended the meetings in the halls on the Lord s Days; there were never less than at least three thousand saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>During these past twenty to thirty years, even if some of the saints have passed away, moved away, or become cold and backslidden, you should still have increased in numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But it seems as if you have done nothing in your twenty-three years of work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, the statistics show that there has been no advance in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Second, the work has lost useful ones in all the places; consequently, the number of co-workers has decreased.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the past there were almost one hundred co-workers in Taiwan, but now their number has been reduced greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Third, even though the elders in all the localities have shown some improvement, the overall situation of our work has not improved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The reason for this is that the co-workers pay more attention to giving messages than to practical matters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to run an educational system, it is not enough to simply invite famous speakers to come and speak once or twice a month or even every week.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The students would not gain anything from this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all must clearly see this, and we must go step by step to be sure that we have a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At a minimum, we would have a group of elementary school graduates in six years, and we could continue to teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then after sixteen years we would have a group of university graduates.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the only way to produce useful saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot leap high without laying a foundation; we cannot work with our heads in the clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must pay attention to being practical and to laying a good foundation in our work.</S>
