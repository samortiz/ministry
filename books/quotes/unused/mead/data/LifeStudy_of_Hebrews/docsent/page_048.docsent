   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FIFTEEN CHRIST AS THE APOSTLE SUPERIOR TO MOSES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to the third comparison found in the book of Hebrews that Christ as the Apostle is superior to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the very beginning of this Epistle, we saw the comparison between our God and the God of the Jewish people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then, in chapters one and two, we saw two aspects of the comparison between Christ and the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As both the Son of God and the Son of Man Christ is superior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The third boast of the Jewish religion is Moses, who was their most outstanding leader.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we shall see in another message, the fourth comparison, that between Christ and Aaron, shows us that Christ as the High Priest is superior to Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the Apostle and High Priest, Christ is superior to both Moses and Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We see these two titles of Christ in 3:1 where we are told to consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jesus is our Apostle and our High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the Apostle, He was typified by Moses; as the High Priest, He was typified by Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Apostle is the One who was sent to us from God and with God John 6:46; 8:16, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The High Priest was the One who went to God from and with us Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the Apostle, Christ came to us with God to share God with us that we might partake of His divine life, nature, and fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the High Priest, Christ went to God with us to present us to God that we and all our case might be fully cared for by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the Apostle He was typified by Moses who came from God to serve the house of God 3:2-6 , and as the High Priest He was typified by Aaron, who went to God with the house of Israel and their cases 4:14 7:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although you might have known that Jesus is our High Priest, I doubt whether many of you reading this message have ever heard that Jesus is also the Apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Jesus was the first Apostle in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why I say once again that the book of Hebrews is quite peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Firstly, it tells us that the Lord Jesus has been appointed by God to be the Heir of all things 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then it tells us that He is even the Captain of salvation 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ as the Heir of all things and as the Captain of salvation is not so clearly revealed as in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even Christ as the High Priest cannot be found elsewhere in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we see that Christ is the Apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word apostle in Greek means a sent one, one who is sent by higher authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jesus is the One who was sent by God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God sent Him to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I. MOSES</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moses was a type of Jesus as the Apostle, the sent one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the children of Israel were suffering persecution under the tyranny of Pharaoh, God appeared to Moses and charged him to go to the children of Israel and to Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, Moses became an Old Testament apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moses was God s sent one, the apostle who was to take Israel out of Egypt and lead them through the wilderness for the purpose that they might be constituted as God s house and to be formed into a habitation of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This habitation of God was symbolized by the tabernacle made by the children of Israel in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That tabernacle was only a symbol; it was not the real habitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time, God s real habitation on earth was the children of Israel themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The children of Israel were formed and constituted into a house of God by Moses, God s apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This portrait is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we read the Bible we need to have such a heavenly vision, a revelation in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without this, we can never apprehend the true significance of all the stories in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A. A Part of God s House</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is, however, a difference in degree between Moses and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Regardless of how much Moses prefigured Christ, he was still only a part of the house, whereas Christ is the Builder of God s house 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>B. Faithful in God s House</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Moses, as God s sent one to take care of God s house, was faithful to God in all His house.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This typifies that Christ, as the Apostle from God, for God s house, is faithful to God who constituted Him v. 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>C. For a Testimony of the Coming Things</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Chapter three, verse 5, says that Moses was a servant for a testimony of the things to be spoken later.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moses was a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here a testimony means that Moses was a photograph.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Your photograph is your testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose we have never seen a certain person but we have a photograph of him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His photograph is his testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Likewise, Moses was a testimony, a prefigure, a photograph, a type of the real, typical, and genuine Apostle sent from God.</S>
