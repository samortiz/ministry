   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN EMPHASIZING REPENTANCE THROUGH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A MIND FILLED WITH THE LAW AND WORKS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why does man pay so much attention to repentance?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is because man's mind has the poison of the law and works remaining in it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Salvation is free, but because man's mind is full of the law and works, he never considers that God would give salvation to him freely.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He never thinks that God would freely bear man's burden.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He always thinks that he has to do something good before he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether it is the keeping of the law, the performing of good works, or the need for repentance, man always thinks that he has to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It seems as if man is never willing to be an unconditional beneficiary.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He never wants to stand in a position of receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although he realizes that it is impossible to do everything, he thinks that he must at least do something.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is precisely this doing that has twisted the biblical meaning of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It turns repentance into our repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Please remember that the repentance mentioned in the Bible and the repentance that we talk about are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is repentance according to man's mind?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the human concept, repentance is improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to his mind, repentance is not something for the past, but is something to deal with the present and the future.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Formerly, I was sinful, fallen, degraded, and weak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now I want to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, I have to improve myself from today on and make myself look better.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Chinese word for repentance is hwe-gai.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hwe means to feel sorry, and gai means to change.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some have invented a new doctrine, unknown to the New Testament, based on this Chinese word, saying that some people only hwe but do not gai.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, they say that it is not enough just to feel sorry; there must also be a change.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why does man pay so much attention to change?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is because man's thought is full of works.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why he emphasizes works so much.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He says that since everything he did before was wrong, he must no longer be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He realizes that he was bad and that he was a sinner, but now, he should not be bad and should no longer be a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Formerly he sinned, and before God he was clothed in rags; he had squandered all of his Father's possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How then can he be accepted when he returns home?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Surely he has to do business, and make some money.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Surely he should have on the best robe and a pair of shoes before he can return home.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man's thought is that he needs a certain degree of improvement before he can return home.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If his clothes are not proper and he looks the same as before, perhaps the Father would not accept him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If he would improve somewhat, although there is still no assurance whether the Father would accept him, at least there is a better and greater chance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Man never considers that it is possible to go to God and receive salvation in his present condition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He always wants to improve himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He admits that he cannot be perfect in his conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But he thinks that he still has to have something and trust in the Lord for the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To him, it is like gambling; he has to place a bet before he can gamble.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This bet which he places is the repentance that man talks about.</S>
