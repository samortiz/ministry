<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is a collection of messages given by Brother Witness Lee, a servant of the Lord, in Taipei in 1950. It contains ten messages, covering the way for a saved person to progress in life: to be pure in heart, to remove all that covers God&rsquo;s light within him, to confess his sins, to ask for God&rsquo;s enlightenment, to consecrate himself to God, to deal with his conscience, to live before God, and to have a proper service in Christ. These messages have been hidden for half a century; now that they are being published, the abundance of life contained in them is once again released.</p>
