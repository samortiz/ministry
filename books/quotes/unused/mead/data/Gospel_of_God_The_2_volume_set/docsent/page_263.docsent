   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We see that the Lord Jesus has offered Himself up once as a sin offering for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He has accomplished eternal redemption once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By His one work we are eternally perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 2 implies that those who have been purified no longer have the consciousness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, there is only one offering of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is no second offering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If someone rejects this sin offering, there will be no other sin offering for him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why verse 26 says that if we sin willfully, there is no more sacrifice for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sins of a sinner are forgiven through the cross of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After a Christian is saved, even if he sins, the Lord Jesus cannot die for his sins again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His one-time accomplishment has accomplished everything eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Him everything is included.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us now read a few verses from chapter nine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verses 25, 26, and 28 say, "Nor in order that He might offer Himself often, just as the high priest enters into the Holy of Holies year by year by the blood of other creatures; since then He would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself....So Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time to those who eagerly await Him, apart from sin, unto salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His coming the second time will have nothing to do with their sins; rather, it will be for their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verses 12 through 14 say, "Not through the blood of goats and calves but through His own blood, entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, obtaining an eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who are defiled sanctifies to the purity of the flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 9, speaking of the first tabernacle, says that it is "a figure for the present time."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to this tabernacle "both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which are unable to perfect, according to conscience, him who worships."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By reading chapters nine and ten we see that those in the Old Testament differ from those in the New.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If I were in the Old Testament and committed a sin, I would have only one way to deal with my sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If I had enough money, I would buy a bull.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If I did not have that much money, I would buy a goat.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If I could not afford either, I would buy a turtledove.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then I would ask a priest to offer up the sacrifice for me to atone my sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I saw the bull or goat, I would be happy at heart, for I would know that the offering had served as a substitute for my punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the blood of the bull or goat would be like my blood, God would forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I could go home happy and joyful at heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I would be the happiest person on earth, because my sins would have been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I did not have my sins anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The darkness in my conscience would be removed, and I would suffer no more.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But after two days, I would begin to think, What if the sacrifice offered that day did not work?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What if the priest did not do the right thing the other day?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because of these thoughts, I would begin to worry and suffer again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Finally, I would decide to buy another bull or goat, take it to the priest, and tell him that the sin offering the other day was not done well, and ask him if he would perform the offering once more.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The priest then would slaughter the bull or goat and offer it once more to God, and assure me that the bull or goat had been offered up for my sins.</S>
