   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OBEYING THE LORD S COMMANDMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND HIS MAKING AN ABODE WITH US</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Having the Lord s manifestation is the first step, and His making an abode with us is the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are two sides to the Lord making an abode with us: His coming to abide in us and our abiding in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, this is a matter of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord s manifestation is a matter of joy, whereas His making an abode in us is a matter of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we love the Lord and obey His commandments so that there is no barrier between us, and we obey all that He asks of us, we will have the Lord s manifestation, and we will have joy within.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we continue to love the Lord and obey His commandments, we will not only experience His manifestation; the Lord will also make an abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we argue with the Lord, if we are willing to say, Lord, I let You win.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am willing to surrender, to love You, and to listen to You, we will still experience His manifestation, and He will come to make an abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He will abide in us, and we will abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we will have joy and also rest within.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many Christians have the Lord s manifestation, but few experience the Lord making an abode with them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They love the Lord, but they love Him today and do not love Him tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are willing to listen to Him in one matter but are not willing to listen to Him in another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They often sense the Lord s manifestation but also sense the Lord withdrawing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In one matter they have the Lord s presence, but in another matter the Lord hides Himself from them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They do not have the Lord s manifestation in a consistent way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their experience of the Lord can be compared to a person staying with us for an hour and then leaving.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This kind of manifestation is not continuous.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A person who lives with us and is a member of our family will abide with us in a consistent way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His manifestation to us will not be temporary; it will be a long-term abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This illustration explains why some people have a temporary manifestation of the Lord but do not experience Him making an abode with them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to experience the Lord making an abode with us, we must have an unchanging love toward Him and listen to His words without preference.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some brothers and sisters love the Lord, but they are selective when they listen to His words.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When they feel that they can obey the Lord s command, they do so, and thus, they have the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, when the Lord gives them a command that does not correspond to their preferences, they argue with the Lord and defeat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a result, they lose not only the Lord s presence but also the Lord s making an abode with them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The most precious thing for a believer is to experience not only the Lord s manifestation but also His making an abode with him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not enough for us to have the Lord s presence in individual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should have the Lord s manifestation in our entire living so that the Lord will make an abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He abides in us, and we also abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When He is able to obtain a dwelling place in us and have rest, we are able to obtain a dwelling place in Him and have rest as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We become those who abide with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord abides in us, and we abide in Him; thus, we have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These two matters, the Lord s manifestation and His making an abode, depend on our loving the Lord and obeying His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must know and be able to recite John 14:21-23.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These verses clearly show how we can experience the Lord s manifestation and His coming to make an abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 21 the Lord said, He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both the Father and the Lord Jesus love a person who keeps the Lord s commandments, and They manifest Themselves to him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is entirely a matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we love the Lord and obey His commands, we will have the Lord s manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In verse 23 the Lord said, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we love the Lord and keep His word, He will make an abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE LORD S MANIFESTATION</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>AND HIS MAKING AN ABODE WITH US</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>BRINGING US JOY AND REST</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As Christians we must experience the Lord s manifestation and His making an abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How much has the Lord manifested Himself to you?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How much has the Lord made an abode with you?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the Christian life, and it is an overcoming and sanctified life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You do not have to deal with anything except whether or not the Lord manifests Himself to you and whether or not He makes an abode with you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This kind of spiritual life is very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord s manifestation is something you sense within, and His making an abode with you is also something you can sense within.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever you experience the Lord s manifestation, you will have joy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Likewise, whenever you experience the Lord making an abode with you, you will have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord is real in us, His manifesting Himself to us is also real, and His abiding in us is real.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Furthermore, the Lord who indwells us speaks and makes demands of us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord does not necessarily speak to us when we are listening to a message or reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Often the Lord speaks to us when we are not listening to a message or reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We only need to lean toward Him or love Him, and He will speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Nine times out of ten when He speaks to us, He makes a demand.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes He asks us to put aside our plans either to go somewhere or to obtain something.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sometimes He asks us to give something away or to go along with His will.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Most of the time, His speaking to us is a demand.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Such demands cause us to argue with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If the Lord promised to give us something, we would surely praise the Lord and say, Thank You!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If He gave us something every time He spoke, none of us would have a problem with His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, this is not our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Most of the time the Lord s words to us are demands, either forbidding us or requesting something of us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hence, we are easily aroused to argue with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When He loses and we win, we lose His manifestation, and His face is hidden from us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Furthermore, we have no joy and no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have no peace and no security.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must understand that we have no rest, because the Lord is not making His abode in us, and we are abiding outside of the Lord instead of abiding in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If, by the Lord s grace, we continually obey His demands, His face will be manifested in us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>His face will be toward us continually.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We will touch His presence, and we will be full of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Not only will we have joy; we also will have no problems and no barriers between the Lord and us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He will make an abode with us and dwell in us securely, and He will also cause us to dwell in Him securely.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When we abide in Him, we will be persons who are secure and settled.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then we will not only have joy but also rest.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do you have joy?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Are you secure and at peace within?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The only reason that you would not have joy or be secure or at peace is that there is a dispute between you and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we love the Lord, do not argue with Him, and listen to His words and obey them, He will appear to us moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We will have His face, and we will have joy.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Moreover, He will dwell securely in us and will cause us to dwell securely in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is the way for us to have full rest.</S>
