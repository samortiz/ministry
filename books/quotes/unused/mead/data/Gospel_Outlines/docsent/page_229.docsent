   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Two Hundred Sixty-one GOD COMING AMONG MAN Scripture: John 1:14; 2 Tim 3:16 Two reasons why God came to man He came that man may approach Him.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He came that man may understand Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to do these two things, God had to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Relate the story in The Normal Christian Faith, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>51-53.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God coming among man</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Throughout these six thousand years, only one person has ever been God among us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From Adam to Moses, there is only one person Jesus of Nazareth, who claimed to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If He is God, He must have the following qualifications:</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He must have told us that he was God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He must be superior in words and deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He must have supernatural power.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He must have the words of his prophecies fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only the Lord Jesus satisfies the above four requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the Lord Jesus is God coming to man as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Subject Two Hundred Sixty-two MAN IS SINFUL Scripture: Rom 3:23; 7:18</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God, coming among man to have contact with him, would naturally encounter much difficulty on man s side.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is because the nature of man is corrupted and the behavior of man is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He, being a holy God, has to solve these two problems before He can fellowship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Subject Two Hundred Sixty-three THE WAY OF GOD S SALVATION Scripture: Rom 3:24; 1 Pet 1:4</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since the righteous God wants to fellowship with man, and since man is sinful and corrupted, He needed to find a way to solve the problem of both man s sinful acts and man s sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to solve this problem, He shed His blood for man that man might be redeemed from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He also gave His very life to man that man might be free from his sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>So, His way of salvation needed to be one that, on the negative side, redeemed man from sin, and on the positive side, imparted life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The salvation mentioned in the Bible is indeed of this nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Subject Two Hundred Sixty-four GOD WANTS MAN TO RECEIVE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>HIS WAY OF SALVATION Scripture: Mark 1:15; Acts 2:38; 16:31; Rom 10:9-10</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has completed the work of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Surely He wants man to receive this, since all that He has done is for man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The way to receive this salvation is by repentance and believing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Subject Two Hundred Sixty-five SAVED BY BELIEVING Scripture: Mark 16:16; Acts 16:31; Rom 10:10</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s salvation is, on the one hand, real, and on the other hand, it is already accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When man receives it, he will be immediately saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Subject Two Hundred Sixty-six SALVATION RESULTS IN CHANGE Scripture: Luke 19:8-9</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Use examples to prove this both from the Bible and from what you have seen and experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One good example is the case of Zaccheus.</S>
