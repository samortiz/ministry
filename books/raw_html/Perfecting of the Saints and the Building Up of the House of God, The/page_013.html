<h1 class="title">PERFECTING THE SAINTS TO ARRIVE<br />
AT A FULL-GROWN MAN AND<br />
TO SUBMIT TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE HEAD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CO-WORKERS ALWAYS PERFECTING THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>Wherever the workers are, they must perfect the saints. If the workers replace the saints instead of perfecting them, the church will not be built up. To perfect the saints is to build up the church. In order to perfect the saints, we do not work by ourselves; instead, we work with the saints to teach them to do what we do. Our goal is to perfect the saints until they can replace us. Initially, we work by ourselves, but after a while the saints are able to work with us and are even better than we are. In the process of perfecting the saints, we pass responsibility to them. Initially, we are responsible for the work, but after a while, the saints are responsible. When the saints are responsible for the work, we can leave. This sounds simple, but the principle is crucial. The result of this type of work is the building up of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CO-WORKERS SERVING IN ONE PLACE</h2>
<p>According to my observation our work is short in perfecting the saints. In other words, the element of working with others to perfect them is inadequate. There is another matter that we need to consider seriously before the Lord. When we came to Taiwan, we took the way of a worker serving in a locality for a long time to take care of the church. We took this way because it was convenient. This may have been the right way for us to take in the past, but to continue the work in this way may create problems.</p>
<p>Even though it is beneficial for a worker to stay in one place for a long time, there are also disadvantages. The longer a worker stays in one place, the more likely he is to replace the saints in their function. In other words, a greater part of his work will result in replacing the saints rather than perfecting them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some workers tend to become isolated or even peculiar after they stay in a place for a long time, because they do things by themselves and are not balanced by others. They lack a balanced view of the churches and other workers because they have made decisions and have led and encouraged the saints by themselves.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there may be some loss when a worker travels frequently, but on the other hand, there is much benefit. The more a worker travels, the more he sees, and the broader his view becomes. A broader view is often a balancing factor and a salvation. A worker who stays in one place is bound to become local, narrow, shallow, and peculiar in his view. Hence, it is easy for him not to be balanced. A worker also becomes more subjective the longer he stays in a place. According to our present practice, most places have one main worker. It would not be good for this worker to become subjective. A person who is subjective becomes peculiar and has a narrow view. In all the places that I have visited, I have rarely met a worker who has a very broad view. When we travel, our view is enlarged, and we are balanced by others.</p>
<p>Moreover, when a co-worker stays in one place, the local saints have less of an opportunity to receive fellowship from other gifts. When the supply in a locality always comes from one gift, it is not easy for the saints to receive the supply from other gifts.</p>
<p>In spite of these considerations, it is difficult for us to decide how to deal with this matter. We do not know how the Lord will lead us. It may be that instead of staying in one place, some of the workers should travel frequently to fellowship with and supply the saints. But there are still advantages for a worker to serve in one place. A worker who stays in one place will bear more responsibility and is more likely to carry out specific burdens in a locality. In contrast, a worker who travels all the time may end up with no responsibility and no specific burden. Both sides have their merits and disadvantages.</p>
<p>We need to evaluate every aspect of our situation. Some workers might stay in one place for a long period, and others might spend more time to visit different localities. Regardless of whether we stay in one place or travel frequently, our goal must be to perfect the saints. Some brothers may say that since they are workers, what they do perfects the saints. This may be true, but even the pastors and preachers in the denominations say that their work is to perfect the believers. Their perfecting, however, is different from ours. When we refer to perfecting the saints, we are referring to the perfecting in Ephesians 4:12 that enables the perfected saints to take part in the work of the ministry to build up the church. This is not what Christianity refers to when they speak of edification. Many believers in Christianity are edified by their pastors or preachers, but they are not perfected. The perfecting that we speak of is not merely to edify the believers; it is more than edification, because it has the element of building.</p>
