<h1 class="title">IMPORTANT POINTS<br />
RELATED TO OUR SERVICE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider specific points that are intimately related to us and to our service.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WHAT WE ARE</h2>
<p>There are two main branches in Christianity: old Christianity and new Christianity. Old Christianity includes Roman Catholicism and the Eastern Orthodox Church, and new Christianity refers to Protestantism. There are people in Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism who have been forgiven of their sins and who have been regenerated by the Lord&rsquo;s grace. Thus, they are saved, and they belong to the Lord.</p>
<p>Roman Catholicism has departed from the truth of the Bible, but some who are saved are still there. However, there are more saved ones in Protestantism than in Roman Catholicism. Some may ask whether we are old or new Christianity. We are neither Roman Catholicism nor Protestantism. We are simply saved Christians meeting together to serve God.</p>
<p>We do not want to imitate the practices of Roman Catholicism or of Protestantism. We worship and serve the God in whom we believe according to the Bible. We do not belong to a denomination, nor do we want to become a denomination. We are not a denomination; we are lowly, simple Christians who worship and serve our grace-bestowing God on the ground of the church according to the Bible, the Word of God. We do not care for Roman Catholicism or Protestantism. The living God has put the Bible into our hands, and we believe in Him according to the Bible.</p>
<p>God saved us because we believed into Him, and His Spirit and life entered into us and regenerated us. With such a blessing, we happily serve Him according to His Word, the Bible. We have no stand apart from the Bible. We do not want to be under the influence of any denomination or sect. We want only to serve God according to the Bible. We do not need to oppose the denominations, nor do we want to interfere with their matters. Although we believe that Roman Catholicism and Protestantism have deviated from the Bible in many matters, and we cannot approve of them, there is no need for us to oppose them. This is not our work.</p>
<p>God has not called us to do a negative work but to serve Him positively and in simplicity according to His Word. Even if a person is in a denomination, we will acknowledge him as our brother in the Lord as long as he is saved in the Lord. Even if the denominations misunderstand our ground, we are not a denomination. A person&rsquo;s understanding us is not our basis for acknowledging him as being our brother in the Lord. All that matters is whether he belongs to the Lord, not whether he is Chinese, Caucasian, Protestant, or Catholic. Whether the denominations are willing to serve God with us is not important. We will not interfere with them, and we do not want them to interfere with us. We just want to serve God, to maintain His testimony, and to spread the gospel by His grace. This is our stand.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR BASIS FOR MEETING AND SERVING</h2>
<p>We are not a human organization. This, however, does not mean that we are disorderly or loose. We will now consider the basis for our meeting and serving God together.</p>
<p>Any person can meet and serve with us; we will not turn anyone away. However, before we acknowledge that a person is our brother in the Lord, we must be clear that he has been saved, regenerated. Before acknowledging him as our brother in the Lord, we must be clear that he has repented, received the Lord Jesus, and has God&rsquo;s life. Only those who are saved are our fellow believers. The status of a person&rsquo;s salvation is the first item related to meeting and serving together.</p>
<p>The second item related to meeting and serving together is a person&rsquo;s heart for the Lord. A believer&rsquo;s heart for the Lord may differ from our heart, but we will not criticize him. However, if his heart for the Lord matches ours, that is, if he is willing to be a simple Christian, one who does not belong to a denomination and who serves God according to the Bible, we will recognize him as a fellow serving one.</p>
<p>The third item related to meeting and serving together is the teaching of the Bible. Every denomination in Europe and America has a so-called creed. We do not have a creed; we only have the Bible. We base everything on the Bible and settle all questions with the Bible. Even though we may not have a thorough understanding of the Bible, we aspire to practice all that we understand. In the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we understood only a little, but we served God according to what we understood. However, the more we have seen in the Bible, the more our service has progressed. There is no fixed practice among us, because we base everything on the Bible. We will not practice a teaching that we do not see in the Bible, but we endeavor to practice all that we have seen.</p>
<p>The fourth item related to meeting and serving together is the leading and manifestation of the Holy Spirit in the saints. We do not &ldquo;elect&rdquo; the responsible saints among us. The saints fulfill their service and manifest their function by letting the Spirit reign in them and by growing in life. The brothers who have grown in life under the leading of the Spirit are spontaneously manifested as responsible ones. The brothers or sisters who diligently serve God, the church, and the saints by the gracious leading of the Spirit are spontaneously manifested as well. There is no human organization or arrangement among us. We have only the manifestation of the Spirit in the brothers and sisters. A brother who lets the Spirit work in him unhindered, who loves the Lord fervently, who is willing to pay the price to be broken, who lives for the Lord, and who knows the Lord and His ways will spontaneously be manifested as a responsible one. Similarly, those who follow the Spirit&rsquo;s leading and are constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love to labor and serve the church and the saints will spontaneously serve in the church.</p>
<p>The saints who participate in the service are manifested through the leading of the Spirit and the growth in life. All our service arrangements are based on the manifestation of the Spirit in the saints. We do not want human will or human organization. We let the Spirit make things manifest in the saints.</p>
<p>Our experience in the localities proves that there is no organization among us; we have only the leading and the manifestation of the Spirit. The Spirit has absolute freedom among us, and the saints in whom the Spirit is manifested bear responsibility among us. If a brother in a local church lets the Spirit reign in him so that his spiritual growth and progress are evident, he will be manifested as a leading one among the saints in his locality. No one will object to this; instead, all will praise and thank the Lord for raising up such a brother to care for the church and shepherd the sheep. When a brother is manifested by the Spirit as an elder, the Spirit will immediately confirm in the saints that he is one who possesses Aaron&rsquo;s budding rod with the authority of life (Num. 17:8). The saints who let the Spirit work in them are the leading ones among us. Every saint among us has the opportunity to develop the grace that has been given in an unrestricted and unhindered way.</p>
<p>We do not have organizational limitations, because we are not an organization. In the churches we are not waiting for responsible ones to finish a &ldquo;term&rdquo; before other responsible ones can be added. If a brother stops loving the Lord, becomes cold or backslidden, no longer pursues the Lord desperately, or does not progress spiritually, he will not be a responsible one even if his &ldquo;term of office&rdquo; has not come to an end. No one who bears responsibility among us has a &ldquo;term of office&rdquo; or a &ldquo;term limit.&rdquo; We do not have the dead regulations of human organizations. There are only the leading and manifestation of the Spirit.</p>
<p>If some brothers in a local church love the Lord, and they are willing to accept the Lord&rsquo;s dealings and run in the spiritual course, they will spontaneously become responsible ones in their locality. If the elders and deacons do not similarly pursue, they will fall behind. It is possible for those bearing responsibility to fall behind, even if they are currently running well. We are not bound by the restrictions of dead, organizational regulations. The responsible brothers and sisters in the various localities cannot hinder the leading and manifestation of the Spirit in the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Consequently, the responsible brothers in the churches should not think that they have been &ldquo;appointed for life&rdquo; to be an elder or deacon. Such an attitude is wrong. An elder should bow his head and praise the Lord for His work of grace if the Spirit manifests other brothers who love the Lord more and are more spiritual. An elder should be willing to let such ones take the lead. We must let the Spirit have the full ground and absolute freedom among the saints.</p>
<p>The authority of the church is in the hand of Christ, the Head of the church. It may be that He has not yet gained those who are closer to His heart; hence, He can only put the administrative oversight of the church into our hands temporarily. Then, when He gains those who are more according to His heart and who give the Spirit more ground in their being, He can establish them as authorities in the church. Our human hands cannot limit the work of the Head. In every locality the responsible saints must firmly follow this point. We must never use our position of authority to limit the Lord&rsquo;s leading in the saints or their spiritual development. We must give the saints the opportunity to develop the grace that they have received.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Serving According to Revelation &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
