   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The seventh major item in the history of the universe is that in and through His resurrection, Christ became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen in the previous message that the life-giving Spirit is a compound, as typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The life-giving Spirit has been compounded with God as the base, typified by the one hin of olive oil, and with man, typified by the four spices.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This all-inclusive Spirit is also compounded with all the elements of the process through which God has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this compound there is the death of Christ, signified by myrrh, and the resurrection of Christ, signified by calamus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is also the effectiveness of the death of Christ, signified by cinnamon, and the repelling power of the resurrection of Christ, signified by cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The one hin of oil and the three units of five hundred shekels among the spices signify the unique Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The second unit is split into two, signifying that the Second of the Divine Trinity was split on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the compound Spirit we have God, the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and the uplifted Man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the compound Spirit, we also have Christ's death, the effectiveness of Christ's death, Christ's resurrection, and the repelling power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The compound Spirit is the totality of all of these items.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God, God the Father, God the Son, God the Spirit, the uplifted Man, the death of Christ, the effectiveness of His death, the resurrection of Christ, and the power of His resurrection are compounded together, blended together, to be the compound life-giving Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No Spirit, no effectiveness of the death of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But with the Spirit, Christ's death is here to kill us, to crucify our old man.</S>
