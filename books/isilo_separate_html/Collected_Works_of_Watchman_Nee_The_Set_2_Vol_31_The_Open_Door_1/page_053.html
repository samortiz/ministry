The brothers and sisters (the refugees) in Yuan-Jiang are all safe in the Lord's grace. They are happy and comforted. The Lord has arranged for Brother Gun-jih to teach English at the T'ao Hua Lun Lutheran Secondary School in Yi-Yang. The principal of this school is Mr. Chen Kai-yuan, who was formerly a classmate of our brother at Shanghai University. They had no prior contact with each other. Their encounter in Yi-Yang is really of the Lord's leading. Through him the Lord resolved the burden of living for Brother Chang's family and also enabled him to stand firm for the Lord in Yi-Yang. There is an old sister who loves the Lord in Yi-Yang, Mrs. Chiu Jung-sheng. She has returned from Ch'ang-sha to the countryside for the Lord's sake. She plans to testify for the Lord with Brother Chang. She has taken the task upon herself of providing hospitality to all the brothers and sisters who pass through Yi-Yang. They began to have a prayer meeting last Lord's Day. I hope you will remember them in your prayer. Brother Chang may move his whole family to Yi-Yang. He is still waiting for the Lord's leading.</p><p>Brother Han is in Ch'ang-Teh. There is a start in the work. The Lord's table has already been established. I have heard that there are about twenty brothers and sisters. Brother Lo's school is set up. He has also started a Living Water Tea Room with the purpose of preaching the gospel. Elderly Brother Chu Teh-hsin is the manager and seven students are the waiters. May the Lord flow living waters out through them.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Lan Tsi-yi<br />February 24, in Hankow</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother James Chen,<br />Swatow</h2><p>After working in Jieh-Yang, I returned to Swatow to rest for a few days. I had already accepted the invitation of those in Pao-Tai, so I went there to work for a week. Although the opportunity in Pao-Tai is not as good as that in Jieh-Yang, the Lord taught me to "preach the word in season and out of season." After working in Pao-Tai, I was more tired physically. After ten days of rest and with the prayers of the brothers and sisters, I am much better now. I really thank the Lord for His grace! I have already decided to go out to work in the inland regions again on February 2. Four or five localities have already sent invitations. It will take more than a month to finish. I tremble at the thought of the importance of the work ahead. I can only finish the course to testify of the gospel of grace through the petitions of the brothers and sisters. There were a few brothers in Pao-Tai who sympathized with us. Two of them were baptized. I really hope that place will have an assembly also. The area is peaceful. The brothers and sisters are well and comforted. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />James Chen<br />January 30<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> </body></html>
