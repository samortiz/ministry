<h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>In this volume we will see specifically the types in the Bible that are of great importance with rich significance. The divine revelation in the Bible is not only presented in plain words but also portrayed in types. A picture or portrait is better than a thousand words. In particular, since the revelation in the holy Word concerning the mystery of Christ and the church is spiritual and abstract in nature, it cannot be thoroughly made clear by words; it needs to be portrayed and indicated by figures. Among the types in the divine revelation, the first are the light and the tree of life, which typify Christ as light and life; the significance revealed in these types must be high and great.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE LIGHT</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Typifying Christ as the Light of the Universe</h2><p>First, the light typifies Christ as the light of the universe. The light-bearers, such as the sun and the stars, are merely shadows, but the body is Christ. He is the true light of the universe. He is the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings (Mal. 4:2). He is also the bright morning star (Rev. 22:16b), appearing privately to His lovers before the darkest hour, prior to dawn. Furthermore, He is the great light that dispels the death and shadow in man (Matt. 4:16).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Christ as the Source of All Lights</h2><p>Psalm 36:9b says, &ldquo;In Your light we see light.&rdquo; We can see light only in the light of Christ. When Christ comes to us, He brings light to us that we may know ourselves thoroughly, see our true condition, and realize the corruption of our flesh. If we want light, we must receive Christ and touch Christ. Christ always brings light to us and shines on us in every way (Eph. 5:14). Therefore, Christ is the source of all lights.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Christ as the Light of the World</h2><p>In John 8:12 Jesus spoke to the people, saying, &ldquo;I am the light of the world.&rdquo; Also, in 9:5 He said, &ldquo;While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.&rdquo; As the light of the world, Christ enables us not to remain in darkness but to walk in the day that we may not stumble (John 11:9) or lose our direction, not knowing where we are going (John 12:35). We were once darkness (Eph. 5:8a), but now we have become sons of light by believing into Christ as the light (John 12:36b). We even are the light (Matt. 5:14); that is, we are luminaries holding forth the word of life (Phil. 2:15-16), shining forth Christ to enlighten this dark world.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Christ as the Light of Life</h2><p>Christ as the light is the light of life (John 8:12; 1:4). The entire Bible shows us that life comes from light. When light comes in, life comes in. Where light is, there is life. The amount of light there is determines the measure of life that is present. Genesis chapter one tells us that before the work of God&rsquo;s restoration began, the earth was waste and dark, that is, full of death. Hence, the first step of God&rsquo;s work was to command light to come forth. When light comes, it dispels death, which belongs to darkness, and begins to bring in life. Therefore, life comes after light and begins with light.</p><p>God commanded light to come forth on the first day, issuing in the plant life, which is the lowest life, a life without consciousness. This is a type of Christ as the light of life that shined on us and brought the life of God into us when we were newly saved. However, the life we received then was a life in its initial stage, which is neither solid nor shaped. On the fourth day God commanded the sun, the moon, and the stars to shine forth with a light that is more definite and concrete than the light of the first day. Consequently, a higher life was brought in; not only was there the life of animals such as birds, fish, and beasts, but there was the life of man, who is like God. This signifies that we have received a stronger, more definite, and more solid enlightening, and the life in us grows and bears a shape, which means that Christ has grown and is &ldquo;formed&rdquo; in us (Gal. 4:19). Finally, on the seventh day God, signified by the tree of life, came forth, and as the highest light He brought the life of God, which is the highest life, signified by the tree of life. When light shines to its utmost degree, life also reaches its apex. When light is perfect, life also is complete. This signifies that when Christ as the light of life shines within us to the utmost degree, our spiritual life becomes full and mature to the extent that we are exactly like God. This is the highest result of Christ as the light of life imparting life to man.</p><p>Furthermore, the light of life indicates that light issues from life and belongs to life. Where life is, there is light. Christ first came to be our life, and then this life became the light in us (John 1:4-5). This light of life is subjective and inward, and it is within us.</p>
