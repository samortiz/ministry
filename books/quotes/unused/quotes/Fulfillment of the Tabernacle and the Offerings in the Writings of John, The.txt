As we proceed chapter by chapter through the Gospel of John, our concern will be with what we may call the extract of each chapter
An extract may be understood as a liquid extracted from a plant or other organic matter and that contains its essence in concentrated form
A synonym for extract is 'spirit,' which is the essence of a substance extracted in liquid form, especially by distillation
Many teachers and expositors say that the first eighteen verses of John 1 are a prologue, an introduction, to the entire Gospel
After further study of this Gospel, we have come to realize that all of chapter one is an introduction or prologue to the Gospel of John
Often the introduction to a book is actually an extract of the book, for it usually gives the reader a brief outline of the book as a whole
The extract of John 1 includes six matters: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb of God, the dove, the stone, and the house of God
The first of these six items, the Word, is found in verse 1, and the last, the house of God, Bethel, in verse 51
In Matthew we see that the Lord Jesus is the King; in Mark, that He is a servant; and in Luke, that He is a Man
The Lord's death is, on the negative side, to take away our sins, and, on the positive side, to impart life into us
If we do not see the mystery of Christs redemptive work we shall not know the significance of the blood and water flowing out from His side
God told Moses to lift up a brass serpent on their behalf for God's judgment so that by looking upon that brass serpent all might live
John 2:11 says, 'This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory, and His disciples believed in Him'
We may know all the miracles recorded in this Gospel, but we may not have seen that these all are signs of mysteries
If we tell them that we, the living members of Christ, are God's sanctuary, they would say, 'What are you talking about?
Now we must go on to see that the One who is the tabernacle and the offerings has become the life-giving Spirit signified by the dove
The tabernacle signifies that through incarnation God became a man, mingled Himself with humanity, and became His own dwelling place
Everyone who takes the offerings and enters into God, having the divine life imparted into him, eventually becomes a stone
In God's new creation we, the believers in Christ, will be transformed into stones for the building up of God's dwelling place, Bethel
As a result, the believers are regenerated and gradually transformed into stones for the building up of the house of God
Certainly here in the writings of John we have the fulfillment of the types of the tabernacle and the offerings in the Old Testament
The type of the tabernacle in the Old Testament was fulfilled by the defined God coming to mingle Himself with man in the flesh
Let us be impressed that the defined God becoming incarnate to mingle Himself with humanity is the fulfillment of the type of the tabernacle
One well-known hymn, written by Charles Wesley, opens with the words, 'Hark, the herald angels sing, Glory to the newborn King'
Like so many others, this hymn is a praise concerning the birth of Jesus mainly according to the Gospels of Matthew and Luke
It is easier to write hymns according to what is written in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, because these Gospels are not so mysterious
Because the incarnation of the defined God as presented in John is very mysterious, it is difficult to write a hymn on this subject
Today we have the reality of the tabernacle and the reality of all the offerings by means of which we may enter into the incarnated God
According to what is revealed in chapter fourteen, through death and resurrection He becomes the life-giving Spirit
When the Spirit of reality comes to be in us, the Lord Himself comes to dwell in us, for He has become the life-giving Spirit
In this message we shall give a preliminary word regarding the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God
Some expositors and Bible teachers say that the Word in John 1:1 refers to the concept of the Logos in Greek philosophy
The Word in John 1:1 refers to the defined God, the explained God, the expressed God, the revealed God, the God made known to human beings
In order to know God, you need to read Christ, study Christ, behold Christ, contemplate Christ, gaze on Christ
If we would know God, on the one hand we need to contemplate this living Person and, on the other hand, we need to study the Book
How, then, could we say that the fullness of the Godhead includes only God the Son and not also God the Father and God the Spirit?
In the beginning, that is, in eternity past, the Word that defined God, explained God, and revealed God, was with God
In the four Gospels we see Christ as the tabernacle, and at the end of the Gospels we see Him crucified as the Lamb of God
After accomplishing redemption as the Lamb, Christ was resurrected and came as the Dove, as the life-giving Spirit
In this message we shall cover a number of basic matters regarding John's writings, the Gospel of John in particular
Throughout the centuries teachers and expositors have agreed that Johns writings were the last of the New Testament writings to be completed
The Gospel of John, the Epistles of John, and the book of Revelation were the last books of the Bible to be written
John's Epistles consummate all the other Epistles, and John's Revelation consummates the entire New Testament, even the entire Bible
The Gospel of John is both supplementary and consummating, for it unveils the divine side of the wonderful Person of Christ
Because the veil has been taken away, we can see that Christ is on the throne in the heavens carrying out God's administration
Some theologians say that John's writings are conciliatory in reconciling doctrinal controversies concerning Christ's Person
Another school of thought claimed that Christ was human and not divine, that He was merely a good man but not God
Those who do not see Christ's all-inclusiveness can be compared to blind men touching different parts of an elephant
If Christ were not a creature as well as the Creator, how could He be a man with a body of flesh, blood, and bones?
It is the blood of Jesus that redeems us, and it is the divinity of the Son of God that insures the eternal efficacy of this redeeming blood
Because He is both human and divine, both a creature and the Creator, He had the blood to shed for our redemption
Those who condemn us falsely for teaching pantheism say, 'Witness Lee teaches that grass, water, air, sunshine, and wind are all God
The mystery of the divine life includes the fellowship of the divine life, the divine anointing, the divine birth, and the divine seed
Even now, Christ, the Lamb on the throne, is the mysterious Administrator, the mysterious center of God's universal administration
Other divine matters are regeneration, resurrection, reproduction, sanctification, building up, and glorification
In this prologue we have the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb of God, the Dove upon the Lamb, the stone, and the house of God
With the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house we have the extracts of chapter one of John's gospel
John reveals that, on the one hand, the Word is eternal, uncreated, but that, on the other hand, He became flesh, something created by God
Concerning this, John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
Also, according to Hebrews 1:3, Christ is the effulgence of God's glory and the express image of His substance
The shining gold and the acacia wood signify respectively the divine nature of Christ and His human nature, His humanity
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit were embodied in the tabernacle, and this embodiment is God's dwelling among men
We may enjoy Him as our life supply, signified by the bread on the showbread table, and as our light, signified by the lampstand
The tabernacle we have today will have a consummation, and the consummate tabernacle will be the New Jerusalem
The Lamb of God signifies the Word in the flesh as the representation of all the offerings to accomplish God's full redemption
Through Christ as the Lamb of God representing all the offerings, we may enter into God and participate in the divine life and nature
We may boldly come into God, knowing that God does not have the right to reject us, because we come through the Lamb
According to John 1:32, John the Baptist testified, saying, 'I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him'
John the Baptist could testify that he saw a heavenly Dove descending upon the Lamb of God and abiding upon this Lamb
According to John 1:42, when the Lord Jesus first looked at Peter, He said, 'You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas '
The significance of a stone is that it denotes a work of transformation to bring forth material for God's building
As the universal ladder, Christ brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven and thereby makes God and man one for eternity
We may say that the measure of the universe is Christ Himself for in Pauls words Christ is the breadth the length the height and the depth
For this reason, after thirty-three and a half years on earth, He suddenly told His disciples that He was going away
After dying to accomplish redemption, the Lord changed His form and in resurrection became the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit
The consummation of the church will be the New Jerusalem, the tabernacle of God in its consummation, in eternity
Now the divine life with the divine nature has been imparted into our being to make us stones and to build us together to be the church
The six signs in John 1the Word the tabernacle the Lamb the Dove the stone and the house of Godcover the entire central line of Gods economy
Apparently, the Lord's word concerning the temple has nothing to do with the incident of the changing of water into wine
After the Lord cleansed the temple , 'the Jews then answered and said to Him, What sign will you show us, seeing that you do these things'?
In response to their word concerning a sign, the Lord said for them to destroy this temple and that He would raise it up in three days
According to John 2:20, the Jews then said, 'It took forty-six years to build this temple, and you will raise it up in three days'?
The religious ones did not realize that the Lord Jesus was saying that His physical body, not the temple in Jerusalem, was the real temple
The temple in Jerusalem was destroyed by Titus, but the body of Jesus was 'destroyed' by the Jews when they had Him crucified
The wording here is different from the record in the synoptic Gospels, which for the most part say that God will raise up the Lord Jesus
We are told clearly that the incident of the changing of water into wine was a sign: 'This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee'
In the second chapter of John we have two signs: the changing of water into wine and the resurrection of Christ
John's use of signs in writing his Gospel can be compared to our use of letters to make words and of words to write an article
By the use of these two expressions John indicates that the two signs in chapter two are both related to the Lord's resurrection
It was in resurrection that the Lord Jesus came to the weak and fragile people in Cana of Galilee-a despised place
In John 6 the Lord Jesus revealed that He is the living bread, the bread of God that came down out of heaven to give life to the world
Whether this 'wedding' is genuine or not genuine, long lasting or lasting a short time, every day we have some kind of wedding
Parents may find it hard to believe the positive change that has taken place in their children over the period of a few years
Our living as Christians is simply a matter of the changing of death into life for the building up of the mystical Body of Christ
The entire Christian life consists of two matters: changing death into life and building up the mystical Body of Christ
We have a living of the eternal life, the eternal zoe, for the purpose of building up the mystical Body of Christ
We shall all enjoy an inner, mutual understanding concerning the changing of death into life for the building up of the Body of Christ
To be sure this life is neither physical life nor psychological life not even merely spiritual life it is divine life the very life of God
We may not be able to define the mysterious matter of the divine life, the life of God, but this life exists, and it is a mystery
We have seen that in chapter one of John there are six signs: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God
The first sign, the changing of water into wine, sets forth the principle of life, which is to change death into life
The second sign, that of rebuilding the destroyed temple, shows us the goal of life, which is to build up God's dwelling place on earth
The overall subject of all the extracts in the Gospel of John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings
The first mention of the tabernacle in the Gospel of John is in 1:14: 'The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us'
The only thing that can keep you in the tabernacle is the fact that you are built into it and you thus become a part of its composition
The materials that have been built into the meeting hall, especially the beams and the columns, never leave it
The point we are making is that the rebuilt temple in chapter two of John includes us all and is built with us all
If we did not have the signs in the Gospel of John, we would not be able to have a deep understanding of the types in Exodus
According to the signs in John 2, the way we are built into the temple is through the changing of death into life
The second sign in John 2, that of the rebuilt temple, depends on the first sign, that of changing water into wine
If water is not changed into wine, that is, if death is not changed into life, it will be impossible for the destroyed temple to be rebuilt
Now we can see things that are even deeper, richer, and more significant than what we covered in the Life-study of this Gospel
When we say that regeneration is a mystery, unbelieving scientists would say that this is altogether something unreal
Young people, since you have been regenerated, have your parents not had difficulty explaining certain things that have happened to you?
Anyone who claims to be a Christian but who does not have the sign of regeneration is a pseudo-Christian, a false believer
In the first birth we pass through the water in our mother's womb, and in the second birth we are born of the Holy Spirit
Can you imagine that when the Lord Jesus was speaking to Nicodemus, an elderly man, He was referring to the water of our mother's womb?
Water was the central concept of the ministry of John the Baptist, that is, to terminate people of the old creation
Nicodemus, a leading Pharisee, must have been familiar with the word of John the Baptist concerning water and the Spirit
John was the forerunner of My ministry and introduced to you the matters of baptism in water and in the Spirit
The Lord went on to say to Nicodemus, 'That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit'
The Lord spoke this word in reply to what Nicodemus had said in verse 4: 'How can a man be born when he is old?
Regarding the new birth he was foolish and blind thinking that regeneration involved returning to the mothers womb to be born a second time
The Lord seemed to be telling Nicodemus, 'Because that which is born of the flesh is flesh, you should let it be buried and forget about it
The Lord's word here indicates that a regenerated person is like the wind, which can be realized but which is beyond understanding
John 3:14 says, 'And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up'
Numbers 21:5 says, 'The people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?
As a result, 'the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died'
In the sight of God the rebellious Israelites had become serpents, and those evil serpents were condemned and rejected by God
They were all serpents, and there was the need of a serpent to become their substitute to be judged by God for them
If that brass serpent had the poison of a real serpent, it could not have been a substitute for the serpentine people
The Lord told Moses to lift up this brass serpent on a pole and have the serpent-bitten children of Israel look at it
We as dead serpents need a substitute, someone with the form of a serpent but without the poisonous element of the serpent
According to Romans 8:3, God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin and condemned sin in the flesh
He was lifted up not as the Creator, but as a creature, even as a creature that was in the form of the flesh of sin
The point we are emphasizing here is that the brass serpent in 3:14 is a sign not only to Nicodemus, but to us all
We all must realize that, in the sight of God, we are serpents full of the poison of the Devil, the old serpent
Why did the Lord Jesus become a 'brass serpent' to be lifted up on the cross for us so that we may have eternal life?
It is significant that there is no mention of the bride in chapter two, and no mention in chapter three of the changing of water into wine
By this we see that it was John the Baptist, the forerunner of the Lord Jesus, who spoke in 3:29 concerning the bride and the bridegroom
It indicates that all regenerated persons are components of the bride who will be married to the Lord Jesus as the Bridegroom
It is correct to say that the goal is that we may enter into the kingdom of God and become members of the Body of Christ
The Greek word rendered 'for' here, gar, is often used in a very significant way, especially in the writings of Paul
We may say that the Bible teaches two main things: the law of the old dispensation and the grace of the new dispensation
We are not told here that God gave us some kind of unmerited favor; we are told that He gave us a Person, His Son
We have seen that 3:16 begins with 'for' and that this indicates that here we have an explanation of the foregoing word
John 3:14 says, 'And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up'
If the Son of Man had not been lifted up in the form of a brass serpent, it would not be possible for eternal life to be given to anyone
John made it clear that He had come to baptize in water, but the One who was coming would baptize His believers in the Spirit
John seemed to be saying, 'The One who is greater than I, He who is coming after me, will baptize you in the Spirit
For centuries Christians have paid attention to this conclusion as if it were something separate from the foregoing verses
Nicodemus knew that if he were seen talking to the Lord Jesus, he might be condemned and put to shame by the other Pharisees
The Lord seemed to be saying, 'The fact that you call Me a rabbi indicates that you want to receive more teachings, more doctrines
When the Lord told him of the necessity to be born anew, Nicodemus said to Him, 'How can a man be born when he is old?
Notice that the Lord did not explain to Nicodemus what it means to be born of water and the Spirit; neither did Nicodemus ask about this
John the Baptist had said that he baptized in water but that the One coming after him would baptize in the Spirit
In the following verse, the Lord said that He is the One who descended out of heaven and who is still in heaven
In chapter one we have the tabernacle and the offerings as the way to enter into this tabernacle, the incarnated God
In John 1 we see that God came in incarnation to be the tabernacle and also came as the offerings for us to enjoy
The One whom Nicodemus contacted that night was the incarnated God to be received by us so that we may enter into Him
When Nicodemus referred to the Lord Jesus as a teacher sent from God, the Lord told him that he needed to be born again
Nicodemus, this indicates that no matter how good, gentle, and qualified you may be, you must realize that you have a serpentine nature
3:16 is the issue of 3:14; that is, the receiving of eternal life is the issue of the uplifting of the brass serpent
In John 1 and 3 God is not merely the Creator; He has become incarnated to be the tabernacle into which we may enter
John 3:14 says, 'And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up'
The Lord seemed to be saying to Nicodemus, 'You are a teacher of Israel, and surely you must have taught the story in Numbers 21
We know from Numbers 21:9 that 'it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived'
The brass serpent was a substitute for all the children of Israel who had been bitten by the fiery serpents and who had become serpentine
All the children of Israel were judged by God when their substitute, the brass serpent, was lifted up on the pole and judged by Him
The Bible does not say that the children of Israel were healed by looking at the brass serpent; it says that they were made alive
The serpent is mentioned in John 3 in such a way as to indicate that we, fallen human beings, are all serpentine
To be sure, when Nicodemus came to the Lord Jesus that night, he certainly did not have any realization that he was serpentine
Nicodemus said, 'Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him'
In the conversation between Nicodemus and the Lord Jesus there were two sides, the side of Nicodemus and the side of the Lord
No doubt, the Lord's word about being born anew was puzzling to such a religious and ethical person as the elderly Nicodemus
The Lord seems to be saying, 'Even if you could go back again and again to your mother's womb to be born, you would still be flesh'
We have seen that water is the central concept of the ministry of John the Baptist, that is, to terminate those of the old creation
Spirit is the central concept of the ministry of the Lord Jesus, that is, to germinate people in the new creation
In 3:5 the Lord was saying to Nicodemus, 'You need to be buried in the water spoken of by John the Baptist in his ministry
In answer to Nicodemus question the Lord said that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up
In Matthew 23:33 He called them 'serpents, brood of vipers,' the offspring of the most poisonous kind of serpents
Every one of the millions of persons who believes in the Lord Jesus has received the Spirit, the immeasurable Spirit
The Lamb satisfies the requirements of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory, for the Lamb is pure, perfect, and without blemish
As the Lord was speaking to Nicodemus He indicated to him that He Himself would be lifted up as the brass serpent to be Nicodemus Substitute
In a sense, the sisters are more vital and necessary for the fulfillment of God's purpose than the brothers are
Do you remember when the children of Israel were bitten by serpents in the wilderness, and they cried out to Moses?
When the serpent bit Adam in the garden of Eden, he gained the entire human race, and all of mankind became his increase
Praise the Lord that He came in the likeness of the flesh of sin and was nailed to the cross in the form of a serpent!
According to Hebrews 2:14, through His death on the cross, Christ destroyed the Devil, the one who had the authority of death
When we put all these verses together, we can realize that when the Lord Jesus was lifted up on the cross, He was the brass serpent
In the past we were part of Satan's increase, but we praise the Lord that we have become part of the increase of Christ
Immediately after the wedding, this universal couple will fight against Satan and his followers, the beast and the false prophet
The subject of all these messages is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the writings of John
With the tree of knowledge in the garden of Eden there was not only the knowledge of evil, but also the knowledge of good
After we were saved and became genuine Christians, we became religious, and we tried to live a religious, ethical, moral, and good life
We must be able to testify that in a way that is actual and practical we have been terminated crucified and that now Christ is living in us
When we live Christ and walk according to the living Spirit, we become the bride and spontaneously we are built up
Rather, it would be easy for us to pray, praise the Lord, or testify of what we have experienced of the Lord during the day
When we have this kind of living, then in reality we are serpentine beings in the process of transformation into the bride of Christ
These mysteries include the mystery of the divine Person, the mystery of the divine life, and the mystery of the divine birth
If we neglect the mysteries in the writings of John, we may take what is revealed in the Bible and use it to form a religion
According to the Bible, Christians teach that there is a God and that this God is triune-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
He was resurrected, and He has ascended to the heavens, where as the Lord of all He is now sitting at the right hand of God
It is common for Christians to speak of everlasting life rather than eternal life, according to the King James Version
The indwelling of Christ involves two mysteries: the mystery of the divine life and the mystery of the divine Spirit
Because the majority of believers do not live in their regenerated being, regeneration is not a reality to them in their daily living
For some, the term 'the Spirit' has been spoiled by the talk about the baptism in the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues
John 3:16 says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son and that everyone who believes in Him will have eternal life
There are a number of matters in John 3 concerning which the majority of Christians have very little realization
We may have read chapter three of John again and again without paying attention to the brass serpent in verse 14
Because we, as fallen people, are serpentine, it was necessary for Christ to have the form of a serpent but not its nature
All the requirements of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory were fulfilled by Christ as the Lamb of God without blemish
The first is that the sin offering must fulfill all the requirements of God, the requirements of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory
If He had had the sinful nature, then He also would have needed a substitute, for He would not have been qualified to be our Substitute
If Christ did not have the likeness of the flesh of sin, the form of a sinner, He could not have been our Substitute
On the one hand, Christ fulfilled the requirements of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory and thereby accomplished redemption for us
The realization that regeneration takes place in the human spirit is very much lacking among today's believers
The bride is the aggregate of regenerated persons, and the Bridegroom is Christ with whom all regenerated persons should be one
It is important for us to know that the regenerated part of our being is the reproduction, the multiplication, of Christ
Speaking in a general way, we may say that those who believe in Christ and who have been regenerated are the increase of Christ
That way of speaking is part of the serpentine being, and the serpentine being cannot be part of Christ's bride, His increase
Although John 3 is often used by Christians for teaching and preaching, most believers do not give adequate attention to these eight matters
The people are serpentine, the increase is universal, Christ is unlimited, the Spirit is immeasurable, and the life is eternal
In verse 14 the Lord said to him, 'And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up'
If we do not live in our spirit, then surely we shall live in our serpentine nature, no matter whether what we do is good or bad
Our regenerated human spirit is part of the increase of Christ, and this increase is Christ's multiplication and reproduction
When some hear that Christ is the unique One loved by the Father, they may point out that John 3:16 tells us that God so loved the world
John 3:35 says not only that the Father loves the Son, but also that the Father has given all things into the Son's hand
Christ is the unique object of the Father's love and also the unique recipient of the gifts given by the Father
Have you ever heard that the Spirit is God's essence and that this essence is conveyed through God's spoken word?
Many of us can testify that as a result of listening to the genuine ministry of the Word, we receive the essence of God
As a waiter serves others with food, so those who minister the Word of God should serve the saints with the essence of God
Only He is loved by the Father, has been given all by the Father, and has been sent by the Father to speak God into us
We can testify that if we handle the Word of God rightly and digest it in our spirit, we shall be filled with the Spirit of God
The unique way for us to become the universal increase of the unlimited Christ is to receive the Spirit and be filled with the Spirit
The genuine filling of the Spirit is by taking the Word of God in a proper way through the exercise of our spirit
We shall not experience the filling of the Spirit by merely studying the Word in order to stimulate our mentality
We need to exercise our spirit to receive God's written Word so that it may become the present, spoken word to us
The word 'immeasurable' not only denotes the sphere of the Spirit, but also denotes the contents and nature of the Spirit
The immeasurable Spirit is actually the all-inclusive compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25
The immeasurable Spirit as the all-inclusive compound Spirit is not simply the Spirit of power or the Spirit of life
We do not yet have the spiritual culture necessary to have the language adequate to describe fully the immeasurable, all-inclusive Spirit
They say that as Adam became a living soul through creation, so Christ became a living Spirit through resurrection
Before He was resurrected and while His body was still in the tomb, Christ's spirit went to Tartarus to make such a declaration
In this booklet we point out that according to 1 Corinthians 15:45, the last Adam, who is Christ, became a life-giving Spirit
Whether the article is definite or indefinite, the last Adam, who is Christ Himself, became a Spirit who gives life
Eventually, He indicated that in order to be life as the bread of life, He must be the Spirit, for it is the Spirit who gives life
To put the matter another way, do you believe that besides the Spirit of Christ there is another Spirit called the Holy Spirit?
After His resurrection, through His resurrection, and in His resurrection, Christ became such a life-giving Spirit
The truth is that there is only one divine Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, who gives life
Because these creeds are not complete, some Christian groups declare that the only creed they hold to is the Bible
Because of the influence of tradition, if we speak of Christ in the Spirit, others may think that Christ is separate from the Spirit
When the unlimited Christ is applied to us, appreciated by us, and enjoyed by us, He is the immeasurable Spirit
Eternal life is the essence of the Triune God becoming the element of the church the bride and the bride is the universal increase of Christ
In chapter one we have six signs: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God, Bethel
In chapter two we have two genuine, typical signs: the changing of water into wine and the raising up of the temple
Although the signs in chapters one, two, and three are typical and genuine, the two signs in chapter four are traditional
In a sense, the signs of the well and the mountain in John 4 are a mixture, for they are related to the territory of Samaria
The Assyrians captured Samaria and brought people from Babylon and other heathen places to the cities of Samaria
At that mountain there was a double blessing because it was a gift of the forefather, Jacob, and it was the place of God's blessing
The pagans brought in idol worship and mixed their worship with that of the worship of God practiced by the Jews
In principle, it is the same as that practiced on Mount Gerizim: it is a mixture of pagan things with worship in the name of the true God
No matter how genuine or typical a tradition may be, as long as it is a tradition, it cannot satisfy man's thirst
Her trust was altogether in these two traditions, in the well for human living and in the mountain for the worship of God
There is an interest among some Christians in returning to the so-called historic church, that is, in returning to traditional things
We should not trust in our Bible knowledge, in our past experience, or in traditional teachings we have received from others
We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that no well, regardless how genuine, typical, and ancient it is, can quench our thirst
Our thirst can be quenched only by the living Person of the Son of God, who has been given by God to be the spring welling up within us
They may know about their 'well,' but they may not know the living Person, Jesus Christ, as the living water within them
She did not preach about any kind of 'well,' and she did not preach justification by faith in an old, traditional way
After every message she would go immediately to the main entrance of the chapel and talk with those who were passing by
Insulted by the way this evangelist had spoken to him, the Lutheran pastor went home and spent much of the night plotting how to kill her
Some may claim that they know all about the seed of the woman in Genesis 3 or about the names of the Lord in Isaiah 9:6
In the foregoing message we began to consider the two traditional signs in John 4: Jacob's well and Mount Gerizim
That served to strengthen the concept held by the Samaritans that Mount Gerizim was the proper place for the worship of God
When a temple was built on Mount Gerizim by Manasseh, the mixture in worship was not only strengthened but also completed
The Lord Jesus first pointed out to the Samaritan woman that Jacob's well cannot satisfy man's thirst in his human life
The Lord Jesus indicated that the mountain on which the Samaritans worship cannot provide the kind of worship that is satisfying to God
Among today's Christians, many have not found satisfaction for their thirst, and their worship does not satisfy God
Under the authority of pagan rulers the things of paganism have been mixed with the things of Christian faith and worship
In the Old Testament Mount Zion, the place of God's habitation and the place of His name, was a type of the human spirit
The genuine worship of the Father, the worship He desires, is the worship of Him in our spirit, as typified by the worship on Mount Zion
Whenever you come to a church meeting, you should come with Christ as your sin offering and also as your burnt offering or meal offering
Although we do not follow such an order in our worship, we still may be too much under the influence of tradition
He indicated to her that she needed the living Son of God as the fountain to become a spring of water welling up within her
According to traditional teaching, we should worship God the Father in the name of Jesus Christ the Son by the power of the Holy Spirit
Whenever we come to a meeting of the church, we should come not in a ritual or form-we should come in our spirit
Whenever we are about to come to a church meeting, we should stir up our spirit so that our spirit may be 'lifed' in a full way
In His conversation with the Samaritan woman the Lord pointed her to the two spirits-the divine Spirit and the human spirit
In our human life we need Christ as the living water, and in our church life we need Christ as the reality of the offerings
Of tradition, rituals, or forms, we shall have a life in which we are satisfied and a worship that satisfies the Father
Christ is both the means and the element used by God to produce His dwelling place for the carrying out of His divine economy
In order for Christ to be the means and the element for God's dwelling place, He must be the tabernacle and the offerings
If we see this, eventually we shall realize that the tabernacle and all the offerings are the structure of this universal mystery
The sixty-six books of the Bible are, in a very real sense, condensed into one book, and this book is the Gospel of John
In our Life-study of the Scriptures we have completed all the New Testament books with the exception of Mark, Luke, Acts, and James
Some of these messages point out that if you do not know how to deal with your husband or wife, Christ is the way
How can we have the forgiveness of sins and deal with indwelling sin, that we may participate in the enjoyment of God?
According to this understanding of John 14:6, the Lord Jesus is saying that apart from Him there is no way to heaven
He is telling us that He is the way for us, God's creatures who have been redeemed by His blood, to enter into God
The traditional well cannot satisfy us in our human life, and the traditional mountain cannot satisfy God in the matter of worship
We have seen that in John 1 there are six signs: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God
In chapter two there are two signs: the changing of water into wine and the raising up of the destroyed temple
In chapter four we have another illustration, that of the Samaritan woman, an immoral woman who was seeking satisfaction in her life
In John 10:22 we read of the feast of Dedication, a feast held in addition to the seven feasts mentioned in Leviticus 23
We may also say that the days of death became the days of life, because the Jews passed out of death into life
That feast commemorated the cleansing and recovering of the temple by Judas Maccabaeus, approximately one hundred sixty years before Christ
Modern chronologists have concluded that, according to the chronology in the Bible, the feast of the Jews here must be the feast of Purim
According to the record of the four Gospels, we know that the ministry of the Lord Jesus lasted for more than three years
It was necessary for John in his Gospel, a book concerning the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings, to speak about the feasts
John 5:2 says, 'Now there is in Jerusalem at the sheepgate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches'
The sheepgate, one of the gates of the city of Jerusalem, signifies the door to traditional religion's sheepfold
The pool of Bethesda signifies that the religious people, who tried their best to keep their religion, realized their need for God's mercy
The number five denotes responsibility, and the five porches here signify traditional religion's shelter depending on man's responsibility
After the Lord healed and enlivened him, he could carry his bed, and he no longer needed to lie under the cover of the porch
Verse 3 says, 'In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, withered, waiting for the stirring of the water'
Verse 4 speaks of an angel of the Lord: 'For an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool and stirred up the water
Whoever then stepped in first after the stirring up of the water was made well of whatever disease he was held by'
No matter how often the angel came and stirred up the water, this stirring up would not be effective for a dead person
The stirring up of the water to make people well signifies the traditional practices of religion that attempt to make people perfect
In your church life you may depend on a particular practice to stir up the water with the thought that this practice will make you perfect
John 5:10 says, 'The Jews then said to the one who was healed, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to pick up your bed'
The Jews told the one who had been enlivened by the living Son of God that it was not lawful for him to pick up his bed on the Sabbath
He had been carried by that bed for thirty-eight years, and now that he had been healed, he was able to carry it instead
The religion that condemned Him in John 5 was not a heathen religion, nor a religion of mixture such as that practiced by the Samaritans
We should not think that, because the church life is real and genuine and not a mixture, it in itself can do something for us
The Lord said concerning John the Baptist, 'He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light'
John 539 says You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life and it is these that testify concerning Me
Many read the Bible without obtaining any life supply, because they study the Bible apart from the living Son of God
He is not only our feast of Passover, Pentecost, and tabernacles; He is also our feast of Purim, the feast of our lot and destiny
Because Christ is the real Word of God, we must come to Him when we read the Bible, instead of coming to the Scriptures apart from Him
Because Christ is the unique One who can give us life, we need to contact Him day by day and even moment by moment
It is of vital importance that we see that no holy thing, no religious thing, no spiritual thing, no traditional thing, can replace Christ
Only the present Christ, the living Christ, the Christ we are enjoying and experiencing at this very moment, can be our genuine help
John 5 reveals that only Christ, the living Son of God, is the real fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings
In chapter three of the Gospel of John we see Christ as the brass serpent, as the Bridegroom, and as the all-inclusive One
In chapter four we see Christ as the fountain of living water and as the reality with which we render genuine worship to God
John is unique in taking the miracle of the feeding of the five thousand as a basis for speaking concerning Christ as the bread of life
John told us that in writing his Gospel he selected certain things done by the Lord Jesus and used them in composing this book
The principle of life is to change death into life, and the goal of life is to produce the dwelling place of God in resurrection
With the case of the Samaritan woman we see someone who needs Christ to be the source of her life and the means for her to worship God
People need a new birth with a new life in order to be a new man so that they may become part of Christ's increase
We have seen that the word Bethesda means the house of mercy and that Christ Himself is the real house of mercy
Even the holy Scriptures, though inspired by God, are empty apart from Christ, for without Christ there is no eternal life in the Scriptures
The divine truth revealed in the Gospel of John is actually the Triune God embodied in Jesus Christ and expressed through Him
If you are involved with religion, therefore, that is a strong indication that you are sick, lame, blind, or withered
In His mercy the Lord had come in to recover the covenant that had been broken by the idolatry of the children of Israel
That was the reason the Lord told Moses to hew out two tablets of stone and come up to the mountaintop to meet with Him
The Ten Commandments are in Exodus 20, and chapters twenty-one through twenty-three of Exodus are concerned with the ordinances
If we enjoy Christ, this enjoyment will cause the borders of the good land to be enlarged, and it will keep the enemy away
God, however, spoke to him about the feasts, the Sabbath, and about five conditions for feasting with the Lord
The important point here is that in Exodus 34 God's concern was that His people would enjoy Him by feeding on Him
In their reading of the Bible, the majority of Christians do not see anything concerning the enjoyment of the Lord by feeding on Him
The brother and the sister reading the book of Ephesians do not see anything concerning the enjoyment of the Lord
Not only are the things in the secular world annulled, but even all the things in the religious world are annulled
The barley loaves of the plant life signify the generating aspect of Christ's life, and the fishes signify the redeeming aspect of His life
In His redeeming life, as typified by the two fishes, Christ lived a victorious life in the 'death water' of the sinful world
In 627 He says Do not work for the food which perishes but for the food which abides to eternal life which the Son of Man shall give you
In verse 40 He goes on to say For this is the will of My Father that every one who sees the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life
The Lord went on to tell them not to work for the food which perishes, but to work for the food which abides to eternal life
Chapter six of the Gospel of John is unique in giving many details concerning the Lord Jesus as the bread of life
As the bread of life He is the bread that came down out of heaven He is the bread of God He is the living bread and He is the true bread
We have five characteristics of the Lord as our bread heavenly bread the bread of God the bread of life the living bread and the true bread
The bread of life refers to the nature of the bread, which is life; the living bread refers to the condition of the bread, which is living
Even though you may hear many messages on life, you still may not be deeply impressed that you need Christ as your daily life supply
The burden in these messages is to point out that the Bible is not merely for teaching-the Bible is for life and life supply
We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that we need Christ as the true bread of life sent by God to bring us eternal life
In verse 33 Christ refers to Himself as the bread of God, who came down out of heaven and gives life to the world
When we receive Him as the crucified and resurrected Savior, the Spirit who gives life comes into us to impart eternal life to us
To eat the Lord's flesh and to drink His blood, therefore, is to receive the Lord's flesh and blood into our being
To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life
When they come to Christ's resurrection and ascension, many Christians become somewhat unclear, and their understanding is vague
He came forth in resurrection, He ascended to the heavens, and He is now on the throne at the right hand of God
They could not understand how it was possible for the Lord to give them His flesh to eat and His blood to drink
We are also told that the Jews 'contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat'?
The Lord explains that what He would give us to eat is not the meat of His physical body; the meat, which is the flesh, profits nothing
Today the incarnated crucified resurrected and ascended Christ is the lifegiving Spirit and this lifegiving Spirit is embodied in the Word
We should not be satisfied merely to read a few chapters of the Bible each day or take a portion of the Word in morning watch
Whenever we come to the Word we need to exercise our entire being especially our spirit to contact Christ who is now the lifegiving Spirit
We have seen that Christ is the bread of life, the bread of God, the heavenly bread, the living bread, and the true bread
Today this bread is not merely the incarnated crucified resurrected and ascended Christ but the Christ who has become the lifegiving Spirit
In chapter three of John we have the case of a religious gentleman, and in chapter four, the case of an immoral Samaritan woman
Just as we have three meals every day, so we need to eat Christ as the bread of life again and again during the day
The One who is our Creator, Redeemer, Savior, Lord, and Master is the life-giving Spirit for us to contact all the time
These are the feasts which, according to the book of Leviticus, were to be held by the Jews throughout the centuries
In the morning, at nine o'clock, He was crucified, and He was on the cross for six hours, until three o'clock in the afternoon
From the Passover on which the Lord was crucified back to the Passover in chapter six of the Gospel of John is a period of one year
From the Passover in John 6 back to the feast of Purim in chapter five is approximately another year in the Lord's ministry
Everything from verse 13 of chapter two through chapter four of the Gospel of John took place within the period of one year
The first Passover in John is in chapter two; the second is in chapter six; and the third is in chapter twelve
Let us now consider what happened during the first year of the Lord's ministry according to the record in the Gospel of John
These verses speak of Christs cleansing of the temple and also of the body of Jesus the temple being destroyed and raised up in resurrection
When we put together the two cases of Nicodemus and the Samaritan woman, we have a full view of God's salvation
Christ alone can cause us to have the real feast of Purim, a feast which indicates that we have passed out of death into life
We may say that the situation of the Jews at the time of the first feast of Purim was a passing out of death into life
The significance of the record in John 5 is that nothing should replace Christ, for He is everything and only He can enliven us
As we have indicated, the record in the Gospel of John does not say anything about what took place during this year
The Passover includes redemption with the blood of the lamb and with the feeding on the lamb, the unleavened bread, and bitter herbs
The Passover was the first of the annual feasts mentioned in Leviticus 23, and the feast of tabernacles was the last
The feast on Thanksgiving day is a feast of ingathering, a feast held at the end of the year after the crops have been harvested
We have seen that in chapter five of John everything is annulled and only Christ remains as the available One and the availing One
After His death and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit, the very breath breathed into His disciples
It is crucial for us to see that Christ has annulled everything and that only He Himself avails for our feeding and satisfaction
Christ was 'cut' on the cross so that the fountain could become the life-giving Spirit as the flowing river to satisfy us
In the scene of the feast of Passover, the Lord presents Himself as the bread of life, which satisfies man's hunger
In the scene of the feast of tabernacles, the Lord promises that He will flow forth as the living water, which quenches man's thirst
With the Passover at the beginning of the year and the feast of tabernacles at the end, we see the beginning and end of human life
We may say that, in particular, at the beginning of human life He is our food, and at the end, He is the river of living water
In chapters two, six, and twelve, we have the Passover; in chapter five, the feast of Purim; and in chapter seven, the feast of tabernacles
The Lord promised that the one who believes in Him will experience rivers of living water flowing out of his innermost being
Both the eating at the Passover in John 6 and the satisfaction at the feast of tabernacles in John 7 are shadows
The fact that Jesus is the Lamb with the Dove indicates that He is the One who redeems us and puts us into the Spirit
The Lord's brothers seemed to be saying, 'Since you are able to do miracles, why not show yourself openly and get a name for yourself?
Although the Lord is the eternal, infinite, unlimited God, He lived here as a man, limited even in the matter of time
The Lord knew that what was written in the Scriptures would be fulfilled at the feast of Passover, not at the feast of tabernacles
Living such a restricted life, He knew that He was not to die at the feast of tabernacles, but at the feast of Passover
As One who lived a restricted life, a life restricted from doing things for self, the Lord sought the glory of God for God's satisfaction
When the Lord Jesus taught in the temple, the Jews marveled and said, 'How does this man know letters, having never learned'?
Because the Lord lived a life of restriction and a life of seeking the glory of God, He was fully qualified to be the burnt offering
As the One who lived a life for the burnt offering, the Lord Jesus even seemed to be misleading in speaking with His brothers
Not only does He live for God and satisfy God, but He also satisfies the thirsty ones who come to Him and overflows from within them
Many Christians can testify that when they were first saved they experienced the Lord overflowing from within them
We should live a life restricted by God from doing things for ourselves and also live a life that seeks God's glory for His satisfaction
They claimed that they wanted to act in a scriptural way, and they charged others to search and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee
Concerning this pride, verse 49 quotes the words of the Pharisees, who said, 'This crowd which does not know the law is accursed'
In this message our emphasis certainly is not on religion's persecution; it is on Christ, the reality of the feast of tabernacles
The tabernacle made by Moses was a type of this tabernacle, and that type was fulfilled in Christ as God's tabernacle among men
Within the eternal tabernacle of God, that is, within the New Jerusalem, the Lamb of God will be on the throne
To say that the reality of the universe is Christ may simply be a doctrine, a menu; it may not be the reality, the food
It also may merely be a doctrine to say that the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit is the reality of the universe
As we shall see, according to the record of the Holy Word, the reality of the universe is actually the tabernacle and the offerings
If we get into the depths of the truth revealed in the Bible, we shall see that in these depths we have the tabernacle and the offerings
The New Jerusalem will be such a mutual dwelling place, a place where we shall abide in God and He will abide in us
According to chapter forty of Exodus, when the tabernacle was erected, God's glory descended upon it and filled it
By means of the offerings we may enter God's dwelling place and meet with Him, eat with Him, converse with Him, and enjoy Him
We need to go on to speak in a more detailed way and say that the tabernacle is God incarnated, and Christ is the incarnated God
How can the tabernacle and the offerings, which are the reality of the universe, be realized by us and enjoyed by us?
In a similar manner, the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit, and now the life-giving Spirit is the extract of the last Adam
We may use this as an illustration of the life-giving Spirit as the extract of the last Adam, God in the flesh
Because the Spirit is everywhere, we can contact Him simply by exercising our spirit and calling on the name of the Lord Jesus
The content of the record of the Bible is the Triune God passing through a process to become the tabernacle, a mutual abode for God and man
The reality of the universe is the Triune God as the tabernacle and the offerings, and this reality is the content of the Bible
In chapter one of the Gospel of John there are six signs: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God
According to 132 John the Baptist testified of Christ saying I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven and He abode upon Him
Later, when Simon was brought to the Lord Jesus, the Lord said to him, 'You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas '
In 1:51 the Lord said to Nathaniel that he would see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man
The Lord Jesus told her that He is the fountain of living water to satisfy her and also the reality for her to worship God
After the Lord annulled the religious things in chapter five, He presented Himself as the bread of life to the hungry ones in chapter six
In chapters eight through eleven of John's Gospel three negative things are dealt with: sin, blindness, and death
In the first seven chapters of John we have a picture of how we have been regenerated, satisfied, and supplied with living water
We still need chapters eight through eleven to show us how we can overcome the three problems of sin, darkness, and death
God has ordained that regarding married life there should be one husband for one wife, and one wife for one husband
God is the real Husband, the universal Husband, and we human beings, both male and female, are in the position of the wife
In the Old Testament the children of Israel committed fornication before God in their high places, in the places where they worshipped idols
Because we all have left God to pursue other things, in His sight we all are females who have committed spiritual fornication
The children of Israel had an illegal relationship with the Devil, and God regarded that relationship as fornication
The Christ we enjoy is One who includes God, incarnation, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection
As a result, we may have Christ in doctrine, in terminology, but we may not have Christ in actuality and practicality
Some of those who hold to traditional teachings concerning the Trinity even oppose the truth that Christ is the life-giving Spirit
As the extract of an herb is actually the herb itself so the lifegiving Spirit as the extract of Christ is Christ Himself for our enjoyment
In order for us to enjoy Him and participate in Him, it was necessary for Him to become the extract, to become the life-giving Spirit
The pneumatic Christ is not a spiritual Christ; the pneumatic Christ is the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit
We all should strongly reply that we definitely have this reality, which is the actual, practical, present, pneumatic Christ
At that time you will know that the One you have crucified is not merely a man, but is the eternal God, Jehovah'
If you want to be free from your temper, do not go to the Lord and make up your mind that from now on you will never lose your temper
You need to realize that you have the extract of Christ, the life-giving Spirit, within you, and that this Spirit is the universal reality
Our medicine is the life-giving Spirit, the extract of the all-inclusive Christ, who is the universal reality within us
The greatest argument between the Lord Jesus and the Pharisees in chapter eight of the Gospel of John concerned who the Lord was
In 812 the Lord Jesus said I am the light of the world he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness but shall have the light of life
Whenever we enjoy other things, such as worldly entertainments and amusements, in place of God, in His sight that is fornication
When we receive the shining of this light, we receive life, for the light, as the light of life, issues in life
He can release us from the bondage of sin and, by imparting eternal life to us, make us sons of God free from death
Because the life-giving Spirit is an extract containing all these elements, this extract is truly powerful and effective
We do not have an element of the divine extract, but we do have the nature of the element of the Lord's living as the Son of Man
To be set free from sin in John 8 includes to be set free from honoring ourselves and from seeking glory for ourselves
In 8:56 the Lord Jesus said, 'Your father Abraham exulted that he should see My day, and he saw it and rejoiced'
The Lord Jesus as the Son of the Father was slandered by religious people, who regarded Him as a Samaritan possessed by a demon
The religious people not only accused the Lord of being a Samaritan, but accused Him of being a Samaritan possessed by a demon
The Lord was slandered, tempted, and persecuted, and certain ones were looking for the opportunity to kill Him
The other three Gospels-Matthew, Mark, and Luke- are called the synoptic Gospels, and they record different aspects of the Lord's humanity
Throughout the centuries, philosophers, scientists, and teachers have not been able to say what the reality of the universe is
What if He should make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory '?
In order for a bottle to have meaning and fulfill its purpose, it needs to be filled with the beverage it was designed to contain
We see this in the opening chapter of the Gospel of John: 'The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us full of grace and reality
As a result of much study, we have come to see that in the writings of John truth refers not to doctrine but to reality
It is true that if the Triune God were not the content of the universe and of our being, everything would be empty, vanity
The Triune God is the reality of the universe and also the reality of the tabernacle with its furniture and utensils
Many teachers of the Bible have pointed out that the tabernacle with its furniture and utensils is a shadow or picture of invisible things
Because Christ is divine and mysterious, God in His wisdom used the types in the Old Testament as pictures of Christ
All these messages are concerned with the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the writings of John
We can see more of the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the writings of John than in the other New Testament books
A literal translation of the Greek words rendered 'shall spread His tabernacle over them' would be 'shall tabernacle over them'
That type was fulfilled in Christ as God's tabernacle among men, and it will be fulfilled in the fullest way in the New Jerusalem
The first mention of the lampstand is in the book of Exodus, where we are told that the lampstand was in the tabernacle
In 812 the Lord Jesus said I am the light of the world he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness but shall have the light of life
The case of the Lord's giving sight to the blind man in chapter nine is also a sign with spiritual significance
According to 9:2, the Lord's disciples said to Him, 'Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind'?
According to their concept, they regarded this man's blindness as being the result of some sin committed either by him or by his parents
The Lord answered His disciples by saying Neither has this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of God might be manifested in him
In verses 4 and 5 the Lord Jesus says, 'We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work
Since we are concerned in this message with chapter nine of the Gospel of John, we need to realize that here blindness is equal to darkness
If we would understand this, we need to know the significance of the clay, the Lord's spittle, and the anointing itself
In his first Epistle John says, 'You have an anointing from the Holy One,' and 'His anointing teaches you concerning all things'
Our point here is that it is by the anointing that the light of the world is able to come into a man born blind
The earth was dry at first, but after the spittle was mingled with it, the earth became wet and was made into clay
In Genesis 2 the Lord breathed into man the breath of life; in John 9, the Lord spat on the ground and then made clay of the spittle
The spittle, as something that proceeds out of the Lord's mouth , signifies His words, which are spirit and life
To make clay of the spittle signifies the mingling of humanity with the Lord's living word, which is the Spirit
Another kind of mingling is found in Leviticus 2, where we have the mingling of oil with fine flour to make the meal offering
As we have indicated the clay signifies us human beings created by God and the spittle signifies the Lords word which is spirit and life
Verse 35 says, 'Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and finding him, He said, Do you believe in the Son of God'?
Notice that the Lord Jesus did not ask him if he believed the Son of God; He asked him if he believed in the Son of God
Believing into the Son of God implies an organic union between the believer and the Son of God in whom he believes
Our believing brings about an organic union between us and the Son of God, and in this union we are one with Him
When we receive the Lord Jesus as the Spirit and life and believe in Him, we enter into an organic union with Him
Many of us can testify that when we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus, we received our sight and began to see a marvelous, divine view
After we believed in the Lord Jesus and entered into an organic union with Him, spiritual things began to be clear to us
We also had a clear view of human life, of where we came from and where we are going, and of the meaning of human life
And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus
Perhaps Saul wondered why, if the Lord was sending him to open the eyes of others, his own eyes had been closed
After he met the Lord Jesus, his inner eyes were opened, and, for a period of time, his physical eyes were blinded
If they experience this mingling, the divine light will come into them, their blindness will vanish, and their darkness will disappear
To believe is an inward obedience to the Lord's salvation, and to be baptized is an outward obedience to the Lord's word
Jessie Penn-Lewis emphasized the subjective death of Christ, and she insisted that baptism in water was not necessary
On the one hand, we can declare that because we have believed in the Lord Jesus, we have a divine view and can see spiritual things
On the other hand, we must admit that we have not always been obedient to practice the washing away of our old man
The religious people rejected this living Person, the One who is the unique reality, and held to their religion
Christ as the light of the world became the door for him to come out of the old, religious fold and to follow Him as the living reality
As we consider this case, we see that only Jesus Christ is the fountain of living water that can quench the thirst in our human life
Only Christ can satisfy the thirst in our human life, and only He is the reality that can afford us the genuine worship of God
The background of this case was 'a feast of the Jews' , which was the feast of Purim recorded in the book of Esther
In chapter five of John we see how the Lord rescued the impotent man and caused him to pass out of death into life
Chapters nine and ten of the Gospel of John are actually concerned with one case-the case of a man who was blind from birth
Why, then, in a chapter concerned with Christ as life is there a verse telling us about the feast of Dedication?
Daniel also prophesied that the wise among God's people would be bold to do valiant things against this evil one
In a war that lasted approximately three years, Judas Maccabaeus was victorious, and the temple was restored and cleansed
When the temple was restored by Judas Maccabaeus, there was not an adequate supply of oil to use in lighting the lamps
In the feast of Dedication the Jewish people remembered that miracle by lighting lamps both in the temple and in their homes
With this feast as the background, the Lord Jesus came to Jerusalem to indicate to the Jewish people that He is the real light
If we do not realize that chapters nine and ten are linked, we shall not understand why chapter ten opens the way it does
Chapter nine concludes with the words, 'Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, Are we also blind?
The thieves and robbers are those like the Pharisees and the Jewish leaders who came into the sheepfold, but not through Christ
Some misinterpret the Lord's word concerning Himself as the door and think that He is the door for us to go to heaven
According to their understanding, they would say that if we do not have the Lord Jesus, we do not have the entrance to heaven
Christ was the door of the Old Testament sheepfold so that God's chosen people could enter the fold and be preserved there
Some of God's chosen people are still in the darkness, even though the New Testament age is in the daytime, not in the nighttime
Jesus, our wonderful Shepherd, Brought us right out of the fold Into His pasture so plenteous, Into His riches untold
In the divisions He sought us, Weary and famished for food; Into the good land He brought us, Oh, to our spirit how good!
Jesus Himself is our pasture, He is the food that we eat; We as His sheep are fed richly Each time, whenever we meet
We thank the Lord that sovereignly He has brought us out of the folds into the pasture and out of night into day
They may point to chapter ten of the Gospel of John and ask, 'Wasn't the Old Testament sheepfold established by God?
The reason the Lord Jesus did not leave the sheep in the sheepfold was that the age, the dispensation, had been changed
When the Son of God came, those in the Old Testament sheepfold did not recognize Him or receive Him, but rather rejected Him
Those in today's sheepfolds may talk about serving Christ, but some of them might not recognize Him if He appeared in their midst
The religious leaders in the Old Testament sheepfold had strong religious teachings concerning Christ, the Messiah
Because some Christians have not been clear concerning this distinction, they use the word 'fold' when they should use the word 'flock'
The good shepherd is Christ, who laid down His psuche life for His sheep so that they may have the zoe life and may have it abundantly
In 10:11 the Lord Jesus says concerning Himself, 'I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep'
Verse 10 proves that the Lord Jesus shepherds us in the way of life: 'I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly'
He laid down His psuche life so that the sheep may have His zoe life, and now He is shepherding us in the way of life
As we are under the Lord's shepherding, there will be a life consciousness within us and also an instruction, a guidance, in life
The life within us, which is actually Christ Himself, will indicate that the Lord intends to lead us in a certain way
We should not be directed by anything outward, but instead should be directed inwardly by Christ who is life to us
In 10:9 the Lord says, 'I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture'
Now, since Christ has come, all God's chosen people must come out of the law and come into Him to enjoy Him as their pasture
In our daily Christian life we need to have the definite realization that we are in the pasture enjoying Christ as the rich supply of life
As this is the eternal life that lasts forever, so whoever possesses it shall by no means perish forever, that is, for eternity
When Paul prayed for the removal of the thorn, the Lord said to him, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness'
Many Christians know from reading John 10:28 that they are held by Christ's hand, but they may not realize what this hand is
If we enjoy the Lord's shepherding in life, in this life there will be a power to keep us from being snatched away by Satan
When we examine our experience we shall realize that we were kept away from the Lord whenever we were not enjoying Christ as our life supply
Whenever we fail to enjoy Christ inwardly as our life supply, in a practical way we are not in the Lord's keeping hand
Elsewhere we have pointed out that grace and love are not two separate matters, but are two aspects of one thing
When we enjoy Christ as our grace, and then through this grace we contact God the Father as the source of grace, we experience love
We may enjoy both the source and the course, for we may enjoy both the love of the Father and the grace of Christ
For some of the saints the church life may be glorious at certain times, and at other times their church life may be gloomy
The reason is that these saints do not adequately enjoy Christ as life to be their door, their Shepherd, and their life supply
If we would have Christ as the One who cleanses the temple and as the light of God's people, we need to have Him as our life
In our experience He will purify us from all pollution and defilement, and we shall become a purified temple for God's expression
If we are enlightened as we read and pray-read John 10, we shall see that nothing religious is useful in serving a spiritual purpose
The first case, that of Nicodemus, reveals how the natural man, no matter how good he may be, needs regeneration
In chapter four we have the case of an immoral Samaritan woman who pretended to be religious and to be a worshipper of God
If we have Christ as the reality of the offerings, we shall be able to offer God the Father the worship He is seeking
Chapter five of the Gospel of John is actually a chapter dealing with resurrection in both a spiritual and physical sense
on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink
In these three cases we have the matters of sin, blindness, and death, the three main characteristics of fallen human beings
In Philippians 3:6 Paul could say of himself that 'as to the righteousness which is in the law' he had 'become blameless'
The case of the blind man in John 9 is the case of a man blind from birth , not the case of someone who became blind due to illness
For this reason, in Ephesians 2:5 Paul says that God made us alive together with Christ, even when we were dead in offenses
By receiving sight through the gospel, we also receive marvelous light to see the things concerning God and our destiny
The record in the Gospel of John is different from that in the so-called synoptic Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke
Rather, John's intention is to depict the divine life, portraying this invisible life through a number of visible cases
Not only are the cases recorded in this Gospel signs, but the main points revealed in each chapter also are signs
Because we were born dead and because the element of death is in the fiber of our being, we need the Lord's life-giving salvation
In verse 3 the sisters of Lazarus sent word to the Lord Jesus and said, 'Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick'
Whenever you say that you are weak, you need to realize that your weakness is the 'calling card' of death, for death is behind your weakness
Many Christians have never heard about life-giving; they are not familiar with this term in the spiritual vocabulary
The Lord Jesus waited not only until Lazarus had died, but even until he had been buried and had begun to stink
The Lord will not resurrect a sick one; He will resurrect one who has died, who has been buried, and who has begun to stink
After we were saved, we realized that we had certain defects and imperfections, and we wanted to improve ourselves
When the Lord said this to them, the disciples replied, 'Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and are You going there again'?
The disciples seemed to be saying to the Lord, 'Why did You not go when the news came to You that Lazarus was sick?
In other chapters of this Gospel the opposition to the Lord Jesus and the frustration came from those in the Jewish religion
As long as we express an opinion of any kind, that opinion will be a sign that we are in darkness and that we do not know what we are saying
We may read something in the Scriptures and then say that this is not for our experience today, but for some time in the future
When she had finished speaking, 'she went away and called her sister Mary, saying secretly, The Teacher is here and is calling you'
It is likely that this was initiated by Martha and that her word to Mary was yet another aspect of her opinion
Verse 33 says, 'When Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her weeping, He groaned in His spirit, and was troubled'
He realized the situation and perceived that everyone around Him, the unbelievers, Martha and Mary, and all the disciples, did not know Him
Some of them said, Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have also caused that this man should not die'?
Martha, expressing her opinion again, said, 'Lord, by now he smells, for it is the fourth day that he has been there'
If there had not been any opinion, it is likely that the Lord Jesus would have resurrected Lazarus at least half a day earlier
The resurrection of Lazarus is a sign indicating that the Lord Jesus is not merely a healing Savior, but is a life-giving Savior
After resurrecting us through regeneration, the Lord is now continuing this process of resurrection by sanctifying and transforming us
He has resurrected us in our regeneration, and now He is continually resurrecting us through sanctification and transformation
Later on we shall see that chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John are in the Holy of Holies
Everyone who enters the Holy of Holies has not only been forgiven of his sins by God but is also one fully resurrected from the natural life
The Apostle John shows us that in order to come into the Holy of Holies, we need to begin our journey at the altar, at the cross
When we enter the Holy of Holies, we shall no longer be natural; we shall be fully in resurrection fellowshipping with our God
No matter whether we are good or evil, as long as we are the old creation, we need Christ for our regeneration and resurrection
In order to become something absolutely new, we need to be regenerated and thoroughly resurrected from the old life
We shall become new, not in our natural life, in the Adamic life, but new in Christ and in the divine life, which is the eternal life of God
God's people were descendants of the forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whose lives are recorded in the book of Genesis
The history of the Old Testament is a history of this dwelling place, which is symbolized first by the tabernacle and later by the temple
Recently we gave a series of messages on the offerings printed as the book Experiencing Christ as the Offerings for the Church Meetings
Just as the sin offering is supported by the burnt offering, so the trespass offering is supported by the meal offering
As the burnt offering, Christ was qualified to be the sin offering, and as the meal offering, He was qualified to be the trespass offering
Let us now consider how these five offerings are fulfilled in the cases recorded in chapters three through eleven of the Gospel of John
Nicodemus, you may say that you are good in your conduct and character, but you cannot say that you are good in your nature
As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so must I the Son of Man be lifted up so that whoever believes in Me may have eternal life
In John 6 the Lord Jesus says that He is the bread of life, the bread of God, the true and living bread that came down out of heaven
If the Lord Jesus were not the offerings, He could not do anything for us, because between us and God there is the great problem of sin
There was the need for the problem of sin to be solved in order for fallen people to enter into the tabernacle to meet with God
God's dwelling place was on earth so that His people could enter into Him to enjoy Him and participate in all His riches
At the cross Christ offered Himself as our sin offering, trespass offering, burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering
The first sign in John 12 is the sign of the house in Bethany , a house that is a miniature of the church life
John 12:2 says, 'So they made Him a supper there; and Martha was serving, but Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with Him'
While that feasting was taking place in Bethany, the high priest and the other priests were serving God in the temple in Jerusalem
Through His resurrection life the Lord gained a house in Bethany where He could feast and have rest and satisfaction
In that house in Bethany the Lord, God incarnate, and His disciples could feast together on the peace offering
The result of Christ being the offerings is a household where His disciples may feast with Him as the incarnated God
In that house in Bethany there were no priests, and there was neither the altar with the offering of sacrifices nor the incense altar
Because they had the Lord Jesus Himself with them Lazarus Martha and Mary certainly would not have left Him to go to worship in the temple
In the miniature of the church life portrayed in John 12, we see three matters: serving, loving, and testifying
They will appreciate the fact that you are living another life, a resurrection life, a life that has brought you out of the tomb
Many years ago we coined the term 'life-study,' realizing that what the children of God need today is a life-study of the Word
Not long afterward, certain Greeks who had come to Jerusalem to worship at the feast came to Philip and said, 'Sir, we wish to see Jesus'
That was the time for Him to be sown into the earth as the grain of wheat to produce multiplication through death and resurrection
Just as a grain of wheat releases its life by falling into the ground, so Christ released the divine life within Him through death
Through His death on the cross, that shell was broken, and the divine life contained and concealed within it was released
Others regarded Him as nothing more than a Nazarene, for they did not know that the divine life was within Him
His death and resurrection was the glorification of the divine life, and this glorification was the glorification of God the Father Himself
When the Lord prayed for the Father's name to be glorified, the Father answered that He had glorified it and that He would glorify it again
When the Lord Jesus was crucified, the entire old creation, including our old man and the satanic world, was crucified with Him
Through the death of Christ on the cross, all the negative things, all the things of the old creation, were judged
What we have covered in the foregoing message and in this message is an extract of chapter twelve of the Gospel of John
In this church life we enjoy Christ as the sin offering the trespass offering the burnt offering the meal offering and the peace offering
The quality of this miniature of the church life in John 12 is perfect, but the quantity is too small, too limited
In verses 35, 36, and 46 we see the rejection of the light, and in verses 37 through 50, the unbelief of the hardened heart
The worship in the temple in Jerusalem was religious, a worship according to religious regulations, rituals, ceremonies, and forms
The first case, that of Nicodemus, is a case of regeneration, and the last case, that of Lazarus, is a case of resurrection
These nine cases depict one complete person who is in the new creation, a person who has gone from regeneration to resurrection
In chapter twelve we see that these nine cases result in a house at Bethany, which represents the church life in miniature
With the miniature of the church life in Bethany we see service with Martha, love with Mary, and the testimony with Lazarus
It was still necessary for Christ to prepare the place and cut the way for His believers to enter into the tabernacle
According to the type in the Old Testament, between the altar of burnt offering and the tabernacle was the laver
It was necessary for those who had come to the altar and who were ready to enter the tabernacle to come to the laver to be washed
We have seen that in chapters three through twelve the people have to come to the altar, where they enjoy Christ as the offerings
The washing in chapter thirteen is the turning point, for it brings us from the outer court into the tabernacle
Reading the Gospel of John in this way, they may completely miss the significance of foot-washing in chapter thirteen
As such a book, this Gospel begins like this: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
We may also go on to ask the significance of regeneration in chapter three and of resurrection in chapter eleven
Because the Gospel of John deals with such profound things, we should not be satisfied with a superficial understanding of it
John 13:3 says, 'Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands, and that He had come forth from God, and was going to God'
It is significant that in chapters thirteen through seventeen of this Gospel the word 'heaven' is not mentioned
We are told not that the Lord Jesus came from heaven and that He was going to heaven, but that He came forth from God and was going to God
The Lord Jesus had come from God, lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, and now He was going back to God
The commission was to bring fallen, natural, sinful, satanic, and demonic man into the holy, glorious, infinite God
He also realized that He had come from God for the accomplishment of the commission given to Him and that now He was going back to God
We have also seen that the commission the Lord Jesus received from the Father was to bring fallen mankind into God
Because they were still unclean due to the earthly touch, they needed the washing of the laver before they could enter the tabernacle
If we do not have the washing, both our fellowship with the brothers and our fellowship with God will be broken
We should not regard our fellowship with God as one thing and our fellowship with the brothers as another thing
Today Christians talk a great deal about brotherly love, yet not many realize that brotherly love is expressed in foot-washing
That elderly sister came to the door and spoke one sentence to us: 'Foot-washing is good, but the water was too hot'!
If instead of washing one another's feet we are polite and political, the defilement on us will make fellowship impossible
Suppose we in Shanghai had done nothing about our feelings concerning the way that elderly sister prayed in the meetings
If this situation is not cleared up, how could all of us have the peace to attend the Lord's table meeting together'?
Chapter thirteen of the Gospel of John puts together three matters: foot-washing, Judas' betrayal of the Lord, and Peter's self-confidence
The fact that these matters are put together indicates that footwashing sifts the false one and also exposes the real yet selfconfident one
It is possible to be a false one at a love feast, but it is not possible to be a false one when foot-washing is practiced
In human society today, there is a certain kind of beauty, but this beauty is that of cosmetics applied to a dead body
We do have spiritual foot-washing in order to eliminate all defects so that we may have clear fellowship with one another and with God
In this message we shall see an overview of the ten signs in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John
We have pointed out that the sequence of events in the Gospel of John is for the formation of a doctrinal frame
Chapter one is a prologue to the entire Gospel, and in chapter two we have the principle of life and the goal of life
In 13:10 the Lord Jesus said to Peter, 'He who is bathed has no need, except to wash his feet, but is wholly clean'
If there were no laver, the earthly contact would annul the wonderful result of Christ being all the offerings
If we study the Gospel of John with a spiritual view, we shall realize that chapters one through twelve show us all the offerings
We may say that these chapters reveal different aspects of the all-inclusive Christ, and that these aspects are related to the offerings
And 3:14 says, 'And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up'
Chapter thirteen is a turning point, a link between chapters one through twelve and chapters fourteen through seventeen
The offerings are on the altar, and in the tabernacle are many riches: the showbread table, the lampstand, the incense altar, and the ark
If we are defiled through earthly contact, we shall not be allowed to enter into the dwelling place of the clean and holy God
Whoever comes into the tabernacle must be clean in every way-physically, psychologically, spiritually, and morally
According to what we have pointed out concerning the laver in previous messages, the laver is altogether lacking
We are told in verse 12 that the ladder Jacob saw in his dream was 'set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven'
Their holy days, their holidays, were the feasts, and their weekend was the Sabbath, a day on which they enjoyed resting with God
The fourth sign is the great sign of the divine Trinity, the sign of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit
Before incarnation He was God's only begotten Son, and He continued to be the only begotten Son until His resurrection
According to John 17, the believers need to be preserved in oneness in the name of the Father, by the word of God, and by the glory of God
Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of the Gospel of John are a message given by the Lord Jesus during His last night on earth
The tabernacle as God's dwelling place among His people on earth is actually the center and reality of the entire universe
We may say that the universe, which is composed of the heavens, the earth, and billions of items, is a huge container
Without God's people as His dwelling place, the universe would be empty and vain, without a center and without reality
The Gospel of John reveals the Triune God dispensing Himself into His people and thereby making them His dwelling place
Whereas the Gospel of John is an abstract of the Bible, the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings is an extract of this Gospel
In addition, there were the wave offering, the heave offering, the freewill offerings, and also the drink offering
The basic offerings are the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering
In chapters three, four, seven, six, and twelve we see Christ as the fulfillment of the five basic offerings in the Old Testament
If we put all these matters together, we shall see that in the Gospel of John we have a full picture of the tabernacle
Some of the signs in the earlier chapters of this Gospel are the tabernacle , the Lamb of God , the door , and the pasture
The first of the ten signs in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John is the sign of the Father's house
The concept of going to a heavenly mansion is superstitious and completely off the line of the revelation in the Gospel of John
The Gospel of John opens like this: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
The Father's house signifies God mingling Himself with His redeemed people to make them His house, His dwelling place
Praise the Lord that in the universe there is such a wonderful entity as this mutual dwelling place for God and His redeemed people!
God is dispensing Himself into His people and mingling Himself with them in order to produce such a mutual dwelling place
Concerning the temple, the Lord Jesus said that it was His Father's house: 'Do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise'
The same term that was used to refer to the temple on earth in 2:16 is used again in 14:2: 'In My Father's house are many abodes'
We need to be impressed with the fact that in the Gospel of John the expression 'My Father's house' is used twice
If the house in John 14 is a heavenly mansion, then in addition to the church on earth, the Lord Jesus is building a house in the heavens
If God needed a heavenly mansion as a dwelling place, there would be no need for Him to spend two thousand years to build it
Since such a dwelling place would be part of His creation, He would only need to speak, and His dwelling place would be produced
Apart from the death and resurrection of Christ, there is neither a way for us to enter into God nor a place for us in God
Do you believe that while the Lord is building the church on earth, He is also building a heavenly mansion for the Father?
Since acacia wood signifies proper humanity and gold signifies divinity, here we have humanity mingled with divinity
Once inside the tabernacle they can enjoy the riches of Christ signified by the showbread table the lampstand the ark and the incense altar
The temple was founded upon a foundation of stone , and it was built of stone, cedar, and fir overlaid with gold
With the temple we once again see the mingling of divinity with humanity through death and in resurrection and transformation
In the temple they also receive God's revelation concerning the destiny of the ungodly and the godly under His dealing
To bring the thought of a heavenly mansion into the Gospel of John can be compared to adding a foreign element to our physical body
To bring the thought of a heavenly mansion into the Gospel of John is to inject into it something that is not of life
It is not correct to say that after God's creation it was necessary for Him to add something to His creation or to remodel it
God works Himself into this entity not through speaking it into being, but through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection
It is a divine organism, an organism that is Christ's Body, the Father's house, and also a mutual dwelling place
According to these expositors, in chapter fourteen John was following the Gnostics to speak of a heavenly mansion
To say that John 14:2 refers to a heavenly mansion is to take in a concept that is Gnostic, pagan, heathen, and heretical
It is also deceitful, for believers are cheated when they are told that their departed loved ones are now in a heavenly mansion
By the Spirit and through His death and resurrection, He is building an organism, the church, which is His Body and the Father's house
May we all be nourished with the truth concerning the mingling of God with us to produce a mutual dwelling place
In the previous message we covered three illustrations related to the Father's house: Bethel, the tabernacle, and the temple
In John 1:14 we see that the incarnated Word, God in the flesh, is the real tabernacle: 'The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us'
Unless someone offered something to God on the altar for his sins, an Israelite could not have an entrance into God's tabernacle
In resurrection the Son of God who Himself is resurrection not only raised up Himself but also raised up all those who would believe in Him
Christ is the firstborn Son of God, and we, the many sons of God, are stones for the building up of the Father's house
The second stage is Christ resurrected with all His believers, the many sons built up together to be the church
The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate consummation, the last stage, of the Father's house in the New Testament
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
The resurrected temple in John 2:19-21 is Christ raised up with His members, who are the many abodes in the Father's house
Concerning the spiritual house, 1 Peter 2:5 says, 'You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house'
Because the church life is in our spirit, we all need to learn the lesson of turning to our spirit and staying there
The New Jerusalem as the consummation of the mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed people will be as a bride adorned for her husband
Pearls signify God the Son's overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection for regenerating God's redeemed people
In order to understand what the Father's house is, we need all the books of the Bible from Genesis 28 through Revelation 22
As we consider the revelation of the Father's house in the Scriptures, we see that this house certainly is not a heavenly mansion
The concept that the Father's house in John 14 is a heavenly mansion is far off, and this concept needs to be discarded
Our Father's house is a living organism composed of the Triune God mingled with all of His regenerated, transformed, and glorified believers
In the meantime, they may be living on earth in the flesh and enjoying the world, yet still expecting one day to go to a heavenly mansion
We regard this as a sign because when the disciples heard about the Lord's going and His coming, they understood it in a natural way
The Lord was trying to tell her that Lazarus would be raised up that very day because the Lord Himself is resurrection
No matter how much the Lord explained to them concerning His going and coming, they could not understand what He was saying
Because of this preoccupation, they do not have the proper understanding of the Lord's going and coming in John 14
There is the need for us to see that both the Lord's going and His coming are signs indicating something deep, divine, and mysterious
In John 314 the Lord Jesus said to Nicodemus And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up
Concerning this Paul says, 'Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him that the body of sin might be made of none effect'
The Lord's going took away the sin of the world, terminated the old creation, judged the world, and cast out the ruler of the world, Satan
Sin has been taken away, the sin offering has been offered, the world has been judged, and Satan has been destroyed
When these sheep are brought together with the Jewish sheep, there is one flock, one church, composed of both Jewish and Gentile believers
What we have in John 14:2 and 3 is not yet the building of the Father's house; this is the way, the entry, into the building
We also have the dispensing of the Son with His overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection signified by pearl
We have the dispensing of the Spirit into our being, mainly for the purpose of transforming us and making us precious stones
In chapter twenty of the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus came to His disciples, who were in a place where the doors were shut, as the pneuma
In chapter one Christ was the Lamb, but in chapter twenty, after His death and in His resurrection, He was the pneumatic Christ
Praise the Lord that we are enjoying not only the redeeming Christ but also the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Christ!
Just as a car tire must be pneumatic, that is, full of air, so every Christian should be pneumatic, full of heavenly air
The redeeming Christ is now the pneumatic Christ in resurrection, and this pneumatic Christ enters into us to impart the divine life to us
By this we see that the divine life has been imparted to our being not only through the Lord's death but also through His resurrection
Through Christ's death and resurrection, through His going and coming, we have entered into the Father's house
John 14:23 says, 'If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him'
The abode here is one of the many abodes mentioned in verse 2, where the Lord says, 'In my Father's house are many abodes'
These three verses in chapter fourteen are very deep, and the three matters in verse 6-the way, the reality, and the life-are signs
We cannot understand these matters properly if we consider these verses merely according to the black and white letters
We may consider these three as one sign in three aspects, steps, or stages, or we may regard them as three separate signs
A jumbo jet can easily overcome gravity and bring people safely and comfortably through the air to their destination
The passengers in a jumbo jet need not be frustrated by wind or rain, for the jet carries them through everything
In the foregoing message we saw that, through His death on the cross, the Lord Jesus dealt with sin, the world, and Satan
Not only is there a great distance between them and God, but there are also many obstacles keeping them from contacting Him
The Jews who honor God and fear Him cannot testify from their experience that they are in God and that God is in them
The Lord has taken away sin, He has judged the world, He has destroyed Satan, and He has terminated the old creation
The way by which we enter into the Father is the crucified Jesus and the resurrected Christ with His redemption
We would emphasize the fact that the Lord's crucifixion signifies that sin, the world, Satan, and the old creation have all been dealt with
If we were to call on a name other than that of the Lord Jesus we would not have a way into God because all other names are void of reality
When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are immediately on the way into God because the Lord is the embodiment of the Triune God
Because the Son is the embodiment of the Father, when we call on the name of the Lord we have both the Son and the Father
Many of us can testify that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we sense that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in us
The life brings us the reality the reality is the way the way is one with the destination and this destination is God and the Father Himself
They may realize that they are sinful and that they have the problems with the world, Satan, and other negative things
In 14:6 the Lord Jesus clearly says, 'I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me'
Because Christ is the way, the reality, and the life, when we have Him, we have the life, the reality, and the way
We used flying on a jumbo jet as an illustration of the Lord as the way into God, saying that 'Jumbo Jesus' is the way to the Father
No matter how fast a jumbo jet may go, it still must travel a certain distance before it brings you to your destination
When we get into Him as the way, we arrive at the Father as our destination, because the Son is one with the Father
From experience we can testify that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are immediately in the Triune God in an experiential way
From our side, these chapters reveal the way for us to enter into the Triune God, enjoy Him, experience Him, and possess Him
If we regard the Trinity merely as a doctrine, we shall have difficulty, because no one can adequately define the Trinity in a doctrinal way
In the Gospels the Son prayed to the Father, the Father spoke to the Son, and the Father sent the Spirit to be upon the Son
We simply are not able to analyze the Person of the Godhead; we are not able to explain how He is three yet still one
After His resurrection, the Lord charged His disciples to baptize people into the three-one name: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of John are one long discourse followed by a lengthy prayer recorded in chapter seventeen
Although much is said in these chapters concerning the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, nothing is as clear as Matthew 28:19
In the Gospel of John there is a verse that points out that, before the resurrection of Christ, the Trinity was complete but not completed
In chapter seven of John, the Lord Jesus was still in the flesh; He was not yet in glory, that is, not yet in resurrection
After His resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ
Before the Lord's resurrection, this Spirit, the Spirit including humanity, crucifixion, and resurrection, was not yet
The Spirit as the Spirit of Jesus Christ now includes the elements of divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection
If you are served a cup of tea without milk and sugar, you would say that your cup of tea has not been completed
When you add milk and sugar to the tea, your drink will be completed, for the necessary elements have been added to it
Although the Trinity was complete, one of the Three- the Spirit-was not completed before the Lord's resurrection
After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus could speak clearly and definitely concerning the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
In order to be completed, the Son had to pass through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection
Of course, neither were the elements of human living, crucifixion, and resurrection in the only begotten Son before His incarnation
After His resurrection, He could tell His disciples to baptize people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
In Matthew 28:19, after Christ's resurrection, the Son and the Spirit are not only complete but also completed
As we have pointed out, this firstborn Son of God includes divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection
In John 6:38 the Lord Jesus says, 'I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me'
Concerning this point, 1 Timothy 6:16 says, 'Who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen nor can see'
According to 15:21, the disciples will be persecuted because their persecutors do not know Him who sent the Son
If we study these verses, plus others in the Gospel of John, we shall learn why, how, and when the Father sent the Son
If someone sends you to a certain place, that person will usually remain where he is, and you will go to the designated place
According to John's Gospel, where the Son is, there the Father is also, and when the Son speaks, the Father also speaks in Him
We need to be impressed with the fact that it is beyond our ability to analyze how the Father and the Son are one
We cannot separate the mind from the emotion or the emotion from the will and then analyze these parts of our being separately
Concerning the Father's sending the Son and coming with the Son, we should not analyze, but instead simply believe whatever the Bible says
Concerning this matter, 1 John 4:13 says, 'In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given us of His Spirit'
The Son is the expression of the Father No one has ever seen God the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father He has declared Him
John 6:46 says, 'Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him who is from with God, He has seen the Father'
It is easy to see the matter of coexistence, but it is much more difficult to realize the matter of coinherence
The coinherence of the Son and the Father means that the Son is in the Father and that the Father is in the Son
Whatever is spoken by the Son is the word of the Father, because the Son does not speak His own word, but speaks the Father's word
In John 14:7 the Lord pointed out to the disciples that if they had known Him, they would have known His Father also
When the Spirit as the Applier enters into us, He brings with Him whatever the Father has planned and the Son has accomplished
The Lord's breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter
We have the Applier within us, and day by day He is applying all that has been planned by the Father and accomplished by the Son
The more we practice these matters and live them, the more opportunity we give to the Spirit to apply them to us
Although the Son came as the expression of the Father, this was not the ultimate, the consummate, coming of the Triune God
Concerning the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, we are using three crucial words: source, expression, and realization
The Spirit is the realization of the Son as the Father's expression, and this realization is ultimate, consummate
As the expression of the Father, the Son can reach us in an objective way, but He cannot reach us in a subjective way
To say that the Son cannot reach us in a subjective way means that He can be among us or with us but not in us, apart from the Spirit
When the realization, the Spirit, becomes our portion and enjoyment, we also have the source, the Father, and the expression, the Son
Once we possess the Spirit as the realization, we also possess the Son as the expression and the Father as the source
In other words, if we have the Spirit, we have all Three of the Triune God- the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
As a result, my daily life is the realization of the Triune God, and this realization is the all-inclusive Spirit
For us to be filled with Him means that He is within us; for us to be immersed into Him means that we are in Him
Continually the Triune God is dispensing Himself into us, and we are being immersed into Him in order to be mingled with Him
We can become abodes of the Father's house and branches of the universal vine only by being mingled with the Triune God
We need the Spirit as the realization of the Triune God to fill us and saturate us, and we need to be immersed in this Spirit
According to your experience, is not the Christian life a life of having the Triune God dispensed into us and mingling Himself with us?
Through this dispensing and mingling we may be so happy in the Lord that we may momentarily forget where we are and who we are
If you have never experienced the Triune God in this way, your experience as a Christian is below normal, below the standard
We can testify that this experience of the Triune God makes us God-men, persons filled with the Triune God and immersed in Him
According to these chapters, the Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit comes to us and enters into us
When the Spirit enters into us we experience the dispensing of the Father the Son and the Spirit and also the mingling with the Triune God
We should not remain serious and sober in a natural way, but we should have the wonderful enjoyment of the Triune God
Paraclete is the anglicized form of the Greek word parakletos, which denotes one alongside who takes care of our cause, our affairs
Today we have both the Lord Jesus in the heavens as well as the Spirit within us as our Paraclete, taking care of our case
We have all Three: the Father as the source, the Son as the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit as the transfiguration of the Son
Because brother A sends brother B in his name, brother B does not come in his own name, but comes in the name of brother A
If we understand this illustration, then we can understand why according to Isaiah 9:6 the Son given to us is called the Father
If he were asked to identify himself, brother C could say, 'I am brother C coming in the name of brother B and sent by brother A'
In a similar way the Spirit could say of Himself, 'I am the Spirit coming in the name of the Son and sent by the Father'
Because the Spirit is sent by the Father in the Son's name, so the Spirit comes in the name of the Son with the Father
We have the Father as the source, we have the Son as the expression, and we have the Spirit as the One entering into us
For the Spirit to come from the source does not mean that He leaves the source; it means that the source comes with Him
Because the Father and the Son abide in our spirit with the Spirit, we sense that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us
Since the Spirit is sent by the Son and comes with the Father, the Spirit's testimony concerning the Son is a matter of the Triune God
John 16:14 says that the Spirit will glorify the Son: 'He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you'
In John 4:14 the Lord says that whoever drinks of the water that He gives will have in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life
In chapter seven the Lord goes further and says that anyone who drinks of Him will have the flow of the rivers of water of life
In the book of Revelation we have the seven Spirits before the throne of God as the seven eyes of the Lamb, the Son
The fact that the seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb, the Son, proves that the Son and the Spirit are not separate
In Revelation the consummation of the Triune God marries the consummation of God's redeemed people to form a universal couple
The Spirit, as the consummation of the Triune God, is the Husband, and the consummation of God's redeemed people is the bride
Regarding the divine Trinity, we would also point out that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the one God
Peter 1:2 reveals that the Father is God; Hebrews 1:8, that the Son is God; and Acts 5:3-4, that the Spirit is God
In a note on John 14:16 Darby says that a paraclete was 'one who carries on the cause of any one and helps him'
In his translation of 1 John 2:1, where the same Greek word is used, Darby says that we have a 'patron' with the Father
In a note he explains that he uses the word patron in the sense of the Roman patron who maintained the interests of his clients in every way
Regarding this, the Lord Jesus says, 'He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you
Our understanding of the Son is by the Spirit, who has received whatever the Son is and then reveals this to us
Now we would point out that, in particular, this is a function of the Spirit of reality, who comes through the Son's death and resurrection
The Spirit of reality guides us into the reality of justification, holiness, love, and all other divine things
The Spirit always convicts the world, that is, mankind, concerning the three matters of sin, righteousness, and judgment
Sin entered through Adam , righteousness is the resurrected Christ , and judgment is for Satan, who is the author and source of sin
Now we can be filled and saturated with the Triune God, who is dispensing Himself into us and mingling Himself with us
We have seven important terms: source, expression, consummation, Originator, Accomplisher, Applier, and realization
If you encounter such a situation, you may say, 'I certainly believe what is written concerning the Lord in Acts 1 and 3
Let us study chapters fourteen through seventeen of John's Gospel and see what these chapters reveal concerning the Triune God
Medical doctors may study our physical body, but they may not know much about our psychological part and virtually nothing about our spirit
Let us now go on to consider the fifth sign in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John-the sign of the abode
We love the Son, the Father loves us, and the result is that both the Father and the Son come to us and make an abode with us
The word 'abode' in verse 23 may be so familiar to us that we take it for granted and do not pay attention to it
Many times when we read the Bible, our natural, human thoughts are veils that keep us from seeing the truth in the Word
Both the Father and the Son come to the one who loves the Son, settle themselves within him, and make their abode with him
The Father responds to our love for the Son, and then the Father and the Son come to us to make an abode in our spirit
The first matter signified by the abode in chapter fourteen is that we human beings may become God's dwelling place
According to the New Testament, we are God's house, and the family, the household, is composed of the Triune God with His children
The abode is a sign signifying the mingling of divinity with humanity, a mingling that is both the house and the household
If we see this, we shall realize that the genuine church is different from organized Christianity with its forms, rituals, and regulations
We can testify that when we love the Lord Jesus, we have the sense deep within us that our Father is happy and pleased with us
Spontaneously, we also have the sense that two wonderful divine Visitors, two divine Guests-the Father and the Son-have come to stay with us
We have the Triune God dwelling in us, mingling Himself with us, and making Himself one with us, and this oneness is the abode
In this message we come to the sixth sign in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John-the sign of the true vine
Christ Himself is the true vine, and the Father is the Husbandman, the Farmer who cultivates the soil so that the vine may spread
In relation to the true vine, the organism of the Triune God, what does it mean that the Spirit is the Testifier?
Doctrinally we may not be able to understand this, but experientially we do know what it means for the Spirit to be the Testifier
Many have testified that the Spirit within them responded in such a way when they first came in contact with the Lord's recovery
We know that chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen are one message given by the Lord in the night He was betrayed
The Father's house is the vine, and the branches of this vine are the many abodes, the many rooms, of the Father's house
Have you seen that you are a branch in the universal vine and that the branches are rooms of the Father's house?
The word in Ephesians 3:17 has the prefix kata, and the meaning of the word is somewhat similar to the English expression 'settle down'
It seems that the best way to translate this Greek word here is to say that Christ is making His home in our hearts
In John 14 and 15 we have the words 'abodes' and 'abide,' and in Ephesians 3 Paul prays that Christ may make His home in our hearts
God has a habitation, a dwelling place in us, in a deep way, in a way that is settled down and even rooted downward
These verses reveal that in the New Testament there is the crucial thought that God, the Creator, longs, desires, to make His home in us
His home is a matter of mingling, and this mingling is also a vine that is growing, spreading, and covering the entire earth
With the vine we also have the glorification of the Father through the expression of the riches of the divine life in fruit-bearing
Whereas the first three Gospels-Matthew, Mark, and Luke-charge us to preach the gospel, we do not have such a charge in the Gospel of John
It is unnecessary to require a living peach tree to bear fruit, and it would be useless to tell it to produce fruit overnight
The propagation or multiplication of the divine life through the vine is the glorification of the Father, that is, His expression
When the switch in a room is off, electricity is still present, but there is no expression of electricity in the shining of light
The glory given by the Father to the Son and by the Son to the disciples is the divine life with the divine nature for God's expression
An apple tree will produce apples and a peach tree will produce peaches because both an apple tree and a peach tree are after their own kind
One day, all Christians will go to such a heavenly mansion, to a place with gates of pearl and streets of gold'
The common teaching concerning a heavenly mansion has no basis in the Bible, and especially no basis in the Gospel of John
In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus says, 'I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me'
We should not think that Peter was born at one time, Paul at another time, and each of us at a much later time
All the believers, including the early apostles and those who will be the last to believe in the Lord, were regenerated together
The Lord's word concerning the man born in 16:21 includes Himself as the firstborn Son and all the believers as the many sons
In John 1616 the Lord said to His disciples A little while and you shall behold Me no longer and again a little while and you shall see Me
The Head is the firstborn Son of God, and the Body is a composition of all the many sons of God, the many brothers of the Lord
Before the Lord's resurrection, there was only one man- Adam, including all his descendants as the components of this one man
We should rejoice over the birth of the new man in resurrection much more than we do over the incarnation of Christ
Because of the fall, all the components of the first man are under God's judgment and headed for the lake of fire
According to God's view, the divine view, all His chosen people were born together with Christ in His resurrection
The disciples were disheartened, but suddenly the Lord as the newborn child was in their midst saying, 'Peace be to you'
In chapter fourteen we have the Father's house, in chapter fifteen we have the vine, and in chapter sixteen we have the new man
By this we see that, in one sense, the resurrection of Christ was a birth and, in another sense, it was a rebuilding
In chapter two the Lord prophesied that He would build the house of God in resurrection and that He would build it in an enlarged way
The word 'what' refers to the physical element; 'when,' to the time element; and 'where,' to the space element
Concerning this question we should pay attention to the fact that Revelation 138 speaks of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world
To say that Christ is the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world means that from the time creation came into existence Christ was slain
The reason Revelation 13:8 can speak of Christ as the One slain from the foundation of the world is that there is no time element with God
In the foregoing message we strongly emphasized the fact that the new man was born in the resurrection of Christ
Many believers do not see that actually, in the divine view, the church as part of the new man was born in Christ's resurrection
It was not the case that the Head of the new man was born at one time and that the members of the Body were born at a later time
Rather, resurrection is a divine matter, and in this divine matter there are not the elements of space or time
Because the new man was born in resurrection and resurrection is a divine matter, the birth of the new man was not a matter of time or place
From our limited point of view, the birth of the new man takes place gradually throughout the centuries following Christ's resurrection
As we consider the birth of the new man, it appears to us that some parts have already been born and other parts will be born in the future
You may meet a Bible teacher who will say to you, 'How can you claim that the church as the new man was born with Christ in resurrection?
It is possible to read this Gospel many times without seeing the significance of the birth of the new man in John 16
Concerning the church we need to see both the human side and the divine side, both the physical side and the spiritual side
Rather, this Gospel says, 'In the beginning was the Word and the Word was God and the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us'
In Matthew and Luke we have the historical record of the physical side, but in John we have a revelation of the divine facts
Praise the Lord that we are now in the new man that has come into being through the death and resurrection of Christ!
A strong proof that Paradise is in Hades is the comparison of the Lord's word to the saved thief in Luke 23:43 with Acts 2:27 and 31
Matthew 12:40 indicates that Hades is in 'the heart of the earth' where the Lord Jesus went for three days and nights after His death
Luke 16 indicates that in Hades there is a pleasant section, known as Paradise, where believers go when they die
Using 2 Corinthians 12:2-4, some have argued that Paul was caught away to Paradise when he was caught away to the third heaven
On the one hand, Paul was living on earth; on the other hand, he was 'caught' to the third heavens and into Paradise
As far as mankind is concerned, the universe is of three sections: the heavens, the earth, and the section under the earth
Some Bible students believe that Paradise the pleasant section of Hades was transferred to the third heaven at the time of Christs ascension
According to this note, 'Hades was formerly in two divisions, the abodes respectively of the saved and of the lost
The note goes on to say that a 'change has taken place which affects paradise' and that Paradise is 'now in the immediate presence of God'
On the day of Pentecost, fifty days after the Lord's resurrection, Peter said, 'David is not ascended into the heavens'
Of waiting to go to a so-called heavenly mansion when we die, we have the blessing of dwelling in the church life today
We may say that today's church life is the best dwelling place, a real mansion, for it is God's dwelling place on earth
In the church, which is a miniature of the New Jerusalem, we have the golden street, the pearl gates, and the jasper wall
As we have seen, gold signifies God's nature; pearl, Christ's death and resurrection; and precious stone , the Spirit's transformation
As saved ones, we may enjoy the church life today and have the assurance of going to Paradise if we die before the Lord's coming
Because so many believers are influenced by traditional concepts, we need to talk about these matters in a careful, sober way
When a believer dies, he does not go to heaven or to a mansion in heaven; he goes to Paradise to await the coming resurrection
As we have indicated, it is commonly thought that these verses reveal that the third heaven in verse 2 is the same as Paradise in verse 4
The third heaven, therefore, must be the heaven above the sky, in biblical terms, the heaven above the heavens, the highest heaven
If this brother is in Paradise, which is far away from the third heaven, where the Lord is, how can you say that he is with the Lord'?
Through his physical death, he would be with Christ to a fuller extent than he already enjoyed in this earthly life
Paul knew that as a result of physical death he would be with Christ to a fuller extent than in his earthly life
In figure, the altar is in the outer court of the tabernacle and the temple, and the outer court signifies the earth
The 'heart of the earth' is called the lower parts of the earth and Hades , where the Lord went after His death
Hades, equal to Sheol in the Old Testament, has two sections: the section of torment and the section of comfort
They say that when Christ comes back He will bring the dead believers with Him and that this proves that they must be with Him now in heaven
Although there certainly are heavens, there is no heavenly mansion, and the believers do not go to heaven when they die
According to John 17:1, when the Lord Jesus prayed to the Father concerning the glorification of the Son, He lifted up His eyes to heaven
Although the Lord had spoken in the previous chapters about the Father's house, the Father did not yet have a house on earth
The blossoming of a carnation flower is the expression of the glory concealed in the life and nature of a carnation seed
When this life and nature are released through the blossoming of the flower, we see the glory of a carnation plant
The carnation blossom is the glory, and this glory is the expression of the life and nature of a carnation plant
According to John 17:1, the Lord Jesus prayed, 'Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You'
His divine element was confined in His humanity, just as God's shekinah glory was concealed within the tabernacle
Once, on the mountain of transfiguration, His divine element was released from within His flesh and expressed in glory
Before the prayer recorded in John 17, the Lord had indicated that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him
He would also resurrect so that He might uplift His humanity into the divine element and that His divine element might be expressed
Before His incarnation, the Lord as the only begotten Son of God was with the Father in glory and enjoyed this glory with the Father
His humanity was a shell that covered and confined the divine life and nature, along with the divine glory, that were within Him
The divine glory, the expression of the divine life and the divine nature, was therefore confined and concealed within the Lord's humanity
As the Lord lived, walked, and worked among the people, His disciples saw in Him something that had never been seen by men before
What the disciples saw in the Lord Jesus was the expression of the divine life and nature that were within Him
According to John 17:6 the Lord said to the Father, 'I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world
For the Lord to make known to them the Father's name was for Him to express the Father in His divine life and nature
The Lord lived among the disciples in such a way that He expressed the Father, and this expression was a matter of glorification
As we have indicated, the Lord was temporarily glorified in the presence of three of His disciples on the mountain of transfiguration
Matthew 172 says concerning this He was transfigured before them and His face shone as the sun and His garments became white as the light
When the Lord was glorified on the mountain of transfiguration, His divine life and nature were expressed in a full way
Father, cause My opaque humanity to become completely transparent so that Your life and nature can be expressed from within Me
We have seen that for the Father to glorify the Son was to cause the Son's opaque humanity to become transparent
It was through this glorification that the old man was done away with and that the new man has been brought forth
The more glorification there is in the church life, the more the old creation is done away with and the more the new man is brought in
We need to emphasize the fact that glorification signifies that the old man has been terminated and that the new man has come in
Praise the Lord that glorification is the new man, the new man is the vine, and the vine is the Father's house!
We have seen that in John 17 the Lord prayed that the Father would glorify the Son so that the Son might glorify Him
One day the Lord Jesus will come in a physical manifestation of glory, and we shall be brought into that glory
The New Jerusalem will be the completion of the new man, the consummation of the vine, and the full building of the Father's house
As we consider this sign, we need to pay attention to a number of verses in the Gospel of John that speak of glory or glorification
According to John 12, when the Lord Jesus went up to Jerusalem for the feast of Passover, He received a great welcome
In verse 24 the Lord says, 'Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
Verse 23 indicates clearly that the Lord was concerned for His glorification, and verse 24 explains what this glorification is
The Lord was glorified by dying as a grain of wheat and then growing up in resurrection to produce many grains, that is, to bear much fruit
According to 12:28, after the Lord prayed, a voice came out of heaven, saying, 'I have glorified it, and will glorify it again'
Shortly after speaking these words, the Lord went on to give the lengthy message recorded in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen
We need to show them that the portion of the Gospel of John from 1223 through the end of chapter seventeen is a complete section of the Word
The building up of the Father's house is equal to the planting of the vine, and this is equal to the birth of the new man
The basic thought in this section of the Gospel of John is the glorification of the Father in the Son's glorification
Certainly whatever is produced through the Lord's death and resurrection has nothing to do with a heavenly mansion
The glory which the Father gave the Son is the sonship with the Father's life and nature to express the Father in His fullness
The producing of the many grains and the bearing of fruit by the many branches are both matters of glorification
The fruit-bearing of the branches is a continuation of the glorification seen in the multiplication of the one grain into many grains
It is by this continuing delivery that the Lord's prophecy in John 2 concerning the raising up of the temple is being fulfilled
Because this delivery, this bringing forth, is still taking place, the divine glorification is also continuing today
We may say that Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the synoptic Gospels, are on the human side, whereas the Gospel of John is on the divine side
In this fruit-bearing, in this delivery, Christ is glorified, and in His glorification the Father is glorified
Suppose on earth today there were only a few Christians and these Christians were scattered throughout the world
According to the book of Ephesians, the church is the Body of Christ in Ephesians 1 and the house of God the Father in Ephesians 2
Even in the Old Testament we have the thought that children are the glory of their father because they are his multiplication
In writing this book John put together a number of different cases in order to give us a clear view of the divine revelation
In contrast to the Gospel of Luke, which gives us a history, the Gospel of John gives us a view, a revelation, of the divine working
The Triune God wants to enter into His people to be their life and even their nature so that they may have the same life and nature as He
In the same chapter the Lord goes on to say, 'Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God
In order to make Himself one with created mankind, God desires to impart Himself into the man created by Him for His purpose
We have seen that John selects nine cases and arranges them in a particular sequence in chapters three through eleven
Both regeneration and resurrection are according to the same principle, a new beginning for something that is of the old creation
If we had been the Lord Jesus, we probably would have been thankful for this opportunity to receive men's exaltation
The Lord's response was quite unexpected: 'Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified'
If we had been there, we probably would have had such an understanding of the Lord's word concerning being glorified
A grain of wheat, on the contrary, will eventually produce fruit, and this fruit-bearing will be its glorification
A carnation seed is glorified when the plant blossoms, and a grain of wheat is glorified when the wheat brings forth fruit
In this way the life within the seed is released to bring forth much fruit, and this fruit-bearing is glorification
By going through the process of death and resurrection, the Lord terminated the old creation and germinated the new creation in resurrection
As the many grains brought forth by Christ in His resurrection, eventually we are ground and blent together to be one loaf, one Body
If we understand this matter, we shall be able to grasp the main point in chapter twelve of the Gospel of John
In this section of the Gospel of John we see how Jesus is glorified, that is, how He, the one grain, is multiplied to become many grains
Let us, then, keep in mind that the main topic of this section is how the Lord Jesus is multiplied in order to be expressed and glorified
Now we can see that before the Lord gave the message recorded in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen, He prayed concerning glorification
For the Son of Man to be glorified is for Him to have His divine element released, expressed, and multiplied through death and resurrection
If we do not see the matter of glorification, we shall not be able to understand this section of John's Gospel
We have also seen that in chapters fourteen fifteen and sixteen three main things are covered the Fathers house the vine and the new man
According to 12:23 and 24, the Lord's glorification is a matter of His multiplication: 'The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified
The answer is that there would be no relationship between a heavenly mansion and the multiplication and glorification of the Son of Man
We should point out that this section is on the glorification of the Lord Jesus, a glorification that involves His multiplication
If the Fathers house in 142 were a mansion in the heavens then it would have nothing to do with the Lords multiplication and glorification
The interpretation which says that the Father's house is a heavenly mansion is altogether contrary to the context
If he answers in this way, you should go on to say, 'How wonderful that your heavenly mansion eventually will be the New Jerusalem
Let us read Revelation 21:10, where the Apostle John tells us that he saw the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God
Eventually, you will go to the New Jerusalem by way of a mansion in the heavens, but we shall go to the New Jerusalem by another way
John certainly was not a Gnostic or influenced by Gnosticism, and oikia in 14:2 does not refer to a heavenly mansion
Paul twice mentions the household of Stephanus, in the first instance using the word oikos and in the second, the word oikia
If Paul used these two words interchangeably in 1 Corinthians, we may also say that they are used interchangeably in the Gospel of John
Anyone who cares to study this matter will learn that elsewhere in the New Testament oikos and oikia are used interchangeably
Some believe that even in the New Testament some trace of the distinction between oikos and oikia still exists
They would say, and in this way they may be correct, that oikos in 2:16 has a somewhat broader meaning than oikia in 14:2
Judas was a tare, and this tare was eliminated before the Lord spoke the message recorded in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen
The Father's house is pure, and the grains produced by Christ as the unique grain constitute a pure multiplication of Him
After the Lord prayed in chapter seventeen, He presented Himself to be arrested, judged, sentenced, and crucified
According to the Gospel of John, the Lord's death was His going away, and His resurrection was His coming to the disciples
Through His going and His coming, He produced the many grains of wheat, and these grains are His glorification
In John's Gospel we see that the resurrected Christ remains within us essentially to be our life so that we may live by Him to bear fruit
Apparently the glorification for which the Lord Jesus prayed in John 17 has nothing to do with the Father's house, the vine, and the new man
It is important for us to see that the glorification of the Son for the glorification of the Father is the building of the Father's house
In chapters twelve through seventeen of the Gospel of John we see that the divine glorification is actually a matter of the church life
According to 12:24, the Lord Jesus fell into the ground as a grain of wheat, died, and then was raised up to produce many grains
As the many grains, we are the members of the Body, the abodes of the Father's house, the branches of the vine, and the parts of the new man
After giving a message on the house, the vine, and the new man, the Lord went on to pray concerning the points He had covered in His message
In this message we shall go on to consider the last of the signs in John 14 through 17, the sign of the believers' oneness in the Triune God
In order to have such a oneness, not only must our opinion be terminated, but even our own person must be terminated
John 17:2 says, 'Even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him'
If our oneness is a matter of having the same opinion or believing the same doctrine, this oneness will not last
The more we are mingled with the Triune God through His dispensing, the more we are mingled, blended, together in the Triune God
Their unity can be compared to bricks that are attached in some way, whereas the oneness in the Triune God can be compared to solid rock
We have the oneness of the believers in the Father's glory given to the Son and given to the believers by the Son
We are safeguarded by the Father's Person, by the Triune God, and by the glorious expression of the Triune God
The Father's house in chapter fourteen is the vine in chapter fifteen, and the vine is the new man in chapter sixteen
The Lord has enlightened us to see that the Father's house, the vine, the new man, the glorification, and the oneness are all one thing
John's Gospel opens with the words: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
In order to see the connection, we need to penetrate into the depths of the Gospel of John and find what is the extract of chapter eighteen
Such answers, although somewhat close to the truth, may be according to the doctrines the saints have learned in the Lord's recovery
No matter what our need may be, no matter what our case may be, the Lord Jesus is able to meet our need and take care of our case
The first case, that of Nicodemus, is a case of regeneration, and the last case, that of Lazarus, is a case of resurrection
On the one hand, apart from resurrection no one can be regenerated; on the other hand, regeneration is related to resurrection
All the cases found in the first eleven chapters of this Gospel are in the principle of regeneration by resurrection
These cases reveal that the Lord Jesus is fully qualified and adequate to meet all the needs of those in death
If we had been in the Lord's place in chapter twelve of John, we probably would have said, 'How wonderful that the people are welcoming Me
If we see this, then we shall know the answer to the question concerning what aspect of Christ's death is emphasized in the Gospel of John
As such a One, He had come for a single purpose-to reproduce Himself, to have Himself multiplied, through death and resurrection
In chapter one of John's Gospel we have the Lord as the Lamb of God, and in chapter twelve we see Him as a grain of wheat
If a grain of wheat remained alone and did not fall into the earth to die, it could never be multiplied or glorified
As a whole, John's Gospel reveals that the Triune God desires to work Himself into His chosen people to make them His reproduction
According to 12:24, the Lord brought forth this reproduction by falling into the ground as a grain of wheat to die
We have seen that after the resurrection of Lazarus, the crowd welcomed the Lord Jesus and wanted to exalt Him
Concerning the Lord's death, 12:31 says, 'Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out'
In the sight of God and in the sight of the angels demons and Satan this world has been judged condemned and its ruler has been cast out
Even though many believers are weak, it cannot be denied that Christians are Christ's multiplication and glorification
In chapter fourteen we have the Father's house; in chapter fifteen, the vine with all its branches; and in chapter sixteen, the newborn man
The Father's house, the vine, and the new man are all the result of Christ's multiplication; they are the issue of His reproduction
As we have pointed out in previous messages, the Father's house, the vine, and the new man are the Lord's glorification
In chapter seventeen the Lord prayed for His multiplication, which would be the issue, the result, of His death
After praying for His glorification, the Lord presented Himself in chapter eighteen to be arrested, tried, judged, and put to death
If you make such a comparison you will see that the synoptic Gospels emphasize aspects that are different from those emphasized in John 18
In John 18 we also see that Judas brought a band of soldiers and deputies with weapons to seize the Lord and arrest Him
Verse 4 says, 'Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, went forth and said to them, Whom are you seeking'?
One reason this name is used here is that John's record is to show us how Jehovah, the Triune God, works Himself into His chosen people
As we read John 18, we see that the emphasis of the record here is certainly different from that in the other Gospels
According to John's Gospel, the One who was arrested in the garden was the Lamb of God, but even more He was a grain of wheat
In order to avoid being arrested, it would not have been necessary for the Lord to call the angels to fight for Him
For what purpose did the Lord give Himself to those who betrayed Him, arrested Him, judged Him, and sent Him to be put to death?
Judas betrayed the Lord and Peter bold in the flesh to resist first cut off the ear of a slave of the high priest and later denied the Lord
Not long before the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus, the Roman Empire adopted crucifixion as a method of executing criminals
Immediately before Pilate asked Him about being a king, the Lord had said to him, 'My kingdom is not of this world
The Gospel of John is the only Gospel that records this aspect of the conversation between Pilate and the Lord Jesus
The Lord Jesus indicated to Pilate that He came as the King of the kingdom of God and also came to testify to the truth
For the Lord to testify to the truth means that He testified that the Triune God is the real content of the universe
As soon as Pilate ended his conversation with the Lord Jesus, he went out to the Jews and said to them, 'I find no fault whatever in him'
There was a manifestation of the Lord as the King of the kingdom of God and as the living witness to the truth, the universal reality
We have seen that the emphasis with respect to the Lord's death in John's Gospel is on multiplication rather than redemption
The second man was not created; rather, the second man was begotten, produced, through Christ's death and resurrection
The result of Christ's death and resurrection is multiplication, and this multiplication is the Lord's glorification
The Son's glorification issues in the Father's glorification because the Father is glorified in the Son's glorification
Now we need to see that this glorification is a matter of multiplication, and this multiplication has not ceased
In the synoptic Gospels the Lord commands the disciples to go forth and preach the gospel to disciple the nations
In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus does not charge us to go forth to preach the gospel in order to win souls
As we have pointed out, in chapter twelve there was a golden opportunity for the Lord to be exalted and to have a large crowd following Him
Because we are not willing to die, God in His sovereignty prepares everyone and everything necessary to bring us into death
He may prepare a 'Judas' to betray you and a good-hearted 'Peter,' who may think that he is helping you by defending you
We know that Peter only caused trouble for the Lord Jesus by cutting off the ear of the slave of the high priest
Some of us had the concept that if we loved the Lord and took His way in the recovery, everything related to us would be flourishing
We expected to have a good wife or husband and children who were obedient and would eventually become successful in their professions
Judas' betrayal, Peter's resistance, the high priest's rejection, and Pilate's judgment were all helpful in this regard
He was ready for this, for He was ready to be sown as a grain of wheat so that through death and resurrection He might be multiplied
As the many grains produced by the one grain, we are the branches of the vine to bear fruit for the glorification of the Father
The soldiers, having plaited a crown out of thorns, put it on His head, and threw around Him a purple garment'
Verse 17 says, 'And bearing the cross Himself, He went out to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha'
According to the facts of history, it was not the purpose of the cross to cause suffering; instead, the cross was for terminating people
It terminates the things, the matters, and the people of the old creation, all of which are contrary to God's purpose
John 19:18 says that 'they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on this side and one on that, and Jesus in the middle'
The Gospel of Luke also speaks of this, telling us, 'There were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death
If we study this matter we shall see the difference between the words recorded in the Gospel of John and those recorded in the other Gospels
Before we consider the sign of the fourth word spoken by the Lord Jesus, let us consider the words recorded in the synoptic Gospels
In Luke 23:34 we have the first of the words spoken by the Lord on the cross: 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do'
During the second period of three hours, He spoke four other words: 'My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me'?
When the Lord cried out concerning God's forsaking Him, this was an indication that He was our Substitute bearing our sins
The seventh word, when the Lord committed His spirit into the hands of the Father, is also related to redemption
How could the Lord's mother have one of His disciples as a son, and how could this disciple become the son of the Lord's mother?
The deep significance of the Lords word here is that through His death the divine life within Him was released and imparted to His believers
Toward the end of His hours on the cross, when the Lord Jesus realized that everything was finished, He said, 'I thirst'
The Lord Jesus indicated His thirst and need of a drink because He knew that 'all things had now been accomplished'
John 19:29 and 30 say, 'A vessel full of vinegar was lying there; so they put a sponge full of vinegar on hyssop and brought it to His mouth
It was necessary for sin and sins to be taken away, for the old creation to be terminated, and for the divine life to be released
Through this work He accomplished redemption, He terminated the old creation, and He released the divine life to produce the new creation
When God desired a certain thing to come into existence, He simply spoke the word, and that thing came into being
We need to be impressed with the difference between the producing of the old creation and the producing of the new creation
Through the working of the Lord in His death, the divine life within Him was released to produce the new creation
In referring to the Lord's word, 'It is finished,' they emphasized that the Lord's redemptive work was finished
Many Bible teachers have not gone on to point out that through His death the Lord's divine life was released from within Him
We have seen that there is an important difference between the Lord as the Lamb of God and as the grain of wheat
The Lord's death, on the negative side, is to take away our sins and, on the positive side, to impart life into us
Most Christians, including many Christian teachers, see only one aspect of Christ's death, the redemptive aspect
We need to see that the Lord's death has two aspects: the aspect of redemption and the aspect of life impartation
If we see only the redemptive aspect of the Lord's death, this means that we see the procedure but not the goal
Because the Lord is the resurrection and the life, in His behavior as described in John 19 there is nothing of the fear of death
The soldiers mocked the Lord Jesus when they put the thorn crown and the purple garment on Him, but He accepted their mocking
According to 19:7, the Jews said to Pilate that according to their law the Lord Jesus deserved to die 'because he made himself Son of God'
When Pilate was told about Jesus' being the Son of God, he was afraid and asked the Lord concerning His place of origin
John 19:17 says, 'And bearing the cross Himself, He went out to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha'
He did not protest, as we might have done, saying that He had done nothing wrong or complaining that He had to bear His own cross
Those who were persecuting the Lord Jesus first took off His garments and then mockingly put a purple garment on Him
After they nailed Him to the cross, the soldiers took His garments and made four parts, a part for each soldier
Because the Lord is the resurrection and the life, He did not have any reaction to being stripped of His garments
Jesus, seeing His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by, said to His mother, Woman, behold, your son
Even under the suffering of the betrayal of His false disciple and the arrest of the soldiers the Lord still took good care of His disciples
John 19:34 says, 'One of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water'
Verse 36 explains, 'For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of Him shall be broken'
We have the sign of the unbroken bones signifying the Lord's unbreakable resurrection life for the producing of the church
The bone in Genesis 2 is a type of the Lord's resurrection life, which is unbreakable and which was released through His death
Ephesians 5 reveals that Adam producing Eve to be his wife is a type of Christ producing the church to be His counterpart
The water that flowed out of His pierced side signifies His resurrection life, which is typified by the unbroken bone
Through the piercing of the Lord's side to release the flow of His life the Lord's word in 12:24 was fulfilled
The many grains have been produced to form the church, and the church is the bride to match the wonderful Christ as the Bridegroom
We have seen that when the Lord was dying on the cross, He was working for the accomplishment of God's purpose
As we read the Gospel of John, we see what wonderful things were done by Him and through Him as He lived as a man among men
When we read John 18 and 19, we may sympathize with the Lord in a natural way and pity Him for all His sufferings
In everything recorded in these chapters the Lord behaved Himself as the One who is the resurrection and the life
Let us review some of the details concerning how the Lord as the resurrection and the life behaved in the presence of death
After praying concerning His glorification, the Lord boldly went to the garden for the purpose of handing Himself over to death
After uttering this prayer, He boldly went to the garden to present Himself to those who would put Him to death
We have pointed out that the Lord's behavior in these chapters indicates that He was not at all afraid of death
His one request was that they would let His disciples go: 'If therefore you are seeking Me, let these go away'
In 12:24 the Lord indicated that He as a grain of wheat would fall into the ground and die and then grow up to produce many grains
In a short period of time perhaps less than forty hours this prayer was answered when in resurrection the Lord was multiplied and glorified
It is significant that the Lord was resurrected not on the last day of the week, but on the first day of the week
The first mention of the eighth day in the Scriptures is related to the circumcision of the children of Israel
The sign of the first day of the week indicates that the entire universe has a new beginning in Christ's resurrection
Whereas the Lord's death was a termination of the old creation, His resurrection was the germination of the new creation
For this reason, instead of keeping the Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, we meet on the Lord's Day, which is the first day of the week
The one who was sober asked why the ointment was wasted, and why it was not sold for a certain amount of money
Some may say that Mary the Magdalene was foolish to go to the tomb early in the morning, while it was yet dark
After believing the fact of the Lord's resurrection, 'the disciples therefore went away again to their own home'
The Lord's word to Mary indicated that in resurrection His disciples had become the same as He insofar as they also were sons of God
Mary was the first to receive the revelation of this, for she was not satisfied with the fact, but was seeking the experience of Christ
We need to learn from this sign not to be satisfied with the mere fact or doctrine but to seek the experience of the resurrected Christ
According to this hymn, the empty tomb implies that our sins have been forgiven and that our case has been solved before God
Because the church is altogether in resurrection, we should not bring anything of the old creation into the church life
In John's Gospel the resurrection is divine and mysterious, for it is related to Christ's multiplication and glorification
In verse 17 the Lord told Mary the Magdalene not to touch Him, because He had 'not yet ascended to the Father'
The firstfruits were not to be enjoyed by the people; rather, they were to be offered to God for His enjoyment
According to Leviticus 23:11, the day the firstfruit was offered to God was one day after the Sabbath, that is, on the first day of the week
At the expiration of those days, He publicly ascended to the heavens; that is, He ascended openly in the sight of His disciples
If we did not have this word, how would we know that on the day of the Lord's resurrection we became His brothers?
We should be thankful to Mary that her love held the Lord back at least for a few minutes in order to reveal such a mystery
Verse 19 indicates that on the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the Lord's disciples were gathered together
In John 20 we have a record that on the day of His resurrection the Lord Jesus came back to His disciples and met with them
On the one hand, the disciples were comforted; on the other hand, they were shocked by the Lord's sudden appearance
As we have already indicated, this signifies that His commission to the disciples is like the Father's commission to Him
If we see this, we shall have assurance and confidence, and this assurance and confidence will become our power and authority
According to the Gospel of John, the resurrected Christ breathed Himself into His disciples as the holy breath and now dwells in them
The Gospel of John reveals that God lived among men, that life passed through death, and that now the Spirit is moving in resurrection
We were deeply touched by Him in the meeting, and we even received the holy breath through the Lord's breathing upon us
Verse 9 says, 'When they got out then onto the land, they saw a fire of coals laid there, and fish lying on it and bread'
The account in chapter twenty-one of Peter's experience in fishing reminds us of what is recorded in chapter five of the Gospel of Luke
Peter may have felt that the Lord had left them and that they had nothing to do, nothing to live on, and nowhere to go
Concerning this, it is significant that 21:1 tells us, 'Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias'
Some of the saints may say, 'Brother Lee, we agree with you concerning what you minister about spiritual things
When the disciples got onto the land with the fishes, they saw a fire of coals with fish lying on it and bread
There is no further record to indicate that Peter was ever again troubled concerning the matter of having food to eat
Of remaining in Galilee, he went to Jerusalem according to the Lord's word, a place that was not safe for the followers of the Lord Jesus
In this aspect of the aggregate sign in chapter twenty-one we see that Peter was not only trained but also restored
John 21:9 says, 'When they got out then onto the land, they saw a fire of coals laid there, and fish lying on it and bread'
Verse 15 says, 'Then when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these'?
In verse 15 the Lord said to Peter, 'Feed My lambs'; in verse 16, 'Shepherd My sheep'; and in verse 17, 'Feed My sheep'
According to this Psalm, the Lord as our Shepherd causes us to lie down in the tender grass, and He leads us beside the waters of quietness
In Psalm 23 the Shepherd has the rod and the staff to use in protecting the flock from anything that would cause harm
In these verses the words 'lambs' and 'sheep' refer to the flock, which is a collective noun denoting the church
In his first Epistle Peter regards the Lord as the chief Shepherd and all the elders, including himself, as shepherds caring for God's flock
In John 21 the Lord Jesus went on to give Peter further training, training concerning his death to glorify God
Peter when he heard that he would be martyred to glorify God wanted to know what would happen to another disciple the one whom Jesus loved
If we were called by the Lord to be martyrs, we would want to know about the destiny of other brothers in the Lord
Between these two events the Lords resurrection and His coming we have various matters related to the Christian life during the church age
We all need to see the revelation concerning the issue of Christ's resurrection-the producing of His many brothers
Because of the Lord's resurrection, God is our Father, and we have been begotten, regenerated, by Him to be His many sons
We need to meet with the brothers in the church to enjoy the Lord's presence and then be breathed on by the Lord to receive the Holy Spirit
As we have seen, in chapter twenty-one Peter was reminded not to love the Lord Jesus with his natural strength
Finally, we need to practice the Lord's invisible presence either until we die to glorify God or until He comes back
We have also seen that according to the Lords word in 211822 some believers will die to glorify God and others will live until His coming
In this concluding message let us consider some other important matters revealed in chapter twenty-one of the Gospel of John
If the Lord meant that He would leave the disciples and later come back to them, how could He say, 'Follow Me'?
With the truths in the Bible there are two aspects: an outward, visible aspect and an inward, invisible aspect
We have been opposed by those who hold only the outward aspect, the outward view, because we have both the outward and inward aspects
The outward aspect or view of the truth is mainly a matter of doctrine, but the inward aspect is for experience
Which aspect of the Lord's presence do you treasure more, the aspect of His visible presence or the aspect of His invisible presence?
If we answered this question frankly, most of us would have to admit that we treasure His visible presence more than His invisible presence
The reason for this reaction would be that they have not had sufficient experience of the Lord's invisible presence
If we experience the Lord's invisible presence adequately, then we shall be excited when we are brought into His visible presence
Because the Gospel of John emphasizes the Lord's invisible presence, in this Gospel there is no record of the Lord's public ascension
Do you prefer the Lord as Emmanuel, as the One with you outwardly, or as the life-giving Spirit, the One dwelling within you?
We have seen that with the Lord's presence there are two aspects, the visible presence and the invisible presence
Because He as the first Comforter is a person, then the other Comforter, the Spirit of reality, should also be a person
In John 14 we have two Comforters, the Lord and the Spirit of reality, and it seems that these two Comforters are two persons
In chapters fourteen and twenty we have two aspects of the Spirit: the Spirit as another Comforter and the Spirit as the breath of Christ
Whereas the Spirit as another Comforter is a person, the Spirit as the breath of Christ is not a person separate from Christ
We have seen that, according to chapter fourteen, Christ is the first Comforter and the Spirit is another Comforter
As viewed from another aspect, the inward, subjective aspect, the Spirit, the second Comforter, is the breath of Christ, the first Comforter
In chapter twenty-one, the Lord who manifested Himself to the disciples is the real Comforter as the breath who dwells in the disciples
Just as the disciples were trained in John 21, we also need to learn how to live by this indwelling pneumatic Christ
