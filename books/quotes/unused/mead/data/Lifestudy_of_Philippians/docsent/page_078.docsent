   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITHOUT ANXIETY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 6 Paul goes on to say, In nothing be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Often when we hear bad news, we worry and fall into anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anxiety undermines the living of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead of being anxious, in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving we should make our requests known to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then the peace of God will guard our hearts and thoughts in Christ Jesus v. 7 . The peace of God saves us from worry and anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul s word here proves that our interpretation of these verses according to our experience is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Being free from anxiety is for the purpose of keeping us calm and tranquil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 6 Paul charges us in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The words in everything refer to the many different things which happen to us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Under the Lord s blessing, many positive things happen, and we hear good news.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, we also experience negative things and hear bad news.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, we should make our requests known to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Prayer is general with the essence of worship and fellowship; petition is special for particular needs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Notice that Paul says with thanksgiving, not and thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that both our prayer and petition should be accompanied by thanksgiving to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It may seem easy to understand Paul s word, Let your requests be made known to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But we should not take this word for granted, assuming that we understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have spent considerable time studying the phrase to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It may also be rendered before God or in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Greek preposition is pros, often translated with John 1:1; Mark 9:19; 2 Cor 5:8; 1 Cor 16:6; 1 John 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It denotes motion towards, in the sense of a living union and communion, implying fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, the force of to God here is in fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should let our requests be made known to God in such a fellowship, in such a union and communion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This requires that we pray to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In our prayer to God there must be the essence of worship and fellowship, and also petitions for particular needs.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even if we do not have specific needs, we still need a time of prayer day by day to worship the Lord and have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we worship the Lord and have fellowship with Him in prayer, we enjoy communion with Him and practice the organic union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The issue, the result, of practicing the organic union with the Lord is that the peace of God guards our hearts and thoughts in Christ Jesus v. 7 . The peace of God is actually God as peace v. 9 , infused into us through our fellowship with Him by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This peace is the counterpoise of troubles and the antidote to anxiety John 16:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Bad news or difficult situations may cause us to worry or to be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We find the antidote to this anxiety when we pray, practice communion with God, and enjoy the organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then spontaneously, even unconsciously, the peace of God is transfused into our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This transfused peace becomes the counterpoise of trouble and becomes the antidote to anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From experience we know that through prayer we receive this antidote to anxiety when the peace of God is infused into us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Having the peace of God as the counterpoise to our troubles does not mean that the troubles will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The troubles remain, but we have a counterpoise.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, the poison of anxiety is still within us, but we have an antidote the peace of God transfused into our being through our fellowship with God in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we enjoy God as our peace, we are made calm within.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In verse 7 Paul says that the peace of God will guard our hearts and our thoughts in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Greek word rendered guard may also be rendered mount guard over.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The God of peace patrols or stands guard before our hearts and thoughts in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The heart is the source, and the thoughts are the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The peace of God guards both our hearts and our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that in Christ Jesus the peace of God patrols as a guard who goes back and forth before our hearts and our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The peace of God which patrols within our inner being in such a way keeps us calm and tranquil.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even though we may have many troubles and much anxiety, nothing will disturb us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not a mere teaching, but a word which corresponds to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From experience we know that the peace of God infused into us keeps us calm.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Toward man we need the forbearance mentioned in verse 5, and with God we need the fellowship to which Paul refers in verses 6 and 7.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As two leading aspects of the expression of a life that lives Christ, forbearance and fellowship cause us to remain calm inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this way we shall become a tranquil people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This does not mean, however, that nothing negative will happen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, it means that we need not be disturbed by negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not complain about your living situation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Live Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The first expression of your living of Christ will be forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To say that we should be forbearing and free of anxiety does not mean that every day we shall receive only good news.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Quite often Satan will send us bad news.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But we need not be troubled by this bad news, for we have the peace of God, God Himself as peace, within us, guarding our inner feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, if we would experience this peace of God, we need to pray and have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In 4:5-7 Paul does not mention a third thing apart from forbearance and not having anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Instead, he simply points out two important aspects of a life that lives Christ that we have forbearance, but no anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we are forbearing and free from anxiety, we are kept tranquil and in a calm atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then we can live Christ and have the full enjoyment of Christ.</S>
