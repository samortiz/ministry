<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1>
<p>These messages were taken from the book of Revelation concerning the seven Spirits of God for the local churches. They were given by Brother Witness Lee in the evening meetings of the 1969 summer conference in Los Angeles, California and were originally published in <em>The Stream,</em> volumes 7 and 8, in November 1969 and February and May of 1970.</p>
