<h2 class="head2">Up to the Present (Putien)</h2><p>The church moved out of the place in Taoxiang this spring, and we have been continuing the table, fellowship, and prayer meetings in the Lan's home at Ru-Nan village. Since we began this last month, the Lord has opened a door for the gospel. Although the brothers who speak for the Lord are very weak, He has given us a number of saved ones, and the numbers have not diminished from when we met in the hall in Taoxiang. This is something for which we should thank and worship.</p><p>Please pray for us in the church in Putien, Fukien, that we would continue going on in God's grace and light.</p><p>Chu Ai-zeng and Huang Guang-hua<br />November 30, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">May the Lord Not Forsake the Corner of Tientai</h2><p>In Tientai's cities and villages, there are nine localities meeting in the Lord's name; they are Chengzhong, Huangdanchiu, Huanao, Shantouwang, Jingtoutang, Shuangliu, Shiayangtien, Tantou, and Hexi. Every two months we have a fellowship meeting in which all the responsible brothers and the brothers and sisters who pursue the Lord meet together. Everyone is eager to attend the meeting, but we feel that we are sheep without a shepherd! May the merciful Lord not forsake the corner of Tientai.</p><p>Chou Liang-mei, Xi Xing-zhen, and Chen Dao-tan<br />December 3, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">All Is God's Mercy (Canton)</h2><p>Thanks and praise be to the Lord for putting us (Liao Bo-hui, Chen-chi, and me) in Canton with the brothers and sisters to learn to serve together. Although we are weak and immature, God has worked according to His rich love and mercy, beyond what we could ask or think. Between April of last year and October of this year, three hundred forty-eight people have been baptized into His name. The brothers and sisters are coordinating in one accord and learning to serve God together.</p><p>The Lord Himself has opened a door for the gospel. Whenever we preach the gospel in the meeting hall or in the homes of the brothers and sisters, people get saved. In September, Brother Chen Ze-xin came here for a ten-day conference, and we made some new arrangements for the affairs of the church. We are not worthy to participate in the Lord's work, nor are we worthy to receive His marvelous doings. We can only give thanks by saying, "He will have mercy on whomever He will have mercy, and He will have compassion on whomever He will have compassion." May all the glory be unto Him.</p><p>The least member,<br />De-er<br />November 6, 1950</p>
