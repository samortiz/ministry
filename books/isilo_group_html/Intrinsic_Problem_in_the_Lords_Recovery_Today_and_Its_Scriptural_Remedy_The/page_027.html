<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO FACE<br />
THE PRESENT DIVISIVE SITUATION<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:15; 2 John 1-2; 3 John 3-4; Rom. 16:17; Titus 3:10; 2 John 7-11; 1 Cor. 5:2, 11-13; 11:19; 4:1-5; 2 Cor. 5:10</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover the way to face the present divisive situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. But before we do this, I would like to present to you a list of truths that can help us to clear up the dimmed vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery among us today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE PRACTICAL TRUTHS<br />
VERSUS THE DISSENTING ACCUSATIONS</h2>
<p>In his withdrawal from the eldership of the church in Anaheim on March 19, 1989, Brother John Ingalls charged us with a number of accusations concerning our present situation. Hence, I have the burden to present to the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery some truths that will blow away the cloud that has dimmed the clear vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery among us, and will bring back to us a clear sky with a clear view in the recovery. These practical truths are versus some of John&rsquo;s dissenting accusations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Dissenting Accusation&mdash;<br />
the Change of the Nature<br />
of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The nature of what we call the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has changed.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the recovery of:</p>
<ol class="upper-alpha">
<li>The church ground of oneness versus division.</li>
<li>The church as the organic Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</li>
<li>The all-inclusive Christ as the mystery of God.</li>
<li>The life-giving and compound Spirit.</li>
<li>The divine life in Christ.</li>
<li>The divine revelation of the holy Word.</li>
</ol>
<p>These six items are the main contents of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and the nature of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery should be the very nature of the elements of these items as the contents of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Whatever changes have been made in our practice up to the present time, not one of them can be considered as something that has caused the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to change in its nature.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. The Dissenting Accusation&mdash;the Emphasizing<br />
of the Building Up of the Ministry<br />
More Than the Local Churches</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There has been a change of emphasis to the building up of the work or the ministry more than the local churches...it seems that in the past years...there has been more emphasis on the churches being for the ministry. The ministry has been promoted, exalted, and built up, and the churches have suffered greatly in the process.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Intrinsic Problem in the Lord's Recovery Today and Its Scriptural Remedy &nbsp; pg 27</div><br></body></html>
