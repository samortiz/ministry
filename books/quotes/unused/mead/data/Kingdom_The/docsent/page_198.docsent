   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At His judgment seat in the air, He will exercise His judgment over all the real Christians to decide who will be selected and chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those will be the overcomers who will return to the earth and fight against the rebellious army of Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After defeating Antichrist and his army, the overcomers will be His co-kings reigning with Him in His kingdom on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That will be the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
