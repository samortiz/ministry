   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Son of the King</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>in the Parable of the Marriage Feast</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the Lord Jesus has spoken the parable of the evil husbandmen of the vineyard in Matthew 21:33-46, referring to the Old Testament, likened to a vineyard, with the focus on the labor under the law, He continues to speak another parable, the parable of the marriage feast in Matthew 22:1-14, referring to the New Testament, likened to a marriage feast, with the focus on the enjoyment of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Both the householder of the former parable and the king of the latter one are God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The son of both the householder and the king is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the former parable Christ is the Heir who inherits the Father s possession and becomes the cornerstone of God s building, joining together God s people of different sources.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the latter parable Christ is the Bridegroom who satisfies the Father s desire and becomes the pleasure of God s invited ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both the Old Testament and the New Testament are for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is the center of God s economy!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>19.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lightning Coming Forth</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>from the East and Shining to the West</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Matthew 24:3 the disciples asked the Lord Jesus concerning the sign of His coming and of the consummation, the end, of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As part of His answer, recorded in chapters twenty-four and twenty-five of Matthew, the Lord says, As the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be 24:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Greek word rendered coming in this verse, as in verse 3, is parousia, which means presence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ s coming will be His presence with His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This parousia will begin with His coming to the air and end with His coming to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Within His parousia there will be the rapture of the majority of the believers to the air 1 Thes 4:15-17 , the judgment seat of Christ 2 Cor 5:10 , and the marriage of the Lamb Rev 19:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Matthew 24:27 indicates that Christ will be in the air for His coming to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the lightning flashes from the east to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The coming parousia of Christ has two aspects: one is the secret aspect toward His watchful believers; the other is the open aspect toward the unbelieving Jews and Gentiles, The lightning in verse 27 signifies the open aspect after the great tribulation v. 29 , whereas the thief s coming in verse 43 signifies the secret aspect before the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Lightning is concealed in a cloud, waiting for an opportunity to flash forth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ will also be clothed with a cloud Rev 10:1 in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear like a flash to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>20.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Thief in the Parable of Watching</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Matthew 24:43 the Lord Jesus says, If the householder knew in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The householder refers to the believer and the house, to the believer s conduct and work that he has built up in his Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A thief comes to steal precious things at an unknown time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No thief tells us in advance of his coming or steals things that are without value.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thieves come secretly to steal what is valuable, having a discerning eye for what is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus will come secretly as a thief to those who love Him and will take them away as His treasures.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because Christ will come to steal valuable things, we should seek to be precious, worthy of being stolen by Him in His secret coming.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A normal Christian is one qualified to be stolen by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, because the time of Christ s secret coming is unknown, we need to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you Rev 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Matthew 24:44 the Lord tells us, Be ready, for the Son of Man comes in an hour that you think not.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, for the Lord s secret coming as a thief we need watchfulness and readiness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>21.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Master of the Faithful Slaves</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>and of the Evil Slaves</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Matthew 24:45-51 Christ is the Master of the faithful slaves and of the evil slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 45 says, Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the appointed time?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The slave here is faithful toward the Lord, who set him over His household, and prudent toward the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The household refers to the believers Eph 2:19 , who are the church 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To give them food is to minister the Word of God with Christ as the life supply to the believers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Blessed is that slave whom his master when he comes shall find so doing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Truly I say to you, that he will set him over all his possessions Matt 24:46-47 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be blessed is to be rewarded by Christ, the Master, with ruling authority in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Master will set the faithful slave over all his possessions as a reward in the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here we see Christ as the Master of the faithful slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In verses 48 through 51 Christ is presented as the Master of the evil slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The evil slave is a saved one, a genuine believer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As the Master, Christ would never assign duties to a false believer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That the evil slave is a saved believer is proved by the fact that he is appointed by the Lord, that he calls the Lord my Master, and that he believes that the Lord is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This evil slave, saying in his heart, My master is delaying his coming v. 48 , begins to beat his fellow slaves, and eat and drink with the drunken v. 49 , that is, to mistreat fellow believers and to keep company with worldly people, who are drunk with worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The master of that slave shall come on a day when he does not expect him, and in an hour which he does not know, and shall cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>50-51 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For Christ, the Master of the evil slave, to cut him asunder, or cut him off, signifies His separating that slave from Himself in His coming glory.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This corresponds to being cast out into outer darkness in Matthew 25:14-30.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Master will appoint the evil slave s portion with the hypocrites, indicating not that the slave will perish eternally but that he will be chastened dispensationally.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Here we see Christ as the Master of the evil slaves.</S>
