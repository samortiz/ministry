<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Ish-bosheth Rivaling David in the Kingship</H2><P>In verses 8 through 10a we see that Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, at the age of forty rivaled David in the kingship. Abner, the son of Ner, the captain of Saul's army, helped Ish-bosheth to become king. Abner took him and made him king over all Israel, and Ish-bosheth reigned over Israel for two years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The War between the House of Saul<br>and the House of David</H2><P>Second Samuel 2:12&#151;4:12 is a record of the war between the house of Saul and the house of David.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Servants of Ish-bosheth<br>Competing with the Servants of David<br>and Being Defeated by Them</H2><P>The servants of Ish-bosheth competed with the servants of David and were defeated by them (vv. 12-17). Verse 17 says, "The battle was very severe that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were routed before the servants of David."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Asahel, a Servant of David, Pursuing<br>After Abner and Being Killed by Him</H2><P>Asahel, a servant of David, pursued after Abner, a servant of Ish-bosheth. Abner said to him, "Turn away from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to Joab your brother?" (vv. 18-22). Asahel refused, and he was killed by Abner (v. 23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Abner Appealing for Peace,<br>and Joab Responding to Him</H2><P>Abner appealed for peace, and Joab responded to him (vv. 24-29). Verse 28 says that Joab blew the trumpet and "all the people stood still; and they pursued after Israel no more, neither did they fight any more." There was peace for a period of time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. David's Servants Killing<br>Three Hundred and Sixty Men of Ish-bosheth</H2><P>In this battle nineteen of David's servants plus Asahel were missing, and the servants of David killed 360 men of Ish-bosheth (vv. 30-32).</P>
