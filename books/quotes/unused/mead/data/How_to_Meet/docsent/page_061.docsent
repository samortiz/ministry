   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>STRANGE INCENSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we burn the incense, however, we should not offer strange incense.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Anything strange is an insult to God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is strange incense?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anything which is not Christ is strange incense.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You may be an exceedingly fine person humble, patient and gentle, etc. If we are such, there is always within us a kind of subconscious concept that in ourselves we are fairly good.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes, of course, our estimation is not so correct.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You may think you are good, but really you are not so good.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may think you are humble, but really you are not so humble.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you come to God with anything of your supposed inherent goodness, you are burning strange incense.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not bring anything other than Christ, no matter how good it may be.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Anything but Christ is strange and is an insult to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let me illustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The marriage life is really a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suppose, however, that you are a brother who has never given your dear wife a difficult time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You have always been patient, humble, and kind toward her, and as a result, she has spread your praise abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If, when you come to the Lord, you bring just a little of this goodness of yours before Him, you are burning strange incense.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Regardless of how good you are, that kind of goodness can never be offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead of a fragrance, it will be a blasphemy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What we can offer to God is nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must say, O Father God, I have nothing to offer You, nothing which You can accept, but Christ, only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Regardless of whether I am sinful or good, all I bring to Thee is Thy dear Son, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No strange incense should ever be offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>STRANGE FIRE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the problem today is not so much with strange incense, but with strange fire.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The fire that consumes the incense must be from the heavens, from God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is the significance of strange fire?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Strange fire is natural enthusiasm.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When you are natural in your fervency, you are offering strange fire before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes we need to be emotional.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be emotional is right, but to be naturally emotional is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you come to burn the incense, you must use the fire from the offering altar.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The offering altar simply means the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must pass through the cross that we may offer Christ as the incense to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now the problem is not with the incense, but with our burning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By what kind of fire do we burn the incense?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With what kind of fervency do we offer the praise of Christ to God?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>TWO EXTREMES</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The enemy is exceedingly subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In so many matters he would keep us either at one extreme or push us to the other.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this matter of praising the Lord, many dear Christians have been retained by the enemy in the extreme of silence, and not only silence, but something much worse death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They really believe, however, that they are right.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When they come to a meeting which is full of praising and singing, of shouting and joyful noise, they are offended and extremely critical.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They like to be kept in that extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They have their human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the subtlety of the enemy to keep them from the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you would not open your mouth to pray and praise the Lord, you can never minister at the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether those who make noise are right or wrong is another matter, but to be dumb and silent is undoubtedly wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those who shout and make a joyful noise may be fifty percent wrong, but it is certain that those who shut their mouths are one hundred percent wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No one should be a dumb worshipper.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must make some noise.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christians are praying ones, Christians are praising ones, and Christians are preaching ones.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you never open your mouth, how can you preach?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You may say that you preach not by what you say, but by what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then you are just a dumb preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If so, God must be wrong, for He created you with an organ for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You may say that your mouth is for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But eating is just for yourself; preaching is for God, speaking is for others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all must say something.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I do not believe Christians should cease from speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They should speak all the day long, either to God, to human beings, to the angels, to the demons and Satan, or sometimes to the creation Mark 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Every one must know that Jesus is my Lord and your Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we come to the meetings, we must be speaking members.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the last one and a half centuries the Lord has recovered the universal priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we would minister in our priestly office, we must open our mouths to speak something, to pray, to praise, or to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I am more than sure that you are wrong if you would not open your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now we come to the other extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If the devil could not hold us at one extreme, he will push us to the other.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He will cause us to burn the incense with a strange fire, with something natural which has never been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>So we need to be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>On one hand we need to be released, and on the other hand we need a certain amount of restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>These two laws are always in operation to maintain anything in existence.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Every one of us must be released, and after being released, every one of us must be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The fire with which the incense is burned on the incense altar must be taken from the offering altar.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Our fervency must originate in the spirit through the dealing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>To be a faithful servant to the Lord in the ministry of the Word is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We would all like to please all men.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I realize that among those reading this book there are two kinds of persons: some who would never open their mouth, and some who would never close their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I must be faithful in speaking to both.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Those who never open their mouth are one hundred percent wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I condemn this.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I do not condemn you, but I condemn the dumbness.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As a little servant of the Lord, I must speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Some of you, however, are so bold.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You must take heed: is that kind of boldness natural or spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Does that kind of boldness originate in your natural disposition, or in your spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You see, we need to be balanced; we need an equal proportion on each side.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is something of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I hope that we all may be equally balanced to open our mouths and at the same time to utter something with heavenly fire.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We must burn the incense and burn it with fire from God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Those who would not open their mouths must obtain mercy and find grace to be delivered from their dumbness.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We speak much about the Lord Jesus as our life and salvation, and in this very matter of dumbness we need Him as our life and our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We need to be utterly delivered from this kind of silence.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Then, on the other hand, once we are set free we need a certain amount of restriction, a certain amount of balance and checking within, that we may not burn the incense with anything natural, but with fire from God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We must offer our praises from the spirit.</S>
