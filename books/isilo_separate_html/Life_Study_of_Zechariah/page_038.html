The Millennial Kingdom as a Time of Restoration</H2><P>Verse 10 says, "I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim / And the horse from Jerusalem, / And the battle bow will be cut off; / And He will speak peace unto the nations, / And His dominion will be from sea to sea / And from the River unto the ends of the earth." This refers to the millennial kingdom, which will be a time of restoration. In the millennial kingdom God will stop all the fighting. This word concerning the kingdom surely must have been a comfort and an encouragement to the people of Israel.</P><P>The sequence in this chapter is very meaningful. Verses 1 through 7 speak concerning the damage and devastation Alexander the Great caused to the nations surrounding Judah. Then verse 8 continues to say that the Lord Himself encamped around His temple within the holy city. This saved Judah with Jerusalem and the temple from the devastation of Alexander. Jerusalem and the temple were spared and saved from the devastation of the enemy. That was a good deliverance and a sign of the coming restoration. However, the coming restoration needs the coming of Christ. For this reason, after the word in verse 8 concerning the deliverance of Jerusalem and the temple, verse 9 says that Christ is coming, being righteous and bearing salvation. Eventually, the situation was right and fitting for Christ's coming, and He came in humility, and also in an intimate manner, riding upon a donkey.</P><P>What should be the issue of Christ's coming? As verse 10 indicates, after His coming peace and restoration should be here, and God's dominion should also be here. In the restoration the first item is peace: "He will speak peace unto the nations." The second item is dominion: "His dominion will be from sea to sea."</P><P>However, when Christ came the first time, He was only welcomed a little and was ultimately rejected, detested to the uttermost, and put to death by being crucified. Regarding His rejection by the children of Israel, the Lord Jesus said, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not! Behold, your house is left to you desolate" (Matt. 23:37-38). The word house denotes the house of God, which was the temple. It was the house of God, but here it is called "your house." The house of God had become their house, and it would be utterly destroyed by Titus in A.D. 70 (Matt. 24:2).</P><P>Because the children of Israel rejected Christ the King, the restoration was somewhat suspended, and a time of judgment over the children of Israel entered in, which has lasted about twenty centuries. Therefore, Christ needs to come a second time, this time not riding a donkey but coming as lightning (Matt. 24:27). Then peace and the eternal kingdom, as God's dominion, will be on the earth from sea to sea. This is the sequence according to the spiritual significance.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> </body></html>
