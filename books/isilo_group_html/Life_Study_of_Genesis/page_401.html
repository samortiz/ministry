It was not his choice that Esau be his brother, nor that Isaac and Rebekah be his parents. The father Isaac, the mother Rebekah, and the brother Esau were all an exact match for Jacob's need. As we have seen, when Jacob was in his mother's womb, he struggled and was under the dealing of God's sovereign hand. From the very beginning of his life, Jacob was defeated. That was the start of his transformation.</P><P>Jacob's father was an enjoying person who did not exercise much discernment. Being a simple person, he just enjoyed grace all day long. He did not like to think, consider, or exercise himself very much. He did not like to do anything. As he was meditating in the field, Rebekah came to him. Isaac simply enjoyed. Whether the sky was clear or cloudy did not make any difference to him. As long as he could eat and enjoy, he was satisfied. When Jacob came to him disguised as Esau, Isaac did not exercise his discernment. When Rebekah was concerned that Jacob might marry one of the daughters of Heth (27:46), Isaac called him, charged him not to take a wife of the daughters of Canaan, and sent him to Laban, his mother's brother. Isaac's simplicity was for Jacob's benefit. If Isaac had not been so simple but had exercised more control, it would have been difficult for Jacob to get the birthright and receive the blessing.</P><P>As we have already pointed out, Rebekah was the opposite of Isaac. She was full of consideration. She might have exercised her mentality day and night considering how to obtain the birthright for Jacob. She might have been constantly watching to see how Isaac was dealing with Esau. If she had not been watching, how could she have overheard the conversation between Isaac and Esau regarding the blessing (27:1-5)? After overhearing this conversation, she immediately called Jacob in and told him what to do (27:6-13). Because Isaac and Rebekah were so different from one another, Jacob obtained the birthright and received the blessing.</P><P>Esau was a careless person. Regarding the birthright, he seemed to say, "Jacob, do you want the birthright? It doesn't mean very much to me. If you give me something to eat, I'll give it to you." By this we see that Esau was rude and careless. The simple father, the ingenious mother, and the rude and careless brother caused Jacob to suffer and to be dealt with.</P><P>After Jacob had supplanted the birthright (25:27-34) and the father's blessing (27:5-29), Esau hated him and intended to kill him (27:41). When Rebekah learned of this, she told Jacob to go to her brother Laban until Esau's fury had turned away (27:32-45). After telling Jacob this, she manipulated the father to send Jacob away. This brought Jacob into the pit of God's transformation. Although it was difficult for Jacob to leave his loving mother and his father's home, he was forced to escape (27:42&#151;28:5). He had no choice. He was forced to flee into a strange land. Later on we shall see that when Jacob was in Laban's home, he was in the oven. Laban, Leah, Rachel, the maids, and all the children were used by God to burn Jacob on every side. Jacob suffered from every angle, in every corner, and in every aspect. God placed him in such a situation that he might be transformed.</P><P>As we read Genesis 25, 27, and 28, we see that God's sovereign hand was upon Jacob to transform him. At that time, however, Jacob did not realize that he was under God's transformation. He only knew his brother's rudeness and hatred, his mother's cleverness, and his father's simpleness. Actually, he was under God's dealing day after day. Not one day was wasted. Every person he met and everything that happened to him was a dealing. Jacob surely represents the aspect of transformation in our spiritual life. If we would know what transformation is, we must read Jacob's story again and again.</P><P>By reading Jacob's story, I have become fully convinced regarding God's dealing hand. After I began to comprehend this, I realized that everything that happens between others and myself is a dealing for me. The elders, the brothers and sisters, my wife, and my children are not to blame. Everything is under God's sovereign hand as a dealing for my profit. I have needed it all. Perhaps tomorrow I shall need another dealing. The Lord knows what kind of wife, husband, children, in-laws, and grandchildren we need. Nothing is accidental. Everything has been prearranged and happens according to God's plan and schedule. Nothing is either too late or too early. Everything occurs on time. Eventually, we shall say, "Father, thank You for Your sovereign hand. Thank You for Your dealing, for Your prearrangement, and for everything You have done. Now I know that everything has been under Your sovereignty. I am just a chosen Jacob under Your hand."</P><P>Do you think that Jacob liked to go to Laban's home? No, he was forced to go. He was not sent by his father or mother; he was sent by the sovereign hand of God. Yes, Jacob was God's choice, and God planned to give him the birthright. Nevertheless, God knew that His chosen one required a great deal of transformation. Thus, it was not merely a matter of the birthright nor of the blessing; it was also a matter of transformation. From the first day until the last, God's hand was upon Jacob. How we must thank and praise the Lord! He has chosen and predestinated us, and now we are under His sovereign hand that we might be dealt with day after day. God is dealing with us through all kinds of persons and circumstances. In the past, a brother said to me, "Everyone in my life has been arranged by God except my wife." I said to him, "Brother, your wife is the number one person whom God has arranged for you." Without exception, every person in our life is used by God for our transformation.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_400.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_402.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Genesis &nbsp; pg 401</div><br></body></html>
