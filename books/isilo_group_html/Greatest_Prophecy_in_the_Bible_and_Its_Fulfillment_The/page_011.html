<p>Now we want to see that Christ has abolished all the ordinances so that He could put the different peoples into Himself to make a new man (Eph. 2:15). For creating the new man, He needed to abolish all the ordinances. An ordinance is a way to worship God or a way of living. Any way for your living or for your worship is an ordinance. The Jews and the Arabs worship the same God, but they are enemies because the ways they worship God are different. The Jews have the Jewish way, and the Arabs have the Arabian way. These different ways create enmity. Even today there are a number of so-called Christian brothers who hate each other. Such religious prejudice is really awful, and it comes from different ways of worship.</p>
<p>In the church life, we do not have any ordinances. We do not have ordinances about how to arrange the chairs or about having quiet or loud meetings. We have no ordinances. Positively speaking, we need to endeavor to keep the oneness of the Spirit and to arrive at the oneness of the faith. Negatively speaking, we have to drop two things: doctrines and ordinances. Today the Lord is carrying out His recovery, and He is demanding that we drop all the doctrines and ordinances.</p>
<p>The Jewish ordinances were abolished on the cross, so the church had an opportunity to come into existence. But regretfully, after not too long a time the Christians created a lot of ordinances. Christians today are divided either by ordinances or by doctrines. There are so-called different churches because of the many doctrines and ordinances among the Christians. In order for the Lord to build up His church, we must keep the oneness and have no ordinances. This does not mean that we become a loose people. We are very proper, but we do not have any ordinances.</p>
<p>In the New Testament you cannot find a definite way for Christians to meet together. The only way you can find in the New Testament for us to worship God is to be in the spirit (John 4:24). There is no other way. People today like to quote 1 Corinthians for the way to meet, and in my early years I did the same. In this book, however, Paul says two things that are very difficult to reconcile. According to 11:5, women may pray and prophesy with their head covered, but in 14:34 Paul says that the women should be silent in the churches. Thus, chapter 11 permits women to speak, but chapter 14 forbids them. How can these passages be reconciled? According to the New Testament principle, for women not to be permitted to speak in the church meetings means that women are not permitted to teach with authority in relation to the defining of the truth (1 Tim. 2:12). In this sense, they should be silent in the church meetings. They may, however, pray and prophesy, that is, speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord in the church meetings. But they must do this under the covering of the brothers.</p>
<p>When I came to Shanghai in 1933, that was the biggest city and the biggest local church among us in China. Brother Nee was very burdened to take care of the speaking in our meetings. The sisters in our meetings were not even allowed to pray at that time. They had to be silent. Brother Nee was bothered by this practice, and he had the burden to show the church that it is okay for the sisters to pray in the meetings. But some of the brothers would not agree with this. Eventually, the announcement was made that in our meetings it would be okay for the sisters to pray. But they were still not allowed to speak, including to testify. Then gradually the leading ones among us agreed that it would be altogether a loss if we did not allow the sisters to give testimonies. Later, we saw that in 1 Corinthians 14 to speak means to teach with authority, not to testify. Thus, we said that it was okay for the sisters to give testimonies.</p>
<p>I am sharing this to show that there is no definite way for us to worship God today, because today is the day of the Spirit. It is no longer the day of any ordinance. We do not have any ordinances. If we are clear about these things, there will be no division among us. We care only for the oneness of the Spirit, and we desire to arrive at the oneness of the faith.</p>
<p>Day by day, we all have to put off the old man and put on the new man by being fully and thoroughly renewed in the spirit of our mind (Eph. 4:22-24). To put on the new man is to put on the church life. By this way we will be one, we will grow, we will be transformed, and we will be built together. This is the real recovery of the Lord&rsquo;s building of the church. I look to Him that in these last days we would be so clear and we would sell ourselves to this recovery.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Greatest Prophecy in the Bible and Its Fulfillment &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
