<h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>We must not think that the days we have lost are a few, unimportant days. If we consider the journey the Israelites took in the wilderness, we will realize how serious it is to waste our days. Three months after the Israelites left Egypt, they came to Sinai (Exo. 19:1). They remained there for ten months. On the twentieth day of the second month in the second year, they left Sinai and traveled toward the land God promised to give them for their inheritance (Num. 10:11-12). Deuteronomy 1:2 says, "It is eleven days' journey from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea by the way that leads to Mount Seir." Kadesh-barnea was at the border of the land of Canaan. It was only an eleven-day journey from Mount Sinai to Canaan. Yet when they arrived at Kadesh-barnea, they could not enter Canaan because of their unbelief. After this they wandered in the wilderness for thirty-eight years before their descendants finally entered Canaan. This was indeed a big, indirect route! It took not just three or five years but thirty-eight years. They spent thirty-eight years on a journey to Canaan that should have taken them only two years! In our spiritual journey, there are countless wasted days. Some problems can be dealt with in three to five days, yet they remain unsolved in some people for three to five years. These ones are like the Israelites, who circled around in the wilderness and wasted many days. This is a great loss. We should not consider it to be inconsequential.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>The story of Abraham also shows us that parts of his life were counted and parts were not counted. According to Acts 7:2-3, while Abraham was still in Mesopotamia (i.e., in Ur), God appeared to him, saying, "Come out from your land and from your relatives, and come into the land which I will show you." What did he do? He would not have had peace if he did not obey; yet he was not willing to obey completely. As a result, he partially obeyed. God told him to come out from his relatives, yet he took his relatives along. He did not go alone; rather, he brought his nephew Lot and his father Terah with him. God intended that he go all the way to Canaan. Yet he went only as far as Haran and stayed there (Gen. 11:31). This is the picture of a Christian who is not willing to be absolute. Some Christians are not altogether cold; they still have some glow in them. Yet they are not hot. This was Abraham's condition. He left Ur of the Chaldees, yet he did not enter Canaan. He was like a halfway Christian.</p><p>After his father Terah died, God called Abraham again (12:1). This time, God called him from Haran. God's will cannot be changed. Once He has decided to do something, He will always accomplish it. God wanted Abraham to go to Canaan, and Abraham's deterrence in Haran did not change His will at all. The first time God called Abraham, he only obeyed halfway. Therefore, God called him the second time. When Abraham obeyed God by leaving Haran, the Bible immediately points out that he was seventy-five years old (12:4). His years in Ur were not mentioned, and his years in Haran were not mentioned either. But the minute he left Haran for Canaan, the Bible points out that his age was seventy-five. This shows us a new beginning in his life. The days Abraham spent in Haran, the days he tarried halfway, were wasted days; God did not remember those days. Brothers and sisters, in looking back at our past, we find that there are numerous days we have lost! We must remember that God has no concern for the days in Haran. We often walk according to our self-will. We become lazy and seek our own comfort; we tarry halfway. These are days in Haran and days which will not be counted. In order to receive blessing from God, Abraham had to leave Haran. The year he was seventy-five years old was the year he left Haran. Until then the Bible did not record his age. Until then God did not consider that his age was worth mentioning. He wants man to obey Him in an absolute way!</p><p>These were not the only years Abraham wasted. He also suffered a loss in the course of begetting a son. God promised Abraham that he would have a son. Yet he took his wife's suggestion and married Hagar as his concubine. He committed the sin of presumptuousness in the eyes of God. Later, Hagar gave birth to a son; however, this son was born out of Abraham's fleshly energy rather than out of God's promise. At the end of Genesis 16, he is spoken of as being eighty-six years old. But at the beginning of chapter seventeen, he was ninety-nine years old. There was a gap of thirteen years. During those thirteen years, there is no record of anything concerning him. We do not see him building an altar, and God did not appear to him once. He did not receive any new revelation or promises. Those days were empty days and days of nothingness. Those were the days Ishmael grew up. We have to remember that this period of Abraham's life was wasted and lost. Brothers and sisters, have we received any new experience, new light, and new messages during the past few years? Was anyone saved through our hands during the past few years? Did anyone receive our help during the past few years? Have we received a deeper knowledge of God during the past few years? Have we gained a stronger assurance of His promises? Have we renewed our consecration to God? If we did not have any of these experiences, our days were wasted days. An older sister once said, "Every single day of a Christian's life should count for a day. This is the way to assure our reward." What a pity that ten days often do not add up to one day! Brothers and sisters, it would be wonderful if we could live our Christian life in a conscientious way. If we spend our days foolishly, rebelling against God, sinning, and walking according to our self-will, our days have been wasted in the eyes of the Lord; our time has been squandered away. What a waste this is!</p><p>Why does the Bible point out that Abraham's age was ninety-nine? It is because he was circumcised in that year. One year after he was circumcised, he begot Isaac. The meaning of circumcision is the removal of the flesh. If we walk according to the flesh, our years are wasted. May we start today by removing everything that is of the flesh and offering ourselves up fully on the altar, so that we will no longer waste our time. We should not wait for fifty years to find out that we have wasted forty-nine of them. We have to consider how many days we have wasted in foolishness and how many days we have left. If we are waiting for the Lord's coming every day, we will pay attention to the way we spend our days.</p>
