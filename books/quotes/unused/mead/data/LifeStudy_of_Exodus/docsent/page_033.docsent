   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. To Carry Out God s Commission</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With Christians today we rarely see this kind of matching.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is very little coordination between Christian workers because they lack the vision of the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am burdened that we all, as God s called ones, see the need of such a match.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have known some very gifted brothers who became useless because they refused to accept a match.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A matching one binds us and restricts us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason, it is difficult to be matched with others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A three-legged race illustrates the principle of matching.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In a three-legged race, the runners have one of their legs tied to one of their partner s legs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord s service is not a race run by individuals; it is a race run by those who are bound to another member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To dislike such an arrangement is to dislike the Lord s service.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you want to share in His work, you must be willing to be part of a twosome in a three-legged race.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you refuse to be bound to another, you are disqualified from this race.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By yourself you may be able to accomplish a great deal, but what you do will not be very profitable for the building of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some may carry on a great Christian work, but it is not of much benefit to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The work in the Lord s recovery is not an ordinary Christian work; it is the work of building the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we would be used of the Lord to build the Body, we must be willing to run a three-legged race; that is, we must be willing to be bound to another to form one unit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Regarding this, there are many lessons to be learned, especially by those who are capable.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is very difficult for a capable person to be bound to another.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The situation in today s Christianity proves this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every gifted preacher or minister is individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such people may have employees those whom they hire and fire, but they do not have any matching co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A hired one is very different from a matching one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moses did not hire Aaron, and Paul did not hire Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nevertheless, most of the well-known Christian workers today are individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If they need others to help them, they hire them, but they do not accept them as a match.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever is done by such Christian workers is not of much profit for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Lord s recovery there is an urgent need for the true work of building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This building work, however, can be carried out only by co-workers who have been matched.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all need to be matched, not just with one other person, but with several others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is by means of such matching that God s commission is carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>C. Aaron Becoming Moses Spokesman</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>and Moses Becoming God to Aaron</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many think that if they are matched with others, they will lose their position.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason, they do not want others to do the same work they are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But look again at the case of Moses and Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Aaron did not cause Moses to lose his position.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nothing Aaron did could replace Moses in his position as God s called one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 4:16 God said to Moses concerning Aaron, And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This verse indicates that there was no need for Moses to be concerned about being replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The same is true with God s called ones today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Your standing as a called one is of the Lord, and no one can take it from you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the record, Aaron might have been more capable than Moses in the matter of speaking; Aaron might have been more eloquent than Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, Aaron was not to take this as an occasion to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He could only do a certain amount, for God did not give him so much as far as position was concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In fact, verse 16 says that Moses was to be as God to Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From the match of Moses and Aaron we all can learn the importance of knowing where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The place we occupy in a matching relationship depends entirely on the Lord s arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord called Moses and He prepared Aaron to match him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There was no place for human maneuvering.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everything was according to the divine economy, the divine arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have been involved in matching relationships for almost fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I have learned that such a relationship is not easy to bear over a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this, we need to receive grace from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now seems to be the right time for the release of this word concerning matching.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I hope that all those in the local churches will become clear about the need to be properly matched so that there may be among us permanent and constant matches.</S>
