   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE'S DAILY LIFE AFTER PASSING THROUGH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE GATE OF VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After we have passed through the gate of victory, we must continually abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Abiding is remaining, and abiding in Christ means that we remain in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To abide in Christ is to consider ourselves in Christ and not in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we consider ourselves in ourselves, we will only see ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We will overcome the first time when we look to Christ as our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thereafter we must continue to look to Christ as our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can only have the overcoming life when we are in Christ, and we can only continue to live an overcoming life when we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>HOW TO DEAL WITH SPIRITUAL PROBLEMS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the meetings, there are often people who speak improper words.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The workers should exhort these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The way to deal with spiritual problems is not to deal with the problems alone that is the way of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to deal with spiritual problems, one must first find out the cause.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, a brother who speaks improper words all the time may not be speaking those things consciously; his problem may be elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Chinese medicine does not deal only with the head when the head hurts; one must consider the body as a whole, because the cause of the illness may be elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some brothers have problems with their conduct because they are sick in their spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to change their conduct, they must first change their whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is useless to only change their conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, in helping others, we should not try to change their conduct; we should look for the sickness within them and help them to find out the root cause.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>CONCERNING FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Faith is a wonderful thing; it substantiates spiritual things and accomplishes God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Satan only works in the envi- ronment and can only attack God's Word from the outside; he cannot attack God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's Word demands our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, God's Word may say, "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household" Acts 16:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Satan will tell a person that this is not necessarily so.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some brothers face hardships and oppositions at home.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way to deal with them is not by enduring the unbelief of the family members.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Of course, I do not mean that one should allow his family to go on worshipping idols.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The way to deal with them is to stand firmly on the promise of God and declare to Satan that one's household shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, if one does not have the faith, he will be afraid, change God's Word, and say that His promises are not effectual.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Satan will then sing and rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This shows us that we fail only when we do not stand on God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Satan is most afraid of us holding on to God's Word and dealing with him according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, we have to stand on God's Word with firm faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even if the environment changes, we will not change.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do this, Satan can do nothing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He can stir up adverse environments, but we believe that God's Word is true and unchanging.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can say to Satan, "Do all you can.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let us see what God's Word will do."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first thing Satan does in deceiving us is to produce an environment that is opposite to God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The second thing he will do is to tell us that God's promise is not real.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He will base his words on the environment he has created.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once I was sick.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I prayed and God promised that He would heal me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I had the faith for the healing, but after three weeks, the sickness became worse.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then Satan came and tempted me, saying, "What good is your faith?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Your illness is still here."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I prayed again, God rebuked me, saying, "Why are you still praying?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have told you that I will heal you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why do you still have to pray?"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I immediately began to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I said, "God, I cannot sleep, and I feel much pain.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Satan is troubling me all over.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet I praise You because Your Word is true.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I do not care if I suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only Your Word counts; only it is trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The environment is just Satan's performance.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You alone are faithful and trustworthy."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I began to sing Hymn #778 on my bed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>That was the best singing I ever experienced in my life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The words in stanza two were particularly precious: "For God delights when faith can praise /Though dark the night and long."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Later the Lord did heal me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Satan's work produces only one result doubting God's Word, that is, making men wonder whether or not it is true.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Outward conditions are not real.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you listen to Satan and look at the adverse environment, you will think that God's Word is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But if you stand on God's Word by faith, you will not fear.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Faith does not require any proof or evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When a person has good credit in business, he does not need a guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only those who do not have good credit need a guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Satan does not have good credit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is why he asks for a guarantee for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He has to furnish facts to guarantee everything he says.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The facts he furnishes are often the environments he creates.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is not the way our God works.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Our God has very good credit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He does not need any fact, and He does not need any guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>His Word alone counts.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What can guarantee the words of the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Bible only uses a few words to tell us the facts about God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and ascension, etc. The Bible does not need any guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Today we can commit our spirit, soul, and body to God because we have the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We can give up all things for the Lord because we have the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Bible produces faith in us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Those whose eyes are set on the environment will not change any fact.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But those who praise by faith will see fruitful results.</S>
