   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 The Definition of Calling On the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Firstly, we need to learn the meaning of calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some Christians think that calling on the Lord is the same as praying to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Formerly, I held the same concept.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One day, however, the Lord showed me that calling on His name is different from merely praying.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yes, calling is a type of prayer, for it is a part of our prayer, but calling is not merely praying.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Hebrew word for call means to "call out to," "to cry unto," that is, to cry out.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Greek word for call means "to invoke a person," "to call a person by name."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, it is to call a person by naming him audibly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although prayer may be silent, calling must be audible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To call on the Lord also means to cry to Him and to experience spiritual breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"I called upon thy name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry" Lam 3:55-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These verses indicate that calling is also crying and breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Crying is the best breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have been told that crying is the best exercise for little babies.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever you cry out, you breathe spontaneously and deeply.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By crying and breathing we both exhale and inhale.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Inhaling always follows exhaling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By exhaling we breathe out all the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever you breathe out the negative things, the positive things of the Lord will fill you up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let me take the example of losing your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When you are about to lose your temper, do not try to suppress it, but call, "O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then add a short prayer, "Lord Jesus, I am going to lose my temper."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do this and see whether you still lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By calling on the name of the Lord you will breathe out your temper and you will breathe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You will exhale your temper and inhale the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you want to be holy?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The way to be holy is to call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By calling on His name all the sinful, evil, and unclean things will be breathed out, and all the positive things the riches of the Lord will be breathed into you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A. B. Simpson wrote a hymn on breathing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us read some of the stanzas:</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>O Lord, breathe Thy Spirit on me,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Teach me how to breathe Thee in;</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Help me pour into Thy bosom</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All my life of self and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am breathing out my sorrow,</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Breathing out my sin;</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am breathing, breathing, breathing,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All Thy fulness in.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Breathing out my sinful nature,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thou hast borne it all for me;</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Breathing in Thy cleansing fulness,</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Finding all my life in Thee.</S>
