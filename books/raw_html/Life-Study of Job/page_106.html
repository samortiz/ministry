<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JOB</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE COMPLETED DIVINE REVELATION<br>IN THE ENTIRE SCRIPTURES<br>CONCERNING GOD'S RELATIONSHIP WITH MAN</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; Matt. 1:23; 2 Cor. 3:18; 4:16-17; Rom. 8:29-30; Col. 1:12, 14-19; 2:9; 3:4a, 10-11</H1><P>God's answer to the book of Job is the completed divine revelation in the entire Scriptures concerning God's relationship with man. In a previous message we saw this relationship in the Old Testament. Now we will cover this matter in the New Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. FROM THE FIRST COMING OF CHRIST<br>TO THE MANIFESTATION<br>OF THE NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH</H2><P>God's relationship with man in the New Testament begins with the first coming of Christ and consummates with the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. God Coming<br>to Be Conceived in a Human Virgin<br>and to Be Born of Her<br>to Be a Man</H2><P>The New Testament reveals that God came to be conceived in a human virgin to be born of her to be a man, thus bringing divinity into humanity and causing God and man to be mingled as one entity but not as a third substance (John 1:1, 14; Matt. 1:20, 23; 1 Tim. 3:16). This is the first step God took in order to give Himself to Job by the way of dispensing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jesus Christ,<br>as the Incarnated God<br>and as the Embodiment of the Triune God,<br>Dying in His Humanity<br>a Vicarious and All-inclusive Death</H2><P>Jesus Christ, as the incarnated God and as the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9), died in His humanity a vicarious and all-inclusive death to terminate all the negative things and to release the divine life from within Him for us.</P>
