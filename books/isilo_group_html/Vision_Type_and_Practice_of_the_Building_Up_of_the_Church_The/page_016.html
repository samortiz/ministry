<p>Some serving ones struggle to drop the self but to no avail. The easiest way to leave the self is to be built up. When we are built up, we are out of the self. Those who struggle individually to get out of the self will remain in the self. Individualism is the strongest expression of the self. It is impossible to get out of the self when we are in the self. However, if we are willing to be joined together with other saints, we will immediately be freed from the self. The easiest way to be freed from the self is to be joined together with the saints.</p>
<p>We have said repeatedly that in order to be built up, we must be broken. The reverse is also true: as soon as we are built up, we will be broken. Those who are built up and joined with others have no choice but to be broken. If we aspire to spirituality, we will become spiritual as soon as we are built up and joined with others. This is very simple. Some desire to know how to pray. If the believers who desire to know how to pray would be willing to be joined with others and pray together, they would spontaneously know how to pray.</p>
<p>Perhaps a brother envies the spiritual merits and strengths of other Christians. As soon as he is put in the building, joined and knit together with the saints, he will experience these merits and strengths. Some serving ones read the Bible every day but do not receive any light. If they would be willing to be joined together with others and read the Bible together with other saints, they would receive light. The serving ones who are willing to be fitly joined with other saints will be empowered. Some think that they do not know how to visit people, but if they would be willing to join themselves to other saints in the visitation, they would immediately experience the blessing in visitation. As long as we are willing to put ourselves in the Body and be joined to other saints, there is no need to talk about being broken, for we will surely be broken. We will also be freed from the self. All our problems and difficulties can be resolved in the Body of Christ. As long as we stand as individuals, our problems and difficulties will remain. When we are placed in the Body, our problems disappear. It is a powerful experience to be placed in the Body, to be placed among the saints, that is, to be fitly joined together with others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING JOINED AND BEING INDIVIDUALISTIC</h2>
<p>God cannot build His house and build up the Body of Christ through individualism. God desires that we be joined together with others so that the individualistic element in our nature would be broken. Some saints pray well at home, but they never pray in the meetings. This is the result of an individualistic element in their nature. We may not want the saints to know our spiritual problems or needs, but our problems should be brought up in the Body and made known to others. If we learn the lesson of allowing others to pray concerning our weaknesses, we will no longer be weak. It is useless to fast and pray if we are afraid to let others know our problems. We merely need to place our weaknesses before the saints and allow the Body to deal with our weaknesses. Then our problems will vanish even without our praying. It is regrettable that we still like to hide our problems and yet resolve to pursue spirituality, to be overcoming, to be enlightened, and to be empowered. On our side, our thoughts are related only to our desires, but God does not give us what we desire, because His grace is given to the Body, not to those who are individualistic.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BLESSING OF GOD</h2>
<p>If we are built up together, God&rsquo;s blessing will be manifested among us. When we put ourselves in the Body by being joined with the saints and being members individually one of another, we will be spiritual and full of light. We can receive and enjoy all the riches of God and of Christ only in the Body.</p>
<p>Haggai 1:6 speaks of the children of Israel sowing much but bringing in little because they were concerned only about themselves; they were not concerned about the house of God. This means that they labored much but reaped little. Let us consider our situation. We must admit that even though we have many meetings every week, have a heart for the Lord, and pray, we bring in very little because we have neglected the building up of God&rsquo;s house. Most Christians pursue personal spirituality, personal power, and personal enlightenment, but they neglect the building up of God&rsquo;s house. We need to be delivered. We are not asking for personal spirituality, personal power, or personal enlightenment. We want God&rsquo;s house to be built up. We do not want to be isolated members, individual Christians. We should serve together with the saints no matter where we are placed and should commit ourselves to them. We should be joined together with all the saints as well as with the elders and the responsible ones in the church. If we are willing to be built up in such a way, we will be the first to be blessed, and we will also become a channel of blessing through which many blessings will be brought into the church.</p>
<p>May God open our eyes to see that He is not focused on our being spiritual, powerful, or enlightened but on whether we are being built up as the house of God. Hence, we should seek nothing other than the building up of His house. When we are willing to allow His house to be built up in us, we will experience genuine spirituality, power, and enlightenment. We will also touch the presence of God in the church.</p>
<p>We must remember that the manifestation of our function depends on whether we are fitly joined with other saints. If we are joined together with all the members of the Body, we will spontaneously manifest our function. We may not know what our function is, but when we are fitly joined together with the other members, we will have a function, and the blessing of God will be with us. The way to manifest our function is to put ourselves in the Body and be fitly joined with the other members. We must never be individualistic or pursue personal spirituality. May we be built up together in the house of God, fitly joined and firmly knit with one another, so that we would spontaneously manifest our function.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Type, and Practice of the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
