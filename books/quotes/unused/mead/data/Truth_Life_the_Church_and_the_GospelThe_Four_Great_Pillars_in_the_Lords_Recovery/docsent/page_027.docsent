   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PROMOTING THE LEARNING OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not only should the full-timers learn these three things, but every saint should also learn them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, you all have to learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This requires that you pay the price and make an effort to study carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One time I asked the elders what the meaning of Jesus is and what the meaning of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was as if they were all inexperienced, for none of them could give me a clear answer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since we all have been serving in the church for years, we should not have some who are still inexperienced.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose you teach a group of students English, but at the end some of them have not learned anything, and others have learned only half of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Would you continue to teach them?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Most of the churches in the Lord s recovery are currently in this kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The majority of the saints have learned only half of the truth, so ultimately no one has learned the truth in a complete way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, there is no way to build up the service and no way for the Lord to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now that all the life-studies of the New Testament have been published, I hope that all the churches would take this set of books as the basis for their study and greatly promote the learning of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In every church we have to help all the saints to study the Recovery Version of the New Testament, especially the footnotes, in a careful and thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This will truly be a great task.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the past we felt that we had nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, this was because we did not do anything and did not want to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even when we truly wanted to do something, we could not find the way to do it, so we lost interest in doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, now the way has been clearly presented to us, and everything depends on whether or not we are willing to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are willing to pay the price, I believe that in three to five years the whole church will make great progress in learning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>PROMOTING THE SPREAD OF THE GOSPEL WORK</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second, we have to encourage all the saints to preach the gospel from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This will be very effective.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the full-timers should receive the burden to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you go to the saints concerning this matter, do not go to the brothers first, because most of them will say that they do not have the time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You should contact the sisters, who are more likely to receive the burden because their hearts are softer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is the same with the matter of the small groups you have to work on the sisters first.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once they are set on fire, it will spread to the brothers, and eventually every home will be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should also have a good campus work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There should be some who preach the gospel to the college students in every college.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a crucial work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, we must also do the children s work in a serious way because the children are the future of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You may want to consider preaching the gospel to the children first.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then, aside from gaining the children of the saints, you must also gain some from the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This work is very worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If these five items promoting the learning of the truth, preaching the gospel from house to house, shepherding in the group meetings, doing the campus work, and doing the children s work are properly established, the church life will be living and healthy and will surely increase and multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>PURSUING THE TRUTH TO BRING IN THE REVIVAL</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to serve, we all must be equipped with the truth, and in particular, we all must be familiar with the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All of you who have the heart to serve full-time must get yourselves fully equipped by studying the life-study messages thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Otherwise, when you go to establish the work, shepherd people, and speak to people, you will have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this matter the co-workers should take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not force the saints to read the life-studies, but every co-worker should read the life-study messages in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In America all the doctors and nurses in the hospitals have to take examinations every year.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Taiwan some organizations also require their employees to take annual examinations.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have never held any examinations for the co-workers, so no one really knows whether they are qualified in the matter of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It seems that once a person becomes a co-worker, he obtains a very secure job, and no one can dismiss him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some co-workers even think that as full-time serving ones they are special people and that everyone has to listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is inappropriate and wrong to think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From now on we will not allow this kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whoever wants to be a co-worker or to continue to be a co-worker must pass through an examination once a year.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many Christians acknowledge that the churches in the Lord s recovery know the truth the most.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, we have to ask ourselves how many of us are really like this?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Actually, the majority of the saints do not know the truth that much.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, I hope that the Lord will be gracious to us by stirring up the churches all over the world to rise up and pursue the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I believe that if we endeavor for three to five years, the saints will be revived by studying the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This will bring in a big revival on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I hope that we can stir up this kind of a pursuing atmosphere in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>From now on, there should not be any more idle talk in the saints homes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even when they converse, they should also study the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, when you go to a saint s home, you should not just greet him and ask, How are you?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Instead, you should ask him, What does the genealogy in Matthew 1 talk about?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You may also go further and ask him, Do you know that there are three important names in the genealogy in Matthew 1?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They are Abraham, David, and Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These are three crucial persons who brought in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When you meet a saint on the street, instead of talking to him about other things you should ask him, Which verse in the Gospel of John says that the Lord is edible?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>How did the Lord say that He was edible?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Why did the Lord say that He was edible?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Thus, in a conversation of just two minutes both of you will be reminded, supplied, and mutually nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have to change the atmosphere and encourage the brothers and sisters to read the life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Even when we are facing matters related to national affairs, such as an election, we still should not talk about them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Let those who belong to Caesar be occupied with Caesar s business.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As those who belong to God, we ought to be occupied with God s business Luke 20:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>One time I was given hospitality at a couple s home.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They were Chinese who lived outside of China and had never studied in a Chinese school, but they spoke very good Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The hostess told me that because she had been meeting and listening to messages in the Lord s recovery for a long time, she had learned Chinese very well.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When I listened to her fellowship, however, I realized that she did not know the truth very much.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Eventually, I found an opportunity to tell her, I am really grateful that you gave me hospitality and had three or four suits made for me, but I am very concerned about your spiritual situation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I hope that the next time I come we can talk about the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We all should do this to stimulate the lambs in our small group.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Do not be afraid of offending others.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We may offend someone today and tomorrow, but he will be grateful toward us the day after tomorrow.</S>
