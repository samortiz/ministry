   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Greetings to my beloved brother in the Lord, Kwang-hsi:</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thank the Lord for leading you safely to Yunnan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although you tasted much suffering and many difficulties, the Lord will not forget you, and your trip will not be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have been in Singapore for three or four weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am ashamed to say that I am so mediocre that I cannot do much.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The brothers and sisters in Singapore really hope that you and Brother Kaung can come and work here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The work on the southern islands has a great and desperate need.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After meeting in this hall for two weeks, we have concluded nine evenings of meetings in the True Light Chapel of the Anglican denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Starting next Monday we will have four evenings of preaching on the rooftop to the Evangelistic Crusade.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Greet Brother Chung Huang, Brother Kwang-tsao, the Chou brothers, and Sister Hwei-sian.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May the Lord use you all very much!</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Faithful Luk</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>January 10</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Lan Tsi-yi and the Orphanage</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thank the Lord, my meeting with Mr. Lee with regard to the orphanage was satisfactory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has promised to make up for the shortage in the budget, but he can only support us for one year.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He has also agreed to move the orphanage, but he gave me the freedom to decide where we will move.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have been constantly praying for this matter, and I have clearly seen several things concerning this matter: 1 In order to answer to God and man, I cannot shrink back from my responsibility concerning the education of these children.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>2 I cannot return to my old hired position in the orphanage.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If I do, it will be completely against the leading I received when I quit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, I have decided to stand on God's side in receiving man's commission.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The most marvelous thing is that Mr. Lee and Brother Yu's attitudes toward the commission are similar to mine.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They say that they will do their best to supply the money needed to meet the financial needs.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They will not interfere with the administration.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the one hand, I feel a great responsibility and cannot avoid being in fear and trembling; on the other hand, I am forced to take this way, so I must look to the Lord for the way ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May the Lord prove His faithful Word and precious promises 2 Cor 12:9 in a weak and useless person like me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>My problem now is the matter of moving.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the long run it seems better to move to a safer region, but in order to be close to the care of the brothers and sisters and in the center of the region of my personal work, it seems that I should not move from Wu-ch'ang.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In my prayer I feel that it is best to settle ourselves in Wu-ch'ang.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The other things that must be taken care of immediately include: 1 finding jobs for the older students, 2 hiring able brothers and sisters to be responsible for administrating and teaching, and 3 finding one or two productive means for income.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Please pray for the future of this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Your weak member in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Lan Tsi-yi</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>February 24, Hankow</S>
