The Bible contains sixty-six books written by more than forty people during the course of more than one thousand six hundred years
Those who desire to know the Bible should have a clear understanding of all ten lines, which are a golden key to open the Word
With such a key we will be able to more easily enter into the depths of the Bible in order to touch its real essence
All the words in the Bible are full of the revelation of God; therefore, we will first look at the line of the Triune God in the Bible
In the Old Testament, there are at least three different Hebrew words for God-Elohim, El, and Eloah, each with a distinct meaning
Also in Genesis 322 when Adam ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil God said The man has become like one of Us
In Genesis 117 when the children of men were building the tower of Babel God again said Let Us go down and there confound their language
4) In Matthew 28:19, the Lord said, 'Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
5) In John 17:11 and 22, the Lord said that the Father and the Son are one, which is to say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one
6) Although God is three in person, 1 Timothy 2:5, 1 Corinthians 8:4 and 6, and Romans 3:30 all say that God is uniquely one
7) According to the record in Numbers 6:24-26, God told the priests to bless the children of Israel with three requests
The first request would be carried out by God the Father, the second request by God the Son, and the third request by God the Spirit
The first request is carried out by God the Father, the second request by God the Son, and the third request by God the Spirit
The first part El means one who is strong and powerful, and the second part ohim means to bind oneself with an oath
It is first used in Genesis 1:1, showing that the God who created the heavens and the earth is triune and that He is mighty and faithful
The emphasis on might relates to creation, whereas the emphasis on faithfulness relates to preservation and maintenance
Shaddai means 'breast' or 'udder'; El Shaddai denotes that God is the mighty One with an udder, the all-sufficient mighty One
In Hebrew this name is composed of three words: Je represents a word, ho represents a word, and vah also represents a word
Jehovah means that God is present, was present, and will be present forever, and also that He is, was, and will be forever
In the book of Psalms, it is combined with hallelu to form the frequently used word hallelujah, meaning 'praise Jehovah'
On the one hand, we are His slaves and He is our Master; on the other hand, we are His wife, and He is our Husband
In Genesis 32:24-30, the man who wrestled with Jacob at the ford of the Jabbok was also God embodied in Christ
In the Old Testament the Spirit of God is a person, and He is referred to as both the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah
The title the Spirit of God is found in Genesis 1:2; 6:3; Exodus 31:3; 35:31; Numbers 24:2; Job 26:13; 33:4; Isaiah 4:4; Joel 2:28-29
John 3:1 says, 'Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God'
There are instances in the New Testament where the Greek word pater and the Aramaic word abba are used together
Peter 2:1 and Jude 4 both refer to the Lord Jesus as the Master of the universe who has authority over everything
Although Jesus is a name that refers to Him as a man, this man is Jehovah coming to be our Savior and becoming our salvation
In the New Testament, as Luke 4:18 says, God anointed the Lord Jesus when He came to the earth, so the Lord Jesus was also an anointed One
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
Among these attributes, there are five basic attributes; if we can remember these five, the rest can easily be remembered
The primary attributes of God are the sources, whereas the other attributes are derived from these five sources
As we mention each attribute, we can give only a few references; we do not have the time to explain their meaning
When He is hidden, arrogant men will certainly take the opportunity to speak arrogant words and godly men will undergo severe trials
The meaning of the original Greek word does not refer merely to a will; it refers more to a plan, a purpose, according to a will
If we want to run a big business or open a large factory, we cannot call this an arrangement; instead we should call it an economy
The goal of God's eternal plan is to build a dwelling place for Himself and to build the Body of Christ His Son
In other words, it is to choose a bride for His Son and to gain a corporate vessel for Himself as His full expression
In eternity, while carrying out His economy according to His plan, God chose us according to His foreknowledge and sealed and designated us
The record in Genesis 1:1, which says, 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,' refers to God's original creation
At one point, this anointed archangel, due to his pride, rebelled against God and became Satan, God's adversary
The original universe under his rule became corrupted and was brought under God's judgment with water covering the surface of the deep
The original creation was submerged under water; it was waste and emptiness, with darkness on the surface of the deep
He ordered the heavenly luminaries to give light and then He ordered the water on the earth to gather together so that dry land would appear
Rebellion occurred not only in God's original creation, which came under God's judgment; it took place also in God's restoration
To believe into the Lord Jesus means to be identified with the Lord Jesus; without identification there is no substitution
In the same way, a sacrifice could be slaughtered in place of Adam because Adam was identified with the sacrifice
When the Israelites observed the passover, they hid within houses that were sprinkled with blood and consumed the meat of the lamb
2 Corinthians 5:21 says, 'Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him'
After God called and promised man salvation, He was still concerned that man might not know the Savior or the way of salvation
He established numerous types, like a kindergarten education, conveying thoughts through pictures and describing them in numerous ways
God gave the law at Mount Sinai so that through the law man's corruption and impotence would be manifested and proven
In this way man would be subdued, knowing that he could not do good, and thereby, would draw near to the way of salvation
In the books of prophecy and the Psalms, God promises the Redeemer and the redemption through prophecies in plain words
The churches should be fully redeemed; yet there are some unredeemable elements that have been brought into the churches
At the very beginning of Revelation the redeeming Lord comes as the judging Lord to judge all of His redeemed churches
The first three chapters are on the judgment of the church, and chapters 4 through 20 are on the judgment of the world
Romans 11920 Psalm 1913 Acts 141517 and 172627 all show us that God has proven Himself through the heaven and the earth which He created
God has proven Himself by creating the heavens and the earth, and God has spoken concerning Himself in the Holy Scriptures
After God passed through death and resurrection, He ascended and descended in the Spirit and is able to enter into man
When we read through the names of God, the attributes of God, and the works of God, the Bible will become clear and transparent to us
When God regenerated us, the Lord Jesus came first as the Word of God, then as the light of life, and as a result we received life inwardly
Verse 27 says, 'God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them'
Adam sinned and, being conscious of his own shame, he sewed leaves together to make loincloths to cover his body
In the fellowship between man and God, Christ, as the gift man offers to God, becomes the food that God enjoys
The firstlings of the flock and the fat portions typify the Lord Jesus as the means by which we fellowship with God
He is our gift to God for our acceptance before Him, and He is the food that God receives from us for His satisfaction
In the book of Genesis, almost everything concerning Isaac can be applied to Christ because Isaac typifies Christ
In the covenant of grace which God made with man, the Lord Jesus is God's unique Heir, God's unique seed, who received the inheritance
The Lord Jesus was killed as a calf, and all that He is and all that He accomplished became a cake that man could offer to God
Later, in Exodus and Numbers, God charged His people to present offerings involving animal sacrifices and meal offerings
God wants to carry out His covenant of grace to the point that we can fellowship with Him and He can fellowship with us
In all of God's fellowship with us and our fellowship with God, everything that is being enjoyed is the Lord Jesus
In Genesis 22, when Abraham offered up Isaac, God showed Abraham a ram that had not been brought by him but had been prepared by God
Without this Lamb, the covenant of grace that God made with us would be without a center and could not be fulfilled
Genesis 49:10 tells us that as the Peace-bringer, Christ is called Shiloh, and to Him will be the obedience of the peoples
When God's people fell into Egypt, they needed a salvation, and for this salvation, they needed a mighty deliverer
The Lord Jesus became the Passover lamb to deliver us from God's judgment so that God's judgment might pass over us
Just as the blood of the lamb typifies the death of the Lord Jesus, the Red Sea also typifies the death of the Lord Jesus
They were delivered from the judgment of God the usurpation of the world and the bondage of Satan and they also had an inward supply of life
After God's people were saved, they journeyed forward, yet no part of their journey was without hardship; everything was a trial
The Lord Jesus who died on a wooden cross, on a tree, is able to turn our bitter water and bitter situations sweet, like at Marah
The Lord Jesus is also our spiritual Rock in our journey, constantly flowing out as living water to supply us and quench our thirst
The service of the children of Israel before God mainly involved the tabernacle, the offerings, and a group of priests
The Lord Jesus is our tabernacle; He is the place where we can appear before God and where God can meet with us
On the one hand, these offerings are the gifts we offer to God; on the other hand, they are the food accepted by God
As Joshua, Christ causes God's people to receive the inheritance; as Boaz, Christ causes the lost inheritance of God's people to be redeemed
God's people were delivered from Egypt, journeyed through the wilderness, won the victory, entered Canaan, and received the inheritance
Now we need to point out that in this kingdom there were many godly, spiritual men who lived in the presence of God
Micah 5 reveals that Christ's coming forth is from eternity; Christ is the One from ancient times, from the days of eternity
Isaiah 9:6 says that the One born in Bethlehem of a virgin is a Son and also the eternal Father; He is a child and also the mighty God
Zechariah describes how He was pierced on the cross by His people to become the fountain that washes away sins
From the first chapter of Genesis to the last chapter of Malachi, the entire Old Testament is linked together by the Lord Jesus
The four Gospels, which constitute the first section of the New Testament, show us the Lord Jesus in the flesh
The Lord Jesus is the One established by God as the Lord, and He is appointed by God as the One who judges the living and the dead
God not only wants Him to be the Savior Lord and the Lord of all, God also wants Him to be the Lord of judgment
Later, we see the Lord Jesus coming to judge the world; both the Jews and the Gentiles will be under His judgment
In this kingdom our Lord Jesus will be the Leader and the King; moreover, He will be everything in the kingdom
In eternity, in the new heaven and the new earth, Christ will be the Lamb on the throne, and God will be in Him
Christ will be the central character in the New Jerusalem, and the living city of the New Jerusalem will be His expression
If we read through all nineteen ins we will have a thorough understanding of both the Old Testament and the New Testament
In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, all of the offices of man before God are included in these three categories
From Genesis to Revelation, those who are anointed and used by God always serve within the sphere of these three categories
On the one hand, the service of the priests is to bring man to God, and on the other hand, it is to bring God to man
Kingship emphasizes reigning for God, bringing God's authority to man so that man may submit to God's authority
The service of the priests is mainly to bring man to God, and the service of the prophets is mainly to bring God to man
In both the Old Testament and New Testament, these three offices typify the work carried out by the Lord Jesus between God and man
From Melchizedek to Aaron and his sons, priests were the spiritual leaders who had authority among the children of Israel
Melchizedek typifies the Lord Jesus being a Priest in His divinity, that is, the Son of God with the nature of God
The Lord Jesus is a Priest with two natures, having humanity to know the things of man and having the divinity of the eternal God
Some say that David typifies the Lord Jesus in His first coming, while Solomon typifies the Lord Jesus in His second coming
There are also two representative figures in the books of prophecy, typifying the prophethood of the Lord Jesus
Elisha somewhat typifies the Lord Jesus because he was preceded by Elijah, just as the Lord Jesus was preceded by John the Baptist
He told man to repent so that he might escape God's judgment, and He also told man to believe so that he might receive God's salvation
According to the sequence of the books in the Bible, Isaiah is before Jonah; but according to chronology, Jonah is before Isaiah
Only when we have read through the entire Old Testament will we understand all that is portrayed by these six representative characters
When the Lord was on the earth, He preached God's judgment in a complete way and spoke God's salvation in a full way
The Lord Jesus preached the words of Jonah on the earth on the negative side and the words of Isaiah on the positive side
As the Priest of God, He brought the sacrifice that God delights in the most to the cross and offered it to God
The above three points show that the offices of the Lord Jesus in the New Testament are also the priesthood, kingship, and prophethood
When we open the Bible and read at the very beginning in the book of Genesis, we see a very striking item-the tree of life
The more we read the record of God's creation in Genesis 1 and 2, the more we should realize that the center of God's creation is life
Genesis 12 describes the earth prior to Gods further creation as being waste and emptiness and darkness was on the surface of the deep
The bringing forth of different kinds of life involved a definite sequence, and all of these kinds of life have symbolic meanings
A leaf of grass, a tree, or a flower contains life, but this life is without consciousness; it can neither think nor feel
The appearance of these stronger lights was not for producing life but for strengthening life so that life could grow
Their life is higher than the life of the living creatures in the water, but the consciousness of this life is still relatively low
Among all the creatures, man has the highest life with the highest consciousness, a consciousness that is higher than all other creatures
With regard to the living creatures He began by creating the lowest living creatures going up level by level to the highest living creatures
In His creation God did not put Himself into man; the created man did not have the uncreated life of God within him
He also warned man that if he ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he would surely die
God placed these two trees in front of man because He wanted man to receive Him as life He did not want man to touch Satan and receive death
Genesis 3 shows us that man was deceived by Satan and partook of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and thus fell into death
They learned to live in the principle of the tree of life, which was to turn away from sin and to live before God
They renounced evil and desired to draw near to God by doing good, supposing that evil was enmity with God but that good was not
The book of Job begins with a man who feared God and turned away from evil, who was blameless, perfect, and upright
They thought that since God could do no wrong and would never be unjust, then surely those who had been struck by God must be at fault
These questions had nothing to do with evil or good, and they could be answered only when God Himself was the answer
When they uttered something about their goodness and merit, the Holy Spirit took the opportunity to speak forth Christ
Song of Songs is altogether about a girl pursuing her beloved and taking her beloved as the object and the center
The books of poetry show us that there was a group of saints who were willing to live in good and focus on good
The prophecies spoken by the prophets in the Spirit all emphasize the coming One who is man's salvation and man's way before God
In the New Testament, the One prophesied by the prophets came; He was God manifested in the flesh so that man might receive Him as life
Many saints have tried to tell us what God is doing in the universe, yet their explanations never hit the mark
In the recent years we have gradually come to see very clearly based on the Word of God that Gods desire is to gain a citythe New Jerusalem
Isaiah 66:1 clearly says that even though heaven was His throne and the earth was His footstool, He did not have a resting place
God wants to gain a dwelling place in the universe; second, God is building this dwelling place with Himself as life
In order for man to be built with Him, He must enter into man and mingle with man to become man's inward element
God's building work is being carried out in whomever has God's life; God's building is accomplished through Him as life
Some of Noah's descendants still followed and cooperated with Satan; so Satan's second city appeared-the city of Babel
Beginning with Genesis 11, the Bible repeatedly shows us two cities-the city of Babel and the city of Jerusalem
Babel is the city of Satan a building related to the union of man and the devil Jerusalem is a building related to the union of man and God
After the judgment of Babel, God called Abraham out of this place of man's rebellion, out from among the rebellious people
God called him out of Babel, telling him to leave his land, his relatives, and his father's house and to go the land of Canaan
The portion of land was the base for the building work, and the group of descendants were the materials for the building work
God's intention was to build the seed of Abraham, the children of Israel, into God's dwelling place in the land of Canaan
Previously we were clay, but once we receive the Lord and His life, we are changed in nature to become a stone
Later, in his Epistle Peter says that the believers are living stones who are being built up as a spiritual house
The Holy Spirit is the manifestation of God, the transfiguration of God, and God's reaching of man and entering into man
Later, due to the matter of eating, he went down to Egypt with his sons, altogether forgetting God's revelation
While in Egypt, his descendants cared only for the matter of eating and ended up falling under Satan's usurpation
God promised seed to Abraham as building materials; but due to the matter of eating, this seed went down to Egypt and was usurped by Satan
While the children of Israel were in Egypt, the Bible specifically says that Pharaoh ordered them to build two cities
The city of God is built with gold and precious stones, but the cities of Egypt, like the city of Babel, were built with bricks of clay
According to the books of prophecy, when God's people were not firm in their standing, they either went to Babylon or went down to Egypt
These cities were clayish and earthly, and they were for man; they were not heavenly, and they were not for God
After God delivered the children of Israel, His desire was fulfilled to a certain extent-the children of Israel erected a tabernacle for God
Even though the tabernacle was only temporary and physical, God filled it with His glory, taking it as His dwelling place after its erection
After the children of Israel came to the foot of Mount Sinai and became a corporate entity in the eyes of God they were His spiritual house
During Eli's time, his two sons, who were priests, were very corrupt; they represented the corruptness of all the children of Israel
Consequently, the tabernacle and the Ark were both devastated; the Ark was captured and the tabernacle became desolate
Before Samuel there were priests and judges, and since Samuel was both a priest and a judge, he was an heir of the preceding age
He was truly a pivotal figure who gained the inheritance from the preceding age and ushered in the succeeding age
Once David was raised up, he had the desire to find a resting place for the Ark of God, so he wanted to build a temple for God
On the day of the completion of the building of the temple, the glory of God filled the temple in an unprecedented way
The descendants of Solomon were corrupt, and the house of Israel became desolate; as a result the Babylonians came
We need to remember that Abraham came out of Babylon, and after he came to the land of Canaan, his descendants built Jerusalem
Even the vessels in the temple for the worship of God were carried away to Babylon and placed in the temple of idols
The building work in the Old Testament was merely a figure; in the New Testament God actually comes to carry out His building work
We should not apply the Lord's raising up of the temple in three days just to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Himself
Today the so-called 'edification of the saints' among Christians actually means 'building up of the saints' in the original language
The ultimate teaching in the New Testament is not for individual spirituality but for our being built together
Individual spirituality certainly has its value, but without being built together, we cannot attain God's goal
The final scene, the last picture in the Bible, is a city, which is God's tabernacle, God's dwelling place on the earth among men
Just as the New Jerusalem is the expression of God among redeemed humanity, Babylon is the manifestation of Satan among fallen humanity
Satan was originally an archangel created by God, yet one day he became the center of death, because he utterly overthrew God's authority
Without God's authority, there cannot be anything of God's life; wherever God's authority is overthrown, death is manifested
These three lines-life, building, and the kingdom-are like a threefold cord to become the most important line in the Bible
If we read the Bible in a thorough way, we will discover that these three matters are the greatest delights to God's heart
From the words in Matthew 6:9-10 spoken by the Lord Jesus to the disciples concerning how to pray, we can see that the kingdom is God's goal
Whether or not God's name is sanctified and whether or not God's will is done on earth depends on whether God's kingdom has authority
At the end the Lord provided the reason for this kind of prayer, saying, 'For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory'
There must be the kingdom as a realm, and then there can be the exercise of authority and the expression of glory
Although God wanted man to have dominion over heaven, over the earth, and over the sea, the emphasis was on dominion over the earth
After following Satan, man fell because he violated God's commandment and thus was involved with God's authority
Through the slaughtering of an animal and the shedding of its blood, God redeemed man and put man back under His authority
Since man lost God's care and rejected God's way of redemption, man began to make a living on his own and invent a culture for himself
Self-justification is a matter of morality, self-dependence is a matter of existence, and self-invention is a matter of living and culture
Wherever there is self-justification, there is self-dependence, and where there is self-dependence, there is self-invention
The descendants of man were deceived by Satan again and utilized God's authority to establish many nations on the earth
Nimrod was ferocious and warlike; he was the first among the people to establish a kingdom and set himself up as a king
If the created man had not fallen, God's creation would have been sufficient; God's calling would not have been necessary
Once man became fallen and the entire human race followed Satan, God had to come and set apart a group of people
He was a man on the earth under the rule of heaven, a man on the earth as the outlet of heaven, one who was connected to heaven
Through the blood of the lamb, God delivered them out of Egypt with a mighty hand and led them to the foot of Mount Sinai
Initially, God found Saul and appointed him to be the king, but Saul reigned according to man's will, not according to God's heart
The nation of Israel was formed, God's authority was exercised among them, and God's glory was expressed among them as well
Babel was the place of man's collective rebellion; it was also the place out of which Abraham had been called by God and set apart
When the Lord came out to preach, the first sentence He spoke was, 'The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
From this we can see that the Lord's coming was to bring the kingdom of the heavens to the earth and to exercise God's authority among men
Colossians 1:13 also says that God delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love
Romans 14:17 says, 'The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
At this point, heaven and earth will be fully joined, without any distinction between reigning in the heavens and reigning on the earth
Now the Lord and the church, including all who belong to God throughout the ages, will rule and reign together forever and ever
When someone in the church allows God to reign, immediately the scene on the day of Pentecost appears-everyone speaks the same thing
In the New Jerusalem, everyone will be standing in his own place according to the proper order with the proper authority
It is quite extraordinary that other religious writings are not called a covenant; only the Christian Bible is called a covenant
A covenant is a set of words that are more than just ordinary words; they are formal words with a legal basis and which are bound by law
Ordinary words may be unreliable and questionable, but when they are turned into a contract or a covenant, they are more trustworthy
The Chinese word for contract or covenant also means 'binding'; in other words, a contract is something that binds people
Once we put our words into a contract, we are bound by the words, and we must fulfill the terms of the contract
God's desire toward man becomes a covenant because He swears by a solemn oath and explains His desire to man in very formal words
When two parties negotiate about a certain matter, they do not speak to one another in a common, casual, and light manner
Rather, they speak formally and solemnly in relation to their legal standing so that there is a legal basis and the binding of law
Since the Bible is a book of God's covenants with man, these covenants are a great and central line in the Bible
The Old Testament is so named because it contains a great covenant, which was a previous covenant that became old and has been abolished
Of these nine covenants, some are clearly pointed out in the Bible as covenants, but some are not pointed out so clearly
There are other instances where the covenants are not plainly identified, even though they are God's covenants with man in every aspect
God wanted man to have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over every living thing that moves upon the earth
In this way man could be God's authority on the earth, reigning for God and expressing God's glory in all these things
Since there was not a problem with sin in the beginning, man did not need a covering, an outward justification
His coming to be a man was connected with the first Adam, and in His coming He also assumed the position of the first man
The Bible shows us that the first covenant God made with man eventually was applied to the Lord Jesus and was completely fulfilled in Him
In the end the Lord Jesus has become the Head of creation to rule over the earth as God's authority for the expression of His glory
Adam was unrighteous toward God and fearful of Him so he turned from the presence of God and hid himself in a secret place afraid to see God
The words He spoke were guaranteed by God's faithfulness; therefore, they should be considered as the words of a covenant with man
Satan brought God's curse upon himself because of his deception of man, and so the sphere of his activity is limited to the earth
If the serpent spoken of here referred only to one serpent, God would not have spoken of 'the seed of the serpent'
Since God spoke of 'the seed of the serpent,' the serpent here refers not only to a serpent but also to Satan, symbolized by the serpent
At His birth, according to the flesh, He was the seed of the woman; spiritually, He is also the seed of the woman
Serpents are most vulnerable to a blow on the head; if one receives a blow on the head, it receives a fatal injury
It does not benefit human beings, who have a sinful nature, to be too comfortable; this causes them to fall deeper into sin
We need to see that this position is according to the order arranged by God between the male and the female after the fall of man
It said that even in France, a country that very much values equality, a married woman still has to take the last name of her husband
After all the analysis, it came to the conclusion that there would always be one who is first and one who is second
In creation Eve was second, but in committing sin Eve was first; therefore, God said that the woman would be ruled by the man
Today, all those who desire comfort, who desire to live an easy life, and who desire to have food without labor are against God's principle
From God's perspective, man should not be at ease because sinful mankind with his sinful nature must toil to be saved from many sins
When man sinned, he felt ashamed and sewed tree leaves together to make a loincloth to cover his body, but the loincloth could not cover him
He became the seed of the woman and the Lamb who was slain to deal with our enemy, Satan, and to solve our problem before God
Genesis 6:18-7:5 gives a record of the covenant God made with Noah when He was about to destroy mankind with a flood
Once they did this, God was able to preserve their lives and the lives of the living things that were with them when He flooded the earth
After Noah was saved through the ark, God made another covenant with him, which is recorded in Genesis 8:20-9:17
When it rains and a rainbow appears, we know that the sky will soon clear up because the sign of this covenant is the rainbow
God did not say that He would remove the curse from the ground but that He would not add to the curse on the ground
They would have been concerned that if they did something wrong they might provoke God into sending another flood
Eating vegetables means that man relies only on his own works; eating meat means that man relies on the shedding of blood for his redemption
In order to live before God, man must eat meat; there must be the killing of the animal and the shedding of its blood
Some Bible readers say that another age-the age of human government-began at this point because man had the authority to rule over others
Tenth, God ordained that Noah's three sons-Shem, Ham, and Japheth-would become the ancestors of the three races of humankind on the earth
Shem would become the people of central Asia; Abraham and the children of Israel were all descendants of Shem, the people of God
God was able to enact this covenant with the new human race because in His eyes He saw His Son Christ as the burnt offering
We are able to enjoy the blessings of God's creation and redemption because God has given us His Spirit so that we may have His life
Galatians 3 says that the blessing God gave to Abraham has come to us through the Lord Jesus by believing in Him
All those who are saved are Abraham's descendants through faith; they are as numerous as the stars of the heavens and are heavenly
All those who are Abraham's descendants in the flesh are his earthly descendants; they are as numerous as the sand on the seashore
The record of this covenant is quite long; it is found in Exodus 19 through Leviticus 27, Deuteronomy 5:1-4, and Hebrews 9:1-7
The covenants before Abraham were also included in the orthodox line because the covenants God made with man were in a continuous line
Every covenant made along this line has been necessary with the only exception being the covenant made at Mount Sinai
Beginning in Exodus 21, many statutes and ordinances concerning the details in the living of God's people are also included in the law
Galatians 3:10 says, 'Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all the things written in the book of the law to do them'
In this covenant there are also many ordinances, all of which are related to ritualistic matters, not to moral matters
From His birth all the way to His death, He lived His human life on the earth in matters both great and small fully according to the law
The curse of the law fell on the Lord Jesus because He bore our sins and stood in our place, not because He had any sin
In this covenant, in the aspect of the law, the Lord Jesus has fulfilled for us what we never could keep in ourselves
God said that they would be cursed if they disobeyed His law, forsook Him, and followed the customs of the nations, going after their idols
They would be cursed everywhere and in everything, and they would be overcome by their enemies and carried away to all the nations
After he was king, having conquered most of the enemies around the borders, David built a palace in which to dwell
He did not feel peaceful inwardly because even though he had settled down the Ark of God which is God Himself did not have a dwelling place
The kingdom is for God's reign, the temple is for God's presence, and the house is for the mingling of God and man
He is the One who is the mingling of God and man; He is Emmanuel brought forth through God's entering into man and becoming flesh
He brought in the kingdom of God and reigned for God; and He built the temple of God so that God could be with man and dwell with man
These points are clearly spoken of in the following Scriptures Micah 52 Isaiah 967 Jeremiah 2356 331516 Luke 13133 and Acts 22936
The ultimate, highest, greatest, and most beautiful covenant in the Bible is what we commonly refer to as the new covenant
In Matthew 26:27-28, when the Lord Jesus established His table, He said that it was a new covenant established in His blood
The Lord Jesus shed His blood for redemption on the cross, and in this blood He established a new covenant with God
The Lord Jesus established this new covenant in His own blood, and He also executes this covenant through His incorruptible life
The law of the old covenant was outward and in letter; it was engraved on tablets of stone and kept by man's strength
Consequently, anyone who has a part in this covenant, from the little one to the great one, has no need for anyone to teach him
Today, everyone who has been saved has the life of God, and this life within is a law with a natural capacity for us to know God
In the coming millennial kingdom God will call them out of all the nations again and at that time God will enact this new covenant with them
In the future the Israelites will all participate in the blessing of the new covenant; this is revealed in Jeremiah 31 and Romans 11:25-27
God also ordained that the woman with such a fallen and sinful nature would suffer pain in childbearing and that man would toil in labor
Man also needed to learn to accept the sufferings arranged by God for his salvation, keeping his place to live on the earth
God commanded them to enter into the ark and to bring some of the living things with them to preserve their lives
After the flood was over, Noah and his family came out of the ark and offered sacrifices to God on the new land
God made an extraordinarily great covenant with Abraham, which is called the covenant of promise or the covenant of grace
The kingdom and the blessings, through the seed of Abraham, will extend to all the nations so that all people will be blessed
They proudly said to God that they would listen to Him and keep His words, that is, that they would do all the words which God had spoken
When God spoke to them previously, He was like an eagle bearing its young and a loving mother talking to her child
Because they did not know themselves, the scene at Mount Sinai changed completely; thunder and lightning were present
Even before they broke the law, God prepared the ordinances pertaining to the tabernacle, the priests, and the offerings on Mount Sinai
Even though the children of Israel worshipped the golden calf, God allowed them to live on account of the offerings
Whereas the earlier covenant was altogether according to grace, the covenant that entered alongside was altogether according to law
According to Gods ordination He wants us to live under grace but because we do not know ourselves we foolishly put ourselves under the law
David was a godly man, a man of God, but he committed murder and took another man's wife, committing a great sin; he utterly broke the law
Even though the Israelites were under the law, they still lived in the promise of grace; they were still connected to grace
When these conditions are brought together and extended, the ultimate result will be the manifestation of the New Jerusalem
If the Lord Jesus had not died, none of the facts would have been accomplished; they would merely be promises in a covenant
The Lord Jesus fulfilled the testament, having accomplished all that was written down and then bequeathed them to us
God made a covenant with us concerning all these things, and every fact that the Lord Jesus accomplished is a portion for us to enjoy
According to the Bible, there are four dispensations; according to some Bible scholars, there are seven dispensations
The former emphasizes the content of the dispensations, and the latter emphasizes God's seven arrangements with regard to man
In the period of time from Moses to the first coming of Christ, the law was present in addition to sin and death
When the law was given, it confirmed the situation of man being under sin and death; this period is called the dispensation of the law
Now anyone who receives Him is immediately released from the law, from sin, and from death to enter into grace
In this dispensation, righteousness will reign as king; Christ will judge all the people of the earth with righteousness
Many Bible scholars point to seven dispensations, according to the unfolding of God's dispensational arrangements with man in the Bible
The seven dispensations emphasize God's seven different operations, arrangements, managements, and administrations in His dealings with man
In this dispensation, or in this arrangement of God, man lived directly before God and was directly ruled by God
In this dispensation man did not need to wear clothes because he did not have sin or even a consciousness of sin
At this point God did not need to tell man to eat meat by slaughtering animals and shedding their blood, because man had not yet sinned
According to the record in the Bible, the dispensation of conscience and the dispensation of innocence lasted 1,656 years
Since man could know good and evil, he had to be responsible to his own conscience and live before his own conscience
In this dispensation, man was under his own ruling, so this period of time can also be called the dispensation of self-government
At this point man fell to the uttermost, so God gave up on the descendants of Adam and called Abraham to be the beginning of a new race
We do not need the police to tell us that we should not steal; our conscience should tell us that we should not do such things
The path of the fall of Adam's descendants is from divine government to self-government and then to human government
After God called Abraham out of Babel, He promised him that all the families on the earth would be blessed through his seed, Christ
The law came to expose and prove man's weakness and corruption so that he would be convinced of his condition and draw near to grace
In this way, God was able to deal with man through grace, not just according to the law, so that man could live under grace
With the termination of the law, grace can reign; the dispensation of grace is a continuation of the promise God gave Abraham
In the fifth dispensation, God dealt with man through the strict and righteous law because man did not know himself
When the seventh dispensation, the kingdom, comes, He will reign with righteousness, exercising His authority on the earth
The essential object of God's revealing of Himself is man; therefore, man occupies a very significant place in the Bible
In this period all human beings in the world were of the adamic race; there was no distinction among Israelites, Gentiles, or the church
Adam was created in God's image with a spirit, a soul, and a body, prepared to receive God's life and reign for God
God then submerged the whole earth with the flood; all the people were destroyed by the flood except for Noah's family of eight
Whereas Adam was the father established by God in His creation, Noah was the father established by God in His salvation
Before Babel, people on the earth opposed God individually; they never reached the point of being organized together
At Babel, however, men organized themselves to form an alliance, and they all joined together to rebel against God
Just as the adamic race was terminated due to God's judgment, the line of Noah's descendants was also terminated by God's judgment
Adam was the father of the created ones, Noah was the father of the saved ones, and Abraham was the father of the called ones
The group God created failed, and the group God saved also failed; therefore, God came to call out another group of people
Delivered by God out of Egypt, they were able to leave their position as slaves and return to their position as heirs of promise
After they came out of Egypt and arrived at the foot of Mount Sinai, they received the law from God; they received God's holy Word
They passed through the wilderness, where they received God's leading, encountered numerous circumstances, and saw many signs and wonders
Not long after they established the kingdom, they were defeated, desolate, and carried away to the Gentile nations
When seventy years of captivity were fulfilled, they were restored and brought back to Jerusalem in the land of Canaan
We can be very clear about the things concerning Israel as the chosen people of God if we remember these twelve points
In this long section of the Bible, the main character is Israel, the chosen people of God, the descendants of Abraham
In summary, there are three groups of people in the Old Testament-the adamic race, the descendants of Noah, and the descendants of Abraham
The first twenty-six books of the New Testament are concerned specifically with the church, that is, the believers
A greater part of the Gospels emphasizes hearing the gospel, but there is also a part which emphasizes receiving life
Because the church has heard the gospel received life and received the Holy Spirit she becomes the dwelling place of God the Body of Christ
At the end of the Epistles, almost all of the 'second' Epistles speak about the defeat and desolation of the church
The Israelites are the descendants of Abraham in the flesh; the church are the heavenly descendants of Abraham
Revelation 11 and 12 show that the overcomers in the church will conquer God's enemy and bring in the Lord's kingdom
Revelation 21 and 22 say that all the saved ones in the church will participate in the New Jerusalem in eternity
Revelation 6 shows that there have been increasing afflictions on the earth after the ascension of the Lord Jesus
When the earth is stricken with all kinds of disasters, the gospel is easily preached and people are readily saved
The first matter concerning the Gentiles in Revelation is that they are under judgment and stricken with afflictions
The beginning of man is with Adam, and man's conclusion is seen in the reigning of the New Jerusalem and the nations under its ruling
We have mentioned repeatedly that the tree of life denotes God and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil denotes Satan
According to the Scriptures, the anointed cherub, the archangel, was originally set by God to be over the universe, the preadamic universe
In Luke 4:6, Satan said to the Lord Jesus that the glory of all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth had been delivered to him
The Bible does not speak of it being delivered after Adam was created, because Satan fell before Adam was created
On the one hand, Satan is the ruler of this world, the ruler of the system on the earth, which is a systematized world
Being the ruler of the world speaks of Satan ruling over man, and being the god of this age speaks of man worshipping Satan
On the one hand men are ruled by Satan and on the other hand men worship him because he is the ruler of this world and the god of this age
To tempt is to deceive, to turn falsehood into truth and truth into falsehood, thereby confusing truth and falsehood
These authorities are also called princes, such as the prince of Persia and the prince of Javan spoken of in Daniel 10:13 and 20
When Satan rebelled against God, they followed him in his rebellion and became a group of authorities under him
From these verses we can conclude that at least a third of the angels followed Satan when he rebelled against God
Of these angels, some are the authorities in the air spoken of in Ephesians 6, who are on high, and some are common angels
These ministers do not refer to fallen angels or to unclean spirits; they refer to people who are used by Satan
False apostles are sent by Satan into the church to do a damaging work; they are ministers of Satan who serve him by running errands for him
According to the four Gospels, the demons cast out by the Lord Jesus when He was on the earth were unclean demons and evil spirits
Many who read the Bible confuse unclean demons and evil spirits with angels, thinking that the demons are fallen angels
Their dwelling place is different from the fallen angels, and their nature is also different from the fallen angels
Concerning this matter, we can say that all of the attacks in the Bible against God's children come either from the air or from the sea
There are five categories of Satan's subordinates, together with all the fallen people in the whole world as his citizens
The angels under Satan came to corrupt man, mingling with man, corrupting man to the uttermost and bringing in God's judgment
He took the lead to overthrow the authority of God's rule, to set himself up as a king, to rule over others, and to establish a kingdom
They collectively rebelled to abolish Gods authority from the earth in other words they intended to force God from the earth to the heavens
When the children of Israel came out of Egypt and reached the foot of Mount Sinai, Satan still followed after them to damage them
After the children of Israel came to the foot of Mount Sinai, the first thing Satan did was to cause them to reject God's grace
You did not have to do anything, to make any move, or to do any work; rather, My grace accomplished everything for you
Satan caused the children of Israel to not believe in God's promise to bring them into the land of Canaan with His great power
The last sentence in the book of Judges says, 'There was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes'
God finally established the prophethood among them, yet Satan came to corrupt again, causing them to kill the prophets of God
Satan not only frustrated the building of the temple, he also frustrated the building of the holy city as seen in Nehemiah 4:1-11 and 6:1-13
According to Matthew 23:15, the Jews made people proselytes of Judaism, but in the end they were really sons of Gehenna
Satan's corruption was so great among them that he used God-worshipping religion to make people the sons of Gehenna
According to Daniel 7:21-25, 8:23-25, and Revelation 12:15-17 Satan will particularly destroy and afflict Israel, God's elect, at this time
The Lord stripped off the rulers and authorities in the air, including all the angels under Satan, triumphing over them
When the Lord Jesus gained the victory through death and resurrection, He captured the capturing power of Satan
Satan causes the believers, like Ananias and Sapphira in the early days of the church , to deceive the Holy Spirit
She takes leaven, which is all kinds of heresies, and puts it into the Lord Jesus' truth of life, leavening the whole lump
Corinthians 1134 speak of another Jesus a different spirit and a different gospel and Galatians 16 speaks of a different gospel
Based on Revelation 2:24 and 1 Timothy 4:1, we should never assume that only teachings of God are spoken in Christianity
Even in Christianity Satan works to cause people to speak his teachings, and not just ordinary teachings, but also his deep things
The main thought in Colossians 2:2-4, 8-9, and 16-23 relates to Satan using people to bring Greek wisdom into the church
Satan stirred up the Judaizers to kill the believers and caused them to think that they were faithfully offering service to God
History tells us that the Roman Catholic Church was more vicious in killing Christians than even the nation of Rome
In Luke 22:31 the Lord Jesus spoke of Satan sifting the believers as grains in a sieve; this is not easy to bear
They want to hear things that are interesting such as parables, stories, and jokes; they cannot tolerate healthy teaching
Balaam was a prophet of unrighteousness who preached for wages and taught for reward; moreover, some actually held this kind of teaching
In the Bible the word fornication includes two aspects one aspect is fornication of the flesh and the other aspect is spiritual fornication
Among the children of God there should be the spiritual order in the Body but not the clergy system according to man
The church should be like a boat which is on the sea but not of the sea; however, at the time of Pergamos, seawater came into the boat
The result of the union of a boat and the sea is that seawater fills up the boat and the boat sinks into the sea
The mysterious Babylon the Great spoken of in Revelation 17:1-6 refers partly to the Roman Catholic Church and partly to the Roman Empire
God sees the mysterious Babylon the Great as a great harlot because she has fully mixed religion with politics
The Roman Catholic Church has added many heresies into the truth of Christ as life and changed the nature of all the truths
Although Satan has done some damage to the believers and the church, the believers and the church have victories over Satan as well
In the future, before the great tribulation, after the overcomers are caught up to the heavens, they will cast Satan down out of heaven
The afflictions that are brought to the whole world include wars, natural disasters, man-made calamities, and all kinds of diseases
When Satan is cast down, great tribulation will begin on the earth; Satan will do all that he can to bring afflictions to the world
