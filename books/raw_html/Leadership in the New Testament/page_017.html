<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Christ Having Been Exalted<br>as the Leader over All the Rulers</H2><P>Christ was exalted as the Leader over all the rulers. Acts 5:31 says, "This One God has exalted to His right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins." The way He saves us is by being the Leader. Because He controls all things, He has the power, authority, ability, and capacity to save us. Under His leadership we have been saved. He has the authority and power, if He should so desire, to remove a king in order to save even one of His people. The account of Pharaoh and the people of Israel in Exodus is a demonstration of the Lord's authority and power to save. In Egypt Pharaoh kept all the children of Israel in slavery, and God sent Moses to tell Pharaoh to let His people go (Exo. 5:1). When Pharaoh refused, the Lord brought the plagues upon him, and he asked Moses to entreat the Lord for him (8:8, 28; 9:27-28; 10:16-17). Eventually Pharaoh was subdued, and he released the people of Israel (11:1; 12:31). The Savior saved His people through His power and authority.</P><P>The Lord's authority and power as the Leader over all the rulers can be seen in His control over the world situation. My intention since the early 1940s was to evangelize the northwest portions of China and Mongolia. I never thought that I would eventually come to America. However, due to the Lord's sovereignty in the world situation, I am here today. The One who brought me to this country is the Leader over all the rulers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Christ Having Been Made<br>the Ruler of the Kings of the Earth</H2><P>Christ has been made the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5). On the earth there have been many kings, queens, and presidents, but the Ruler of all these is Christ. God made Christ the Ruler and exalted Him as the Leader.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Christ Having Been Appointed to Be the Head over All Things to the Church<br>and Being the Head of the Church</H2><P>Moreover, God has appointed Christ to be the Head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:22). Whatever Christ is, is to the church. Christ is the Head of the church (Col. 1:18). Whatever the Head is, is transmitted to the church by the circulation of life in the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Christ Being the Head of Every Man<br>under the Headship of God</H2><P>Christ is also the Head of every man under the headship of God (1 Cor. 11:3). Christ is the Head of the church corporately and the Head of every man individually. Still He Himself is under the headship of God. What a marvelous order there is in the universe. God is over Christ, and Christ is over all things. As the Head of all things, He is the Head of the church and the Head of every man.</P>
