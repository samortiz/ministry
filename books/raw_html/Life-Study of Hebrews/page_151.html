<h2 class="head2">C. By the Love and Grace of God</h2><p>The salvation we have received of God is also secured by His love and grace. It is not we who loved Him, but He who loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins (1 John 4:10). Nothing whatsoever shall be able to separate us from the love of God (Rom. 8:38-39). We are changeable, but the love of God is unchangeable. Furthermore, God has not saved us according to our works, but according to His grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began (2 Tim. 1:9). Our works may often fail, but God&rsquo;s grace never fails. Our salvation is secured not by our works but by God&rsquo;s prevailing grace which comes out of His unchanging love.</p><h2 class="head2">D. By the Righteousness of God</h2><p>God&rsquo;s eternal salvation is secured by the righteousness of God which is revealed to faith (Rom. 1:16-17). For the showing forth of His righteousness, God must justify us, and He has justified us who believe in the Lord Jesus (Rom. 3:26). It is the righteous God who has justified us (Rom. 8:33). His righteousness is the foundation of His throne (Psa. 89:14, Heb.). His throne is established forever and nothing can shake it. Our salvation, being secured by God&rsquo;s righteousness, is as unshakable as God&rsquo;s throne.</p><h2 class="head2">E. By the Covenant of God</h2><p>Our salvation is secured by the covenant of God. God has saved us by His new covenant (Heb. 8:8-13). It has definitely been covenanted that He has written the law of life within us and that He will never remember our sins. As the faithful God, He will never break His covenant (Psa. 89:34). Not only His righteousness but also His faithfulness binds Him. Hence, His covenant with His faithfulness is a security of our salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">F. By the Power of God</h2><p>The security of God&rsquo;s eternal salvation is also by the power of God. The Lord Jesus said that His Father is greater than all, and that no one can snatch us out of the Father&rsquo;s hand (John 10:29). God the Father is more powerful than anything. He has a mighty arm, and strong is His hand (Psa. 89:13). No one can pluck us out of His hand.</p><h2 class="head2">G. By the Life of God</h2><p>Our salvation is eternally secured by the life of God. The Lord said, &ldquo;I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever&rdquo; (John 10:28, Recovery Version). Do you believe that the eternal life can be recalled once it has been given to us? To say that once we are saved we can be lost again means that the eternal life which has been given to us would be called back. This is altogether illogical. Once we have the eternal life, we shall never perish.</p><h2 class="head2">H. By God Himself</h2><p>Our salvation is secured by God Himself. God has chosen, predestinated, called, justified, cleansed, and saved us. With Him there is no shadow of change (James 1:17); He is unchangeable (Mal. 3:6). After doing so much for us that we might be saved, do you think that God would change in this matter? Can our condition or situation affect God&rsquo;s nature? Can it change God&rsquo;s doing? No, it is impossible. Our salvation is secured by the unchangeable God Himself.</p><h2 class="head2">I. By the Redemption of Christ</h2><p>Our salvation is secured by the redemption of Christ. Christ has died for us (Rom. 8:34), and the redemption accomplished by His death is an eternal redemption (Heb. 9:12). By offering Himself once to God He has perfected us forever (Heb. 10:14), and His eternal redemption issues in our eternal salvation (5:9). Thus, He is able to save us to the uttermost, not only in extent but also in time (7:25).</p><h2 class="head2">J. By the Power of Christ</h2><p>Our eternal salvation is also secured by the power of Christ. In John 10:28 and 29 the Lord assures us that not only the Father&rsquo;s hand but also His hand will keep us from perishing. The Father is strong, and He is powerful. No one can snatch us out of the Father&rsquo;s hand, nor out of His hand. We are secured by two divine hands, the Father&rsquo;s hand of love and the Son&rsquo;s hand of grace, both of which are powerful to keep.</p>
