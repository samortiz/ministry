   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The first thing that we need to mention is the word "willfully."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is meant by "willfully"?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Does this word mean "consciously"?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This may be the answer that we would give.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But I would ask if there are many Christians who sin unconsciously?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every day we sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet how many times do we sin unconsciously?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I believe that probably every time we sin, we sin "willfully."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Very few people commit sins unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Most of the time, we sin "willfully."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Romans 7, Paul says, "For what I work out, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do" v. 15 . By this we know that Paul did not fall into sin accidentally.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All of his sins were committed after he was fully conscious of their wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, it is clear from Romans 7 that all of Paul's sins were committed "willfully."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If Paul sinned "willfully," then according to Hebrews 10:26, there would remain no longer any sacrifice for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a person perished and went to hell, he would see Paul there, because even Paul had no more sacrifice for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, we need to see that the word "willfully" in Hebrews 10:26 does not mean consciously.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If this were the case, then all of the Christians would perish.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No matter what kind of Christian you may be, countless times in your life, you sin consciously rather than unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the above situation were true, no Christian would be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, "willfully" here must mean something else.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A second point is that verse 26 begins with the word "for."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this particular word to be used at the beginning of a sentence, something has gone on prior to its use.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This word cannot be used without a preceding sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verses 26 through 29, the first sentence begins with "for," which means that there was something mentioned before.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Prior to this, verse 25 says, "Not abandoning our own assembling together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more as you see the day drawing near."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why should we not abandon our own assembling together, but exhort one another?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is because when we sin willfully after receiving the full knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do not read this portion carefully, we will not realize that these two verses go together.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we read it carefully, we will realize that these two verses are linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must realize that not abandoning our own assembling together and sinning willfully go together.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must not forsake the assembling of ourselves together, but exhort one another, for when we sin willfully, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Negatively, we should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Positively, we must not sin willfully.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we assemble ourselves together, then we are not ones who sin willfully.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we customarily forsake the assembling of ourselves together, we are ones who sin willfully.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here, the apostle put the abandoning of our assembling and sinning willfully together.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why is there such a close relationship between abandoning the assembling of ourselves and sinning willfully?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At this juncture we must come to the third point.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to know the background of the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Who were the ones mentioned in this book?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They were the Jews who believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, the book of Hebrews was written to believing Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The position of the Jews is different from that of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Gentiles have the spiritual position only and not the earthly, physical position.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Jews have both a spiritual and a physical position.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They have a heavenly as well as an earthly position.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today when we speak of the Holy of Holies, immediately we think of a place where God dwells in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But to the Jews, when they consider the Holy of Holies, what occurs in their thought is the Holy of Holies inside the temple at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Not only do the Jews have a Holy of Holies in heaven, but they also have a Holy of Holies on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Not only do they have a temple in heaven, but a temple on earth also.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, in their mind, there is the spiritual aspect as well as the physical aspect, the heavenly aspect as well as the earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They have the Old Testament as well as the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They still have the physical Holy of Holies, and with it the offerings.</S>
