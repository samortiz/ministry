<h2 class="head1">I. GOD&rsquo;s PROMISE TO RESTORE ISRAEL</h2>
<p>There are many prophecies by the Old Testament prophets concerning the children of Israel forsaking God due to their unbelief after they entered the good land, the plagues that they would suffer as a result, and their being captured and scattered among the nations. The prophets also prophesied that the captured children of Israel would repent to God and that God would gather them together and bring them back to the good land to receive blessings from Him and to be restored. In this lesson we will begin to study the prophecies concerning God&rsquo;s promise to restore Israel, starting with the prophecies in Isaiah.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. PROPHECIES<br />
CONCERNING THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL<br />
IN THE OLD TESTAMENT AGE</h2>
<p>The Old Testament prophets, including those before the captivity and those during the captivity, prophesied concerning the restoration of Israel. These prophecies are dispersed throughout the books of prophecy in the Old Testament. The content of these prophecies is both detailed and rich. Most of the prophecies were initially and partially fulfilled with the return of the children of Israel from captivity and will be ultimately and fully fulfilled with the restoration of the children of Israel in the millennial age.</p>
