   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Submission Being a Joyful Matter</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The teachings in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew are not there to cause us to feel uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, they are there to make us happy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you walk with others for a mile, it may make you feel uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if you walk with them the second mile, it will make you happy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word "blessed" there can be translated as "joyous."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Submission is a joyful matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The life that the Lord gave us is a joyful life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Head gives the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Where there is the ministry, there is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we submit to authority, we feel happy and joyful within.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Pursuing Submission</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the work of the Lord, we should find out who is ahead of us, and we have to seek for the opportunity to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I do not believe that there is any brother who is not under some other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Something within you will demand that you find out who is the object of your submission.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the sisters cover their heads, they cannot do so with the hair that grows naturally from them; they have to find a handkerchief and cover their heads.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The finding of the handkerchief means that a person has to pursue submission.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why should we not pursue submission in the same way that we pursue love or knowledge?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why would men not pay attention to submission in the same way that they pay attention to work?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why would we not love submission in the same way that we love the preaching of the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A person has to learn to come under one or more authorities in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let me repeat, where there is no ministry, there is no authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Where ministry is, there is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Honoring the Authority that</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God Has Established</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In a local church, not only is there spiritual authority, but there is positional authority as well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul charged Titus and Timothy to appoint elders.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These elders have positional authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you do not have the spiritual discernment and you appoint three elders, and after three years you find out that four other people are more advanced than these three, what should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Should you replace the old ones with the new ones?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Should you ask the old ones to resign?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should honor all the authorities that God has established according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Submission Perfecting Ourselves and Others</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I can testify that God has His arrangements in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you go along with these arrangements, these arrangements will perfect you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ministry is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you submit to the authority of the ministry, you will be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One sister was very capable of assuming headship.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She came to see me because she wanted to submit to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She told me that she could not submit to her husband, because her husband was too indecisive in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I answered, "Nevertheless, simply submit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Go and ask him everything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He cannot tell you every time that he does not know.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By asking, you will force him to go to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You should learn to be godly and to fear God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When you submit, you are not debasing yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, by so doing you are helping your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God has assigned you to be one who submits to others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you would submit, you will help others."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is a reason for our being chosen: we are chosen to submit to others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul could boldly say "my gospel" Rom 2:16; 16:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He could also remind Timothy to know "from which ones you have learned" 2 Tim 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The reason he could say this is that he was a proper apostle, and he had the greatest ministry and the greatest gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, he had the authority to remind others concerning his gospel, his ministry, and his teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Submission Bringing In the Building</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A person must put himself under a few persons and must submit to them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this way, not only will he receive the benefit individually, but the church will also receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A member in the Body is like a stone in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The temple was built up because there were suitable stones that were coordinated and built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Building means that one stone is laid on top of another, and desolation means that no stone is laid on top of another.</S>
