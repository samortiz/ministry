   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PARTICIPATING WITH BROTHER NEE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE ONE FLOW OF THE LORD'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Later, Brother Nee made arrangements for me to edit The Christian, a magazine for young believers, whereas he would edit The Present Testimony, a deeper magazine on the spiritual principles of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At that time he also decided to publish a paper containing church news.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That paper was called The News of the Churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He charged me to take care of that paper.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He also put me into a position of bearing the full responsibility for the ministry in the regular meetings of the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was because his health was not good, and he had to rest much of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He spoke mostly in the conference meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1934, after I had been in Shanghai close to four months, Brother Nee said to me, "Witness, we co-workers feel that you have to move your family to Shanghai so that we can work together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Bring this matter to the Lord, and see how the Lord will lead you."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I took his word and brought this matter to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then I saw that in the book of Acts there was only one flow, one current.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It started from the throne of grace and went to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From Jerusalem this flow proceeded to Samaria and then to Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From Antioch it turned westward to Asia Minor and Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The book of Acts shows that there was only one current of the Lord's move on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no record of any work which was outside of this current.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Barnabas separated himself from Paul Acts 15:39-41 , there was no more record of his work in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After this incident, he no longer appears in the divine narration in Acts of the Lord's move in God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord impressed me that the current, the flow, of the Lord's work in China should be one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the Lord was to do something in the north, I would have to jump into the flow at Shanghai in the south.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then eventually the flow would proceed to the north from Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Based on this revelation, I made the decision to go to Shanghai to work with Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After he had a conference with us on the overcoming life of Christ, under his leadership, a decision was made that we co-workers had to go out to the major cities to spread the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I was assigned to go to the north to work in Tientsin and Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I went to work there in 1936, while Brother Nee remained in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While I was working in northern China, I received a cable from Brother Nee, asking me to come to an urgent conference with all the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this conference in January 1937, he released the messages that are now contained in The Normal Christian Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One day during this conference, he was ill, so he charged me to give his message on Acts 13.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He gave me all the points and I wrote them down.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I did my best to share in this meeting, but I did it in an inadequate way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Later the decision was made by the work for me to travel throughout the provinces of northern China to teach, if possible, in all the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We felt that since the Lord had given us so much light, we should pass on this light to the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I did much traveling until the Japanese army invaded China.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At that time many of the co-workers went to the interior of China, and I joined them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was there that Brother Nee released the messages on the normal Christian church life a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first conference was not so adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this conference he succeeded in releasing his entire burden.</S>
