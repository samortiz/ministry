   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AUTHORITY IN GOVERNMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although Satan fell, God did not give up the entire universe, because there were still many good and clean angels, and the universe was still under God's care.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Likewise, after Adam and Eve rebelled against God's authority and the world and mankind fell, God did not give up the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He still appoints authority in this world and still calls men to maintain and uphold authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We can find authority in the government and in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the institutions of authority that God has ordained in this world are involved mainly with human relationships, such as the relationships between men and women, between husband and wife, between parents and children, and between servants and masters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Other than these four domestic relationships, there are official relationships of those holding offices outside the family.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has set up systems of authorities in all forms of human relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has put those whom He has chosen into authority in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From the day of creation and for the next 1,656 years, God seemingly did not appoint any authority on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During that time some men rose up by themselves and tried to assume authority on their own.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After 1,656 years, that is, after the flood, God instituted government among men.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He decreed and said to Noah, "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed" Gen 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Capital punishment was God's first decree.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the flood God transferred the power of human rule to man himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, all officers and governments are appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Deputy authority in the civil world started in Noah's time and has been with us until today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today officers are found in all forms of government.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although many officers and administrators are evil, authority still exists with them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These men may not be godly; they may not believe in God, but they are the deputy authorities and are appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although all the kingdoms of the earth are under Satan's dominion, authority still rests in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Entire nations may be under Satan's influence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In fact, the entire world will be under Satan one day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet the principle of authority is still under God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Recently I read in the newspaper that England is almost as advanced as Germany and the Soviet Union in its movement towards socialism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not a matter of the degree of advancement; in all these countries the advancement is in full swing already.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>England is still democratic in name, but it is already run by principles which find great kinship to Marx and Engel's communism.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus testified solemnly to Pilate, saying, "My kingdom is not of this world" John 18:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's kingdom is heavenly and spiritual; it is not of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, none of the nations that exist today are God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, they still derive their authority from God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No matter what system of government a nation takes, its authority comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The founding of every nation is based on God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God chose the people of Israel and established them as a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The nation of Israel became God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>David was its king, and he was appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God first appointed Saul and then later David.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Saul was an evil king, while David was a good king.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet both the evil king and the good king derived their authority from God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The history of the Old Testament shows us clearly that due to Israel's continuous rebellion against God's authority, the king of Babylon came and took all the Israelites away as captives.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After Babylon there was Persia.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, God stirred up his heart, and he made a decree throughout his land.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible gives an account of this: "Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth has Jehovah, the God of heaven, given to me" 2 Chron 36:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He said this because God had stirred up his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God even called Cyrus "My shepherd" Isa 44:28 and His anointed 45:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The king of Persia was appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although Cyrus did not know God at all, his authority was from God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the New Testament we find Jews suffering under the hands of the Roman Empire, having lost control of their country.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Israelites were in a situation like ours when we were under the hand of the Japanese.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Jews were ridiculed as men without a country.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord was born shortly after the conquest of the Jewish nation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At that time the rulers, like Pontius Pilate, were Gentiles, yet they were still God's appointed authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once the Pharisees tempted the Lord by asking Him, "Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord answered, "Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar and the things that are God's to God" Matt 22:17, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This means that the Lord acknowledged Caesar's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He acknowledged the existence of earthly authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the Lord did not know God, He could very well have become a revolutionary leader.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But He never gave Himself to any revolutionary movement.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He recognized the authority of human government as coming from God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Roman Empire continued from one generation to the next.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After Claudius died, Nero came to the throne, and the institution of slavery became much more prevalent.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When Paul wrote his Epistles, he told the slaves to obey those over them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He continued the subject of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Paul told men during Nero's time to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Others could have accused Paul of being a traitor.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Such an accusation might not have been a sweet thing to take, but Paul insisted on submission just the same.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the Old Testament there was Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the New Testament there was Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>These two men had a most difficult job.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God charged Jeremiah to tell the Israelites to surrender to the Chaldeans Jer 21:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He told the king of Judah to bring his neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and to serve him and his people so that the Jews would live 27:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the New Testament Paul had similar words to say.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Both of them saw God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the reason they charged men to submit to those in authority and to pay tax where tax was due.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In Romans 13:1-3 Paul said, positively, that every person should be subject to those over him, and negatively, that whoever resisted authority opposed God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He said that the authorities which exist are ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Verse 5 says that it is necessary to be subject, and verse 7 says that we should render tax to whom tax is due, custom to whom custom is due, fear to whom fear is due, and honor to whom honor is due.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Paul pointed out that God has established authority in government.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Some may not be able to swallow these words.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Paul said that rulers are only a terror to evil workers.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Some may argue that many rulers are evil and that men are punished even when they perform much good.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But the truth is that there is still the pretense of justice even with evil and corrupt rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They cannot cast aside their confession and blatantly claim that they are punishing men or executing them for doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Even when a ruler rewards evil for good, he has to first accuse the good man and make him evil before he can punish him.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In the same way, when he befriends the mob and enlists them in his army, he first has to extol them for their patriotism.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He has to ascribe good names to them first and then prove to others that he is rewarding the good and punishing the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He may be wrong in his conduct, but at least he has to be right in his principle.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God says that all authorities are from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He has established the authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Although there are evil rulers and evil laws, these men and institutions still stand for God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The day this world order stops will be the day when all worldly rulers are destroyed and the lawless one appears.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is a good thing that rulers are with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>A government based on anarchy is one that hastens the coming of Satan's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Of course, when Satan comes, the kingdom of God will also have drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Satan is the most lawless one.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When this lawless one appears, he will annul God's principle of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Then there will be no divine authority; evil men will be uplifted, and good men will be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Then men will call evil those who do good and call good those who commit evil.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>God's entire principle of authority will be overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This will be the end, and lawlessness will take over completely.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Today we Christians should pay attention to four things with respect to government.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>First, we should render tax to whom tax is due.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Second, we should render custom to whom custom is due.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Third, we should render fear to whom fear is due.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>It is right for us to fear soldiers and policemen.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We are those who are under authority.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We cannot say that we have nothing to do with policemen since we are good citizens and have not broken any law.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Although the policemen may not come after us, we still have to fear them in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Although the nations are now part of Satan's kingdom, God's authority is still with them.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Therefore, we must still render fear to whom fear is due.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Fourth, we should render honor to whom honor is due.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We have to respect the rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Titus 3:1 says that we should be "subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work."</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This is the proper attitude towards human government.</S>
