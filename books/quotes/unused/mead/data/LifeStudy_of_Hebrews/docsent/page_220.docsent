   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO BE TRANSFORMED AND CONFORMED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO THE IMAGE OF THE FIRSTBORN SON</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we know what answer to give whenever we are asked if we are the same as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should say, The very Son of God is in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But my mind, emotion, and will have not yet been conformed to the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although my mind, emotion, and will have not yet been conformed to His image, I thank God that I m under the process of conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the unique law spreads into my mind, my mind is being transformed and conformed to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After He spreads into my mind, my mind will be exactly the same as His.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Also, He will spread into my emotion and will, making my emotion and will the same as His.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, my whole being will be exactly the same as His.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this way, I shall be the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once we have received this vision, we shall hate the religious teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not teach me to do this and not to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I do not care for such teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I only know that Jesus Christ as the Firstborn Son of God is in my spirit waiting for the opportunity to spread Himself into my mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I simply want to open to Him again and again without trying to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I just open myself and say, Lord Jesus, spread Yourself into my mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lord, cause the unique law to become the many laws in all my inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I want You to spread in me until You possess every part of my being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I don t want to love, hate, or do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I only want You to spread Yourself into me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way, we shall be transformed and conformed to the image of the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is God s doing, the work which He is performing in us today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is absolutely different from religion, for it is the work of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This life is Christ Himself with the law working in us, regulating us, ruling us, and spreading Himself into every part of our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How much we need to see this vision and empty ourselves of every religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I want to drop the teachings and only love the living Christ who is in me as my life and as the unique law spreading Himself into my being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not care for loving or hating, for being good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not care for anything religious.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I only care for the living Christ in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Praise Him that He is in our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now He is waiting for the opportunity to get into our mind, emotion, and will that He might saturate our being with His element, causing Himself to become the very element of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this way, He makes us the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may even say that He is making Himself us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the working of the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is God s economy, the basic concept of the divine revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>May the Lord have mercy on us that we may see this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE WAY TO HAVE CHRIST SPREAD IN US</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How can this Christ spread within us?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only by our eating of Him as the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The hidden manna which we eat will become the budding element in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As this element buds out of our innermost being, it will bud into and through our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the working of the law of life to transform us and conform us to Christ s image that we all might become His living expression.</S>
