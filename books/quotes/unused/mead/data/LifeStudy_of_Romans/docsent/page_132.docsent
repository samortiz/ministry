   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAW OF SIN AND OF DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From 7:24 we go on to the matter of the law of sin and of death in 8:2.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although it is difficult to find terminology to express what this law is, it is easy to understand it according to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, it is easy to apply electricity in using household appliances, but it is difficult to define electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead of attempting to define the law of sin and death, we shall talk about it from the standpoint of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>None of us likes to lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We realize that it is very unbecoming to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But suppose you are stirred up to love the Lord and you make up your mind not to lose your temper again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One morning you pray about this and decide never again to lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Immediately afterward, your wife gives you a difficult time and makes you angry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although you try to suppress your anger, eventually you lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It seems that the more you try to hold in your temper, the stronger it is when it is released.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You had no intention or desire to lose your temper, but you lost it anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This comes from the working of the law of sin within you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suppressing your temper is like pressing down a rubber ball: the more you press it down, the higher it rises.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When sin works by the law, death follows immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As soon as you lose your temper, death comes in to kill you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, by losing your temper you are killed by the law of death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because the law of death has killed you, you cannot pray, fellowship, or testify.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you should try to do any of these things, you feel that you are hollow and empty and that your words are lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the result of the working of the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sin and death are two items, but they have just one law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The law of sin is the law of death, and the law of death is the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the reason that 8:2 speaks of the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sin works to bring in death, and death works to follow sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These two always go together.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every sin, even a little weakness, brings in death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>SETTING THE MIND ON THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Romans 8:6 says, The mind set on the flesh is death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To set the mind on the flesh means to exercise the mind to consider the things of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, to set your mind on worldly fashions or advertisements in the newspaper is to set it on things of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Likewise, to consider the weaknesses of your wife or husband is to set the mind on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The result of this is death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The death caused by setting the mind on the flesh is not, of course, the kind of death that causes you to die physically and be buried in the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No, this death has other symptoms, such as darkness and uneasiness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you feel uneasiness and unrest within, that is a sign of death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Dissatisfaction is another symptom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Perhaps in your time with the Lord in the morning you are very satisfied with the Lord, but after breakfast you set your mind on the advertisements in the newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more you consider them, the more dissatisfaction you are conscious of within.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This dissatisfaction is a sign of death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Weakness is another sign.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As we all know, the ultimate point of weakness is death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When someone is weak to the extent that he can no longer breathe, he dies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That is the consummation of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, weakness is an expression of death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Another sign of death is dryness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When you feel dry within, with no sense of being watered, you are in death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All these items darkness, uneasiness, dissatisfaction, weakness, and dryness are signs of inward spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever you set your mind upon fleshly things, you will be conscious of one or more of these signs of death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be filled with such things is to be filled with death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whenever you are suffering from inward death, those in the spirit will be able to sense it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They will realize immediately that you are filled with death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Your prayers indicate this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You may pray, but there will be no life in your prayers; instead, there will be death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead of watering, there will be dryness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>THE SPIRIT MAKING HOME IN US</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Romans 8:9 says, But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As we have pointed out, the Greek word rendered dwells is not the usual word for abide.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Greek word here has the same root as the word for house.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It conveys the thought, not of staying in a place for a certain time, but of making your home in a place, of settling down there.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If the Spirit is making home in you, you are no longer in the flesh, but in the spirit.</S>
