<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>Matt. 25:8-9 And the foolish said to the prudent, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. But the prudent answered,...go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.</strong></p>
<h2 class="head2"><em>The Three Aspects of <br />
the Kingdom of the Heavens</em> (continued)</h2>
<p>[Third,] the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the last aspect of the kingdom of the heavens<sup>258</sup> [and] will occur at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (Matt. 24:33, 39, 42-44; 25:6, 19).<sup>259</sup> We need to see that the manifestation of the kingdom is simply the transfer of the reality of the kingdom. In the next age [the millennial age], the reality of the kingdom will become the manifestation of the kingdom.<sup>260</sup> The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the practical coming of the kingdom of the heavens in power [24:30], as unveiled by the King on the Mount of Olives in chapters 24&mdash;25. Both the reality and the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens are with the church today. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the proper church life (Rom. 14:17), which exists in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, known as Christendom. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the heavenly part of the coming millennial kingdom, which is referred to as the kingdom of the Father in [Matthew] 13:43; the earthly part of the millennial kingdom is the Messianic kingdom, which is referred to as the kingdom of the Son of Man in 13:41, and which is the restored tabernacle of David, the kingdom of David (Acts 15:16). In the heavenly part of the millennial kingdom, which is the kingdom of the heavens manifested in power, the overcoming believers will reign with Christ for a thousand years (Rev. 20:4, 6); in the earthly part of the millennial kingdom, which is the Messianic kingdom on earth, the saved remnant of Israel will be the priests and will teach the nations to worship God (Zech. 8:20-23).<sup>261</sup></p>
<p>The kingdom in its reality...is an exercise and a discipline to us (Matt. 5:3, 10, 20; 7:21; [18:3]) in the church today whereas the kingdom in its manifestation...will be a reward and an enjoyment to us (Matt. 16:27; 25:21, 23) in the millennial kingdom in the coming age.<sup>262</sup> If we exercise ourselves in a proper way after we are saved, we will enjoy the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens as a reward.<sup>263</sup> How we live, walk, function, and work for the Lord after we are saved is the ground for the Lord to reward us.<sup>264</sup> The big question is whether or not we will be qualified to inherit the kingdom of the heavens [1 Cor. 6:9-10; Gal. 5:19-21; Eph. 5:4-5].<sup>265</sup></p>
<p>The last section of Matthew [chapters 24&mdash;25] concerns the manifestation of the kingdom when the Lord Jesus will come back to the earth....The two parables [on watchfulness and faithfulness] in Matthew 25 are very significant. They show us that, at the manifestation of the kingdom, some of the saints will enter into the joy of the Lord, and others will not. In the parable of the ten virgins [watchfulness; vv. 1-13], the five wise virgins will enter into the marriage feast, but the five foolish virgins will be shut out and sent to buy oil.<sup>266</sup> Oil signifies the Holy Spirit (Isa. 61:1; Heb. 1:9).<sup>267</sup> <em>Buy</em> indicates that a price must be paid. Having the filling of the Holy Spirit is at a cost, such as giving up the world, dealing with self, loving the Lord above all, and counting all things loss for Christ. If we do not pay this price today, we will have to pay it after we are resurrected.<sup>268</sup> Then in the parable of the talents [faithfulness; 25:14-30], the five-talented servant and two-talented servant were able to enter into the joy of the Lord, but the one-talented servant was not. The servant with one talent missed the joy and also was put into darkness where there was weeping and gnashing of teeth. Please do not ask me where this darkness will be and what kind of darkness this will be. I cannot tell you. But I do know that we have such a word out of the Lord&rsquo;s mouth and such a word written in the holy Scriptures.<sup>269</sup> We all need to repent and consecrate ourselves to deal with this matter of the kingdom.<sup>270</sup></p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
