A CORRUPT TREE PRODUCING EVIL FRUIT</h2>
<p>I do not believe that there is anything that is more real than the things in the spiritual realm. A person cannot cheat God. He cannot cheat himself, and he cannot cheat the saints. In two years&rsquo; time, you will see the effect of my words today. The kind of person you are determines the kind of children you produce. Those who love the world will produce Christians who love the world. Those brothers and sisters who seek after modern fashions, if they can bring others to salvation at all, will bring in ones who are flippant and shallow. Those who have a hot temper will surely bring in Christians with a bad temper. A good tree produces good fruit, and a corrupt tree produces evil fruit (Matt. 7:17-18). The kind of person we are determines the kind of fruit we produce. (<em>Messages Given during the Resumption of Watchman Nee&rsquo;s Ministry,</em> vol. 1, pp. 62-63)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>Brother Watchman Nee used to tell us that some people build up twelve inches by what they do but tear down fourteen inches by what they are. This means that they tear down more than they build up. Hence, it is better for them not to do anything. We may build up a certain amount by our Bible doctrine and knowledge, but we will damage more than we build up because of our shortage of the humanity of Jesus. In the church life we need the humanity of Jesus much more than the gifts, the so-called baptism, or the knowledge of the Bible. (<em>Christ as the Reality,</em> p. 108)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIQUE GOAL OF THE CHRISTIAN WORK</h2>
<p>According to the entire revelation of the New Testament, the unique goal of the Christian work should be the New Jerusalem, which is the ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MAIN CAUSE OF THE CHURCH&rsquo;S DEGRADATION</h2>
<p>The degradation of the church is mainly due to the fact that nearly all the Christian workers are distracted to take many things other than the New Jerusalem as their goal.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OVERCOMING EVERYTHING<br />
THAT REPLACES THE NEW JERUSALEM AS OUR GOAL</h2>
<p> Hence, under the degradation of the church, to be an overcomer answering the Lord&rsquo;s call needs us to overcome not only the negative things but even more the positive things that replace the New Jerusalem as the goal.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN OVERCOMER&rsquo;S GOAL</h2>
<p>An overcomer&rsquo;s goal should be uniquely and ultimately the goal of God&rsquo;s eternal economy, that is, the New Jerusalem. (<em>The Vital Groups,</em> p. 131)</p>
<h2 class="head1">BROTHER LEE&rsquo;S FELLOWSHIP ON APRIL 6, 1997</h2>
<p>The following is Brother Lee&rsquo;s fellowship given on April 6, 1997:</p>
<p>The co-workers must see that we should do only one work, which is to make God&rsquo;s chosen people regenerated ones, sanctified ones, renewed ones&mdash;the new man&mdash;transformed ones, conformed ones&mdash;those conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God&mdash;and glorified ones. All those who will be in the New Jerusalem are this kind of people.</p>
<p class="indent1">Specifically, God proceeds step by step to make a chosen one of God a person who is regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God, and even glorified by God. In this way, we go up level by level until we reach the highest point, where we become the same. There is no more flesh and no more natural being. All are in the spirit. All are the kingdom of the heavens, and all are beings of the New Jerusalem. This is the highest point. If you understand this, you can explain it to the brothers and sisters, and you can ask them to speak the same.
