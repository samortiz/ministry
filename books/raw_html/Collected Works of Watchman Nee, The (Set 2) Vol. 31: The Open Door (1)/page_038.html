<h2 class="head2">The General Condition<br />of the Work in Chungking</h2><p>In January Sister Wang held a gospel conference for women which continued with a Bible study. Thank the Lord, some were saved, and some became clear about salvation. Brother Chang Yu-zhi is involved with prison evangelism work, which began January 24. The sisters also plan to go to the women's prison to preach the gospel. From February 1-10, Brother Chang Yu-zhi will borrow a certain chapel to hold a large gospel meeting for unbelievers. After the meeting he plans to continue with one week of Bible studies. In the second half of February, he and Sister Wang plan to go Ch'eng-tu. Please pray for this.</p><p>Ruth Lee<br />January 26, in Chungking</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING<br />THE NORMAL CHRISTIAN CHURCH LIFE</h2><p>Mr. Watchman Nee sent a letter from Hong Kong on January 6 about The Normal Christian Church Life. The following is a quote from his letter: "After coming to Hong Kong, I have been editing this book day and night, but it still is not finished. Because this book is very important, I do not want it to be incomplete. I have added much new material in hope of serving the children of God well. There are now ten chapters in the book. Nine are completed; one is not. I plan to go to Shanghai on the ninth. After the book is printed, I will return to the south. The printing costs here are very high, and the quality of the printing is not very good." (This book is now being typeset and printed in Shanghai. We hope it will come out soon.)</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE CHURCHES</h2><h2 class="head2">K'un-ming, Yunnan</h2><p>Greetings to my dear Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I received your letter of December 26 a long time ago and read it carefully. When the brothers here and I heard that you, Sister Wang, and Sister Chang were coming to K'un-ming soon, we were overjoyed. Mrs. Yin Ren-hsian moved to K'un-ming recently. She knows Sister Wang very well. Many people from other provinces are coming to K'un-ming. We hope that the Lord will send more of His workers here to preach the gospel.</p><p>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, his wife, Brother Hu Yi-min, and Brother Ma Mu all arrived safely in Yeh-Ji Village in the middle of December. The journey was an exceptionally difficult one, and Mrs. Hsu was heavy with her pregnancy. They really received God's special grace on this trip. He has answered the prayers of His children. I received a letter from Brother Ma, saying, "Thank the Lord, there is already a table meeting in Brother Hu's house. We had the first table meeting on December 19, 1937. We also had the first meeting on that morning. Please pray unceasingly with all the other brothers and sisters for the work in this area." I have moved to 11 Wen- Miao-Dung Lane. If letters are sent to the K'un-ming Customs Office, I will have a better chance of receiving them. It is not that hard to travel from Haiphong to Hong Kong; one only needs to have a passport from the special department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Huang Tsung<br />January 9</p>
