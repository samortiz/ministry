One says that Paul was being poured out as a drink offering, and the other says that we shine as luminaries. We cannot shine as luminaries until we lower the standard of our living and are willing to give up our rightful position. We should not grasp our position. To proclaim that we are professors or bank managers is to grasp our position, but if a professor would go to the street corners on Saturdays and distribute tracts to the people, he will be shining. If Christ while on earth grasped His position as God, no light would have shined forth. He gave up the high standard of being equal with God, put it aside, and lowered Himself to live in poverty as a lowly man from Nazareth. Because of this, men saw the light shining through Him and out of Him.<p>Besides verses 15 and 17, verses 6 and 7 are also crucial, saying, &#8220;Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men.&#8221; For Christ to empty Himself, to make Himself of no reputation, means that He lowered His standard. In our living and in the things we do, we must lower our standard. We should not try to be honored by people. To try to be honored by people is a wrong concept in our Christian walk. Rather, we may be despised by others.<p>For Christ to keep His position of equality with God would not have been robbery. It was one hundred percent legal and right, but He gave that up. He lowered Himself and made Himself of no reputation. He was despised as a lowly carpenter from Nazareth. This is our pattern. We should not talk about taking Christ as our life in a vain way. To speak in vain about taking Christ as life is to enjoy a kind of entertainment. If we are serious, we have to lower our position and standard and be willing to be poured out on the altar as a drink offering. Then the light will shine through us. This is the key to Philippians 2.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS OUR GOAL AND AIM</h2><p>Chapter three of Philippians shows us that Christ must be our goal and our aim. Verse 14 speaks of the goal. We are in a race, and our goal is the all-inclusive Christ. When the apostle Paul wrote this Epistle in approximately A.D. 64, he was already quite old and had been running the Christian race for a long time. Although Paul was aged and very experienced in Christ, he did not have the assurance that he had arrived at the goal. He was even afraid that he would miss the mark. So he said, &#8220;Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal&#8221; (vv. 13b-14a). The goal is Christ Himself as the prize to be awarded to us. In the Old Testament the good land of Canaan was the goal for all the people of Israel after they were saved and delivered out of Egypt. While they were wandering and pressing on in the wilderness, they had a goal ahead of them. The good land of Canaan is a type of Christ, who is our goal.<h2 class=head2>Being Conformed to the Death of Christ by the Power of His Resurrection</h2><p>There are many important verses in Philippians 3. Verse 10 begins, &#8220;To know Him.&#8221; Paul knew Christ already, but he desired to know Him more. This verse continues, &#8220;And the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.&#8221; The death of Christ is a form, like a mold used for cooking. God puts us as pieces of dough into the mold of Christ&#8217;s death, onto His cross. When a person makes a cake, he conforms the dough to the form of the mold. In the same way, God puts us into the mold of Christ&#8217;s death to conform us to it.<p>This is by the resurrection power. Within us is the resurrection power and without is the cross, the mold, in our circumstances. Paul&#8217;s imprisonment provided the circumstances in which he was put into the mold of Christ&#8217;s death that he might be conformed to His death. By himself there was no strength to do this. The strength was the resurrection power within him.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>General Sketch of the New Testament in the Light of Christ and the Church, A - Part 2: Romans through Philemon &nbsp; pg 56</div><br></body></html>
