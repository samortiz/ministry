   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED TO TEACH THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO OBSERVE ALL THAT THE LORD COMMANDED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, in Matthew 28:20 the Lord personally charged His disciples saying, Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This clearly says that we need to teach the believers all that the Lord commanded.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When there is teaching, there is the need to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If someone is teaching but no one is learning, the teaching is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moreover, concerning observing, not only we ourselves should observe; we should also teach others to observe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE NEED FOR THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>TO CONTINUE STEADFASTLY IN THE TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>OF THE APOSTLES</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, the believers need to continue steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Immediately after Pentecost in Acts 2, the condition of the saved ones was that of continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles v. 42 . The teaching of the apostles is the teaching concerning the Lord Jesus, and it is the teaching the Lord commanded the disciples to observe in Matthew 28:20.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the day of Pentecost Peter, James, and John observed the Lord s word and taught others concerning what the Lord had commanded them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Their teaching became the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE NEED FOR APOSTLES TO TEACH UNCEASINGLY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>IN BIG MEETINGS AND IN HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Third, apostles need to teach unceasingly in big meetings and in home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Acts 5:42 we see that the apostles taught wherever they were, whether in the temple or in the homes, and they did not cease teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE NEED FOR THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TO ALWAYS LEARN AND TO COME TO</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Fourth, the believers need to always learn and to come to the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second Timothy 3:7 says that there are people who though always learning are never able to come to the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To come to the full knowledge of the truth requires our learning; our learning should enable us to know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Timothy 2:4 says that God desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here full knowledge means an adequate knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The truth requires our learning; it is insufficient to have only inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While inspiration can touch one s spirit, it does not help one s mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only when one s mind is exercised continuously can he know the truth, the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE NEED FOR THE BELIEVERS TO LET</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE WORD OF CHRIST DWELL IN THEM RICHLY</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Fifth, we need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly Col 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How can we let the word of Christ dwell in us richly?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we read the Bible merely in a routine way, the Lord s word will not be able to dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly in all wisdom and by means of all wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates that by means of all wisdom we need to exercise our mind, to exercise our ability to comprehend, to read, to listen, to write, and to learn, as well as to exercise other means so that the Lord s word may enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we want to speak in the meetings and exercise the gift of prophesying, we need to have a certain amount of learning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without learning, it will be difficult for us to prophesy well.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Fifty years ago, we thought that a person would be able to speak whenever there was an outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is true in regard to speaking in tongues and foretelling, but it is not true in regard to prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because of this, some Bible translators in the past translated prophesying as speaking the word as a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to speak the word, a person must learn the word; without learning the word, a person has no way to speak the word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Likewise, a person cannot prophesy simply by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit; rather, a prophecy results from an inspiration that is joined to the Bible as its base, that is, to a person s knowledge of the Bible that he already has within him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Prophesying is carried out in the principle of incarnation, the principle that God and man cooperate together; a man can speak for God and speak forth God only according to this principle.</S>
