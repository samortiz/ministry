   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRINCIPLES OF OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us also consider a little the principles of offering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Material Offerings</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not a Matter of Amount,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>but a Question of Where the Heart Lies</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible speaks about offerings with respect to a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first is material offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is no set principle as to the amount one should offer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some offer more, others offer less.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some time ago, a few brothers in Ku-tien sold all their possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time, I stopped them temporarily from doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no set principle to offering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some offer everything they have.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ says that a man must sell everything to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John the Baptist said that those who have two garments should give one away Luke 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Gospels tell us to care for the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Epistles, we see that the church should care for the widows among us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, a person must first care for his own household 1 Tim 5:16, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Second Corinthians 8:15 says that "he who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The problem today is not how much a person should offer, but the fact that money has laid hold of man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In God's work, no one can keep his money, on the one hand, and say that his heart loves the Lord, on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible says that where our money is, there is the heart also Matt 6:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order for our hearts not to be ensnared by money, we have to let the money go.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the money goes out of our pocket, the heart goes out with it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a man loves the Lord, he will be able to choose voluntary poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Voluntary poverty is the way for the heart to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes God will ask a person to sell all he has.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes He will only ask a person to give what he has in excess.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whatever it may be, the heart has to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Acts, the apostle rebuked Ananias for keeping back what he had in excess Acts 5:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we should not have anything in excess.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To have anything in excess is a shame in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church should not see any excess.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If there is any excess, it should be given away.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sister Eva said that every time she went to bed, she would always consider how she could save something more from her spending in order that others may receive more.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to take care of our livelihood, and we need to take care of our family.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But that is not this issue today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As long as we would set aside a portion from our income and would lower our standard of living a little, we will be able to give away all our excess.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today, when we speak of handing ourselves over, we are not talking about what we have to do to take care of our money.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, we are saying that a person has to offer himself up for the Lord and for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brothers and sisters who are engaged in an occupation, the Lord needs your ministry in your job!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These few years we are short of new co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Formerly, at its peak we had about four hundred co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today we only have about two hundred, with two hundred short.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to fill up the gap of these two hundred workers, there must be a group of people who would go to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Formerly, I dared not say such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But today I dare to say such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some should go to make money and offer their money to the Lord's service.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They should consecrate themselves to make money for the Lord's service.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Perhaps such a one can make a million dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He will only take what he needs to sustain his livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The rest he will give to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you are only a spectator here, nothing will happen to you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But if you want to give yourselves for the co-workers' need, it demands your life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Of course, God does not want us to go to the extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He wants us to be in moderation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First He wants us; then He wants what is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We ourselves have to come to Him first before we can bring what we have to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we do not come, God will not accept what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All the brothers and sisters have to see that everything is for the Lord and that everything has to center around the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must have the same center.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although some function in their money-making ministry while others function in their ministry of the word, the center for both must be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Offering Up Our Occupation</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Taking Up Occupations Approved by God</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Other than material offerings, the Bible also mentions the offering up of our occupations.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Bible shows us that many occupations are not suitable for a Christian to engage in. It is true that we have to make money, but we have to consider how our money is made.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some means of making money are not approved by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We can only keep the occupations that God approves, and we can never engage in works that God does not approve.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today, some leading ones in some localities have wrong concepts about occupations.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They bring these wrong concepts to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As a result, the church is ill-affected.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>A PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Concluding prayer: The Lord of all our works, we beseech for men on behalf of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Today the church is in a state of desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There is a lack of men in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>May the Lord grant us men, and may the church be filled with men.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Give many gifts to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Be merciful to us, so that there will be consecrated ones who will hand themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>May we find men who would submit under Your mighty hand, so that we can serve You together with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In this age of desolation, we ask especially that You raise up not just the young ones or the co-workers, but a church that would uphold Your testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>May more people put themselves into Your hands, so that their jobs, positions, and living can become worthy of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>May there be young ones raised up to work for You, and may all the brothers and sisters rise up to match the move of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We believe that You can fulfill the work of Your recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>May You do a greater work, and may You raise up more men to give all their time to serve You and to go out with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We ask that You raise up a great multitude of men.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We are not asking first for their money or their time.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We are asking for their whole person.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>May there be some who would offer themselves to You in a thorough way, and may they do it right now.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We pray that You would remove from us the desolation and would give us men.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Lord, be gracious to us; we are inquiring of You men.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Only You are worthy to gain us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Only You can cause us to serve You unreservedly and single-heartedly.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We would pour out the water of the well of Bethlehem here on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>May none among us be a withdrawing one, a hiding one, or a spectator.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray, amen.</S>
