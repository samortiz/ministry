   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PHILADELPHIA MUST APPEAR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this training here on the mountain, if God really deals with our self and with our work to the extent that we go out to provide a way for all the one-talented ones to serve, for the first time the church will begin to see what brotherly love is and Philadelphia will appear.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today the church needs not only oversight but also brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe in authority, and I also believe in brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without authority the church cannot go on.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And have kept My word this is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And have not denied My name this is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Philadelphia had these two kinds of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But Philadelphia herself is brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the brothers come forth and serve in love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When such a day comes, we will begin to know what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Otherwise, if the present condition continues, we will still be hanging on to the tail of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism; we will not know what the brothers of Philadelphia are and what the authority of the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>TWO WAYS GIFT AND AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today I think that two ways are clearly set before us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the Lord can really break through in our midst, the way we have taken for the past ten, twenty, or thirty years will be completely reversed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our view cannot be the same as before; it has to be broken and crushed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not Leaving Anyone Out</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First, you should not use a brother just because he is useful and leave him out if he is not useful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the church no member should be left out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not the way taken by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today, if the Lord is going to recover His testimony, He must make all the one-talented ones rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All who belong to the Lord are the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everyone must rise up and be in his function.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If this is the case, you will see the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While you are here on the mountain, consider every place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You almost have to say, Where is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Where is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It seems that neither the church nor the Lord is there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When you go out, never despise the one-talented ones, never replace them, and never suppress them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have to trust them from your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You have to cause them to work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If God has the assurance to call them to be servants, you too should have the assurance to call them to be servants.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Authority Dealing with the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second, in the church we are not afraid of fleshly activities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Two lines are to be established in the church one is authority and the other is gift.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the one-talented ones must come forth to serve, work, and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may ask, If the one-talented ones come forth with their flesh, what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Let me say that the flesh must be dealt with, and the way to deal with it is by using the authority which represents God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Gift and authority are two entirely distinct things; gift is gift, and authority is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The one-talented ones must use their gift, and with those who are fleshly, you must use authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a brother brings in the flesh while he is working, you must tell him, Brother, that will not do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You cannot bring that in. Tell him, This attitude is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We do not allow you to have this attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When you speak with him in this way, he will probably go home the next day and not do anything anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then you will have to look him up and say, No, you still should do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The flesh may come in again, but you still must let him do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You must say to him again, You must do this, but we will not allow you to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Always use authority to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the greatest test.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once the Lord uses the one-talented ones, their flesh will immediately be brought in. The flesh and the one talent are joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must refuse the flesh, but we have to use that one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today s situation is that we bury the flesh, they bury the one talent, and the church has nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This cannot be!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to use authority to deal with the flesh, but we also have to ask them to bring forth their talent.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Perhaps they will say, If I work, it will not do, and if I do not work, it will not do either.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>So what shall I do?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You must say to them, Indeed, if you work, it is wrong because you bring in the flesh; but if you do not work, it is also wrong because you bury the talent.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The one talent must come in, but not the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the church if the authority can be maintained and the functions of all the members brought in, you will see a glorious church on the earth, and the way of recovery will be easy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I do not know how many more days the Lord has set before us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I believe our way will be clearer and clearer.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to use all our thought and all our strength so that all the brothers and sisters may rise up and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When that time comes, the church will be manifested and the Lord will return.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>May the Lord be merciful and gracious to us so that we may do the best.</S>
