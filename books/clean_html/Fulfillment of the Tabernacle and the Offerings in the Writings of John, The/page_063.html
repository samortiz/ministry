<h2 class=head2>The Feasts in John’s Gospel</h2><p>We have seen that the Gospel of John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings. The offerings are closely related to the feasts. The annual feasts ordained by God in His law were times for presenting offerings to God. When the children of Israel came together to keep the feasts, they offered many offerings to God. Therefore, it was necessary for John in his Gospel, a book concerning the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings, to speak about the feasts. For the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings we need the feasts.<p>John 2:13 says, “And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.” This is the first of the feasts mentioned in the Gospel of John. The second time a feast is mentioned is in 5:1, which speaks of a feast of the Jews. We have seen that this is the feast of Purim. The feast of Purim was at the new moon between today’s calendar months of February and March. The Passover is a month later, at the new moon between March and April. Therefore, from the Passover in John 2:13 to the feast of the Jews in 5:1 is a period of almost a year.<p>John 6:4 says, “Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.” This is the second time the feast of the Passover is mentioned in John’s Gospel. There was an interval of a little more than a year between 5:1 and 6:4. Perhaps you have not realized that there is such an interval between chapters five and six. Then from the Passover in 6:4 to the Passover in 12:1, at which time the Lord Jesus was crucified, is another year. This means that from the Passover in 2:13 to the Passover in 12:1 is a period of three years. From 2:13 to 5:1 is one year; from 5:1 to 6:4 is a second year; and from 6:4 to 12:1 is the third year. It is in this way that it can be determined that the Lord’s ministry lasted for more than three years. Even this record concerning the feasts is related to the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.<h2 class=head2>Passing out of Death into Life</h2><p>According to the study of chronology, the feast of the Jews in 5:1 is the feast of Purim. According to spiritual significance also, this must be the feast of Purim. This chapter speaks of passing out of death into life: “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and will not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life” (5:24). The expression “passed out of death into life” may be used to describe the feast of Purim, for that was a time for the Jewish people to pass out of death into life. Their destiny under Haman had been death. But suddenly the situation was turned, and they passed out of death into life. Now we can understand why in 5:24 the Lord Jesus speaks of passing out of death into life. He speaks in this way here because of the background of the feast of Purim.<p>Do you know what our destiny was before we were saved? Our destiny was destruction. Our Haman was the Devil, Satan. He cast lots concerning us to appoint a time when we should be slaughtered, terminated. Thus, our destiny truly was death and destruction. But our God turned the situation, and the “lot” fell on Satan and his followers. As Haman and his sons were hanged on the gallows, so Satan and his followers were hanged on the cross. Satan had plotted to destroy us, but eventually he was the one who was destroyed (Heb. 2:14). Now we have passed out of death into life, and we can enjoy the real feast of Purim. What good news this is!<p>The Passover mentioned again and again in the Gospel of John is a sign of Christ as the real Passover. Likewise, John selected the case in chapter five to show that Christ is also the real feast of Purim. This indicates that Christ is our “lot,” but the lot for germination, not for termination. He is the lot for us to pass out of death into life. The Jews continue to celebrate the feast of Purim. But we need to realize that the real feast of Purim is Christ, the living Son of God. Only He can turn the lot from death to life. This is the significance of the sign of the feast of the Jews, the feast of Purim.
