   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOOD SOLDIERS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The believers are also soldiers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second Timothy 2:3 says, "Take your share in suffering evil as a good soldier of Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The apostles considered their ministry a warfare for Christ, just as the priestly service was considered a military service, a warfare, in Numbers 4:23, 30, 35 lit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>. Whenever we minister Christ to others, we find ourselves in a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, we should be soldiers fighting for God's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sharing the Suffering of Evil</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 2 Timothy 2:3 Paul speaks of suffering evil as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first aspect of being a good soldier of Christ is to share in suffering evil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To suffer evil means to suffer persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A minister of Christ is one who shares in the suffering of such evil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not Entangling Themselves with the Affairs of Life That They May Please the One Who Enlisted Them</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 2 Timothy 2:4 Paul goes on to say, "No one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of life, that he may please the one who enlisted him."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word for "life" here in Greek is bios, indicating the physical life in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To fight a good fight 4:7 for the Lord's interest on this earth we must be cleared of any earthly entanglement.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The matter of our material, physical life should not entangle us as we are endeavoring to minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This ministry is a fighting, and the fighting requires that we be free from entanglement.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the one hand, the priestly service is a ministry to God; on the other hand, it is a warfare against God's enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the priests were bearing the ark of testimony, they had to be prepared to fight against those who might attack this testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Carrying On a War Not at Their Own Expense</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The good soldiers of Christ should not carry on a war at their own expense.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Who at any time carries on a war at his own expense?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>1 Cor 9:7a .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This word was spoken as part of Paul's vindication of his rights as an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul's reference to carrying on a war implies that formerly the believers at Corinth were captives and that Paul had fought for them so that they might be released from Satan and set at liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It should not have been necessary for him to carry on such a war at his own expense.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not fair that a good soldier of Christ must do so.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>JJ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>LABORING HUSBANDMEN 1.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The First to Partake of the Fruits</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Second Timothy 2:6 says, "The laboring husbandman must be the first to partake of the fruits."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here Paul likens Timothy to a husbandman, a farmer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Just as a soldier must win the victory and an athlete must receive the crown, so a husbandman must partake of the fruits, the food.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The most significant thing related to being a laboring husbandman, a farmer, is labor.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A farmer must labor day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But it is an encouragement to him, a comfort, that he is also the first to enjoy the fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By Awaiting the Precious Fruit through Longsuffering</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As laboring husbandmen, we should await the precious fruit through longsuffering James 5:7; 1 Cor 9:10b .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Waiting for this precious fruit requires patience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As athletes we should be quick, but as farmers we need to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If out of impatience a farmer would pluck up the tiny sprouts, his crop would be ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Likewise, if he drives his cattle too much, he may hurt them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>With both crops and livestock, farmers must learn to have patience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>James 5:7 says, "Behold, the farmer awaits the precious fruit of the earth, being longsuffering over it until it receives the early and late rain."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The word "longsuffering" here expresses patience toward persons, as toward those who persecuted the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In addition to being patient with persons, we also need to be patient with our circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Through patience we shall receive the precious fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In 1 Corinthians 9:10b Paul says, "The plower should plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope of partaking."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Here Paul again likens the church to a farm.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In 3:9 he had already told the believers at Corinth that they were God's farm.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As a laboring husbandman, Paul plowed the ground and threshed in hope of partaking.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Like Paul and Timothy, all believers in Christ should be laboring husbandmen.</S>
