<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RECONSTITUTION OF THE NATION<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S ELECT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Neh. 11&mdash;13</h1>
<p>The books of Ezra and Nehemiah bear a strong intrinsic significance for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today. We should not think that the Old Testament is unrelated to us. The Bible is written in two sections&mdash;the Old Testament and the New Testament. The first section contains pictures, while the second section contains the fulfillment of what is signified by the pictures. Without an intrinsic understanding of the Old Testament types, it is not easy to understand the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy in the New Testament.</p>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider the reconstitution of the nation of God&rsquo;s elect.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Arrangement of<br />
the Dwelling Place of the People<br />
and the Appointment of the Officers<br />
of the Levitical Service and of the Civil Affairs</h2>
<p>The reconstitution of the nation of God&rsquo;s elect involved many aspects. In Nehemiah 11 we see that it involved the arrangement of the dwelling place of the people and the appointment of the officers of the Levitical service and of the civil affairs.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Rulers of the People<br />
Dwelling in Jerusalem</h2>
<p>The rulers of the people dwelt in Jerusalem, the holy city, and the rest of the people cast lots in order to bring one in ten to dwell in Jerusalem. The people blessed all the men who offered themselves willingly to dwell in Jerusalem (vv. 1-2).</p>
<p>At that time it was a real burden for anyone to dwell in Jerusalem. Because of the constant threat of foreign invasion, not many were willing to live in Jerusalem. Therefore, there was the need of some arrangement by casting lots. Otherwise, there would not have been a sufficient number of people living in Jerusalem. The ones whose lot was to live in Jerusalem were required to move there. However, some were willing to volunteer to dwell in Jerusalem, and all the people blessed them. Today those who voluntarily go full time will be blessed by all.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. A Record of the Arrangement<br />
and the Appointments</h2>
<p>In verses 3 through 36 we have a detailed record of the arrangement and the appointments.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. A Record of the Priests and Levites</h2>
<p>Nehemiah 12:1-26 is a record of the priests and Levites. The main serving ones in the worship of God, which is the main thing in God&rsquo;s kingdom, were not the kings. The kings were not for worshipping God but for ruling the people. The main serving ones for the worshipping of God were the priests with the Levites, who were the servants of the priests.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Those Who Went Up<br />
with Zerubbabel and Joshua</h2>
<p>In verses 1 through 21 we have a record of those faithful ones who went up from Babylon to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel and Joshua.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Those Who Served<br />
in the Days of Joiakim the Priest</h2>
<p>Verses 22 through 26 are a record of those who served in the days of Joiakim the priest, of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe. They all were living in Jerusalem.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 & 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther &nbsp; pg 56</div><br></body></html>
