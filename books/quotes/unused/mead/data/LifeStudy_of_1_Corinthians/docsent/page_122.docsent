   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FORTY-TWO DEALING WITH MARRIAGE LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 7:1-40</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In married life there are many blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, in 1 Corinthians 7 it is not Paul s intention to stress the blessed side of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the contrary, his emphasis is mainly on the troubles and distractions related to married life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reason for this emphasis is that here he is answering questions raised by the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we have pointed out, thoughtful, philosophical people have many questions about marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To answer the questions raised by the Corinthian believers, Paul sets forth a number of basic principles concerning married life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is profitable to consider these principles, for they help to answer our questions and also bring us into the enjoyment of blessing in our married life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that these basic principles include the following: it being good for a man not to touch a woman v. 1 ; devoting ourselves to prayer v. 5a ; giving no occasion to Satan v. 5b ; the gift we have received from God v. 7 ; remaining unmarried vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>8, 26-27, 40 ; better to marry if we lack self-control v. 9 ; remaining in marriage so that the unbelieving party may be saved vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>13-14, 16 ; allowing the unbelieving party to leave so that the believing party may live in peace v. 15 ; remaining in the status of our calling vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>20, 24 ; seeking to care for the things of the Lord free from other cares vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>32, 34 ; waiting on the Lord without distraction v. 35 ; a virgin giving his virginity in marriage doing well, and one deciding to keep his virginity doing better vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>36-38 ; a wife being free, after the death of her husband, to be married to another in the Lord v. 39 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we read this chapter and pay attention to these principles, we also need to touch the spirit of the writer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul s spirit is expressed in what he writes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For this reason, we should not only be familiar with the principles, but also touch the apostle s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we do not know the spirit of the writer in this chapter, this indicates that we have not adequately considered all the principles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have pointed out that 1 Corinthians 7 is an answer to questions written to Paul by the philosophical believers at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this chapter many points are covered, each of which is an answer to a question asked by the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the many points in this chapter indicate that the Corinthian believers certainly had many questions concerning their married life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>ABSOLUTE FOR THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nothing is more representative of human life than married life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In a sense, human life is simply married life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The matters involving our work and daily living are related to married life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this reason, we may say that married life represents human living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In answering the questions raised by the Corinthians concerning married life, Paul was simple, direct, frank, and genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He did not say anything ambiguous or speak in a political way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, he answered all the questions according to his Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why he says in verse 7, I wish all men to be even as myself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 8 he declares, It is good for them if they remain even as I. This indicates that Paul answers the questions concerning marriage according to what he is in his being and living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, if we would have a thorough understanding of this chapter, we need to ask what Paul lived for.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul was an absolute person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His spirit was absolute for the Lord and His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we read this chapter, we realize that Paul s aspiration was for all the believers to imitate him and follow him in being for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here Paul seems to be saying, I am absolute for the Lord, and I hope that you will all be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this matter I want you all to follow me.</S>
