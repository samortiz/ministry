By putting all these numbers together we can realize that Christ was the Triune God (the number three) who became a man having the number six. He was &ldquo;split&rdquo; in His death and was resurrected, fulfilling all the requirements of the Ten Commandments. In this way He opened the gate.</p><h2 class="head2">The Passage</h2><p>From the threshold we go to the passage, which has many details.</p><h2 class="head3">The Guardrooms</h2><p>Ezekiel 40:10 says that in this passage are six little chambers. Some of the better translations use the word<i> guardrooms.</i> These are the rooms where the guards stay to protect the temple. Each of these guardrooms is six cubits square and is thus the same in size as a cross section of the wall. This indicates that the Lord Jesus in His person and work is the real guard of God&rsquo;s glory and holiness.</p><p>If there were no wall, sinful people would be able to enter into the temple, and that would be an insult to God&rsquo;s glory and holiness. Whereas the wall separates sinners from God, the gate brings people into God and into God&rsquo;s building. In order to be the gate, the Lord Jesus had to fulfill all the requirements of the Ten Commandments. He was a square, upright, and proper man, able to fulfill the Ten Commandments, and now He Himself is the guardrooms of God&rsquo;s glory and holiness. Only those who are qualified and who match God&rsquo;s glory and holiness can enter into the temple. If we would be qualified in this way, we need to pass through the gate. By passing through Christ as the gate, we are qualified to enter into God&rsquo;s building, which is full of God&rsquo;s glory and holiness.</p><p>The six guardrooms are divided into two groups of three. Again we have the number three signifying the Triune God, who became a man and was &ldquo;split&rdquo; into two. This indicates that the guardrooms are a person, Christ Himself.</p><h2 class="head3">The Borders</h2><p>Between the three guardrooms are two spaces of five cubits each. Again we have ten cubits composed of two groups of five cubits. This shows us once more that Christ bears the responsibility to fulfill all the requirements of the Ten Commandments. Furthermore, we once again have the number two, signifying a testimony. On one side there are two spaces of five cubits each, and on the other side there are also two spaces of five cubits. This indicates that Christ fully bears the responsibility of the Ten Commandments and that this becomes a testimony. The Lord Jesus as the Triune God became a man and died on the cross to fulfill all the responsibilities of the Ten Commandments.</p><p>From the guardrooms we go on to the borders. Instead of <i>borders</i> the King James Version uses the word <i>space;</i> other versions use the word <i>platform.</i> Outside each of the guardrooms is a border, a space, which is one cubit wide. These are in two groups of three, signifying the Triune God in resurrection.</p><p>We need to remember that the passage is ten cubits wide. However, there is a sense in which we may say that the passage is eight cubits wide. If we deduct one cubit for the border around the guardroom on each side, this leaves the passage only eight cubits wide. Eight is the number of resurrection. The first day of the week, the day on which the Lord Jesus was resurrected, is also the eighth day. Hence, the eighth day is the day of resurrection and signifies a new beginning. When we pass through Christ, we pass through resurrection and have a new beginning.</p><h2 class="head2">The Posts</h2><p>Next we need to consider the posts, which are difficult to locate. Ezekiel 40:14 says that the posts are a total of sixty cubits and that every post (column) has two sides. Each post, each column, has two sides, and each side is of two cubits. On the sides of the passage are fifteen sides of two cubits each. Thus, there are thirty cubits on both sides of the passage, altogether equaling sixty cubits. Fifteen is composed of three times five, signifying the Triune God in resurrection bearing all the responsibility. The number two, indicating a testimony, is also present. The number thirty corresponds to the chambers of all the pavements for the enjoyment of Christ.</p><p>The columns, which support the roof of the structure, indicate that we need to be upheld by the supporting strength of Christ in order to enter into the enjoyment of Christ. The supporting strength is of the number thirty, and the enjoyment of Christ is also of the number thirty. This indicates that we can enjoy only as much as Christ can support. As we will see in a later message, the expression of Christ, as seen in the side chambers of the temple, is also in the number thirty. Thus, the expression of Christ, the enjoyment of Christ, and the supporting by Christ are all signified by the number thirty. We can only express what we can enjoy, and we can only enjoy what Christ can support.</p><h2 class="head2">The Palm Trees</h2><p>On the two sides of each column is a palm tree (v. 16). In the Bible palm trees signify victory, even victory that is everlasting. Christ, the guard of God&rsquo;s holiness and glory, is the everlasting, victorious One standing, bearing, sustaining, and prevailing.</p><h2 class="head2">The Porch</h2><p>From the posts we go to the porch, where the number eight is used. In the previous portion, mainly the numbers five, six, and ten are used, but with the porch the number eight is used. This indicates that we are now in resurrection, in a new beginning.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WINDOWS</h2><p>The windows are for letting in light and air. These are not narrow windows but latticed windows, having strips of material over them to protect the building from negative things. Yet the windows are kept open for air and light.</p><p>These latticed windows signify the life-giving Spirit. There are altogether thirty windows, fifteen on one side and fifteen on the other side. The gate is full of windows. This indicates that Christ is full of the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit brings in air and light and keeps out all the negative things.</p><p>The Hebrew word for <i>lattice</i> implies the thought of being beveled. This means that the outer side of the window is narrow but the inner side is wider (40:16). The life-giving Spirit is always toward the inside. Outwardly He is not wide but inwardly He is very wide.</p><h2 class="head1">SPREADING IN A SPACIOUS WAY</h2><p>Although Ezekiel mentions the height of the wall, he does not give the height of the gate. The omission of this dimension is quite significant. The entire compound of the temple does not give the impression of height but of spreading in a spacious way. Even the height of the wall is only six cubits. According to the plot plan, the temple compound is five hundred cubits square. Thus, the height is not great, but the spread is very great.</p><p>The human concept is that one should climb higher and higher until one reaches the heavens. That was the concept in the building of the tower of Babel. However, God&rsquo;s intention is to be with man on earth. God&rsquo;s desire is to come to earth and to spread His testimony on earth. Thus, God came to the earth as a man to spread His testimony over the whole earth.</p><p>In this message we have seen that the gates signify Christ as the Triune God. Christ became a man who was square, upright, perfect, and complete. Christ bore the responsibility and fulfilled all the requirements of the Ten Commandments in order to open the way for us to enter into God and into God&rsquo;s interests. Furthermore, Christ is the testimony of God, and as the resurrected One, the enlivening life-giving Spirit, He is a living witness of victory forever.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_083.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_085.html">Next</a> </body></html>
