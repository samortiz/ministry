   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Bringing In More Light</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>concerning the Divine-Human Person</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and the Saving Work of the Man-Savior</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Zachariah s prophecy brings in more light concerning the divine-human Person and the saving work of the Man-Savior than is found in the blessing of Elizabeth or the praise of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we compare Elizabeth s blessing, Mary s praise, and Zachariah s prophecy, we shall see that Zachariah s prophecy sheds more light concerning God s move on earth than is shed by either Elizabeth s blessing or Mary s praise.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this prophecy we have a revelation of Christ in His divine-human Person and His saving work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>HIS FORERUNNER S YOUTH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Luke 1:80 speaks concerning the youth of the Man-Savior s forerunner: And the young child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his presentation to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This verse mentions two things: that the forerunner became strong in spirit and that he was in the wilderness until the day he was presented to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The forerunner s mother and father were both filled with the Holy Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>41, 67 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, it was easy for their child to grow and become strong in his spirit, with the result that he lived in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For him to grow and become strong in spirit means that he was with God and for God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For him to live in the wilderness was to be away from man s culture and religion so that God might have a free and clear way to use him as the forerunner of the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As one who was born a priest, John, like Samuel, should have spent much time in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, as a New Testament Nazarite, John lived in the wilderness, not in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The wilderness is a place without culture, tradition, or religion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By living in the wilderness, John cut himself off from everything of his background.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was a Jew, but he did not live as a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was a priest, but he did not live as a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the contrary, the Lord s forerunner lived as an uncultured person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know from Matthew 3:3 that the forerunner of the Man-Savior began his ministry in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This implies that God intended His New Testament economy to begin in an absolutely new way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea Matt 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the initiation of God s New Testament economy, this preaching was not done in the holy temple within the holy city, where the religious and cultured ones worshipped God according to their scriptural ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, it began in the wilderness, in an uncultured way, not keeping any regulations of the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that the old way of the worship of God according to the Old Testament was repudiated, and a new way was about to be brought in.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word wilderness in Luke 1:80 and Matthew 3:1 and 3 indicates that the new way of God s New Testament economy is contrary to religion and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It also indicates that nothing old was left, and something new was about to be established.</S>
