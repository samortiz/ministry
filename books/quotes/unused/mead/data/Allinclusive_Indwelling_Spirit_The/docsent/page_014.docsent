   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although radio waves are everywhere in the air, the proper receiver must be used to prove that they are real.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is real, but we need to exercise the proper organ our human spirit to know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>People often come to a point in their lives when it seems that nothing can satisfy them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although we may have a good family, education, job, and financial situation, we will come to a point when we realize that there is still a hunger and thirst within that is not satisfied.</S>
