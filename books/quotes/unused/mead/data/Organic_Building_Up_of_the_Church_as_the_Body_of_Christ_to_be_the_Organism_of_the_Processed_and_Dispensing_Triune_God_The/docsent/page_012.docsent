   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INTRINSIC BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter one we saw the intrinsic essence of the church for its organic existence.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In chapter two we saw the intrinsic growth of the church for its organic increase.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter we want to see the intrinsic building up of the church for its organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A physical building is built by putting together and fitting together various materials.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a building, however, is lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not organic.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s building is organic, and the best example of such an organic building is a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A living person is a real building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God took a rib out of Adam s side and built that rib into a woman Gen 2:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This woman was a building.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God created Adam, the husband, but God did not create a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God built up a wife for Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The man was created by God, and the woman was built by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God s building work is finer than His creating work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man, as the one created by God, is rougher than the female, who was built by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Males are rough, and females are fine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A female s face, hands, voice, and actions are finer than the male s. The female is much finer, because she was built by God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God built up a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the brothers are males in the old creation, but we are females in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the new creation we are the bride of Christ; we are God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Body of Christ, the church, is a bride that was not created, but built up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God s building, of course, is much finer than a physical building.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church s building is organic by the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because it is organic, it is intrinsic.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anything that is intrinsic is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The building up of the church is typified by God s fine work of building a woman for man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The building up of the church is actually the growth of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every full-grown person began as a small baby.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The building up of that person over the years was accomplished by that person s growth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When he ate, he grew, and this growth was his organic building up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we mean business to have the church built up, we must take care of our growth in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means we must be those eating and drinking Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We grow with what we eat, and what we eat becomes our very constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We grow by what we eat, and what we eat eventually becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to eat more of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some Cantonese people eat six or seven times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How many times do we eat Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to learn of the Cantonese in our eating of the spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more times we eat Christ, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more we eat Christ, the more we grow in Christ, and the more we eat Christ, the more we become Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we eat Christ, we grow by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This growing is the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, what is built up is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, the built-up church is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By the Ascended Head Giving the Gifts</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The intrinsic building up of the church is by the ascended Head giving the gifts Eph 4:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Ephesians 4:8 says, Wherefore He says, Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may appreciate the Lord s coming down from the heavens, but we also need an uplifted appreciation of His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Ephesians 4:8, Paul points out that it is the ascended Christ who is able to give the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When Paul said that Christ ascended to the height, he quoted from Psalm 68:18.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Height in this verse refers to Mount Zion Psa 68:15-16 , symbolizing the third heaven, where God dwells 1 Kings 8:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Psalm 68 implies that it was in the ark that God ascended to Mount Zion after the ark had won the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 1 of Psalm 68 is a quotation of Numbers 10:35.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It indicates that the background of Psalm 68 is God s move in the tabernacle with the ark as its center.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Wherever the ark, a type of Christ, went, the victory was won.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Eventually, this ark ascended triumphantly to the top of Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This portrays how Christ has won the victory and ascended triumphantly to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In His ascension, Christ led captive those taken captive.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The redeemed saints had been taken captive by Satan before being saved by Christ s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We were captives under Satan s hand through sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But Christ defeated Satan, solved the problem of sin and death, and rescued us out of the hand of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then He led us to the heavens as His captives.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He took these captives and made them gifts to men.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>One of these gifts was Saul of Tarsus, who later became Paul, the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He had been a captive of Satan and a top sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In 1 Timothy 1:15 Paul said that he was the foremost sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He was a big captive of Satan under sin and death, but one day Christ rescued him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He was on the way to Damascus to arrest those who called on the Lord s name Acts 9:1-2, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then the Lord Jesus seized him and rescued him out of the hand of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Saul was Satan s captive, but he became Christ s captive.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Saul of Tarsus had been opposing Christ and devastating the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Suddenly he became a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Christ took this one and made him a gift by the name of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He became a gift who could expound the Old Testament, who could preach the gospel, teach the saints, and prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>How could Paul become such a gift?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He himself tells us with a parenthetical word in Ephesians 4:9-10: Now this, He ascended, what is it except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He who descended is the same who also ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Paul was a wonderful writer.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He wrote this portion in describing Christ s death and resurrection to accomplish His full redemption and impart life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Christ first descended to the earth from the heavenly throne in the third heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He did this through the process of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Then He entered into death, and in death He descended further.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the second step of His descension, He descended into the lower parts of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This refers to Hades, underneath the earth, where Christ went after His death Acts 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The first step of Christ s descension was for His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The second step was for His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>His descension was the means to accomplish His all-inclusive, full redemption, which has saved us from sin, death, Satan, and the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In the first step of His ascension, He ascended from Hades to the earth in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In His resurrection He imparted life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>His descension accomplished redemption, and His ascension accomplished the impartation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In the second step of His ascension, He brought us to the Father in the third heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When He ascended before His disciples into heaven Luke 24:51; Acts 1:9-11 , they did not fully understand what was going on.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>They only saw Jesus ascending.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But the Scriptures reveal that when Jesus was ascending, He was ascending with a train of vanquished foes.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Amplified New Testament renders He led a train of vanquished foes for He led captive those taken captive.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When He was ascending, He was a returning General who had won the victory over Satan, sin, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He defeated all of His enemies, and He had many captives.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He brought these captives with Him in a procession to celebrate His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Peter and John did not see this when the Lord ascended before their eyes, but the angels saw a tremendous and great train of vanquished foes as a procession for the celebration of Christ s victory.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We were there in that procession; Satan was there; and death was also there.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>What a procession that was!</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The Lord then presented us, the redeemed saints, His defeated and vanquished foes, as a present to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It is as though He said, Father, here are the persons You have given to Me. They were dead captives of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Now I have captured them; I rescued them out of the hand of Satan, out from under sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>I have also imparted My life into them through My resurrection, the first step of My ascension from Hades to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Now they are not dead, but living presents.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I give them all to You as a big, corporate present.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This present included all of the redeemed saints.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>It included Peter, Paul, Martin Luther, John Nelson Darby, and Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>I am honored to be included in this present.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We were all included there in Christ s ascension as a big, living present to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The Father, no doubt, was so happy.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>He could have said, I am so happy for My redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>They were dead and captured by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>But My Son, through His death and resurrection, rescued them and imparted life into them, making them living.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We all must realize that we have already been to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We were there with Christ, because He brought us, as His present, to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>He did not go empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>He went to the Father with all His redeemed ones, including you and me, as a corporate present to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>The Father then gave us back to the Son as gifts for His Body Psa 68:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Thus, through His descension and ascension, Christ rescued us, enlivened us, and made us gifts with His resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Paul was such a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Sometimes I have wondered how Paul received such great revelations, such as the revelation in Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Undoubtedly, Christ spent some particular time with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>After he was saved, Paul went to Arabia and stayed there for a period of time Gal 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>No one knows what he did there, but, no doubt, during this time there was much contact between him and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>I believe the Lord used this time to constitute Paul into a big gift to His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>When Paul returned from Arabia, he was able to preach and to speak wonderful things.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>That means he became a big gift to the church in the category of the gifted persons mentioned in Ephesians 4:11.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>This is why he was able to describe Christ s death and resurrection in the marvelous way of verses 8 through 10.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>We all should learn to preach the gospel in such a rich way as that portrayed in Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>We may speak in this way to our unbelieving contacts: I would like to tell you that our Savior descended in two steps.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>He descended from the heavens to the earth and then from the earth to Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>In the first step of His descension, He accomplished incarnation; He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>In the second step of His descension, He entered into death and even went into Hades, dying for us to save us from sin, death, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>As sinners, we were captives of Satan, but through the death of Christ we were forgiven and even rescued from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Then the Lord ascended from Hades to the earth in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>In His resurrection He imparted Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>He accomplished redemption through His death and life-impartation through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Then we were made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>In the second step of His ascension, He led us as a train of vanquished foes to the third heaven to give us as a present to His Father.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Sometimes we should preach the gospel in this way when we go out to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>During the time of the Roman Empire, when a general gained a victory, all his captives became a procession in the celebration of his victory.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Eventually, some of these captives were put to death, and some were given life 2 Cor 2:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>The ones in this procession who were put to death were Satan and his fallen angels, and the ones who were made alive were us, the redeemed saints.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>After we were presented to the Father as a present and the Father gave us back to the Son as gifts, the Son gave us all as gifts to His Body for its building up.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Every saint, great and small, is a gift to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Every member of the Body is a gift to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>We may be only a small member, like the little finger, but still we are very necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>My little finger works so well to comfort my ear when I have an itch inside of it.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>We should never consider ourselves as too small to be a profitable gift to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>The practice of Christianity with one man speaking and the others listening spoils the gifts and kills the functions of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>Some Christians in the denominations do not even know how to pray because their function has been annulled by the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>In this system, only the trained professionals learn how to function while the rest are laymen.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>There is a Chinese proverb which says, If you are sick, go to a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>If you have a lawsuit, go to a lawyer.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>If you want to pray, go to a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>According to the biblical revelation, however, all the believers should be living, functioning members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>I am so happy that, in the Lord s recovery, many of the new believers are able to pray for others.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>We are neither the clergy nor the laity, but the New Testament priests.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>Christ has made us such by His descension and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>He, as the Head of the Body, gave us as gifts to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>If someone were to ask us if we are gifts, each of us should declare, Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>I m a gift!</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>We were captives, sinners, and enemies of God, but through Christ s descension, we were redeemed and rescued from Satan out of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>Through His ascension, He imparted Himself into us as life, so now we are living.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>In His ascension He made us gifts to His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>Many of the saints can testify that I am a gift to them.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>In like manner, many of the saints are gifts to me.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>Many times I need the small gifts to comfort me in the way that my little finger can comfort my itching ear.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>We should not regard the newly baptized ones as burdens to us.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>They are new gifts to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>When we go out as New Testament priests of the gospel to visit people, we should have the assurance that we are going to gain more gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>These gifts are not only for Christ, but also for us.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>In 1977 I encouraged all of our young people to do their best to get a proper education.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>One young brother among us took my fellowship and went back to school.</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>Eventually, he graduated with a Ph.D. in linguistics and specialized in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='182' RSNT='1' SNO='182'>In these past few years, he has rendered a great amount of help to me in helping us to improve, to revise, our present Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='183' RSNT='1' SNO='183'>I was bearing a heavy burden to revise our version, but my knowledge of Greek is inadequate for this task.</S>
   <S PAR='184' RSNT='1' SNO='184'>This young brother, who took my fellowship twelve years ago to go back to school, has become a great gift to me.</S>
   <S PAR='185' RSNT='1' SNO='185'>He has been like an arm or a shoulder to me.</S>
   <S PAR='186' RSNT='1' SNO='186'>We all can be such gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='187' RSNT='1' SNO='187'>Thank the Lord for the gifts given by the ascended Head to His Body for its intrinsic building up.</S>
