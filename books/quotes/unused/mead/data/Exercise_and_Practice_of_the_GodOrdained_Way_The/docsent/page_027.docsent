   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Visiting Our Friends, Colleagues, and Schoolmates</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must also visit our friends, colleagues, and schoolmates.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everyone has a friend, a colleague, or a schoolmate.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you are teaching school, all the teachers and staff are your colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you are a student, you have many classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, we should try to build up a good feeling between ourselves and our colleagues or schoolmates.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then we can talk to them about Christ and make an appointment to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can ask them to give us a time to speak with them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They may try to avoid this, but if we are persistent, eventually they will give us a time to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then when you visit, it is always good to bring a saint with you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Using the Telephone to Make Appointments</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all must learn to use the telephone wisely.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The telephone can be very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today there are some telephone salesmen who make over a million dollars a year.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are constantly calling people, one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can use the telephone to make appointments with people to talk to them about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may even use the telephone book to call people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Simply pick a name and call: "Sir, I got your name from the phone book.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am a Christian who loves the Lord Jesus and would like to talk to you for a short time."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Most would reject you, but maybe three out of a hundred would receive you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then you can visit these three.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nearly every day my mailbox is full of business advertisements.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a bother to me, and I throw all of these advertisements away.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One day I asked, "Why do these businesses waste their money by printing and mailing all these things?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then I found out that if they receive only a one percent response, they will not lose any money.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Usually they will get a three percent response, and they make money.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not expect that every house will have a son of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, most doors will have wolves Luke 10:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In one night we may knock on twenty-five doors and meet nothing but wolves who reject us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This happened to many saints, but when they came to the last door, they got inside and found a son of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not know when we will find a son of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For a hundred and four weeks we may not get one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet the next day we may find a son of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We simply have to exercise our persistence, patience, and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I do not believe someone can go out continuously, regularly, once every week for fifty-two weeks, and still not catch one fish.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you are persistent, surely you will catch one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Jehovah's Witnesses and the Mormons do not have the way to make many appointments because they have a bad name.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not many would give them an appointment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But we are different; we are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can call people on the phone and tell them: "I am not a Mormon or a Jehovah's Witness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am a Christian loving the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Surely some will answer in a positive way, and this will open some doors.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Making Appointments by Purchasing Something</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a brother goes into a stationery store to buy some stationery, and there are no other customers in the store, he can buy something, and, of course, the salesman will be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You should not miss such an opportunity to speak to people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It may be good to have a card printed with your name, address, phone number, and something to indicate that you are a real Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then at such an opportunity, you can hand the salesman your card and say, "I would like to talk with you about Christ for only a few minutes."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not talk too much because that is his business time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Two minutes would be enough.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then say, "May I come to see you?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the way to make an appointment by purchasing something.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you are going to buy three things, do not buy all three things in one store.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Buy one thing at this store, and then go into the next store and try to make another appointment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Your purchase is the bait.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The sisters have to consider how many things they buy in a month.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There are many opportunities to speak Christ to people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All of these people are here for us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You may not have any intention to buy anything, but when you see a salesman standing there with nothing to do, you may buy a pair of socks for a few dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You can buy this in order to open his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Surely this is worthwhile; we are here for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Also, you may buy the socks in a size that would fit this salesman.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then after you purchase these socks, you may say: "Sir, my intention is not to buy the socks; it is to preach Christ to you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I would like to give this pair of socks to you as a gift."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This may seem like an odd thing, but it can stir up people's interest so that we can reach them with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to save some of our time for going out to reach people.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In whatever way we go, we must pray, "Lord, send me the best son of peace."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must believe that the Lord will answer this prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Also, if we pray, the Lord will give us many different ways to reach people.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should not be so legal.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must exercise our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When the sisters go to the beauty shop, they must go purposefully.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They should even go more often with the intention of talking to someone.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then all those who are working in the beauty salon would open their doors to these sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In this way, we can get some doors opened to us warmly.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Human beings are made by God for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As long as we can touch them, they will be saved, but do not expect to do a quick job.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must reach people with patience, gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we are faithful to the Lord every week, we have to believe that we will bring at least two to the Lord every year.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Each one of us can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It all depends upon our labor, persistence, endurance, and patience.</S>
