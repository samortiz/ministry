   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Female Slave of Pharaoh s Daughter</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Pharaoh s daughter saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her female slave to fetch it v. 5, Heb . Here we see the part played by a female slave.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This slave is the third female mentioned in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Again the name is not given in order to underscore God s intention of impressing us with the female life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Exodus 2 we see several females gathered about an ark in which a three-month-old baby boy had been laid.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Each of these females had a different function.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The function of the female slave was to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In particular, her service was fetching the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>D. Pharaoh s Daughter</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Pharaoh s daughter, the fourth female in this chapter, had her function also.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First she rescued Moses and then charged Moses mother to nurse him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later, when the child was brought to Pharaoh s daughter, he became her son.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water v. 10 . We know from Acts 7:21 that Pharaoh s daughter took him up and nurtured him as her own son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Exodus 2 we have a historical record, but in Acts 7 and Hebrews 11 we have a spiritual record.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, Acts 7:20 says that Moses was handsome to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that in the sight of God Moses was very comely.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His parents must have been godly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Possessing spiritual insight and discernment, they realized that Moses was a very promising child for God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, they hid him three months because they saw that he was a handsome child Heb 11:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The emphasis in Exodus 2 is not on the spiritual significance of Moses early life; it is on the important role played by the female life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although the writings of Moses are elsewhere very descriptive, in Exodus 2 he gives us a very simple record in order to impress us with the way God uses the female life in times of crisis.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During critical times, the only life that can be used by God is the female life that stands with God and is dependent upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are living in a critical time, a time when the female life is urgently needed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Anyone who presumes to be a male will become a Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All of us, including the brothers, need to be females.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In a critical time such as now, the male life that is independent of God is not useful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only the female life, the life that depends on God, is prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we see this, we shall have a great appreciation for the female life, the life that is wholly dependent on God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In chapter two God used a number of females to accomplish His purpose of preparing a savior.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One of these females, the mother of Moses, gave birth to him and nursed him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Another, his sister Miriam, watched over him when he was in the ark and served as a connecting link between Pharaoh s daughter and Moses mother.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The female slave fetched the ark, and Pharaoh s daughter raised Moses as her own son.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Probably she was also the one through whom Moses learned all the wisdom of the Egyptians Acts 7:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today we also need the various functions of the female life: the conceiving, bearing, and nursing function; the function of watching, recommending, and establishing the proper connections; the function of helping and serving; and the function of raising, teaching, and training.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Through four kinds of female life, Moses was born, raised, and trained for God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For the carrying out of His economy today, the Lord needs these four kinds of female life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He needs many mothers, daughters, female slaves, and royal princesses to make the preparations for the deliverance of His people so that they can fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THROUGH LEARNING THE WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>OF THE EGYPTIANS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Acts 7:22 says, Moses was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in his words and deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Under God s sovereignty, Moses learned all the Egyptian wisdom while staying in the royal palace as the son of Pharaoh s daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Through his Egyptian education, he became highly cultured and received the highest learning of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, he became mighty both in words and in deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, that was only the preparation on the natural side; he still needed the preparation on the spiritual side.</S>
