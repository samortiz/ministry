   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>An Individual Israel and a Corporate Israel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is also a second important comparison between the books of Genesis and Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Genesis an individual Israel was produced to express God and exercise His authority for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Exodus a corporate Israel was produced to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is more glorious than what we have in Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The individual Israel produced in Genesis bore God s image and expressed Him, and he represented God and exercised His authority on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By the time this individual Israel had come to maturity, he was actually more powerful than Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even Pharaoh was under his blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The corporate Israel produced in Exodus also bore the image of God and exercised His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must admit that the corporate Israel in Exodus is more glorious than the individual Israel in Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A Transforming Vision</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is urgent that we all see this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Such a vision, such a revelation, will revolutionize our concept, change our daily life, and even transform our being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This vision is very different from a teaching presented from a human point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What we need is a revelation from God s point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I believe that if you bring this concluding word to the Lord in prayer and consider it before Him, you will eventually have a clear view of these two books.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A Sketch of Genesis and Exodus</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I believe it would be helpful to present a brief sketch of Genesis and Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Genesis 1 we were created by God, and in Genesis 3 we became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then, after Babel, we were called with Abraham and became river-crossers, Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although we were called with Abraham, we became dead and also enslaved to serve Satan s purpose in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then one day we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The calling was with Abraham in Genesis, but the saving was through Christ as the Passover lamb in Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Having been redeemed by the Passover lamb, we traveled through the wilderness and experienced Christ as the heavenly manna and enjoyed Him as the living water out of the cleft rock.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, we were brought to Mount Sinai, and it is here that we have the church life, typified by the living of the children of Israel around the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even if not all of us have entered into the tabernacle, we all are gathered around the tent of meeting, and we can see the cloud on the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here there is no sin, no death, and no world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here at the tent of meeting we have God in His presence and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we become His dwelling, and He becomes our dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With the tent of meeting what we have is not merely an individual expression; we have a people as God s corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The goal of God s purpose is to have such an expression through His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This expression is the goal not only of God s redemption, but also of His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What God desires is to have a corporate expression of Himself through His called and redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Recovery and God s Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to be deeply impressed that the Lord s recovery is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are here in the recovery not merely for spirituality, holiness, victory, or blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, we are here for God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The books of Genesis and Exodus consummate with God s tabernacle, His dwelling place, filled with glory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In like manner, the entire Bible will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal tabernacle, a tabernacle filled with glory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the church life as God s dwelling place we have the leading and guidance of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is one with us, and we are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now we are in the proper position to hear the Lord s voice, His speaking, as recorded in Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We thank the Lord for what we have seen in the books of Genesis and Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have the full assurance that those who have been with us throughout the years can never be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eternity will reveal what the Lord has been doing within us and among us for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Praise Him for the glorious conclusion of the book of Exodus!</S>
