   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EATING THE LAMB-BREAD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Praise the Lord for the day we received the Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Him was life John 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The tree of life is good for food, and Jesus as the bread of life is also good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The best way to receive Jesus as the bread of life into us is by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are a living container.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We received Jesus into us by eating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have been eating for about seventy years, but I never really understood the right meaning of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Recently I have learned something about eating in a scientific way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When anything is eaten, it is digested and assimilated into the blood system.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, what is eaten becomes the very cells and organic tissues of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It simply becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The dieticians tell us that we are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are composed of all the elements we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is the same spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we eat Jesus all the time, we will be composed with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God made man as His container with His image, and then He put this living container before a tree symbolizing Himself as life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There man was to take God in by the way of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Word tells us that the tree of life was good for food Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The only way to take anything into us in order that it might become us is by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is good for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is edible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God presented Himself to man in the form of food.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s first attempt to cause man to take Him in as food was a failure because of man s unfaithfulness in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man did not eat of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and fell.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For this cause God Himself became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He came to redeem man by putting Himself through a process.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He has been processed for us to take Him in. God again came in the form of food to man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In His first attempt God presented Himself to man in the form of food.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In His second attempt, He did the same.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, there was a difference between the first and second attempt.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In a sense, the tree of life did not need any processing, but the bread of life does.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Genesis 2, He was the tree of life, ready to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But in John 6 as the bread of life, a process is necessary, for man had fallen, and there was the need of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Redemption is a kind of process.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the book of Exodus, the Passover lamb had to be processed in a certain way before it could be eaten Exo 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The lamb was killed and the blood was shed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then the blood was struck on the door post and the meat of the lamb eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God instructed that the lamb must be roasted with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a process of cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Through the cross, Jesus has been processed that we might take Him in by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This eating includes redemption, for the processing includes the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>John 6 troubled me for many years, for Jesus firstly said that He was the bread of life John 6:35 , but eventually He said that we must eat His flesh and drink His blood John 6:53 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What kind of bread is this?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Bread is something of the vegetable life, and blood is of the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But today I am clear.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ has many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In one aspect He is the bread, and in another aspect He is the lamb with the flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So eventually He is the Lamb-bread.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ is the Lamb-bread, processed and good for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we eat this One we receive the remission of sins and the imparting of life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His blood washes away all the negative things, and His life imparts into us everything positive.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>BLOOD AND WATER</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we come to the end of the Bible, the tree of life appears again.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The tree of life was there in the beginning, and seemed to be taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But eventually it appears again.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This time it is seen growing in a flow of living water that proceeds out of the throne of God and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life Rev 22:1-2a .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Who is the Lamb?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We know that this is the redeeming One.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But in eternity, the blood does not flow.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this picture it is the living water that flows out of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the Lord was on the cross, two things flowed out of His side: blood and water John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Blood is for redemption, and water is for imparting life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we get into eternity, we will still see that Christ is the Lamb, but at that time we will not need the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We will only need the water.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The blood came first to wash us, and the water followed to impart life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In eternity, Christ is still the Lamb, but we do not need the blood any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Satan, and all the trouble he caused, for which we needed the blood, will then be in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All the negative and sinful things will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We will not need the blood, but we will still need the water of life with the tree of life growing in it.</S>
