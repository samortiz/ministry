   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When God determined that the purpose of decreeing the law had been attained and that the law had been used to its full extent, that is, at the fullness of the time Gal 4:4 , He became flesh, thus terminating the dispensation of law and inaugurating the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At that time, God again changed the way of His work of the new creation on the man of the old creation by replacing the demand of the law with the supply of grace.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The dispensation of grace began with the Triune God becoming flesh in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In eternity past, this One who became flesh was the eternal Word who was with God John 1:1-2 , the only begotten Son who expressed God John 1:18 , and the Author of life Acts 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In time, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit of God in the womb of a chaste virgin and was born as a God-man Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20 , who is both the complete God Rom 9:5 and the perfect Man Matt 1:1 .</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is the entire Triune God becoming the complete Man, bringing God into man, that is, bringing God Himself to man to be enjoyed as grace and to be received as reality John 1:17 , thus replacing the law of the previous dispensation.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The law is only a testimony of what God is Exo 25:21 ; reality is the realization of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, reality is God realized, and grace is God enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.</S>
