Revelation 19:9</H2><P>"And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they who are called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true words of God." </P><P>This verse shows us clearly that some are invited (like the five wise virgins) and that these are blessed. This city is the bride of the Lamb, and only those saints who are invited and have their own righteousnesses as their garment can enjoy the glory and the beauty of the city. (These righteousnesses are also the very glory and beauty of this new city.) They have a foretaste of all the glory and beauty of this city.</P><P>"These are the true words of God." This appears two more times, in 21:5 and 22:6. It is written to call our attention especially to what has just been said. Some may think that it is a small thing to be raptured; however, only those who attend the marriage of the Lamb have a portion in the kingdom. Those who are not invited cannot partake of the kingdom. This marriage dinner must be something that is only for the overcoming believers. This matches the promise in Revelation 3:20, because both 3:20 and 19:9 talk about dining.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Revelation 19:10</H2><P>"And I fell before his feet to worship him. And he said to me, Do not do this. I am your fellow slave and a fellow slave of your brothers who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy."</P><P>Angels are servants of God, and so are we. It is a great temptation to worship created things. "The spirit of the prophecy" is "the spirits of the prophets" in 1 Corinthians 14:32, because prophets are those who prophesy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE WAR AT ARMAGEDDON<br>(REVELATION 19:11-21)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 19:11</H2><P>"And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war." </P><P>The marriage of the Lamb is now over, and the Lord comes to the earth with His people. "Faithful and True" are names of the Lord in reference to His second coming, and they reveal His relationship to the world. In chapter one, the church is to view things from the Lord's eyes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Revelation 19:12</H2><P>"And His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems, and He has a name written which no one knows but Himself."</P><P>The "diadems," or crowns, here are stacked layer upon layer without end; this is how He can wear many crowns. The "name" here is a special name. The Lord promises the overcomers in the church in Pergamos a name which no man knows (Rev. 2:17). Therefore, the special name that the Lord receives must also be given to Him by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Revelation 19:13</H2><P>"And He is clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and His name is called the Word of God."</P><P>"He is clothed with a garment dipped in blood." The garment is not dipped in blood in the heavens, but on the earth during the fighting. This is the description of the war at Armageddon; it matches what is recorded in Isaiah 63:1-6.</P><P>The expression "the Word of God" is used only by John, showing that John wrote this book.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Revelation 19:14</H2><P>"And the armies which are in heaven followed Him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and clean." </P><P>Those who follow the Lamb are the same as the called and chosen and faithful in 17:14. By this time, the standing of every Christian has been decided. Only those who are invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb may enter into the kingdom because:</P><P>(1) The clothing of the bride is the righteousnesses of the saints.</P><P>(2) The righteousnesses of the saints are the glory and beauty of the new city.</P><P>(3) All those who are invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb must have "the righteousnesses of the saints." All those who descend with the Lord are those who have been invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb. Hence, all who enter the kingdom have been invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb.</P><P>(4) The Lord said, "Until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God" (Mark 14:25). This shows that the dinner is held in the kingdom.</P><P>(5) The dining in Revelation 3:20 matches that of Revelation 19:9.</P><P>(6) Being invited is different from dining. Only those who are invited may partake of the dinner.</P><P>(7) The "blessed" in Revelation 19:9 correspond to the "blessed" in 20:6.</P><P>(8) In the kingdom, the New Jerusalem is the bride. In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem is the wife of the Lamb. However, in 21:9 it still bears the likeness of a bride.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_069.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_071.html">Next</a> </body></html>
