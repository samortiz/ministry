The matter of giving and receiving material things is very practical. Our Christian life and church service must be filled with giving and receiving. We should not store up for ourselves all the things we receive from God. Rather, we must give to others, passing on what we have and caring for others. If we are not this kind of believer, we are wrong. If with regard to material possessions we are defeated, we are not spiritual believers but fleshly or soulish. If the Lord would give us a certain amount of money, we should give to others to take care of the Body. Even giving and receiving is a matter of the Body life.<p>In dealing with material possessions, we must learn to pray, seek the Lord&#8217;s guidance, and take care of the situation in the Body and of the saints&#8217; needs. We must be concerned for the Lord&#8217;s children and His Body to the extent that if we receive a certain amount of money, we would give some to others and then spend the rest, not for ourselves but for the Body.<p>According to verse 2, we should offer our gifts on the first day of the week. This is the eighth day, which signifies resurrection. That we make our offering on the day of resurrection indicates that our giving should be done in resurrection. We should not offer in an old way but in a new way. We should not offer in the principle of the seventh day, which represents the old creation, but in the principle of the first day, which symbolizes the newness of resurrection. Even if we give something on the Lord&#8217;s Day, in the sight of God it still may not be in the principle of the Lord&#8217;s Day. It may be something of the first day of the old week, in waste, emptiness, and darkness (Gen. 1:2). There may be no life or light in that giving. This is to add &#8220;honey&#8221; to our offerings, which is the sweetness of the flesh and of our old nature in our friendliness with others. This is wrong. We must offer whatever the Lord gives as a surplus in material things in the way of resurrection. The flesh and the old creation must be thoroughly dealt with.<p>Sometimes we may pass on good things to our intimate relatives in order to meet a particular need. Although this may be according to the guidance of the Lord, there may be no imparting of life. Rather, we should be willing to give our surplus to the co-workers, to the Lord&#8217;s servants, and to the Lord&#8217;s people with whom we have no relationship in the flesh, but with whom there is a real relationship in the Body. We give to others not because we love them in a natural way or out of a friendship or relationship, but because of the Lord&#8217;s burden, interest, and work. We give not in the old creation but in the new creation, not on the seventh day but on the eighth day. In principle, we give on the Lord&#8217;s Day.<p>Here again, even in the matter of giving and receiving, our self must be dealt with by the cross. We must give all the ground to Christ and give all the praise to Him as our Head. Then our giving will be done in the proper way. Of course, literally speaking, the Christians in the ancient time came together on the Lord&#8217;s Day to meet. This is the literal meaning of the Lord&#8217;s Day, but there is a spiritual meaning as well, which is that we do nothing in the way of old religion.<p>In the foregoing eleven cases, there are spiritual persons, soulish persons, fleshly persons, and fleshy persons. We can apply these four conditions to all the persons in this book.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
