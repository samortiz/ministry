   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PROVERBS MESSAGE EIGHT USING PROVERBS FOR BUILDING UP THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Rom 8:20-21, 23; 1 Pet 1:18-19; Eph 4:30; 2 Cor 4:16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message I would like to give a further word regarding the proper way to receive and to use the book of Proverbs.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE POSITION OF PROVERBS,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ECCLESIASTES, AND SONG OF SONGS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE BOOKS OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible was breathed out by God through more than forty different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The sequence of the sixty-six books of the Bible was arranged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to this sequence, God put Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs together and placed them immediately before the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are two ministries in the Old Testament: the ministry of law, represented by Moses, and the ministry of the prophets, represented by Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs are placed at the end of the section of the law, just before the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do these books belong to the law or to the prophets?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I would say that they belong to the section of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In particular, Proverbs may be considered a subsidiary, or a helper, to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>WISDOM, VANITY, AND SATISFACTION</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Solomon, the writer of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs, was the last writer in this section.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God raised him to the highest peak of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What he was, what he had, and what he did were unparalleled.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is hard to believe that eventually he became degraded to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These three books were written by Solomon, the last two after his degradation, repentance, and return to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of these three books, the first is on wisdom; the second, on vanity; and the third, on satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Proverbs is on the real wisdom, and Ecclesiastes is on the real meaning of the human life under the sun, which is vanity of vanities, a chasing after wind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Song of Songs is the satisfaction of satisfactions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Apart from Christ, there is no satisfaction in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The unique Christ, the embodiment of God, is the unique satisfaction not only to man but to the entire universe, which has been made subject to vanity Rom 8:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fact that the creation is now subject to vanity means that everything under the sun is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is realized as the compounded, sevenfold, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indwelling One is our subjective satisfaction.</S>
