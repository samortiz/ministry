   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN THE GOOD LAND AND THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gal 3:14; 4:6; 5:16-18, 25; 6:18; Eph 1:13, 17; 2:18-22; 3:5, 16-17a; 4:4, 23, 30; 5:18; 6:17-18a; Phil 1:19-20; 2:1; Col 3:16; 1 Cor 5:7; 10:4; Col 1:12; 2:6; 3:11; Eph 3:8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There may be a bountiful spread on the dining table, a sampling of the riches of America.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is another matter, however, for those riches to be realized by us in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The same is true with regard to our enjoyment of Christ as the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The key to experiencing Him is to be found in the two spirits, which are mentioned in most of the verses given above.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE BLESSING OF ABRAHAM</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Galatians 3:14 tells us, "In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The promise that God gave to Abraham, in the New Testament economy has come to us through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is this blessing that was promised to Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is the Spirit, as this verse clearly tells us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But, you may ask, was it not the good land which was promised to Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yes, Abraham was surely promised the good land Gen 12:7; 13:15, 17; 15:18; 17:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This promise was repeated to his son Isaac Gen 26:3 and to his grandson Jacob 28:13; 35:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, in Galatians 3 Paul interprets the good land as the blessing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Old Testament promise was of the good land, but in the New Testament fulfillment the promise becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Have you ever realized that the Spirit whom you have received is the good land?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"And because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Gal 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Spirit sent by God is the blessing promised to Abraham for his descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We today in Jesus Christ are by faith the descendants of Abraham and the heirs of God's promise 3:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may say, then, that the good land has been sent to us!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What need is there for us to go to the Holy Land for a sight-seeing tour; the good land is within us!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is where we are walking and living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is a further inference of the Spirit as the good land in Galatians 5:25: "If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The good land was the type of the all-inclusive Christ, and Christ in His resurrection became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This Spirit has been dispensed into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here we receive life by Him, and we are to walk by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>See also Galatians 6:18, where we find that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE TWO SPIRITS IN EPHESIANS 1</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ephesians speaks further of the Spirit and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1:13 we are told, "You were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Earlier in chapter one it says that God has blessed us, or spoken well of us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit's sealing of us is the reaching stage of God's well-speaking of us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When a paper, for example, has a seal stamped upon it, this indicates that the paper has been reached by the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Triune God is rich, but God did not reach us as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nor did He ultimately reach us as the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yes, the Son came to us, but He did not come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was the Spirit who entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Triune God reaches us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Father, Son, and Spirit all reach us in the sealing with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A seal is fixed and lasting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now that God has reached you, He remains with you and will never leave.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When a seal has been affixed to a paper, the two cannot be separated; they become one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do you realize that the Triune God has reached you in the Spirit and made Himself one with you?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The seal of the Spirit is also the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Corporations use a seal, which may vary in size, to authenticate their documents.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is the size of our seal?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is the size of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No one can take the good land away from us, because it seals us, making us one with God and Him one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Ephesians 1:17 Paul prays "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Spirit in this verse refers to the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the one hand, the Spirit is within us, yet, on the other hand, our spirit needs to be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need a spirit of wisdom and revelation that we may realize this sealing Spirit, who is the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>That you are saved I have no doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But, sorry to say, I do not have the confidence that you realize what you have received with your salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You have received the blessing promised to Abraham!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This blessing is the good land; it is Christ as the Spirit, who has sealed you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For this to be real to you, you need the spirit of wisdom and revelation for which Paul prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Are you living in the good land?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you are, you are living in your spirit, enjoying the Spirit as the good land.</S>
