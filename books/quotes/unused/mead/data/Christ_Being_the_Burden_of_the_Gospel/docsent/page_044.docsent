   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE KEY TO SALVATION BELIEVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The key to salvation is believing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we believe, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are no further requirements such as not playing mah-jongg or not drinking alcohol.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Neither do we have to control our temper after we believe in order to have the assurance of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If this were true, no one would be able to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When it comes to our salvation, the key is to not add anything after the word believe .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The simple way is the best way believe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we add additional requirements, such as not watching movies or not drinking alcohol, the devil, who is very subtle, will use this concept to cause us to question our salvation, and this will hinder us from praising and thanking the Lord for His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even when we speak of just believing in the Lord, the devil can come to bother us, saying, What if your faith is not firm?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What if your faith cannot endure?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even though we have believed, the devil has many ways to shut our mouths and cause us to doubt our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Confessing that we are saved is a critical matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must hold fast to the word in the Bible that we are saved as soon as we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we go to a movie, we should repent, but then we must say, Thank the Lord, I am saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we say this, the movie will be under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is an amazing thing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even though the devil reminds us of our old habits of drinking alcohol and playing mah-jongg, we need to say to the devil, Even if you put all the alcohol in the world in front of me, I have believed in Jesus, and I am saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we confess this with boldness, alcohol and mah-jongg will be under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This acknowledgment, this living faith, this living confession, connects us to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When an electrician comes to install an electrical lamp, he simply puts the electric bulb into the socket of the lamp; once it is connected to the electrical source, the lamp shines immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The only thing that matters is the connection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have heard the gospel and have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nothing more is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even though Satan does not want to let us go, we have been connected to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not allow the devil to distract us with matters in the past or in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All these matters are in the Lord s hands.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since we have believed in the Lord, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the Word says that we are saved, we also should say, I am saved, and I am in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This simple confession is quite powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is nothing simpler than receiving the Lord s salvation.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Believing solves all of our problems before God.</S>

   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When people ask us whether or not we have eternal life, it may seem humble and polite to say, I do not dare say that I have eternal life, but if we say this, we are actually making God a liar.</S>
