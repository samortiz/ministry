<h1 class=msg>Lesson Four</h1><h1 class=msg>THE STATUS OF THE CHURCH (2)</h1><h1 class=msg>THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><h2 class=head2>Scripture Reading</h2><h1 class=scripture>Eph. 4:4; 1:22-23; 5:23; 1 Cor. 12:12-13, 15, 21; Eph. 3:8, 19; Col. 3:11; John 6:48, 57, 63</h1><h2 class=head2>Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Christ being the Head</li><li>We being the members of the Body of Christ</li><li>The Body receiving from the Head</li><li>The fullness (expression) of Him who fills all in all</li><li>The fullness (expression) of God</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Text</h2><p>[The organism of the Triune God is a Body (Eph. 4:4). The very abstract and mysterious God has an organism. God is invisible, yet He has a visible organism, the Body of Christ. The church as the Body of Christ is for His fullness, His expression. The definition of the church as the fullness of Christ may be illustrated by a cup that is filled with water to the extent that it overflows with water. The water within the cup is seen and expressed when it overflows from the cup. The overflow of the water is the fullness of the water, and the fullness of the water is the expression of the water that is inside the cup. John 1:16 says, “For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.’’ We received of the fullness of the incarnated Christ who came as grace and truth (v. 17). The Word became flesh, and He was full of grace and truth (v. 14). The fullness of grace and truth is the fullness of the incarnated Christ. To fill a cup with water until it overflows is to have “water upon water.’’ The Lord Jesus was full of grace, grace upon grace. Of His fullness we all have received, grace upon grace. The fullness is the expression of the riches. A person’s body is his fullness, his expression. A husky American man who has enjoyed so much of the rich foodstuffs of America, the riches of America, may be considered as the fullness of America, the expression of America. The church as the Body of Christ is the expression, the fullness, of Christ.]<p>The church is the Body of Christ. Jesus Christ, being the embodiment of the Triune God, is rich in all that God is. He is also rich in what He has gone through and accomplished. He is wonderful and marvelous. Such a universally great Person needs an equally wonderful and marvelous Body to contain and express Him. After He went through His process and ascended to heaven, He became the Head of the church, His Body. The church therefore is universally great having the Head on the throne in the heaven and the Body on the earth expressing the Head as His fullness.
