   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the last item concerning Christ as everything in God's intention Christ in the Christian life or Christ in the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Christians, or in the Christian life, we should not have anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ must be everything in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One day in 1933 the Lord opened my eyes to see that Christ is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many times the saints came to me to praise someone by saying that he was humble or lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But after 1933 whenever I heard this kind of praise about a person, I always had a question within me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What do you mean by being humble?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What do you mean by being lovely?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you mean that here is a part of the old Adam that is so humble?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Or here is a man in Adam who is so lovely?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The real humility and loveliness of a Christian must be Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our love toward others must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our patience, our humility, our wisdom, our knowledge, and our insight must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, we were not born in Christ, of Christ, or with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What we had originally was absolutely out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But now we have been born of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet still something of the old nature remains with us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have Christ and the old Adam as well.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can even be humble and nice by the old Adamic life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In China I saw some people who were taught, educated, by the teachings of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They were really nice and lovely, but there was nothing of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our humility and loveliness must not be something of the old life but something of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Christian life must be a life which is Christ Himself expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers and sisters, I think I have given you a picture of the centrality and universality of Christ in a very brief way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Godhead Christ is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In God's eternal purpose Christ is the Head, the center, and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In God's creation Christ is everything, and everything is for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In God's new creation, that is, in the church, the Body of Christ, Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And in the Christian life, that is, in us Christians, Christ must be everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now let us look at the situation of Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is very little of Christ in today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, Christianity is full of three categories of things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First, today's Christianity is full of forms and regulations, and it is organized as a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Second, today's Christianity is full of doctrines, knowledge, teachings, and theology.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once I met a person who spoke with me about justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But I found out that he himself had not been justified, though he was so much for justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is because he had the doctrine of justification by faith but he did not have the living person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you have Christ, you are justified.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you do not have Christ, you are not justified.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Someone may have a doctor's degree in divinity and yet not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is full of doctrines but void of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes people asked me, "Brother Lee, do you believe in absolute grace?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I said, "I believe in the very Christ who is grace itself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What do you believe?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You believe in the doctrine of grace, but do you have grace?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Who is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Who is the all-inclusive grace?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Who is the absolute grace?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Brothers and sisters, we must see that grace is a living person, not a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Grace is Christ Himself John 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You can teach grace and even fight for the doctrine of grace, yet you do not have grace if you do not have the living person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You may not have the word grace in your vocabulary or dictionary, but if you have the reality of Christ, you have the reality of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is not a matter of doctrine but a matter of the living Christ to be realized by you.</S>
