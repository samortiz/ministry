<h1 class="title">THE COMPLETE GOSPEL<br />
AND THE MANIFESTATION<br />
OF THE GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOUR GOSPELS CONTAINING<br />
A TRANSITIONAL GOSPEL</h2>
<p>We must discern the difference between the gospel preached in the four Gospels and the gospel preached in Acts. When the Lord Jesus sent His disciples to preach the gospel during His earthly ministry prior to His crucifixion, it was mainly to heal the sick, cast out demons, and proclaim that the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near, that is, to tell people that the age was changing from the Old Testament age of law to the New Testament age of grace (Matt. 10:5-8; Mark 6:7-13; Luke 9:1-2, 6). At that time the reality of the gospel, that is, the life contained in the gospel, was not yet available (cf. John 7:39).</p>
<p>We may say that the gospel preached in the four Gospels was preparatory and transitional; it was to bring people out of the age of the law of letters into the age of the grace of life. This transitional period included healing, casting out demons, and the proclamation that the age of law would soon be over because the age of grace would soon begin. Thus, there was a focus on the need for grace and life, not the law of letters. The three and a half years of the Lord&rsquo;s earthly ministry were a transitional period; they were not a period fully according to letter or to life, because the reality of life was coming but had not yet come.</p>
<p>In order for life to become man&rsquo;s reality, the Lord Jesus had to be raised from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit so that He could enter into all who believe in Him (1 Cor. 15:45). Only when the Lord Jesus became the life-giving Spirit and entered into those who believed in Him to be their life could the life in the gospel become a reality. The gospel that was preached after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection did not focus on healing, casting out demons, or proclaiming doctrines; this gospel concerned Christ as the reality of life coming into man. The preaching of this gospel began in Acts and resulted in men receiving Christ&rsquo;s life and becoming members in the Body of Christ (12:12-13).</p>
<p>We need to discern the difference between the gospel preached in the four Gospels and the gospel preached in Acts. The gospel preached in the four Gospels was mainly related to healing the sick and delivering man from the bondage of demons; it did not yet possess the reality of life regenerating man. Regrettably, Christians preach mainly the gospel contained in the four Gospels; they have not yet entered into the gospel of life. This is to take a step backward, to go back in time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ROMANS REVEALING THE COMPLETE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>In addition to the four Gospels, Acts and Romans can also be considered as gospels. The Epistle to the Romans can be called the &ldquo;Gospel to the Romans&rdquo; because the gospel of God is the subject of Romans. The gospel preached in this book is the complete gospel. Therefore, in the first verse of chapter 1 Paul says, &ldquo;Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated unto the gospel of God.&rdquo; The book of Romans is on the gospel of God; it is the complete gospel of God for man.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the four Gospels do not contain the complete gospel, whereas Romans contains the complete gospel. The gospel revealed in Romans can be divided into four sections. These four sections can be compared to four stations along a journey. After passing through these four stations, we reach our destination. There are sixteen chapters in Romans, and each station consists of four chapters.</p>
<p>The first station includes chapters 1 through 4 and ends with justification. The second station includes chapters 5 through 8 and ends with sanctification. This indicates that after people are justified by faith, they need to be sanctified. The third station includes chapters 9 through 12 and ends with the Body of Christ. This indicates that those who have been justified and sanctified need to be transformed in order to become the Body of Christ. The fourth station includes chapters 13 through 16 and ends with the local churches. Chapter 16 uses the words <em>church</em> or <em>churches</em> five times: the church in Cenchrea (v. 1); the church that was in the house of Prisca and Aquila (vv. 3-5), which was the church in Rome; the churches of the Gentiles (v. 4); the churches of Christ (v. 16); and the whole church (v. 23). This clearly indicates that without the local churches, the Body of Christ is not practical and has no way to be expressed. Hence, Romans presents the complete gospel, which includes justification, sanctification, the Body of Christ, and the church expressed locally. This is the complete gospel.</p>
<p>Justification concerns our outward position. Sanctification concerns the operation of life within us. Romans 1 through 3 reveals that we were sinners under God&rsquo;s condemnation but that when we repented and believed in the redemption of Christ, we were justified in Christ (3:24, 26). Then our position changed from one of being condemned to one of being justified. Through justification we can stand before God, we are in a position to receive grace, and we are qualified to enjoy all God&rsquo;s riches. Furthermore, we have been reconciled to God; there are no problems between us and God. This is signified in Luke 15:22 by the robe that was put on the prodigal son when he returned home.</p>
<p>The prodigal son was far away from his father and in a miserable position. When he repented and returned home, his father put a robe on him so that he could stand before him and be fully reconciled to him. However, putting the robe on merely solved the prodigal son&rsquo;s positional problem; he was still hungry. Consequently, the father said to his slaves, &ldquo;Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry&rdquo; (v. 23). Eating the fattened calf was a further step, because the prodigal son received the inward enjoyment of life after the problem of his outward position was resolved. Romans 5 through 8 concerns the matter of enjoying Christ, that is, of eating the fattened calf. The fattened calf signifies Christ as our life. When we enjoy Christ, He becomes our life. This life sanctifies us and causes us to grow in life. It also conforms us to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son so that Christ might be the Firstborn among many brothers (8:29). John 12:24 says that Christ is the grain of wheat that fell into the ground to die and became many grains in resurrection. These grains are the sons of God. Christ is the Firstborn, and we are the many sons. As the many sons, we bear the likeness of the Firstborn because we have the life of the Firstborn and the riches of the Firstborn.</p>
<p>The first station in Romans is justification. Here sinners receive a new position and are qualified to enjoy God&rsquo;s riches. The second station in Romans is sanctification. The sanctifying life makes man the same as Christ according to His life and image. Christ is the grain of wheat that produced us, the many grains. He is the only begotten Son who became the Firstborn to produce us, the many sons. As the many sons, we are blended together into one Body, just as many grains are blended together into one loaf. This brings us to the third station&mdash;the Body of Christ. We who are many are one Body in Christ (1 Cor. 10:17). However, the Body is spiritual and abstract; hence, it needs a practical expression, a manifestation. This expression is the local churches in Romans 16. Therefore, the fourth station in Romans is the local churches. The church expressed in each locality is the manifestation of the Body of Christ. This is the complete gospel revealed in Romans.</p>
<p>Christianity, however, does not know this complete gospel. Fundamental Christianity emphasizes doctrines, and the Pentecostal movement stresses speaking in tongues; furthermore, to some extent both practice healing and the casting out of demons. Neither fundamental Christianity nor the Pentecostal movement preaches the gospel in Romans but rather the gospel in the four Gospels. The gospel that most Christians preach may be considered as a transitional gospel, not the complete gospel. The saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must faithfully preach the gospel in Romans in order to arrive at the destination. We must ask ourselves which gospel we preach. In other words, do we preach the gospel of casting out demons, healing, performing miracles, and expounding doctrines, or do we preach the gospel of life by announcing the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel? In Ephesians 3:8 Paul says, &ldquo;To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.&rdquo; This indicates that Paul did not preach the gospel of casting out demons, healing, performing miracles, or expounding doctrines; he preached the dispensing of the unsearchable riches of Christ.</p>
<p>We need a clear vision of the gospel in Romans. This gospel includes justification, sanctification, the Body of Christ, and the local churches; it begins with sinners and ends with the local churches. Romans 1 states that fallen mankind is under God&rsquo;s condemnation; hence, everyone is a sinner. However, through the processes of justification, sanctification, and transformation, these sinners become the Body of Christ. Finally, chapter 16 does not speak of sinners, for the believers have become a local church manifested in a locality to be God&rsquo;s corporate expression. This is the complete gospel revealed in Romans, and it is the gospel that Paul preached.</p>
<p>If we preach the gospel that was announced in the four Gospels, we will remain in the transitional period. Although the transitional period is better than the age of law, it is not fully in the age of grace, and it cannot reach the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation. However, if we preach the gospel in Romans, we are in the age of grace, and we will advance station by station in the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
