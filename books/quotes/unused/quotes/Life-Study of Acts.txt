As we come to the book of Acts, we need to realize that both this book and the Gospel of Luke were written by the same person
The Gospel of Luke has a broad span covering all the matters of the wonderful Person of the God-man from His conception to His ascension
We may say that the Man-Savior's conception was His coming down not only from the heavens but also from God the Father
Through His conception and birth He became a Person who is both divine and human, both God the Creator and man, a creature
The angels praised God and said, 'Glory in the highest places to God, and on earth peace among men of His good pleasure'
As such a wonderful Person, the Lord Jesus lived on earth as a man with all the human virtues expressing the divine attributes
As we pointed out in the Life-study of Luke, Christ's ascension was His inauguration, His initiation, into His heavenly ministry
Christs ascension was not the termination of His activity instead it was His initiation into further activity His ministry in the heavens
The first book written by Luke, his Gospel, describes the Lord's first initiation and His life and ministry on earth
My burden in this message is to point out the position of the book of Acts in the arrangement of the contents of the Scriptures
We should not be bothered by this, since there are many different ways of dividing, or arranging, the books of the Bible
The present way of dividing the New Testament books emphasizes the crucial importance of the book of Acts in the New Testament
In heaven Jesus sitting, Christ the Lord is there enthroned; As the man by God exalted, With God's glory He is crowned
God in Him on earth was humbled, God with man was domiciled; Man in Him in heav'n exalted, Man with God is reconciled
A man is now in heaven As the Lord of all enthroned; This is Jesus Christ our Savior, With God's glory ever crowned!
In the book of Luke we see a man living on earth full of the human virtues, yet He expressed the divine nature with the divine attributes
With this One God was expressed in a human being, for the life He lived was the mingling of divinity and humanity
His living was His ministry to accomplish what had been prophesied and typified concerning Him in the Old Testament
After accomplishing in full God's purpose through His all-inclusive death, Christ walked out of death and rose up from the tomb
After accomplishing eternal redemption, He came forth out of death, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit
Economically the Lord Jesus is now in the heavens as the glorified One, and essentially He is in His disciples as their life
Hallelujah for the One who is both within His disciples essentially and on the throne in the heavens economically!
The way to answer this question is to say, 'Essentially Christ is in us, and economically He is on the throne in the heavens
As we study Acts we need to have the view of the Lord Jesus as the One who is on the throne economically and within us essentially
If we do not have the proper understanding of Acts, we shall not be able to understand the Epistles adequately
In the foregoing message we pointed out that the book of Acts may be considered the dividing line, or the 'backbone,' of the New Testament
In Acts we have the propagation of the completed Redeemer and His accomplished redemption for the producing of the churches
The fact that Christ is now in ascension means not only that He is in the heavens; it also means that He has power and authority
According to Matthew 28:18, the resurrected Christ said to His disciples, 'All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth'
Napoleon, after he had been defeated, reportedly looked up to the heavens and confessed that Jesus had beaten him
The point here is that the whole earth is in the hands of the undefeatable One, and this One is carrying out His propagation
Concerning the kingdom, we should not follow the teachings of those who claim that the kingdom of God is not present today
By now we should be impressed with the subject of the book of Acts, a book that stands as the backbone of the New Testament
Acts unveils Christ in His ascension propagating Himself to produce the churches, which are the kingdom of God on earth today
The Epistles, as the continuation of Acts, edify the saints so that the churches may be fully built up as the Body of Christ
Rather, it is of the divine life in resurrection, and it is carried out in the atmosphere and condition of His ascension
We need to realize that the propagation of the resurrected Christ is by the Spirit, in particular, the economical Spirit
Through His witnesses the resurrected Christ in His ascension propagates Himself for the producing of the churches
Every local church must be born of Christ, brought forth by Christ's propagation in His divine and resurrected life
We may use the kingdom of man, the human kingdom, for an illustration of the kingdom of God as the expansion of Christ
It is also true to say that the book of Acts is still being written because the propagation of the resurrected Christ is still taking place
We in the churches are the propagation of Christ and the expansion of Christ, and we are enlarging the kingdom of God
The more we are impressed with the subject of Acts, the more we shall say, 'Lord, we worship You as the resurrected One and the ascended One
The introduction is very brief, consisting of only two verses, and the preparation covers the remainder of chapter one
The words 'first account' in Acts 1:1 refer to the Gospel of Luke as a 'consecutive account' written to Theophilus by Luke
The resurrected Christ has become the life-giving Spirit , yet still in resurrection He did things through the Holy Spirit
As we have pointed out, 1:3-26 is concerned with preparation, a preparation both on the Lord's side and the side of the disciples
He speaks to them things concerning the kingdom of God and charges them to wait for the baptism in the Holy Spirit
Before the Lord went to the heavens to carry out His propagation in His ascension, He did something further to prepare His disciples
Coming to the New Testament we may say that the Gospels are on a college level and that the Epistles are on the level of graduate school
Although Peter, Andrew, James, and John were fishermen, the Lord's calling uplifted them and made them 'college students'
The Lord was able to carry out three and a half years of education with His disciples when He was in the flesh
In order to have a more accurate understanding of the words in the New Testament, it is helpful to learn Greek
Even if we have the knowledge of Greek, we still need heavenly enlightenment in order to see the divine revelation in the New Testament
They know the Greek New Testament in the way of scholarship, but they do not know what the Lord is speaking in the New Testament
We may say that the Lord was 'playing heavenly music' to His disciples; however, they were not able to appreciate it
You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men'
When He was in the flesh, He was not altogether successful in teaching Peter, because He was not able to enter into him
He had, of course, a way to correct and adjust Peter, but no way to regenerate and recreate him and dwell in him
In other words, with Peter and the other disciples, the Lord Jesus did not have a way in His flesh to propagate Himself
The Lord Jesus knew when He was taking His disciples through their 'college course' that it was necessary for Him to enter into them
In resurrection He would then be able to enter into the disciples as life and remain in them as their person and thereby propagate Himself
After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus came back to the disciples as the life-giving Spirit and breathed Himself into them
The Lord's presenting Himself alive was for the purpose of training the disciples to practice and enjoy His invisible presence
In the Gospel of John there is no word or hint indicating that the Lord left the disciples after breathing Himself into them
The Lord appeared and disappeared economically in order to train the disciples, to finish the last half year of their education
When the Lord Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil, He fasted forty days and forty nights
In Acts 1 the Lord appeared and disappeared during a period of forty days in order to test and train His disciples
From the time He breathed Himself as the Spirit into the disciples on the day of His resurrection, the resurrected Christ dwelt in them
It simply means that He made His presence visible to them, training them to realize and enjoy continually His invisible presence
Because the Lord was not in the disciples at that time, they did not have the spiritual insight to understand the kingdom of God
Those who are lacking in spiritual perception may think that to enter into the kingdom of God is to go to heaven
Because they had the life-giving Spirit within them, they were able to understand the Lord's speaking concerning the kingdom of God
The kingdom of God is not a material kingdom visible to human sight; the kingdom of God is a kingdom of the divine life
The kingdom of God is the spreading of Christ as life into His believers to form a realm in which God rules in His life
The kingdom of God is the reality of the church brought forth by the resurrection life of Christ through the gospel
In a similar way, we know the kingdom of God by the divine life because God's kingdom is a kingdom of the divine life
As those who have received the divine life, we not only know what the kingdom of God is; we become parts of this kingdom
In His preparation of the disciples, the Lord Jesus must have helped them to have the proper realization concerning the kingdom of God
It is important that we differentiate the promise given by the Lord in John 14:17 from that given by the Father in Joel 2:28 and 29
In Acts 15 the Lord went on to say For John indeed baptized in water but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now
In these two sections all genuine believers in Christ have been baptized in the Holy Spirit into one Body once for all universally
Verse 6 says, 'So when they had come together, they were asking Him, saying, Lord, are You at this time restoring the kingdom to Israel'?
In asking the question recorded in verse 6, the disciples apparently were forgetting the divine life that was within them
As indicated by their question in verse 6, the disciples even then may not have had a proper understanding of these things
Forget about the kingdom of Israel, and receive My word concerning the kingdom of God and the baptism in the Holy Spirit'
The Holy Spirit was breathed into the disciples on the day of the Lord's resurrection to be the Spirit of life to them essentially
The former as the water of life requires our drinking ; the latter as the water for baptism requires our being immersed
The disciples, however, were occupied with the traditional concept concerning Israel, Moses, and keeping the law
You should no longer be keepers of the law; now you should be living witnesses of Me, living witnesses of the resurrected Christ
They desire to be commandment keepers as the lawkeepers, but they may not have the concept that they should be witnesses of the Lord Jesus
The Lord's word indicating the need of a dispensational transfer was also part of His preparation of His disciples
Acts 1:9 says, 'And when He had said these things, while they were looking, He was lifted up, and a cloud took Him up out of their sight'
His Acts is a record of the succeeding ministry of the resurrected and ascended Christ in heaven carried out through His believers on earth
After the Lord Jesus had spoken to His disciples for a period of forty days concerning the kingdom of God, He was taken up from them visibly
For them to stay in Jerusalem, especially under the threatening of the Jewish leaders, meant that they were risking their lives
These all were persevering with one accord in prayer, together with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers'
We are told in 1:14 that the disciples, together with the women, Mary, and the Lord's brothers, persevered with one accord in prayer
God wanted to pour out His Spirit for the carrying out of His New Testament economy, and He had promised to do this
In Acts 1 Peter is very different from what he was in the Gospels because the resurrected Christ had come into him to be his life and person
They were able to pray in one accord for such a long time because they had Christ within them as their life and person
They were Galileans staying in Jerusalem, and they were under the threatening of the Jews, who were persecuting the followers of Jesus
As a result of this transfer, they had Christ as their life and person and could pray in one accord and not be afraid of persecution
Speaking of Judas, Peter goes on to say in verse 17, 'For he was numbered among us, and was allotted his portion of this ministry'
The apostles' testimony of Jesus Christ, the Lord of all, is all-inclusive, as depicted in the whole book of Acts
According to verse 23, two were proposed as replacements of Judas-Joseph who was called Barsabbas , and Matthias
After praying, 'they gave lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles'
They were still not accustomed to the leading and guidance of the indwelling Spirit as the apostle Paul was later in 16:6-8
Through the casting of lots, Matthias was chosen, and then he was added to the eleven to make the number complete
With the selection of Matthias, we have the completion of the disciples' preparation for the coming propagation
The propagation of the resurrected Christ begins in Jerusalem and then spreads to Judea, Samaria, and the entire world
In chapter two we have the beginning of the propagation in Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria through the ministry of Peter's company
The last part of Friday is one day; the whole of Saturday is the second day; and part of what is today called Sunday is the third day
In the early part of the third day, perhaps less than forty hours after He died, the Lord Jesus was resurrected
If we count from the second day after the Passover on which the Lord was crucified, Pentecost was the fiftieth day from His resurrection
There were seven weeks in between the Lord's resurrection and Pentecost, which also was on the Lord's Day, the first day of the week
In the Old Testament, when the harvest was ripe, a sheaf of the firstfruits of that harvest was offered to God
The freshness of His resurrection was first for the Father's enjoyment, as the firstfruit of the harvest was brought first to God in type
Many Christians do not realize that Christ secretly ascended to the Father early in the morning on the day of His resurrection
As we have pointed out, the feast of Pentecost was the fulfillment of the feast of Weeks, which was also called the feast of Harvest
In typology we have both the feast of Passover and the feast of Pentecost, called the feast of Weeks and also the feast of Harvest
In the Old Testament we have the Passover the offering of a sheaf of the firstfruit of the harvest and then the feast of Harvest Pentecost
Fifty days later, on the day of Pentecost, there was the enjoyment of the harvest of the rich produce of the good land
That was a type of Christ becoming the full enjoyment to His redeemed people as the life-giving Spirit poured out upon them from the heavens
Exodus 23:19a says, 'The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God'
On the morning of His resurrection, He intended to go directly to the Father and present Himself to the Father as the firstfruit
We need to be impressed with the fact that regarding Christ's ascension there is a secret aspect and also an open aspect
His open ascension took place forty days later, when He ascended in the sight of His disciples from Mount Olivet
Christ's secret ascension was for the presenting of Himself to the Father as the firstfruit in His resurrection
After enjoying Christ as the firstfruit, the disciples went on to enjoy Him as the harvest on the day of Pentecost
The enjoyment of Christ did not become full until He, as the Head of the church, poured Himself out upon His Body as the economical Spirit
Not until the Spirit was poured out economically upon the Body of Christ did the Lord's people have the full enjoyment of Christ
When the economical Spirit was poured out upon the Body of Christ on the day of Pentecost, the enjoyment of Christ became bountiful
Now the supply is the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and this Spirit is the blessing of the gospel
The blessing of the gospel is actually the Triune God processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit reaching all the believers
Acts 2:1 and 2 say, 'And when the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled, they were all together in the same place
Suddenly there came a noise out of heaven like a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting'
It is important for us to differentiate these two aspects of the Spirit, for then we shall understand the Gospels and Acts in the right way
According to his understanding, after the performance in John 20, it was necessary for the disciples to wait fifty days to receive the fact
A policeman clothes himself with a uniform when he is about to go on duty, that is, when he is ready to work as a policeman
No matter how much he may drink to quench his thirst, a policeman still must put on his uniform when he is about to work as a policeman
The proper knowledge we need requires not only the study of the Scriptures but also heavenly enlightenment along with adequate experience
We have the fact of the breathing of the life-giving Spirit into the disciples on the day of Christ's resurrection
The One who was incarnated was the complete God, the Triune God, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit, not merely the Son
John 1:14 says, 'The Word became flesh,' and 1 Corinthians 15:45b says, 'The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit'
Now the last Adam has become the life-giving Spirit, and this Spirit is the transfiguration of the incarnated Christ
The incarnated One was the Triune God to be a man as the last Adam, and this last Adam in resurrection has become the life-giving Spirit
On the day of His resurrection, He appeared to His disciples, breathed upon them, and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
On the day of the Lord's resurrection, the processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit was breathed into the disciples
On that day the ascended Christ poured Himself out as the Spirit economically upon the disciples to be their power, authority, and uniform
On the day of Pentecost the one hundred and twenty were clothed with the economical Spirit as their heavenly uniform
When they were clothed with power on the day of Pentecost, Peter stood up to speak with authority and power, and the people were subdued
The facts are that the Lord has breathed the Spirit of life into His believers and has blown His Spirit of power upon them
You need to believe that the Lord Jesus has breathed Himself as the Spirit of life into the disciples, including you
Let us all believe the facts of Christ's breathing and blowing, just as we believe the fact of His crucifixion
The inward filling Spirit the essential Spirit is in the disciples whereas the outward filling Spirit the economical Spirit is upon them
By these two steps He baptized once for all His entire Body into the Spirit , who is the application and realization of Himself
Acts 2:3 says, 'And there appeared to them tongues as of fire, which were divided and sat on each one of them'
The word 'all' cannot be used as evidence that all the disciples who were filled with the Holy Spirit began to speak in tongues
The comma after 'Holy Spirit' may help us to see that 'all' does not modify both 'filled' and 'began to speak'
We need to have the discernment to know whether the modifier 'all' modifies both predicates or only the first predicate
If Luke's meaning is that all spoke in tongues, he should have used the word 'all' a second time, before the word 'began'
According to grammar, verse 4 is not saying that all were filled with the Holy Spirit and that all began to speak in different tongues
Those who promote today's tongue-speaking may insist that 'all' in 2:4 modifies the second predicate as well as the first
The disciples were Galileans , yet they spoke the different foreign dialects of the attendants who came from various parts of the world
The Greek word rendered 'speak out' in verse 4 is 'a peculiar word, and purposely chosen to denote the clear, loud utterance'
Concerning this, verses 5 through 8 say, 'Now there were Jews dwelling in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven
When this sound occurred, the multitude came together and were confounded, because each one heard them speaking in his own dialect
The Jews in verse 5 were devout Jews who came from their dispersion to Jerusalem to keep the feast of Pentecost
According to verse 11, the people exclaimed, 'We hear them speaking in our own tongues the great things of God'
Rather, tongue-speaking must be a dialect, because what the disciples spoke in tongues were all different dialects
Those who promote tongue-speaking may insist that it is not necessary for the tongue that is spoken to be an understandable human language
Promoters of tongue-speaking need to say this because much of today's so-called tongues are not dialects but meaningless sounds
The two hundred tongue-speakers mentioned in that magazine article had doubts because the tongues they spoke were not genuine
While we were visiting there in San Diego, another leader in the group told us that he had been given the ability to speak Chinese
Since much of today's so-called tongue-speaking is not a genuine language, it also may be considered an ecstatic phenomenon
The one who gave the interpretation said that the Lord wanted a certain woman among them, who was very wealthy, to pay the rent
In particular, they need to check if what they utter when speaking in tongues is a dialect, an understandable language
Later, he used the other key to open the door for the Gentile believers to enter the kingdom in the house of Cornelius
The word 'eleven' indicates that Matthias, who was chosen in 1:26, was recognized as one among the twelve apostles
In verse 15 Peter went on to say, 'For these men are not drunk as you suppose, for it is the third hour of the day'
We also need to see that the Holy Spirit poured out on the day of Pentecost is actually the resurrected and ascended Christ Himself
The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the day of the Lord comes, the great and notable day'
In 2:21 Peter goes on to say, 'And it shall be that everyone, whoever calls on the name of the Lord, shall be saved'
It is the joyful way to drink from the fountain of God's salvation , and the enjoyable way to delight oneself in God , that is, to enjoy Him
It is a major practice in God's New Testament economy that we may enjoy the processed Triune God for our full salvation
When Stephen suffered persecution, he practiced this , and his practice surely impressed Saul, one of his persecutors
By his word to Timothy in 2 Timothy 2:22, he indicated that in the early days all the Lord's seekers practiced such calling
Undoubtedly he was one who practiced this since he charged his young coworker Timothy to do the same that he might enjoy the Lord as he did
The Greek word for call upon is epikaleo composed of epi upon and kaleo call by name that is to call out audibly even loudly as Stephen did
Lamentations 35556 indicates that calling upon the Lord is breathing and Isaiah 123 and 4 indicate that calling upon the Lord is drinking
After we believe in the Lord, we need to call upon Him so that we may not only be saved but also enjoy His riches
When we preach the gospel and help others to be saved, we need to encourage them to call on the name of the Lord and say, 'O Lord Jesus'!
From experience we know that the stronger a person calls on the name of the Lord Jesus, the stronger will be his experience of salvation
According to Acts 7:59, when Stephen was being stoned, 'he was calling upon the Lord and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit'!
According to 9:14, Saul had authority from the chief priest to bind all who called on the name of the Lord Jesus
Later Ananias came to Saul and said to him, 'Rise up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name'
Ananias seemed to be saying, 'Brother Saul, you persecuted the saints for calling on the name of the Lord Jesus
While you are being baptized and calling on the name of the Lord Jesus the saints will be very happy to hear that you also call on this name
As we have indicated, calling on the name of the Lord is not a new practice; it is not something invented by us
We have seen that in 2:14-21 Peter, in his first message to the Jews, explains the economical filling of the Holy Spirit
Now Luke's succeeding narrative goes on to tell us that this Man was preached by the apostles as the God-ordained Savior
While Christ was living and ministering, whatever He did was an exhibition of the fact that His work was done by God
In the eternal view of God, from the foundation of the world, that is, the fall of man as a part of the world, Christ was slain
Instead of being an accident, the Lord's crucifixion took place according to the eternal determination of the Triune God
Crucifixion was a heathen practice , adopted by the Romans for the execution of slaves and heinous criminals only
Acts 2:24 says, 'Whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it'
He delivered Himself to death, but death had no way to detain Him; rather, death was defeated by Him, and He rose up from it
Acts 2:26 continues, 'Therefore my heart was made glad and my tongue exulted; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope'
In the original Hebrew text the word for tongue is 'glory,' which is a synonym of soul, according to Genesis 49:6 and Psalm 7:5
After Christ died on the cross, while His soul exulted in Hades, His flesh rested in the tomb in hope, trusting in God
Acts 2:27 goes on to say, 'Because You will not leave my soul in Hades, nor will You permit Your Holy One to see corruption'
The Greek word rendered 'fruit' in verse 30 is karpos, used for Christ only in the sense of offspring here and in Luke 1:42
Christ is the branch of Jehovah and of David , and the fruit of Mary and of David, that we may eat of Him as the tree of life
In Acts 2:32 Peter gives a concluding word concerning Christ's resurrection: 'This Jesus God raised up, of which we all are witnesses'
Especially they bore witness of His resurrection , which is the crucial focus in carrying out God's New Testament economy
The pouring out of the Holy Spirit is a proof that God has exalted the Lord Jesus and has made Him both Lord and Christ
The exalted Christ's receiving of the promise of the Holy Spirit is actually the receiving of the Holy Spirit Himself
The Lord was made Lord, as the Lord of all , to possess all; and He was made Christ, as God's Anointed , to carry out God's commission
God had already appointed Him, but in His ascension He still inaugurated Him into His office as the Christ to carry out God's commission
May we all be impressed with the fact that in 2:36 'Lord' refers to possession, and 'Christ' refers to commission
In his speaking concerning Christ in chapters two through five of Acts, Peter does not refer to Him as the Son of God
From this we see that the speaking of Christ surely leads to the propagation of Christ in those who believe in Him
On the positive side, to repent is to turn to God in every way and in every thing for the fulfilling of His purpose in making men
The visible aspect is the expression the testimony of the invisible aspect whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect
The water, signifying the death of Christ with His burial, may be considered a tomb to terminate the history of the baptized ones
Water baptism should be accompanied by Spirit baptism, even as the children of Israel were baptized in the sea and in the cloud
The third preposition used to describe the relationship of baptism to the Lord is epi, upon or on, used in Acts 2:38
To be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ is to be baptized upon the ground of what the name of Jesus Christ stands for
Based upon it, the blessing of God's full salvation goes forth and consummates in the receiving of the gift of the Holy Spirit
In 2:38 Peter tells the people to repent, be baptized for the forgiveness of sins, and they will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit
Acts 2:40 says, 'And with many other words he solemnly testified and entreated them, saying, Be saved from this crooked generation'!
God is willing and prepared to save us nevertheless we need to be saved that is we need to take the initiative to receive Gods salvation
Peter, at the conclusion of his message, does not say, 'Be saved from God's condemnation,' or, 'Be saved from eternal perdition'
The result of such a salvation is not an entrance into heaven; it is an entrance into a new generation-the church
To be saved this way implies to be saved from God's condemnation and eternal perdition unto God's eternal purpose and His pleasure
Acts 2:41 says, 'Those, then, who welcomed his word were baptized, and there were added in that day about three thousand souls'
Those who received the word and were baptized were only a small percentage of the ones in Jerusalem at that time
A great many Jews lived in Jerusalem, and a large number had come to the city for the celebration of the feast of Pentecost
In God's New Testament economy there is only one kind of teaching revealed and recognized by God-the teaching of the apostles
These practices are not related directly to God's economy for the keeping of the oneness of the church, the Body of Christ
They are not of the apostles, who brought in God's New Testament revelation and His fellowship among all the believers in Christ
The orthodox teaching is that of the apostles recorded in the twenty-seven books of the New Testament from Matthew through Revelation
From this we see that all Christians should have one fellowship, the unique fellowship, which is the fellowship of the apostles
Any group that does not receive all true believers is a sect and is not practicing the fellowship of the apostles
Those who do not receive believers whose nationality differs from theirs are not practicing the fellowship of the apostles
Let us also suppose that the German brothers react and say, 'Since you Americans will not accept us, we will not accept you'
The signs believers post in front of their meeting places often indicate that they are not in the fellowship of the apostles
How strange that in China there was an American Presbyterian Church, and in California, a Taiwan Chinese Church
According to Acts 2:42, in the first church life there was only one fellowship, and that fellowship was of the apostles
In other words, these four matters-the teaching, the fellowship, the breaking of bread, and the prayers-are not one group of four items
Rather, according to the grammatical structure, teaching and fellowship are one group, and breaking of bread and prayers are another group
Although we can break bread at any time and at any place, we cannot have a teaching different from that of the apostles
Acts 2:43 says, 'And fear came upon every soul; and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles'
Wonders and signs are not part of God's central testimony of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ
The Christian way of meeting together is fitting to God's New Testament economy, differing from the Judaic way of meeting in the synagogues
It describes the heart being simple, single, and plain, having one love and desire and one goal in seeking the Lord
Verses 1 through 10 describe the healing of a lame man, and verses 11 through 26 record the actual message given by Peter
Even though a lame man was healed through Peter and John, Peter's emphasis was not on healing but on the name of the Lord Jesus
In his message he went on to say, 'By faith in His name, His name has made this man strong, whom you behold and know'
After the lame man was healed, 'he stood and walked and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God'
When all the people greatly amazed ran to Peter John and the lame man Peter said to them Men Israelites why are you marveling at this man
Peter referred to God as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob because this indicates that He is the God of resurrection
In 3:14 Peter said to the people, 'But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a man who was a murderer to be granted to you'
Only the Lord Jesus can be called the Righteous One, because only He is right with God and with everyone and with everything
Consider the time He cleansed the temple He found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves and the moneychangers sitting there
Although Peter was uneducated and unlearned, he could give the message recorded in Acts 3 by the life-giving Spirit who was within him
In 3:15 Peter went on to say, 'And the Author of life you killed, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses'
It denotes Christ as the origin or Originator of life, hence, the Author of life, in contrast to the murderer in the previous verse
In 3:15 archegos does not denote a prince; it denotes the very source, origin, even originator, of life, the Author of life
Peter is saying that the Healer is the source of life, the Originator of life; He is the Author, the Chief Leader, in life
The word 'Author' in verse 15 indicates that life comes from this Healer, who is the Holy One and the Righteous One
The Greek words rendered 'by faith in His name' literally mean 'on the faith of His name,' that is, on the ground of faith in His name
It shall be that every soul, whoever does not hear that Prophet, shall be utterly destroyed from among the people'
In 3:19-26 Peter exhorts the Jews to repent and turn so that they may partake of and enjoy the ascended and coming Christ
The times of restoration will be brought in by the coming of the Messiah in His glory as taught and prophesied by the Savior in Matthew 1928
It seems that Peter's word in 3:19 skips over the church age and goes directly from the time of Pentecost to the millennium
If we read Acts 3 in this way, we shall see that the Lord is the Servant of God, the Holy One, the Righteous One, and the Author of life
As we have pointed out, in our experience Christ Himself is the season of refreshing, for He is our enjoyment, rest, and peace
We considered the Lord's word in John 6 concerning eating Him and the charge, given by Him when He established His table, to eat His body
We also saw the promise in Revelation 22:14, the promise that those who wash their robes may have the right to the tree of life
Some criticize the practice of calling on the name of the Lord Jesus and claim that it is something we have invented
When some hear that calling on the Lord began with Enosh, they may claim that Enosh did not call the way we do today
In that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon His name, declare His doings among the people, make mention that His name is exalted'
You know, Lord, that my wife is in the hospital, that my older son lost his job, and that my younger son is failing in school
Surely this is the way the saints in both the Old Testament and in the New Testament called on the name of the Lord
If you study the lengthy note on calling in the Recovery Version, you will see how scriptural this practice is
It shall be that every soul, whoever does not hear that Prophet, shall be utterly destroyed from among the people'
In our reading of chapter three of Acts we need to pay attention to all the points related to Christ as the Healer
In our reading of Acts 3, this influence may keep us from seeing all the different matters related to Christ as the Healer
At the time Peter was speaking the word recorded in verse 26, God's Servant had ascended to the heavens and was still there
Both the Pharisees and the Sadducees were denounced by John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus as a brood of vipers
The Sadducees were greatly disturbed that Peter and John were teaching the people and announcing in Jesus the resurrection from the dead
Now it was the same Sanhedrin with its constituents that began the persecution of the apostles and their ministry in Acts
In any case, they must have been dignitaries among the Jews, since they are named with the leaders of the Jewish Sanhedrin
Acts 4:7 says, 'And having stood them in the midst, they inquired, By what power or in what name did you do this'?
Literally, the Greek words rendered 'by what power or in what name' mean 'by what sort of power and in what kind of name'
In verses 11 and 12 Peter went on to say, 'This is the stone which was despised by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone
There is no salvation in any other; for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved'
His word unveiled the Jewish leaders rejection of Him and Gods honoring of Him for the building of His habitation among His people on earth
By this word Peter learned to know the Lord as the precious stone held in honor by God, as he expounded concerning Him in his first Epistle
After the Sanhedrins prohibition Peter and Johns reply and the Sanhedrins release of Peter and John we have the churchs praise and prayer
Verse 23 says, 'And being released, they went to their own people and reported whatever the chief priests and the elders had said to them'
Their own people were the church people, who were made distinct and separate from the Jews by calling on the name of Jesus
The kings of the earth set themselves in array, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ'
The crucifixion of the Lord Jesus was a purposeful fulfillment of the divine counsel determined by the Triune God
The healing recorded in Acts 3 did not take place outside the holy city; it happened not only in the city but on the premises of the temple
They could not deny the fact that the lame man had been healed, and he had been healed through the name of Jesus, not by human ability
For that indeed a notable sign has occurred through them is manifest to all those dwelling in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it
In order that it may not be spread further among the people, let us threaten them to speak no longer to any man in this name
In chapter four Peter presents an aspect of the Healer that is especially for God; he presents Christ as the stone for God's building
In the four gospels we have the King-Savior in Matthew, the Slave-Savior in Mark, the Man-Savior in Luke, and the God-Savior in John
Although Peter was uneducated and unlearned he could nevertheless declare that Jesus Christ is the stone despised by the builders
Due to this influence, we may realize only that the name of Jesus is for salvation, that there is no other name given for us to be saved
We have put out hundreds of Life-study Messages, and in these messages we have covered many things concerning God's economy
Although we see little concerning this in the Old Testament it is revealed in full in the New Testament in particular in the Gospel of John
In John 1:14 we see the mingling of God with man in the incarnation to become God's tabernacle, His dwelling place
We see that the Son and the Father will come to the one who loves the Lord Jesus and make an abode with that one
The New Testament reveals clearly that there is a universal building, and this building is the mutual building of God and His chosen people
In chapter four Peter was given the opportunity to present this Healer in a further way, presenting Him as a stone for God's building
Concerning this, 4:11 and 12 say, 'This is the stone which was despised by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone
There is no salvation in any other; for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved'
No doubt, the Lord's word must have made a deep impression on Peter, even though it is not likely that he understood it at the time
He is not only the Servant, the Holy One, the Righteous One, the Author of life, the Prophet, and the seed; He is a stone for God's building
We say that Christ is our food, air, water, light, door, clothing, and dwelling place, although this certainly is not pantheism
They claim that we should use only those terms used by the church fathers, the councils, and traditional teachings
We need to break through this restriction and use new terms when necessary to convey the all-inclusiveness of Christ
For us as believers Christ is neither the stumbling stone nor the smiting stone-He is the building stone, even the propagating stone
Those who lack the necessary skills may in their reading of the book of Acts pay attention to such things as signs wonders and Peters shadow
We are also told that a 'river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads'
In 1 Corinthians Paul tells us that this rock was Christ: 'They drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ'
To His opposers Christ is the rock that stumbles them, but to us He is the foundation stone and the cornerstone
Zechariah speaks of Christ as the topstone: 'He shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it'
In 1 Peter 2:4-5 we see that the Lord Jesus is the living stone and that we also as living stones are being built up a spiritual house
With such theology there is too much restriction, blindness, and covering concerning many matters in the Bible
In Genesis 2 we have the onyx stone at the beginning, and then in Revelation 21 and 22 we have the jasper city as the consummation
In 4:32-5:11 we have the continuation of the church life, and in 5:17-42, the continuation of the persecution by the Jewish religionists
Concerning the continuation of the church life, there is a positive scene in 4:32-37 and a negative scene in 5:1-11
Verse 33 says, 'And with great power the apostles gave testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all'
The law makes demands upon man according to what God is, but grace supplies man with what God is to meet what God demands
Ananias lied apparently to the apostles but actually to the Holy Spirit, who is God , because the Spirit and the apostles were one
Although some may deny that believers can be possessed by demons, it is a fact that certain genuine believers have been demon possessed
Recently in Taipei the Lord moved among us in such a way that we established more than four hundred small groups in the church
The ground in Ananias and Sapphira that was the basis for Satan's deception of them was their desire to have a name
The Lord said to him You are blessed Simon Barjona because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you but My Father who is in the heavens
Later in the same chapter we see that Peter, the one who received a revelation from the Father, was also occupied by Satan
If we would avoid Satan's deception, we must reject, condemn, and abandon the ambition to be somebody in the church life
The fact that Ananias and Sapphira suffered the punishment of physical death does not mean that they will suffer eternal perdition
In God's governmental dealing, some of His children may be destined to physical death in this age due to a certain sin
In 5:4 there is a word related to having all things common: 'While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own?
Later, when Peter was speaking to Sapphira, he said to her, 'Why was it agreed together by you to test the Spirit of the Lord'?
The Holy Spirit in verse 3, God in verse 4, and the Lord in verse 9 are all one, especially in the experience of the believers
The Greek word for 'church' is ekklesia, composed of ek, out, and a derivative of kaleo, called; hence, the called out , the assembly
The church revealed in Matthew 18:17 is the local church, the expression of the unique Body of Christ in a certain locality
The record of the New Testament concerning the establishment of the church in its locality is consistent throughout
The record here is very similar to that in 2:43, where we are told that 'many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles'
We need to realize that wonders and signs are not part of Gods central testimony of the incarnated crucified resurrected and ascended Christ
The next morning the Sanhedrin and the council of the elders of the sons of Israel sent deputies to the prison to get the apostles
But when the deputies arrived, they did not find them in the prison; and when they returned, they reported, saying
The prison house we found locked with all security and the guards standing at the doors but when we opened the doors we found no one inside
someone came up and reported to them, Behold, the men whom you put in the prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people'
Although the religionists could not understand what had happened, the apostles had been rescued from prison and were in the temple teaching
The Greek word rendered 'words' here is rhema, denoting the present spoken word, not the constant written word
It is the divine life preached, ministered, and lived by Peter that overcame the Jewish leaders' persecution, threatening, and imprisonment
In verses 29 through 31 'Peter and the apostles answered and said, It is necessary to obey God rather than men
He rules sovereignly over the earth with His authority so that the environment may be fit for God's chosen people to receive His salvation
We may say that the earth is ruled by kings and presidents, but the Lord Jesus as the highest Ruler is above them
The New Testament speaks of Christ as the Ruler of the kings, and Peter says that He is the Leader, the chief Ruler
In this matter He is sovereign; He is the Ruler of the kings, arranging the environment so that we were constrained to believe in Him
He has been exalted to be the Leader over all the kings to arrange the environment so that His chosen people will believe in Him
According to Peter's word in 5:31, the Lord is the Leader and the Savior 'to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins'
To give repentance and forgiveness of sins to God's chosen people requires Christ to be exalted as a ruling Leader and Savior
Repentance and forgiveness are major gifts, and only the Lord Jesus as the Leader and the Savior is qualified to give them
We need to realize that in this universe He is the only One qualified to give repentance and forgiveness of sins
In 5:32 Peter goes on to say, 'And we are witnesses of these things, and the Holy Spirit also, whom God has given to those who obey Him'
In verse 35 Gamaliel said to the Sanhedrin, 'Men, Israelites, take heed to yourselves regarding what you are about to do to these men'
As we have pointed out although Gamaliel was godly and pious and also wise and neutral he did not know Gods economy and he was not in it
They were very godly and pious, but no matter how godly and pious they were, they did not know what God was doing on earth
Since He is moving, we need to have the inner assurance, the inner satisfaction, that we know His move and are in it
After calling the apostles, 'they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and they released them'
they went from the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be dishonored on behalf of the Name'
It is a real honor to be dishonored on behalf of the Name, the very name of the man-dishonored but God-honored Jesus
The first problem recorded in Acts was caused by a couple, Ananias and Sapphira, who were ambitious and dishonest
Apparently the problem in the church at Jerusalem was a problem of language related to those who spoke Hebrew and those who spoke Greek
When they came to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast of Pentecost, they were not able to speak Hebrew but spoke their native languages
From experience we know the problems that are caused by the different languages among those in the church life
We thank the Lord that although we have among us those of different languages and races we do not have a problem concerning language or race
The Greek word for full in verse 3 is pleres an adjective form of pleroo according to the usage here and in 65 755 1124 and Luke 41
Full of the Spirit is one's condition after being filled with the Spirit inwardly and essentially, as mentioned in 13:52
To pray is not only to entreat the Lord to do things for His move, but also to cause our spirit to be exercised and to be strengthened
The apostles told the multitude to select seven well-attested men from among them to be appointed over the need
Because Peter and the other apostles bore the responsibility of ministering the word, they distributed the serving of tables to other saints
We have learned much from the pattern in Acts, and we have been following this pattern in the church life for more than fifty years
Like the apostles in Acts, may we all learn to do our portion and to distribute the responsibility for other things to all the saints
Although Stephen and Philip had particular gifts, when they were selected to serve tables, they willingly served
From the example of Stephen we see that what we can do will not be lost, and what we are will eventually be manifest
The entire revelation of the New Testament concerning Christ and His redemptive work is considered the faith of God's New Testament economy
Acts 6:11 and 12 say, 'Then they instigated men, saying, We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God
They stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and led him to the Sanhedrin'
The Sanhedrin, the highest court of the Jews, was a council composed of chief priests, elders, lawyers, and scribes
Verse 15 says, 'And all those sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at him and saw his face as the face of an angel'
According to verse 14, the opposers accused Stephen of saying that Jesus would destroy the temple and change the customs delivered by Moses
The opposing Jews twisted the believers' words, as they did in Matthew 27:40 regarding the Lord's word in John 2:19 when they crucified Him
The ground used by Satan for his instigation was the change of dispensation, which contradicted the Judaic traditions
Even the apostle Paul was in danger of being brought back to the Judaic practices in his last visit to Jerusalem
James, the elders in Jerusalem, and many thousands of Jewish believers still remained in a mixture of the Christian faith and the Mosaic law
God's intention is to have the living Christ as the law of life and also to have Christ as the living temple for God's New Testament economy
After the Lord ascended to the heavens and the Spirit was poured out, there was a prevailing move among His disciples
The Lord Jesus had spoken concerning the termination of the dispensation of law and the destruction of the temple
They had been born into the old dispensation, and they had been raised with the knowledge of that dispensation
According to Acts 21, when Paul made his last visit to Jerusalem, he went in to James, and all the elders were present
Their failure to make the transition in full was one of the reasons the Lord sent the Roman army to destroy Jerusalem with its temple
Even before the end of the first century, Christians began to make the things of God's New Testament economy into a religious tradition
Eventually, when Christianity was presented to us in the twentieth century, it was presented in a traditional way
We can say honestly that, at least to some extent, we have been brought back to God's New Testament economy in a genuine way
Throughout the centuries, some of the things of God's New Testament economy have been used as elements to form a tradition
By the Lord's mercy we need to be willing to be brought by Him into the depths of His truths so that we may see what is on His heart
It separated, sanctified, him from the world unto God , and it was a great encouragement and strength which enabled him to follow God
We do not know where Stephen gained this understanding, for in Genesis we are not told that the God of glory appeared to Abraham
Although we do not know where Stephen learned this, we believe that his word was spoken according to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
In verse 20 Stephen says, 'At which time Moses was born and was handsome to God; and he was nurtured three months in his father's house'
In verse 21 Stephen continues, 'And when he was thrown out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up and nurtured him as her own son'
Acts 7:22 says, 'And Moses was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in his words and deeds'
In his speaking Stephen began with the God of glory and covered many matters until he came to God's habitation
Stephen called God the God of glory and the Most High to vindicate himself before his opposers who had accused him of blaspheming God
Since Stephen was full of the Spirit and was one with the Lord the Spirit , to resist him was to resist the Holy Spirit
Acts 7:54 says, 'Now when they heard these things, they were cut to their hearts and gnashed their teeth at him'
The Greek word for 'full' is pleres, an adjective form of pleroo, according to the usage here and in 6:3, 5; 11:24; and Luke 4:1
Verses 57 and 58 say, 'But crying out with a loud voice, they covered their ears and rushed upon him with one accord
Acts 7:59 says, 'And they stoned Stephen as he was calling upon the Lord and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit'!
It was not the universal church as revealed by the Lord in Matthew 1618 but only a part of the universal church which is the Body of Christ
The record of the New Testament concerning the establishment of the church in its locality is consistent throughout
Acts 8:1 clearly says that all the believers were scattered throughout the countries of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles
Although only the twelve apostles remained, it did not take long before a great many others came to believe in the Lord
Because the gospel was prevailing, soon after the scattering of the saints, a good number of others rose up to believe in the Lord Jesus
In 84 we have another pattern of the preaching of the gospelthe preaching of the gospel through the scattering the migrating of the saints
Although Satan instigated the persecution against the church the Lord is over Satan and whatever Satan does is under the Lords sovereignty
If the church in a particular locality is to avoid becoming such a Dead Sea, a 'canal' must be dug to allow the 'water' to flow out
Using the illustration of a hose, we may say that every church should be like a hose that is open at both ends
The first pattern found in chapter eight of Acts is the migration of the saints for the spreading of the gospel
Through his ministry in preaching the gospel as recorded in chapter eight, he was manifested to be an evangelist
Concerning Philip's gospel preaching, 8:12 tells us that he brought 'good news concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ'
Such a kingdom, the kingdom of God, is what both the Lord Jesus and Philip preached as the gospel, the good news
If you examine the content of their messages, you will find that there is very little of Christ or the kingdom
Although Luke did not give the details of Philips preaching he does tell us that Philip preached Christ and the kingdom of God as the gospel
We have seen that according to 8:4, those who were scattered went about the land bringing the good news of the word
If we are saturated with the New Testament in this way, when we open our mouths to speak the word will come forth spontaneously
People may be entertained by a preacher's stories and illustrations, but they may not receive much of the word
As we go forth for the spreading of the gospel, we should go with the gospel of Christ and the kingdom in the word
Acts 8:16 tells us that before Peter and John came, the Holy Spirit had not fallen upon the believers in Samaria
Acts 8:16 says that before the apostles came to Samaria the believers there 'had only been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus'
In Matthew 28:19 the Lord charged the disciples to baptize the believers into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit
In 8:9-13 we see that a man named Simon, who practiced magic in the city of Samaria, believed in the Lord and was baptized
Acts 8:26 says, 'But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Rise up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza
Although Philip had been helpful to the believers in Samaria, he was able to leave the work there as soon as he was required to do so
According to the Lords sovereign arrangement Philip came into contact with this Godseeking man with one who was hungry and thirsty for God
The Spirit told Philip to approach the chariot, and when he did so he heard the eunuch reading Isaiah the prophet
May we learn to have all our activity in preaching the gospel always under the direction and guidance of the Spirit
In the case of Philip preaching the gospel to the Ethiopian eunuch, we also have the matter of water baptism in 8:26-40
If Philip had not said anything about baptism, it is not likely that the Ethiopian would have reacted in this way
Philip may still have been talking about water baptism when they came to the water in which the eunuch was baptized
It is important for us to see that in this case of water baptism, a typical case, nothing is said about Spirit baptism
Since he records this case of water baptism, he surely would have recorded the experience of speaking in tongues had it taken place here
We have seen that the eunuch's reaction to seeing water indicates that Philip had preached water baptism to him
In Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus charged the disciples to baptize believers into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
Regarding this Romans 63 and 4a say Are you ignorant that as many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death
The Body is therefore the issue of our being baptized into the Triune God, into Christ, and into Christ's death
In a similar way, we may regard water baptism as the writing of the contract, and Spirit baptism as the reality of the contract
Acts 9:1 says, 'But Saul, still breathing threatening and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest'
Saul approved of Stephen's killing , and those who stoned Stephen laid down their garments at the feet of Saul
In 22:3 he says that he studied 'at the feet of Gamaliel, having been trained according to the strictness of the law'
No doubt, Saul was a scholar in both the Greek and Hebrew languages, and he was trained in both Greek culture and in Hebrew religion
With him we see the three main elements of Western culture: Hebrew religion, Greek culture, and Roman politics
He was taught according to the Hebrew religion, he was trained in Greek culture, and he was a citizen of the Roman Empire
In Philippians 3:5 he describes himself as 'a Hebrew of Hebrews,' for he was born a Hebrew and was well educated in the Hebrew religion
No one else was as qualified as he to bear the commission to bring God's New Testament economy to the Gentile world
Satan not only gained Saul; he also instigated him to take a leading part in persecuting the followers of Jesus
Acts 9:2 says that Saul's intention was to find those 'who were of the way' and 'bring them bound to Jerusalem'
The way in 9:2 includes the way of truth, the straight way, and the way of righteousness spoken of in 2 Peter 2:2, 15, and 21
The way of truth is the path of the Christian life according to the truth, which is the reality of the contents of the New Testament
Saul may have said to himself, 'I have obtained authority from the high priests to bind all those who call on the name of Jesus
Suddenly a light from heaven shone around him and he fell on the ground and heard a voice saying to him Saul Saul why are you persecuting Me
Saul did not have this revelation, thinking that he was persecuting Stephen and other Jesus-followers in the way he considered heresy
To his great surprise, a voice from heaven told him that He was the One whom he was persecuting, and His name was Jesus
They may point out that the voice from heaven did not say anything about the crucifixion, the redeeming blood, or the resurrection
Saul was a sinner, an opponent, but he must have known the significance of this name, since he knew both Hebrew and Greek
In 9:6 the Lord Jesus said to Saul, 'Rise up and enter into the city, and it shall be told you what you must do'
Without a member sent by the Lord from His Body to contact him, it would be difficult for any member of His Body to receive him
Before this, Saul considered himself marvelously knowledgeable, regarding himself as one who knew all things concerning man and God
Verses 10 and 11 say, 'Now there was a certain disciple in Damascus named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias!
The Lord sent Ananias, one member of His Body, to go to Saul so that Saul might be initiated into the identification with the Body of Christ
It meant a great deal to him, especially for his inner eyes to be opened to see the things of God concerning His mysteries and His economy
It is likely that as Saul was praying, vision after vision and revelation after revelation came to him concerning Christ and the church
His experience during those days may have been one of watching a heavenly television in which he saw many things concerning the Lord Jesus
Saul may have gone on to consider the Lord's ascension, which implies His incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection
Saul not only saw that Jesus is Jehovah, the Savior, who died and was resurrected; he also saw that the Lord Jesus is one with His followers
Under the inspiration of the essential Spirit, his only interest was to pray in order to know the significance of what he had seen and heard
As we shall see, when Saul came to Jerusalem and tried to join the disciples, 'all feared him, not believing that he was a disciple'
If the Lord had not told Ananias to seek out Saul, none of the believers would have recognized Saul as a brother
The Head of the Body withheld the economical Spirit until Peter and John came to Samaria to lay their hands on the Samaritan believers
The Head of the Body held back the economical Spirit until a representative of the Body came to Saul and laid his hands on him
Saul was a particular member, a member that was to bear the weighty commission to minister God's New Testament economy to the Gentile world
Each point should not merely be a teaching to us; rather, every point should be a vision that we see on the heavenly television
As a member of the Body, he was qualified to receive the heavenly commission to complete the word of God's New Testament revelation
Among the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, fourteen were written by Paul as the completion of God's New Testament economy
For this completion there was the need of another vessel, the vessel chosen by God to carry out His New Testament economy
God's intention in saving Saul of Tarsus was to fill him with Himself and thereby make him an outstanding vessel
Saul of Tarsus was chosen by the Lord not only to be His apostle, His servant, and His minister; he was also chosen to be His vessel
In Paul's life and writings we can see the three elements of western culture-the Hebrew element, the Greek element, and the Roman element
Because he was a composition of these elements, he became suitable as an earthen vessel to contain and convey the all-inclusive Christ
In our reading of chapter nine of Acts we also need to see the heavenly vision concerning 'Me,' Jesus, and the chosen vessel
Saul was a persecutor, but he turned to the Lord and became a vessel to contain Christ and minister Him to others
If we study Saul's experience on the road to Damascus, we shall be able to understand why he used the term 'this One'
According to John 5, the Jews realized that to say that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God is to say that He is God
Only He has been anointed by God and appointed by Him to carry out His commission, to do work God assigned to Him
The revelation given to Peter includes the two aspects of the Lord Jesus, the aspects of His Person and His commission
Christ's commission is to accomplish God's eternal purpose through His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and second coming
He saw the same thing Peter did in Caesarea Philippi; that is, he saw that Jesus the Nazarene is the Son of God and the Christ
Immediately after Saul turned to the Lord the first thing he testified concerning Him is that Jesus the man from Nazareth is the Son of God
As we have pointed out, this was blasphemy to the Jews, and they wanted to do away with Saul for proclaiming it
People may be told that Jesus is the Savior and the Redeemer, but there may not be the needed emphasis on the two basic aspects of Christ
We see that in order to have eternal life, we need to believe that Jesus is the Christ and that He is the Son of God
John 20:31 makes it crystal clear that to believe in the Lord Jesus is to believe in His divine Person and in His divine work
We have been strongly opposed for teaching, according to Colossians 1:15, that with regard to His humanity the Lord Jesus is a creature
Those who deny that the Lord is a creature fall into the category of those who deny that Christ has come in the flesh
Since the Lord Jesus became a man with blood and flesh both of which are created elements He is also a creature with respect to His humanity
It is heretical to deny the fact that the Lord Jesus is a creature, just as it is blasphemous to deny the fact that He is God
According to the Scriptures, we say that Jesus is both God and man, that our Lord is both the Creator and a creature
The point we would make concerning this is that Saul's having disciples indicates that his preaching was powerful and prevailing
Saul's powerful, prevailing preaching stirred up the opposition of the Jews, who 'consulted together to do away with him'
Since Saul had no way to escape, 'his disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket'
A person may attend a seminary to be trained in the way of knowledge, but become spiritually 'flat' by the time he completes his education
We may say that Saul of Tarsus attended the Lord's 'seminary' and 'graduated' after a short while to become a prevailing preacher
For this reason, when Saul tried to join the disciples, they 'all feared him, not believing that he was a disciple'
According to 9:29, Saul was 'speaking and discussing with the Hellenists,' that is, with the Greek-speaking Jews
Judea was in the southern part of the Jewish land, Galilee was in the north, and Samaria was in between the south and the north
Acts 9:32 says, 'Now it came about that as Peter was passing through all those parts, he came down also to the saints dwelling at Lydda'
While he was in Lydda, Peter healed a 'certain man named Aeneas, who for eight years had been lying on a bed, for he was paralyzed'
Verse 36 says, 'Now there was a certain disciple in Joppa named Tabitha ; this woman was full of good works and alms which she did'
In 9:32-43 we see Peter in his ministry outside of Jerusalem, even outside of Judea, in a region that is somewhat related to the Gentiles
Because Joppa was close to Caesarea, it became a stepping stone for Peter to open the door of the kingdom to the Gentiles
As we shall see, in Caesarea Peter opened the door for typical Roman Gentiles to enter into the kingdom of God
Cornelius 'saw clearly in a vision about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him and saying to him, Cornelius'!
In between these two cases, both of which involve visions, there are two miracles which took place through Peter
In our study of the book of Acts, we need to put together different cases such as these and then consider what is portrayed
In chapters six through eleven Peter, although his ministry is still primary, is beginning to move out of the scene
In our reading of Acts, we need to realize that between the end of chapter nine and the beginning of chapter thirteen there is an interval
When he came forth to preach in chapter thirteen, his preaching was much more inclusive than that in chapter nine
As we study Acts, we see that the Lord had His sovereign way to prepare a chosen vessel such as Saul of Tarsus
According to 9:32-43, Peter was moved by the Lord toward Caesarea, which was a strong center of the Roman government
On the day of Pentecost Peter used the first of these keys to open the door for the Jewish people to come into the kingdom of God
It was a difficult thing for the Jewish apostles and disciples with their Jewish background and habit to approach the Gentiles
Acts 103 and 4 say He saw clearly in a vision about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him and saying to him Cornelius!
In that case 'an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Rise up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza'
Neither in the case of the Ethiopian eunuch nor in the case of Cornelius and his household was the angel commissioned to preach the gospel
The reason for this is that only human beings who are believers in the Lord Jesus have the privilege of bringing the good news to others
Cornelius received a vision in prayer , and Peter also received a vision in prayer, through which God's plan and move were carried out
The record does indicate, however, that they set aside certain times for prayer, that they prayed according to a schedule
According to 10:10 Peter 'became very hungry and desired to eat; and while they were preparing, a trance came upon him'
Acts 10:15 continues, 'And a voice came to him again a second time, What God has cleansed, do not consider common'!
In chapter ten of Acts we see an important matter related to God's economy-the need for a dispensational transfer
Eventually the Triune God came in to accomplish everything required by God's righteousness, holiness, and glory to carry out His economy
Since God in His Trinity came to accomplish everything necessary that He might carry out His economy, there was a dispensational transfer
Even the Lord's chosen ones such as Peter, John, and James were not clear concerning the need for an absolute and thorough transfer
Like Peter, we also may have difficulty making the transfer today, for our thinking may still be under the influence of religious tradition
Verses 19 and 20 say, 'And while Peter was pondering concerning the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men are seeking you
In the cases both of the Ethiopian eunuch and of Cornelius and his household, first an angel spoke and then the Spirit spoke
According to this pattern, we should open our homes and invite our relatives and intimate friends to hear the gospel
Peter's word here indicates that he now realizes that God has made Christ the Lord of both the Jews and the Gentiles
In verse 40 Peter says that God raised this One, but in verse 41 he says that the Lord rose from among the dead
The resurrected Christ at His coming back will be the Judge of the living before the millennium on His throne of glory
In 1043 Peter continues To this One all the prophets testify that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins
Acts 10:44 says, 'While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those hearing the word'
After the all-inclusive Spirit fell upon the house of Cornelius, they began to speak in tongues and magnify God
The gift of the Holy Spirit refers to the Holy Spirit Himself, not something of the Holy Spirit given to the believers as a gift
They did not receive any gift distributed by the Spirit, as mentioned in Romans 12:6; 1 Corinthians 12:4; and 1 Peter 4:10
By these two steps the Head of the Body baptized all His believers once for all, both Jewish and Gentile, into His one Body
In verse 47 Peter answered, 'Can anyone forbid water that these should not be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit even as we'?
To be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ is to be baptized into the Person of Christ to have an organic union with Him through faith
We have pointed out that on the day of Pentecost, Christ, the Head of the Body, baptized the Jewish believers into the Spirit
By these two steps, these two instances, Christ, the Head of the Body, baptized His entire Body into the Spirit
In the great many cases of conversion recorded in Acts, there is no mention of the Holy Spirit falling upon the believers economically
In this message we shall consider a matter that will help us to understand God's economy in the record of the New Testament
We shall see that in God's economy certain things, in particular the baptism in the Holy Spirit, have been accomplished once for all
In addition to these four matters, we have the breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples and the pouring out of the Spirit upon them
Suppose we use a circle to signify eternity, and then at a certain place on the circle we place a cross signifying the crucifixion of Christ
Concerning the Lamb being slain from the foundation of the world, we need to be very careful and accurate in our reading of the Scriptures
Although Christ was slain from the foundation of the world, He was foreknown by God before the foundation of the world
Because what Christ accomplished through His death is eternal, it is called in Hebrews 9:12 an eternal redemption
Since Christ was crucified from the foundation of the world, there is no need for a repentant sinner to ask the Lord Jesus to die for him
We should not say to a new convert, 'Now that you believe in the Lord Jesus, you have received the essential Spirit
In the eating of the sandwich, we do not take first the bread, then the turkey, and then the other elements of the sandwich
When we come to eat this allinclusive sandwich we do not first eat the bread of the incarnation and then the turkey of the crucifixion
According to the New Testament, within a period of less than thirty-four years, six eternal matters were accomplished
He participates in Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, breathing of the Holy Spirit, ascension, and outpouring of the Spirit
We should not analyze our experience in this way and we should not follow the inaccurate teachings concerning the baptism in the Holy Spirit
Although in Acts there are many cases of conversions, only two cases are called the baptism in the Holy Spirit
As we have seen, the first case is that of the Jewish believers on the day of Pentecost; the second is that of the house of Cornelius
In these two sections all genuine believers in Christ have been baptized in the Holy Spirit into one Body once for all universally
The second extraordinary case was the case of Saul of Tarsus, who had been a leading persecutor of the followers of Jesus
In his case there was the need of another member of the Body to lay his hands upon him so that the economical Spirit may come upon him
These three extraordinary cases recorded in the book of Acts reveal a particular need for the laying on of hands by a member of the Body
In none of those cases is there any mention of the laying on of hands in order to receive the economical Spirit
Unlike the Samaritans, Saul of Tarsus, and the believers in Ephesus, we are not extraordinary cases that require the laying on of hands
Acts 11:1 and 2 say, 'Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God
In verse 3 those of the circumcision said to Peter, 'You went in to men who are uncircumcised and ate with them'!
The gospel preached by Peter comprises the divine blessings not only of forgiveness and salvation , but also of the Spirit and life
The reason the book of Acts is dispensational is that it describes a great transfer that is accomplished during a period of transition
Economy and dispensation are synonyms, with dispensation being the English equivalent of the Greek word oikonomia
Peter was chosen by the Lord and used by Him to carry out His New Testament economy after He Himself had accomplished the transfer
According to the record in Galatians 2, Peter later had further problems concerning the dispensational transfer
Before the Lord spoke these words, the disciples asked Him, 'Lord, are You at this time restoring the kingdom to Israel'?
The Lord replied, 'It is not for you to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in His own authority'
In this simple word the Lord Jesus was indicating that the disciples would need to break through the Old Testament dispensation
From the disciples' experience we see that to hear is one thing, but to realize and experience what we hear is another
Peter, for example, heard the Lord's word in 1:8, but he nevertheless had difficulty with the Lord's fulfillment of this word
In chapter eight we see that Philip evangelized Samaria and brought a good number of Samaritans into the Body of Christ
According to 10:23, when Peter went to the house of Cornelius in Caesarea, 'some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him'
He may have been acting here out of caution and out of the need to protect himself from the criticism of those of the circumcision
These six were neither sent by the Lord nor invited by Cornelius; instead, they were taken by Peter as a protection for him
Not only did Peter bring these six brothers with him from Joppa to Caesarea; he also took them with him to Jerusalem
Peter knew that he would face trouble in Jerusalem and that he would be criticized for what he had done in Caesarea
The saints in Jerusalem heard about what had happened in Caesarea, about what Peter had done in the house of Cornelius
Those of the circumcision should not have been surprised that God had given repentance unto life to the Gentiles
To speak of a dispensational change means that in this book we see the need for a great transfer, the need for a great turn
We have pointed out that not even the apostles had a clear vision concerning God's abandonment of the Judaic things
Literally, the Greek word rendered 'sent out' means to be sent out on a mission as an authoritative representative
Now Barnabas was sent from Jerusalem to go as far as Antioch to encourage the believers, and he went to Tarsus to bring Saul to Antioch
The Greek word translated full is pleres an adjective form of pleroo according to the usage in Acts here and in 63 5 755 and Luke 41
Being full of the Spirit is one's condition after being filled with the Spirit inwardly and essentially, as mentioned in Acts 13:52
Acts 11:25 and 26 say, 'And he went away to Tarsus to hunt for Saul; and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch
The ending ianos, denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire
Those who worshipped the emperor, the Caesar-Kaisar-were called Kaisarianos, which means adherents of Kaisar, the people belonging to Kaisar
When people believed in Christ and became His followers, this caused some in the Empire to consider Christ as a rival of the Kaisar
At Antioch they began to call the followers of Christ Christianos , adherents of Christ, as a nickname, a term of reproach
Rather, we should be bold to magnify Christ in our confession by our holy and excellent manner of life to glorify God in this name
In 11:27-30 we have a record concerning the communication between the church in Antioch and the churches in Judea
In Acts 11:30 we see that the things from the church in Antioch were sent to the elders in Jerusalem through the hand of Barnabas and Saul
Concerning Saul, God was sovereign in preparing him as another vessel to carry His New Testament economy to the Gentile world
Even though Saul had rejected Stephen and was approving of his killing, he must have considered Stephen's words
He certainly must have thought about the words uttered by Stephen when he was undergoing persecution and martyrdom
After the martyrdom of Stephen, there was a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem , and Saul was devastating the church
The saints there were afraid of him, not believing that he had truly been converted, not believing that he was a disciple
It was Ananias that identified Saul with the Body, but it was Barnabas who actually brought him into the fellowship of the Body
Because certain ones were attempting to do away with Saul, the brothers 'brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus'
The scattered saints had gone to Antioch for the raising up of a church, yet among them there was a shortage of ministry
When Barnabas found Saul he brought him to Antioch and for a whole year they were gathered in the church and taught a considerable number
As we have pointed out, this indicates that through Barnabas Saul was brought into the service among the churches
We stress this matter because it is something the Lord did sovereignly and wisely in order to keep the oneness of the Body
The Lord did not have two streams, one starting from Jerusalem through Peter and another starting in the Gentile world through Saul
The Lord did all things wisely and sovereignly to put Saul, His chosen vessel, into the proper relationship with the church in Jerusalem
In chapter eight, of course, Peter and John went down to Samaria to confirm the believers there as part of the Body
Not only did he become a nobody in Jerusalem; the Lord did not allow him to preach in Jerusalem for a long period of time
After the account of Saul's prevailing preaching in chapter nine, the record comes back to Peter and his ministry
The account of his imprisonment indicates that his ministry will be set aside from the spreading of the gospel to the Gentile world
In chapter thirteen we see that the vessel for the Gentile world is fully prepared, and the door to the Gentile world is altogether open
As they were about to take a second journey, there was a contention between them concerning Mark , and Barnabas separated from Saul
The Lord did everything sovereignly and wisely to withhold Peter's ministry from the Gentile world and to raise up Saul's ministry for it
Otherwise, eventually among us in the Lord's recovery there may be some new starts, and these new starts will cause divisions
Based upon this principle we need to consider why Luke the writer of the book of Acts inserted the instance recorded in 12124 at this point
In 11:1-18 Peter related to those in Jerusalem how the door was opened for the Gentiles to come into the kingdom of God
Sometime after Saul left Jerusalem for Tarsus, the time became right for Barnabas to find him and bring him to Antioch
Only when Saul was brought to Antioch by Barnabas was he brought into the service for the churches in an absolute way
We see this in the disciples in Antioch sending their material gift to the brothers in Judea through the hand of Barnabas and Saul
After Barnabas and Saul returned to Antioch from Jerusalem, Saul entered fully into the New Testament ministry
If Peter had been bold he might have said Brothers the Lord Jesus told us that we should be His witnesses to the remotest part of the earth
Galatians 2 confirms the fact that Peter had a problem concerning the association of Jewish and Gentile believers
In his heart there may have been the thought that if he could go to Spain, he would reach the uttermost part of the earth
Peter should have remembered the Lord's word in 1:8 when he was speaking with those of the circumcision in Acts 11
In chapter twelve of Acts Luke shows us that the persecution now comes from Roman politics as well as from the Jewish religion
Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell; and striking Peter's side, he roused him, saying, Rise up quickly!
Acts 12:18-19b say, 'Now when it became day, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter
Everything was ready for Peter to be brought out of prison and presented to the people, with one exception-the prisoner had disappeared
On an appointed day Herod, having arrayed himself in royal clothing, sat on the judgment seat and made an oration to them
Instantly an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give the glory to God; and he was eaten by worms and expired'
The account of Herod's fate recorded in 12:19b-23 is related to Peter's suffering and to his being presented as a hero
Our impression of him should be very positive, for the record concerning him and his ministry ends with such a miracle
Although we do not agree with the Roman Catholic Church in uplifting Peter as a pope, we recognize that he and his ministry were very good
The Lord Jesus exercised His lordship to send an angel to deal with Herod, one who had been instigated, usurped, and used by Satan
Since the record concerning Peter's ministry in Acts concludes in a victorious way, we should not belittle Peter
The New Testament says clearly that Peter was appointed only for the circumcision, whereas Paul was appointed for the uncircumcision
We have seen that Paul was saved by the Lord directly and was brought into the identification with the Body of Christ through Ananias
Later, also through Barnabas, he was initiated into the Lord's move in spreading the gospel of His kingdom to the Gentile world
According to the record in 13:1, the prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch were from a number of different sources
The five prophets and teachers recorded here were composed of Jewish and Gentile peoples with different backgrounds, education, and status
At the very beginning of this turn the pattern was established to indicate that the churches are composed of all races and classes of people
Rather, among the saints who love the Lord and seek Him, some are gradually manifested to be evangelists, prophets, or teachers
When he was in the church in Antioch, he was not carrying out an evangelical work but was doing a teaching work
In the Lord's recovery today we should follow the pattern in Acts 13 not to have a human way of producing preachers
If some brothers and sisters serve the Lord full time this should be done not in the way of organization but in the organic way of the Body
What matters is how the saints grow in the Lord and how the divine life develops within them to produce a certain ability for functioning
In chapter thirteen of Acts there is no discussion about fund raising or about how much to pay Barnabas and Paul
Today this work has three officesone in Anaheim one in Irving and one in Taipei and many saints work for this publication ministry full time
For the Lord's move in carrying out His recovery today, there is the need for a good number of full-time workers
In this country there may be as many as nearly one hundred churches, but we do not have enough full-time workers to meet the need
Rather, they will be produced through the saints growing in life and then being manifested according to what they are
There is a great need for full-time workers not only in the United States but also in Latin America and Europe
There are many churches in Mexico and Brazil there are also churches in Guatemala Colombia Argentina Chile Peru Bolivia Uruguay and Paraguay
Surely there is the need for a good number of saints to be willing to serve the Lord full time, trusting in Him to meet the need
We see that these prophets and teachers were not conferring with men and organizing; rather, they were ministering to the Lord and fasting
Spiritually speaking, they were not at the altar in the outer court, but were at the incense altar in the Holy Place
When they served the people, they ministered at the altar in the outer court, offering sacrifices to God for the people
These five brothers in Antioch were at the incense altar in the Holy Place ministering directly to the Lord through their prayers
As they were ministering to the Lord in this way He as the Spirit came in and spoke to them saying Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul
If the Spirit is merely the Lords representative then in 132 the Holy Spirit should not have said Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul
Acts 13:3 continues, 'Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away'
By this they declared to all that they were one with the sent ones in their going to carry out the Lord's great commission
Rather, in the laying on of hands we should be one with the Triune God not to ordain the sent ones but to identify ourselves with them
The laying on of hands signifies that our spirit, our prayers, and all that is within us go out with the sent ones
Whenever we lay our hands upon someone in the Lord's recovery who is being sent out by the Lord, we must do it in this way
Through the laying on of hands they indicated that they would go with Barnabas and Saul in their prayers and in the Spirit
If we practice the laying on of hands, it should be according to the inner leading and with a genuine burden in the Spirit
Our practice should be different from that of traditional Christianity, which is far off from the pattern presented in Acts 13
As He walked beside the sea of Galilee, the Lord Jesus saw two brothers, Simon and Andrew, and He called them to follow Him
Following that, the Lord brought them all to the Mount of Olives and in their sight visibly ascended to the heavens
When He called Saul of Tarsus, the Lord indicated to him through Ananias that He would make him not a fisher of men but a vessel
When Barnabas and Paul were about to go on their second journey, 'Barnabas intended to take John, who is called Mark, along with them also'
Paul did not consider it suitable to take with them this one who withdrew from them in Pamphylia and did not go with them to the work'
The point we would make here is that the problem began with the mistake in taking Mark along with them the first time
Verse 8 continues, 'But Elymas the magician was opposing them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith'
In any case, from this point on Paul, being filled with the Holy Spirit, took the lead in the apostolic ministry all the way
Acts 13:11 and 12 conclude, 'And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a time
Based upon 15:38, the reason for John's leaving must have been negative and hence a discouragement to Paul and his companion
In every synagogue the holy Scriptures were taught, and there were a number of people, both Jews and Gentiles, who were seeking God
When Paul rose up to speak, he addressed those in the synagogue, saying, 'Men, Israelites, and those who fear God'
Paul's going to the synagogue also matches the basic principle that God's gospel should go first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles
As the Shepherd, the Lord Jesus called the sheep out of the fold; that is, He called them out of the Jewish religion
Whenever he came to a city, he would go to the fold, the synagogue, in that place, for he knew that a number of God's sheep were held there
The ministry of the apostle Paul was not only to call out God's chosen people from the Jewish religion, but also to gain Gentile believers
Whenever Paul went to a synagogue, he preached and taught from the Bible, which at that time, of course, consisted only of the Old Testament
Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years
David was a man according to God's heart, that is, according to the desire of God's heart, not only according to God's words
In verse 23 he went on to say, 'From this man's seed, God, according to promise, brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus'
We see that after a short introduction, he came to his crucial message, which is altogether centered on Christ
And when they had accomplished all that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb'
Beginning with verse 30, Paul went on to speak of Christ's resurrection: 'But God raised Him from among the dead'
In His first birth He was born of Mary to be the Son of Man, and in His second birth He was born in resurrection to be the Son of God
Before His first birth, that is, before He was born of Mary to be the Son of Man, He was already the Son of God
The Gospel of John emphasizes the fact that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and He is the Son of God eternally
Since He was already the Son of God before His incarnation, why was it necessary for Him to be born the Son of God in His resurrection?
We who believe in Christ are the many sons of God and the many brothers of the Lord, the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God
The Gospel of John emphasizes that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and as the Son of God He is the very embodiment of the divine life
He was the only begotten Son as the embodiment of life; now He is the firstborn Son for the propagation of life
Through His second birth, His birth in resurrection, Christ became the firstborn Son of God for the propagation of the divine life
We have seen that Paul went to the synagogue to speak the word of God to both the Jews and the Gentile seekers after God
As the only begotten Son Christ is the embodiment of the divine life, but as the firstborn Son He is the propagation of this life
We have pointed out that Christ's resurrection was His second birth to bring Him forth as the firstborn Son of God
He is a great gift given by God to His chosen people, and this gift is entitled 'the holy and faithful things'
The resurrected Christ, who is God's firstborn Son brought forth through His second birth, His resurrection, is the holy and faithful things
Paul indicates that the resurrected Christ is not only our Savior bringing us God's salvation, and He is not only the firstborn Son of God
Many of us have never been taught that the resurrected Christ is the holy and trustworthy things given to us by God
The holy and faithful things cover a wide span, a span much wider than that covered by the titles 'Savior' and 'firstborn Son'
According to the New Testament, Christ is life, light, grace, righteousness, holiness, sanctification, and justification
Chronicles 6:42 mentions 'the mercies of David,' the Lord's servant, and Psalm 89:1 says, 'I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever'
In chapter ten of the Gospel of John we have the door, the pasture, and the Shepherd, all of which are mercies
One day after a conference meeting, she said, 'I thought that by now you would be exhausted and have nothing to say
We all need to see that the resurrected Christ is the firstborn Son of God, the Savior, and holy and faithful things of David
All genuine Christians know that Christ is the only begotten Son of God, and some may realize that He is the firstborn Son of God
Have you ever heard that the resurrected Christ is all the holy and trustworthy things as mercies given to us by God as an allinclusive gift
What Paul proclaimed here in his preaching of the gospel requires all the Epistles written by him for its definition
If you want to see more concerning Christ as the holy and trustworthy things, you need to study the fourteen Epistles of Paul
In 13:35 through 37 Paul continues, 'Wherefore He says also in another psalm, You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption
The word 'served' in verse 36 indicates that David's reigning as a king was a service to his generation by the counsel of God
Through the One who is the firstborn Son, the Savior, and the holy and trustworthy things, forgiveness of sins has been announced to us
Through this One we are justified from all the things from which we could not be justified by the law of Moses
The One by whom we are forgiven and justified is not only our Savior; He Himself is our forgiveness and justification
Both forgiveness and justification are mercies from God to us, and these mercies are aspects of the resurrected Christ
Both forgiveness and justification are aspects of Christ Himself as mercies from God to us, and these mercies are holy and faithful things
To be sure, forgiveness and justification are gifts of God, and they certainly are holy and trustworthy things
As the people were going out of the synagogue, 'they entreated that these words be spoken to them on the next Sabbath'
Although we may be familiar with this word, we need to realize that the grace in 13:43 is a compound formed of a number of elements
Verses 44 through 46 say, 'And on the coming Sabbath almost all the city was gathered together to hear the word of the Lord
When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and contradicted the things spoken by Paul, blaspheming
Now, with regard to the Jews who were rejecting them, Paul and Barnabas said that they judged themselves unworthy of eternal life
From our experience we know that eternal life is the Savior the firstborn Son of God the holy and faithful things and the allinclusive grace
On the one hand, God has the power to assign, to appoint; on the other hand, man has the ability to accept or refuse
In these verses we have the Savior, the Son of God, the holy and faithful things, the grace of God, and eternal life
According to its usage in Acts, pleroo denotes to fill a vessel within, as the wind filled the house inwardly in 2:2
When we partake of this 'sandwich,' we enjoy eternal life, grace, the holy and faithful things, the firstborn Son of God, and the Savior
We have Christ Jesus as the Savior, the firstborn Son of God, the holy and faithful things, grace, and eternal life
Verse 2 continues, 'But the Jews who disobeyed stirred up and poisoned the minds of the Gentiles against the brothers'
As the Lord testified to the word of His grace, He granted signs and wonders to be done through the hands of Paul and Barnabas
Rather, signs and wonders are only evidences that what the apostles preached and ministered was absolutely of God, not of man
In the synagogues the Jewish people did not read the Old Testament in order to know the word of the Lord's grace
The word 'testified' in verse 3 implies that the word of grace already existed and that it had already been preached
Of finding the word of grace, the Jewish people paid attention to the word of the law with all the commandments
After Adam and Eve had eaten of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they tried to hide from God
They must have hated the serpent, and now the Lord was telling them that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent
The Jews in the synagogues were spiritually blind and could not see the word of the Lord's grace in the Old Testament
We have seen that in chapter thirteen of Acts Paul applied the 'holy and faithful things of David' to the resurrected Christ
Who other than Paul would be able to understand that the holy and faithful things of David refer to the resurrected Christ?
In resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God for the propagating reproduction of the divine life
According to Paul's understanding, the mercies of the Lord are Christ in His second birth, that is, Christ in His resurrection
When the Lord Jesus proclaimed the New Testament jubilee in Luke 4, He selected a word of grace from the book of Isaiah
In chapter thirteen Paul's preaching to the Jews was mainly based on the revelation in the Old Testament concerning Christ
The Latin equivalent of Zeus, the leading god in Greek mythology, and Hermes, the messenger of the gods, is Jupiter and Mercury respectively
You should turn from these vain things, these idols, to the living God, who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and all things in them'
In verse 16 Paul and Barnabas went on to say that God 'in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to go their ways'
In chapter thirteen of Acts Paul preached according to the Old Testament known for generations by the Jewish people
Of pointing out God's creation and the good things God did for them, he spoke to them concerning Christ in resurrection
In 13:43 they appealed to the believers to continue in the grace of God, but here they entreated them to continue in the faith
The entire revelation of the New Testament concerning Christ and His redemptive work is considered the faith of God's New Testament economy
If we understand what the faith is, then we shall realize that continuing in the faith is a deeper matter than continuing in the grace
Immediately after they were saved, they were persuaded by the apostles to stay in the enjoyment of the Triune God
According to what is indicated in Acts 14, they must have learned quite much of God's New Testament economy during that period of time
In 14:22 we see that Paul and Barnabas told the disciples that 'through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God'
If we would know this, we need to realize that according to the New Testament the kingdom of God is not a visible, material realm
As the Lord's word in Luke 17:20 indicates, this kingdom does not come with observation; that is, it is spiritual, not material and visible
Judaism, for example, has been usurped and utilized by Satan to frustrate the believers from entering this enjoyment
In chapter one of Acts they had not yet entered into the full enjoyment of Christ as the kingdom of God, as God's ruling realm
It was still necessary for them to enter into the realm of the full enjoyment of the resurrected Christ as God's kingdom
As Peter was preaching the gospel in Acts 2, we see with him and the other apostles a picture of the kingdom of God
In Acts 2 the one hundred and twenty were in the full enjoyment of the resurrected and ascended Christ as God's ruling realm
Paul charged them to enter into the realm of the full enjoyment of the resurrected and ascended Christ as the kingdom of God
In verse 17 he says, 'The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
Righteousness, peace, and joy all are the issue of the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ as the kingdom of God
The kingdom of God is the church life, and the church life is a realm of the enjoyment of the resurrected and ascended Christ
The Greek words rendered 'in every church' contain the preposition kata with the distributive usage-according to church
All the churches in which the elders were appointed respectively by the apostles in Acts 14:23 were established within less than one year
They were not voted in by their congregation; they were appointed by the apostles according to their maturity of life in Christ
It was by this grace that Saul of Tarsus the foremost of sinners became the foremost apostle laboring more abundantly than all the apostles
When Paul and Barnabas arrived in Antioch, they gathered the church together and declared all that God had done with them
The fact that it was not dealt with in Jerusalem indicates that there were certain shortcomings with Peter and James
If we have such a concept of Peter and James, we shall not have the proper view of the situation recorded in chapter fifteen
The heart of the problem is not with the heretical Judaizers that went down to Antioch; it is with Peter and James
If James, a flesh brother of the Lord Jesus, was not present when this word was spoken, he certainly must have been familiar with it
Peter and James should have done a thorough job to eliminate the heretical teaching, killing it at the source in Jerusalem
They boldly taught the people, saying, 'Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved'
If we read Galatians 2 along with Acts 15, we shall be helped to understand what the situation was at that time
Peter and James deserve to be blamed for the problem, for they did not guard the truth and contend for it adequately
How could Paul agree with the heretical teaching that the Gentiles could not be saved unless they were circumcised?
According to verse 26, Paul and Barnabas were regarded as those who had 'given up their lives for the name of the Lord Jesus Christ'
The going up to Jerusalem of Paul, Barnabas, and certain others was the move of the church, not the move of themselves as individuals
What would you have done with those who taught that believers in Christ must be circumcised and keep the law of Moses?
Suppose certain ones in the church begin to teach that the believers today should be circumcised and keep the law of Moses
In a proper way you should say, 'We ask you not to speak in the church meetings and not to spread this teaching among the saints
Any who teach the heresy that believers must be circumcised and keep the law of Moses should be told to have a change in their understanding
In Acts 15 we have the unique conference held by the apostles of the universal church and the elders of the local church in Jerusalem
The cleansing of man's heart can only be by the Holy Spirit with the divine life, not by outward ordinances of dead letters
The yoke in slavery in Galatians 5:1 is the bondage of law, which makes the lawkeepers slaves under a binding yoke
In Acts 15:11 Peter goes on to say, 'But through the grace of the Lord Jesus we believe that we are saved, in the same way also as they are'
He told us that we would be His witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria and even unto the remotest part of the earth
Why did he simply remind them that God had chosen that through him the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe?
If Peter had exercised this authority, he would have solved the problem and cut off the flow of the 'poison' of heresy
Peter should have said that God is the Planner of His economy, the One who formed His economy, His dispensation
Peter should have testified concerning the Lord's word in 1:8, the vision he saw, and what happened in the house of Cornelius
they listened to Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them'
In Acts 1:6 the apostles asked the Lord Jesus, saying, 'Lord, are You at this time restoring the kingdom to Israel'?
Although the Lord had spoken such a word, James, in order to take care of the situation in Acts 15, uplifted the nation of Israel once again
In the coming age the Lord will rebuild the fallen tabernacle of David; that is, He will restore the nation of Israel
In referring to these cases the Lord Jesus was bold, and those in the synagogue were offended and wanted to put Him to death
If we compare James' use of the Old Testament with the Lord's, we shall see that James quotes the Scriptures in a very weak manner
Paul quotes Isaiah 49:6: 'I have set you for a light of the Gentiles, that you should be for salvation unto the remotest part of the earth'
That we write to them to abstain from the pollutions of idols and fornication and what is strangled and blood'
In contrast to such a word, James' fellowship causes the New Testament believers to return to considering the law
As we shall see, the influence of this background still remained even at the time Paul paid his last visit to Jerusalem
James 2:8-11 indicates that the Jewish believers at the time of James were still practicing and keeping the Old Testament law
James, the elders in Jerusalem, and many thousands of Jewish believers remained in a mixture of the Christian faith and the Mosaic law
They were unaware that the dispensation of law was altogether over and that the dispensation of grace should be fully honored
Verses 23 through 29 give an account of the letter that was written by those in Jerusalem and sent with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch
In verse 26 we are told that Barnabas and Saul were 'men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ'
We are studying the Bible not merely to learn doctrine, but also to be warned and to be trained to face the present situation
One day a friend of mine, who was a co-worker, said to me, 'Yes, the New Testament does say that Christ is the Spirit
They know what he taught, but because they are afraid of traditional Christianity, they do not dare to teach the same thing
In translating certain of Brother Nee's books, the translator has even changed some of his words in order not to be condemned
In verses 40 and 41 Paul and Silas passed through Syria and Cilicia, and in 16:1-5 they went to Derbe and to Lystra
There arose a sharp contention, so that they separated from each other; and Barnabas, taking along Mark, sailed away to Cyprus'
Mark may have left during the first ministry journey because he was not able to bear the hardships of that evangelical work
Because Paul was strict in not letting Mark go on the second journey, there arose a sharp contention between Paul and Barnabas
After this, there is no further mention of Barnabas in the divine record of God's move in His New Testament economy
Acts 15:40 and 41 say, 'But Paul, having chosen Silas, went out, being commended to the grace of the Lord by the brothers
The fact that Paul was commended to the grace of the Lord by the brothers indicates that he, and not Barnabas, had taken the right way
In chapter fifteen of Acts the solution to the problem regarding circumcision was put in writing , and Paul carried this letter with him
In circumcising Timothy Paul may have been exercising his wisdom to make the situation easier for him to preach the gospel
We need to consider Pauls circumcising of Timothy in Acts 16 in the light of what Paul says concerning circumcision in the book of Galatians
In Acts 15 there is no mention of Titus, but in Galatians 2 Paul tells us that he took Titus with him to Jerusalem
Since Titus in Galatians 2 was not circumcised, why did Paul in Acts 16 circumcise Timothy when he was on his second ministry journey?
In Galatians 54 Paul goes on to say You have been brought to naught from Christ you who are justified by law you have fallen from grace
As the following verse indicates, here Paul is saying that the religious world has been crucified to him, and he to the religious world
In Galatians 6:15 he goes on to explain, 'For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation'
How can we reconcile Paul's having Timothy circumcised with what he says regarding circumcision in the book of Galatians?
He realized that as he traveled through these cities to work among the people, he would first carry out a work among the Jews
He may have thought that it would be a great frustration to his gospel work to have with him an uncircumcised young co-worker
He may have done this in order to be able to carry out his work where the Jewish atmosphere and environment were still prevailing
When he went to Jerusalem to fight against circumcision, he brought with him a co-worker who was not circumcised
We may understand this word to mean that Paul covered both the side of circumcision and the side of uncircumcision
The best we can say regarding Paul's having Timothy circumcised is that he was being flexible in a particular kind of environment
If we do not have the insight that comes from knowing God's economy, God's dispensation, it will be difficult for us to understand this book
We praise the Lord that the book of Acts is being opened to us so that we may see all the crucial dispensational points contained in it
The record of the New Testament concerning the establishment of a church in its locality is consistent throughout
Acts 166 says And they passed through the country of Phrygia and Galatia having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia
Acts 16:7 continues, 'And when they had come down to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them'
The Holy Spirit's forbidding and the Spirit of Jesus' not allowing indicated that Paul and his co-workers should go directly forward
If we look at a map, we shall see that such a forward direction would be toward eastern Europe, in particular, toward Macedonia and Achaia
We need to pay careful attention to two divine titles in verses 6 and 7: the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus
In the Old Testament we read of the Spirit of God in Genesis 1:2b: 'The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters'
The main titles of God's Spirit in the Old Testament, therefore, are the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah
From this we see that in Acts 16 Luke uses two titles for the Spirit of God that are not found in the Old Testament
In order to understand the first usage of the title the Holy Spirit, we need to see that this title is involved with the Lord's incarnation
In Acts 16 we see that the move of the apostles in their evangelistic work was strictly speaking not by the Spirit of God
These two divine titles indicate strongly that Paul's move in his evangelical work was not something in the way of the old dispensation
If it had been a move in the old dispensational way, then the Spirit of God or the Spirit of Jehovah should have been mentioned
Our burden is to see Gods move on earth for His New Testament economy and all the crucial dispensational turning points related to this move
God's New Testament economy is carried out through the Lord's incarnation, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension
Elsewhere we have pointed out that after His resurrection and in His resurrection Christ has become the pneumatic Christ
The pneumatic Christ is constituted of certain elements: incarnation, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension
In Acts 16 Paul and his coworkers were moving under the direction of such a Spirit the Spirit who is the totality of the allinclusive Christ
My fellowship concerning these two titles of the divine Spirit, therefore, is based upon years of study, observation, and experience
The depths of the truth regarding the Spirit is not found in traditional theology; on the contrary, it is in the depths of the Word
These verses prove that the apostles were moving under the direction and guidance of such an all-inclusive Spirit
The kind of work we do for the Lord depends on the kind of Spirit by whom we are guided, directed, instructed, and constituted
Paul was not constituted of the Spirit of God nor of the Spirit of Jehovah but of the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus
For this reason, he could never do the work of ministering Jesus as the all-inclusive One or convey Him as such a One to others
We need the heavenly vision to see what is implied by the two divine titles the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus
When we see this, we shall realize that the title 'the Holy Spirit' is involved with God's New Testament economy
May we all learn to dig into the depths of God's Word to know the deeper truths that have been buried for centuries
In particular, may we all learn the meaning of the two divine titles found in Acts 16:6 and 7-the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus
Macedonia was a province of the Roman Empire in southeastern Europe between Thrace and Achaia on the Aegean Sea
The mind that is capable of understanding such a vision from God is a mind saturated and directed by the spirit
To carry out this particular leading in the Lord's strategic move required the endeavoring of the apostle and his co-workers
It was a fortified outpost of the Roman Empire in a foreign country, where the citizens had equal rights with those at the capital, Rome
The Lord here, who opened the heart of Lydia to give heed to the gospel preaching, must be the Spirit, who is the Lord Himself
As verse 19 indicates, after the demon had been cast out from the woman, she could no longer bring profit to her masters
When the apostles were put into the inner prison, the Lord had an excellent opportunity to vindicate Himself as the Lord of the kings
While Paul and Silas were praying and singing, the Lord shook the prison, and all the prisoners were released from their bonds
As in the case of Lydia baptism was practiced immediately after the jailer and those in his household had believed that they might be saved
The deputies were the Roman lictors those who held the rod to clear the way for the magistrates and to execute punishment on the criminals
In verse 36 the jailer reported to Paul the words of the magistrates: 'The magistrates have sent that you may be released
Paul realized that for the sake of the future of this evangelical work it was necessary for him to claim his rights as a Roman citizen
For the Lord's interest, not for our personal profit, we claim our rights as citizens and appeal to the law as our 'Caesar' today
In verses 1 through 9 Paul comes to Thessalonica; in verses 10 through 13, to Berea; and in verses 14 through 34, to Athens
According to our experience and observation, churches are often raised up through unusual persons such as these
Thessalonica was another leading city, sitting on a gulf in the middle of the shoreline of the province of Macedonia
In Thessalonica there was a synagogue of the Jews, a place where the Jews sought the knowledge of God by studying the Holy Scriptures
According to his custom, Paul 'went in to them, and on three Sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures'
Some have argued that believers should be immersed frontward; others argue that they should be immersed backward or straight downward
Christ's suffering implies His incarnation, and His incarnation implies His dual status, that is, His deity and His humanity
In 17:3 Paul explicitly spoke of Christ's resurrection, saying that 'the Christ must suffer and rise from among the dead'
Paul must have reasoned concerning the incarnated Christ in His deity, humanity, human living, suffering, death, and resurrection
Paul's reasoning in the synagogue concerning Christ corresponds to his being led by the Holy Spirit and regulated by the Spirit of Jesus
Paul did not minister law, genealogies, prophecies, or types-he ministered the living and all-inclusive Christ
It is significant that in Acts the leading women among the Greeks often were among the first to believe in the gospel
Opposers often have this ability, which may come from the training they have received from the Devil, the evil instigator
The Bereans were noble in receiving the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so
It seems that these opposers became professionals, not doing any other business except to follow the apostles and to oppose God's economy
Through the apostle Paul's visit to such a center, the gospel of the kingdom of God reached the people of the highest culture
Acts 1716 says Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens his spirit was provoked in him as he beheld that the city was full of idols
Now the true God, who created the universe and them, sent His apostle to announce the true object whom they should worship
The fact that people worship something or are seeking something to worship is a strong proof that man needs God
We see that in the synagogue Paul reasoned with the Jews and with those who worshipped, who probably were Greeks who worshipped God
In addition to reasoning in the synagogue, Paul reasoned every day in the marketplace with whomever happened to be there
From this we see that Paul reasoned in two places-in the synagogue with the Jews and in the marketplace with the Greeks
Others, He seems to be an announcer of strange demons-because he was bringing good news of Jesus and the resurrection'
They were pantheists who believed that everything was governed by fate and that all happenings were the result of the divine will
Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time for nothing other than telling or hearing something new'
Areopagus was Mars' Hill, the seat of the ancient and venerable Athenian court, which judged the most solemn problems of religion
That Paul was led to the Areopagus indicates that his preaching was very prevailing and that it stirred up the city becoming the latest news
The Areopagus was Mars' Hill, the seat of the ancient and venerable Athenian court, which judged the most solemn problems of religion
The Greek word rendered very religious literally means to fear a demon a supernatural spirit hence given up to demon worship very religious
The Athenians were very religious not in relation to the true God but with respect to the worshipping of idols
We have seen that in verse 16 Paul's spirit 'was provoked in him as he beheld that the city was full of idols'
The Epicureans did not believe in the Creator, the Lord of heaven and earth who provides all the necessities of life for human beings
In chapter fourteen he told the heathen that the 'living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all the things in them
Did not leave Himself without witness doing good giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons filling your hearts with food and gladness
In verse 26 Paul points out that God has determined the appointed seasons and the boundaries of dwelling of all nations
The migrations to America in its times and boundaries is a strong proof of this word and also of the first part of verse 27
From the creation of the heavens and the earth and God's provision for all of mankind, Paul goes on to speak of the existence of mankind
Rather, here Paul is pointing out that all human beings, including the Epicureans and all other unbelievers, live, move, and exist in God
Based upon this, he was supposed to be the son of God, even as the heathen poets considered all mankind to be the offspring of God
They reasoned that since Adam, the first of mankind, was a son of God, then all his descendants must also be sons of God
God used the dust to form man's physical body, and then He breathed into that body the breath of life, which caused the body to become alive
There is no indication in the Bible that the offspring of God, the human beings produced of God, have the divine life with the divine nature
The New Testament says that the believers, who have been born of God, have the divine life and are partakers of the divine nature
All human beings are the offspring of God produced of Him, but the believers are the sons of God born of Him through regeneration
We need to be impressed with the fact that all humans are the offspring of God in the sense of having the breath of life from God
All human beings are the offspring produced of God, but we who believe in Christ are the sons of God regenerated by Him
God Himself can be known only from the revelation of His eternal Word, Christ incarnate, the very embodiment of the Godhead
He has been designated by God to execute this judgment, and God's raising Him from among the dead is strong proof of this
In their preaching to the Gentiles, both Peter in 10:42 and Paul here and in 24:25 stressed the coming judgment of God
The resurrection of Christ is proof and assurance of His coming back to judge all the inhabitants of the earth
Because he was constituted of the Spirit of Jesus his goal no matter what the subject in speaking was to preach Christ and His resurrection
Acts 173234 say Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some scoffed others said We will hear you yet again concerning this
Some men joined him and believed, among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them'
Although the New Testament does not mention a church in Athens, nevertheless Paul did a prevailing work in that city
The Stoics were pantheists who believed that everything was governed by fate and that all happenings were the result of the divine will
From the Creator Paul proceeded to point out that all humans are the offspring of God and that we have our living and our being in Him
It is likely that Paul had the Epicureans in mind when he said, 'If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, fur tomorrow we die'
If there is no resurrection, we the believers shall have no hope in the future and become the most miserable of all men
God has designated Jesus to be the One to judge everyone, and He has furnished proof of this by raising Him from among the dead
When Paul was facing the Jews, he used their Scriptures to preach Christ, pointing out where He is revealed throughout the Scriptures
In Acts 18 Paul goes to Corinth where he meets Aquila and Priscilla and preaches to the Jews and encounters their opposition
In 18:18-21a Paul goes to Ephesus, and in 18:21b-22 he returns to Antioch, thus ending his second ministry journey
Having found a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, recently come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife , he went to them'
Verse 3 says, 'And because he was of the same trade, he remained with them and they worked; for they were tentmakers by trade'
In both 1 Thessalonians 2:9 and 2 Thessalonians 3:8 Paul says that he labored day and night so as not to be burdensome to the saints
If your burden occupies you in full and the environment affords you a living then you should certainly spend all your time on the Lords work
If not, you should still work to support yourself, and not only yourself but also your co-workers, especially the younger ones
According to Luke 8:1-3, a group of sisters ministered to the Lord Jesus and the twelve out of their possessions
Certain women who loved the Lord and who had the substance to support the Lord and His followers met their need
A number of sisters were nurses in a leading hospital, and these sisters supported the church and the co-workers in Shanghai
Although Roman politics persecuted the Lord Jesus, the wife of a Roman official used her husband's money to support Him
Rather, he should carry out his burden and yet at the same time be diligent to work to meet his needs, as Paul did in Acts
Paul, of course, went to the Jewish synagogue gathering for the purpose of taking advantage of the opportunity to announce the word of God
The mention of the Greeks in 18:4 indicates that some Greeks also attended the Jewish synagogues to listen to the word of God
As in 16:9 and 10, the vision in which the Lord spoke to Paul during the night was neither a dream nor a trance
The fact that Paul remained in Corinth for a year and a half indicates that the church in Corinth was the leading church in Achaia
As we read the book of Acts we see that the resistance, opposition, and attack from the Jewish people was very strong
The Jews brought Paul to Gallic and accused him of teaching others to worship God in a way that is not according to the Mosaic law
They all laid hold of Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and began beating him in front of the judgment seat
According to the context, Paul should have been thankful to the Lord for protecting him and preserving his life
After the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision, he remained in Corinth a year and six months, teaching the word of God
He surely accomplished his commission in that city and eventually a sizable church was raised up and established there
Because Paul was the factor in an unpleasant situation, he did his best to keep the oneness with all the saints
Acts 18:5 indicates that when Paul was in the synagogue, He came directly to the matter of testifying that Jesus is the Christ
According to our concept, we may need some kind of opener for our gospel preaching, some way to open the listeners and gain their attention
Our job is not to do anything other than to present Christ to sinners and especially to minister Christ to them
The last night of the year, which was a time of feasting according to Chinese custom, was for us a time of fasting and prayer
The next day, the first day of the year, we came together with our relatives, friends, and neighbors for the preaching of the gospel
Instead of using many stories in our speaking, we mainly preach Christ according to the revelation in the Scriptures
All the attendants at that meeting realized that what had taken place was truly a move of the Spirit and that we could not repeat it
We believe that while we are serving Him and speaking for Him, especially as we are speaking Him forth, He is with us
Perhaps a certain professor will be able to give a message concerning science in order to convince students of science to believe in God
We should put our trust wholly and absolutely in prayer, in the Word, and in the anointing, which is the Triune God Himself
When Saul was in Damascus, he was 'empowered and confounded the Jews dwelling in Damascus, proving that this One is the Christ'
Those who are not eloquent, and who may even mispronounce words, may have impact and power in their gospel preaching
If we trust in prayer, the Word, and the Spirit, the Lord may even use speaking with the wrong pronunciation of words to save others
When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him to themselves and expounded the way of God to him more accurately'
Literally, the Greek words rendered 'grace' in verse 27 mean 'the grace,' indicating the particular grace which Apollos enjoyed in the Lord
Of course, John the Baptist testified to the Lord, and Apollos received the Lord and knew the way of the Lord to a certain extent
Apollos was good, scriptural, and powerful in expounding the Word, yet he was backward concerning the Lord's move
They love the Lord and they know the Scriptures to some extent, but they are not up-to-date in the Lord's move
To be poor in spirit is not only to be humble but also to be emptied in our spirit, emptied in the depths of our being
If we read through the Bible carefully, we shall see that from the time of Genesis 4 onward the Lord has been moving step by step
We see the deficiency in the result of Apollos' ministry, which lacked a complete revelation of God's New Testament economy
Although Apollos was very good, there was a deficiency in the result of his ministry, and this caused a problem
Acts 19:6 and 7 say, 'And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied
Acts 198 says And entering into the synagogue he spoke boldly for three months reasoning and persuading them concerning the kingdom of God
It was sovereign of the Lord that an environment was arranged in the synagogue where Paul could minister for three months
In verse 8 we are told specifically that Paul reasoned and persuaded those in the synagogue concerning the kingdom of God
The kingdom of God is not a material kingdom visible to human sight; rather, it is a kingdom of the divine life
At the beginning of his ministry, especially during his first journey of ministry, Paul did not stay very long in any particular place
We need to learn from Pauls threeyear stay in Ephesus that sometimes we also may need to remain in a strategic place for the Lords interest
For this reason, the apostle Paul stayed there for a long time in order to establish a strong testimony for the Lord
The Greek word translated 'practices' also has the technical meaning of magic spells, and that may be the meaning here
Since each piece of silver approximated a day's wage, we can see that these books were worth a great deal of money
Having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a time'
Although Paul was an apostle set apart by God for the Gentiles , he was still concerned for the Lord's interest among the Jews
His primary concern was for the Body of Christ universally, not merely for his part of the New Testament ministry among the Gentiles
Because the Lord the Spirit dwelt in Paul's spirit , he must have purposed according to the leading of the Lord the Spirit
Concerning this time Paul says I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost for a door is opened to me great and operative and many are opposing
These words to the church in Corinth were written in Ephesus, where Paul stayed for three years on the third journey of his ministry
The time of 19:21 was crucial; it was both a time of opposition and of great opportunity to carry out a fruitful work for the Lord
The fact that Paul purposed in his spirit to go to Jerusalem indicates that he was absolutely for the Body of Christ
From this we see that Paul certainly was a qualified vessel to bear the testimony of God's New Testament economy
Paul also refers to this in 2 Corinthians 8, where he indicates that the giving of material things is altogether a matter of grace
If we study the book of Acts and all of Paul's Epistles, we shall have a clear view of the Lord's move on earth in His New Testament economy
It is likely that Paul had the burden to help Peter and James to improve or adjust the situation in the church at Jerusalem
The situation there was one of mixture-a mixture of God's New Testament economy with the things of the Old Testament dispensation
As we shall see, the mixture of God's New Testament economy with the old dispensation is very obvious in chapter twenty-one of Acts
We have seen that at the end of his second journey of ministry Paul went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church there
If you consult a map, you will see that Ephesus, in Asia Minor, was midway between Jerusalem to the east and Rome to the west
While Paul was laboring and facing attack at Ephesus, he had the heart to care for the situation in Jerusalem and also to see Rome
In the midst of his situation he could still purpose in his spirit to go to Jerusalem, and then express the desire to see Rome
As we have indicated, Paul eventually went to Jerusalem, and, in a marvelous and sovereign way, he did see Rome
Although his burden was for the ministry among the Gentiles, he was still concerned for the Lord's interest universally
Behind the idol worship were demons who instigated the uproar against the apostle to disturb and frustrate the preaching of the gospel
Those whom Demetrius had assembled became full of rage and 'they kept crying out, saying, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!
When they realized that he was a Jew, one voice arose from all for about two hours, crying out, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians'!
If your work is truly prevailing, eventually this prevailingness will touch the heart of the power of darkness
We should not do anything in ourselves to stir up trouble, thinking that this is a proof that our ministry is powerful and prevailing
Instead of being part of the propagation of Christ for God's kingdom, we shall in a practical way be a part of the kingdom of darkness
And some of the Asiarchs also, who were his friends, sent to him and entreated him not to venture into the theater himself'
If Paul had ventured into the theater, the Jews who were opposing him may have seized the opportunity to kill him
Humanly speaking, there was no reason for the people in Ephesus to behave so foolishly, crying out without knowing what they were doing
It was of the Lord's sovereignty that this disturbance took place at the end of Paul's three-year stay in that city
According to Acts 20:2 and 3, after Paul passed through Macedonia, he came into Greece and spent three months there
As we study these parts of the New Testament, we can see that in Paul the Lord had obtained an excellent vessel
The church in Jerusalem and the churches in Judea were not assigned to Paul for him to be burdened concerning them
Paul was concerned that the 'poison' from the source, the 'fountain,' in Jerusalem would contaminate the entire Body of Christ
In particular, there was traffic to Jerusalem from many different cities, especially at the time of the feasts
In chapter fifteen of Acts Paul and Barnabas went up to Jerusalem purposely to deal with the problem regarding circumcision
Paul went up to Jerusalem in chapter fifteen and again in chapter eighteen, at the end of his second ministry journey
In 20:21 Paul continues, 'Solemnly testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance unto God and faith in our Lord Jesus'
Paul's use of this word here indicates that he himself had experienced repentance unto God and faith in the Lord Jesus
He did not merely preach and teach; he testified of what he had passed through in his experience of repentance and faith
Due to the Jews' plot against him, he changed his route northward to Macedonia, and from there he returned to Jerusalem
Not only those in Jerusalem but also those in Asia and in Macedonia and Achaia were determined to apprehend him
Eventually, in his last visit to Jerusalem, Paul was caught by some Jews who had come to Jerusalem from Asia Minor
If we read carefully Galatians 2, we shall see that even James and Peter were both a cause of suffering to Paul
Peter was defeated by not doing anything about the situation, and James was defeated by compromising with the situation
Paul's word here is related to the Lord's New Testament move in propagating the resurrected Christ through the gospel
Paul's word in verse 27 about not shrinking from declaring all the counsel of God indicates that he carried on a great work in Ephesus
It is a little herb for the supply of life, not a big tree for birds to lodge in , not a huge religion like Christendom
In 20:28 Paul tells the elders of the church in Ephesus that the Holy Spirit had placed them among the flock as overseers
In other words, the work of the apostles concerning the churches should be absolutely the work of the Holy Spirit
To make an overseer a bishop of a district to rule over the elders of various localities in that district is grossly erroneous
The two titles refer to the same person: elder, denoting a person of maturity; overseer, denoting the function of an elder
According to 1 Peter 5:1-3, the elders are not to lord it over the flock; that is, they are not to exercise lordship over the ruled
Gods redemptive work acquired the church now Gods Person the allinclusive lifegiving Spirit cares for the church through the overseers
In the following message we shall consider in more detail the meaning of God's obtaining the church through His own blood
In 20:28 Paul charges the elders of the church in Ephesus 'to shepherd the church of God, which He obtained through His own blood'
God acquired, obtained, the church by purchasing it In order to purchase anything, we need to pay the price for that thing
In the conception of the Lord Jesus, the God-man, the divine essence out of the Holy Spirit was generated in Mary's womb
If the redemption accomplished on the cross was accomplished merely by a man, that redemption could not be eternally effective
Although it might be effective for the redemption of one person, it would not be effective for the redemption of millions of believers
Now we can see that our God is the God revealed in the New Testament and not merely the God as He is revealed in the Old Testament
They accuse us of saying that the two natures, the divine nature and the human nature, are mingled in Christ to produce a third nature
Those who have made this false accusation against us do so by twisting our word in the booklet The Four Major Steps of Christ
According to the Scriptures, we definitely believe that our Savior, who shed His blood for our redemption, died on the cross as the God-man
When the Lord Jesus, the God-man, died on the cross under God's judgment, He had God within Him essentially as His divine being
He was conceived and born of the Holy Spirit essentially and therefore the Holy Spirit was one of the essences of His being
The essential aspect was for the being, the existence, of the Lord Jesus, and the economical aspect was for His work, His ministry
We need to be impressed with the fact that when the Lord Jesus was on the cross dying for our sins, God was in Him essentially
The fact that God purchased the church with His own blood indicates the preciousness of the church in His sight
According to Paul's word in verse 28, the elders should consider the church very precious, regarding it as a treasure in the sight of God
The church in Ephesus was raised up, established, and carried on by Paul's ministry over a period of three years
According to Paul's word in verse 30, the purpose of the perverted ones is to draw away the disciples after themselves
We have seen that the intention of the perverted ones is to set apart a group of believers to become their following
We should take heed to Paul's word concerning wolves entering in from without and perverted ones rising up from within
Recently a young brother charged the young people in the Lord's recovery to become constituted of all the riches of the Life-studies
If the young people are constituted in this way, in the recovery there will be a great dispensational transfer
The main thing is that among us many living vessels are raised up and constituted of God's New Testament economy
The divine inheritance is the Triune God Himself with all that He has, all He has done, and all He will do for His redeemed people
To participate in God's inheritance requires us to be sanctified, and to be sanctified requires the word of God's grace
The Greek words rendered 'the weak' may also be translated 'the infirm,' referring to those who are weak physically ; hence, the poor ones
In verse 35 Paul asked the elders to remember the word of the Lord Jesus: 'It is more blessed to give than to receive'
If we carefully read Paul's word to the elders of the church in Ephesus, we shall see that Paul did not consider preaching a profession
The recovery is the Lords uptodate move for the carrying out of His New Testament economy which has not been fully carried out in the past
As those who have heard His word concerning His New Testament economy, we should say to Him, 'Lord, we are here for Your move on earth
A superficial preaching of the gospel and teaching of the Bible will never carry out God's New Testament economy
For the sake of the Lord's propagation, let us all become saturated with God's economy and then help others to be saturated with it
In addition to their study in the morning, these full time ones may use the remainder of the time to preach the gospel and contact people
Those who are burdened to go forth to labor full time in carrying out God's New Testament economy should not go out empty-handed
Rather, they must go out with the full knowledge of the truth, at least the full knowledge of the New Testament
May all the saints in the Lords recovery be saturated with the riches of Gods economy and then dig deeper into the Word to find more riches
Although they may reject the truth again and again, eventually the Lord will gain them through our faithfulness
After Paul's solemn and precious fellowship with the elders of the church in Ephesus , 'he knelt down with them all and prayed'
And having sought out the disciples, we remained there seven days; and they told Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem'
Now in 21:4 the Spirit took a further step to tell him, through some members of the Body, not to go to Jerusalem
He was actually practicing the Body life of the church, living according to what he taught concerning the Body of Christ
Acts 21:10 and 11 say, 'And while we remained there many days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea
The Holy Spirit told Paul again, not directly but through a member of the Body, what would befall him in Jerusalem
It was again the Head speaking through the Body, which Paul should have listened to in the practice of the Body life
Verse 12 continues, 'And when we heard these things, both we and those in that place entreated him not to go up to Jerusalem'
Since Paul would not be persuaded, the members of the Body were forced to leave this matter to the will of the Lord
Verse 14 says, 'And when he would not be persuaded, we were silent, having said, The will of the Lord be done'
James was the central figure relating to the problem in Jerusalem, for he was a leader among the apostles and elders in Jerusalem
After Paul greeted the elders, 'he related one by one the things which God did among the Gentiles through his ministry'
James addressed his Epistle to 'the twelve tribes in the dispersion' , indicating that it was written to Christian Jews
In His New Testament economy God no longer regards the Jewish believers as Jews for Judaism but as Christians for the church
The Jewish believers, as the church of God, should be as distinct and separate from the Jews as from the Gentiles
James, as a pillar of the church , in his Epistle to the Christian brothers, still called them 'the twelve tribes'
James 2:8-11 indicates that the Jewish believers at James' time were still practicing the keeping of the Old Testament law
James, the elders in Jerusalem, and many thousands of Jewish believers still remained in a mixture of the Christian faith and the Mosaic law
These were considered by the unbelieving Jews and even by the Jewish believers in Christ to be apostasy from Gods Old Testament dispensation
James and the other elders used the situation among the thousands of believing Jews in Jerusalem in order to persuade Paul
For him to have died to the law means that the obligation under the law, the relationship to the law, was terminated
Paul's departure from the law was neither apostasy nor heresy; it was the practice of the truth of God's New Testament economy
According to 21:21, Paul taught apostasy from Moses, telling the Jews not to circumcise their children nor to walk according to the customs
In verse 23 James and the elders did not propose something to Paul; rather, they required it of him, telling him to do what they said to him
Paying their expenses refers to the cost of the offerings which a Nazarite had to pay for the completion of his purification
We have emphasized the fact that the vow in 18:18 was a private vow in any place by the Jews for thanksgiving, with the shearing of hair
In order to do this, Paul had to enter into the temple and remain there with the Nazarites until the completion of the seven days of the vow
Paul might have intended in going to Jerusalem to clear up the Judaic influence on the church there, but God knew that it was incurable
On the other hand, they pointed out to Paul that in Jerusalem thousands of Jews believed and were zealous for the law
According to verse 24, Paul was told to be purified with the four men who had a vow on themselves and to pay their expenses
James and the elders told Paul to join himself to the four Nazarites so that the Jewish believers would see that he kept the law
It is very difficult to believe that Paul would be purified, enter into the temple, and wait for the offerings to be offered by the priest
He did this after writing the Epistles to the Galatians and the Romans, books that were written not long before he came to Jerusalem
As we shall see in a later message, there was an uproar against Paul , and he was seized by the Jews in Jerusalem
Let us further suppose that Paul had said to the brothers, 'I do not care for the temple, because God is finished with it
That prison in Philippi actually became a holy place, even the heavens, for Paul, whereas the temple in Jerusalem was a prison for him
In Matthew 22:7 He says, 'And the king was angry; and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city'
Concerning the coming destruction of the temple, the Lord said to His disciples, 'Do you not see all these things?
According to the description given by Josephus, the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple was thorough and absolute
A commander of the Roman cohort intervened, laid hold of him, ordered him to be bound with chains, and inquired concerning the situation
Through the intervention of the Roman commander, Paul was given the opportunity to defend himself before the rioting Jews
He came to Jerusalem with the positive intention and strong purpose to help the believers there to experience this dispensational transfer
Paul must have been unhappy when he was in the temple with the four Nazarites, for he did not have a way out of the situation
Paul, however, joined himself to the Nazarites and went with them into the temple, where he was seen by Jews from Asia and seized by them
As a result of what happened in Jerusalem, Paul was taken to Caesarea and was probably kept there for two years
While Paul was in custody in Caesarea, he might have considered putting into writing those materials that would complete his ministry
Far, Paul had written only six of his fourteen Epistles: Romans, Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and 1 and 2 Thessalonians
We need to be impressed with the Lord's sovereignty in completing Paul's transfer from the old dispensation to the new
In His sovereignty and wisdom, the Lord carried out such a complete transfer with Paul, and this transfer is fully recorded in the holy Word
In His resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit so that He may propagate Himself as the processed Triune God to produce the Body
Through such an application, God's people become living witnesses of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ
Although they had become believers in Christ, they were still strongly under the influence of their Judaic background
Because of this influence, it was impossible for them to abandon their background and to give up the atmosphere that prevailed in Jerusalem
For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who proclaim him in the synagogues, being read every Sabbath'
If James' concept had been widely accepted in Asia Minor and Europe, how could there have been one Body for Christ in a practical way?
Would there be two kinds of churches-a Judaic church for the Jewish believers and a Gentile church for the Gentile believers?
There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus'
Almost at the last minute, at the time when Paul's vow was about to be completed, the Lord came in, and there was a great disturbance
There is a great deal of mixture in Christianity, not just of the one element of Judaism, but also of many other elements
The mixture has gone to such an extent that among the millions of Christians very few know what God's New Testament economy is
As we study the book of Acts, we should learn to say, 'Lord, we need a great transfer, a dispensational transfer
We need to be transferred from degraded Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism into God's New Testament economy
He will bring His kingdom in, and following that there will be the ultimate consummation of God's New Testament economy
We cannot deny that we have seen this vision, and our testimony concerning it is becoming stronger and stronger
In our reading of Acts may we devote our full attention to and concentrate our entire being on the vision of God's New Testament economy
In Matthew 17:1-8 we have a clear revelation of the fact that with the coming of Jesus both Moses and Elijah were over
Moses and Elijah represent the entire Old Testament, with Moses representing the law and Elijah representing the prophets
The fact that Moses and Elijah were over indicates that the entire Old Testament, consisting of the Law and the Prophets, was over
In Acts 21 did Peter not have any remembrance of the vision he had seen in Matthew 17 and about which he later wrote in 2 Peter 1?
He had also seen Moses and Elijah together with Jesus, and then he saw that Moses and Elijah had disappeared and that Jesus remained alone
There is no indication that John, who was with Peter on the mount of transfiguration, said anything to James concerning it at that juncture
If we consider these three charges at the end of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, we shall see how strong, definite, emphatic, and absolute they are
According to the record of the New Testament, the James in Acts 21 was a brother of the Lord Jesus in the flesh
Along with the other brothers of the Lord, James was saved right after His resurrection, if not a little before that time
It is possible that James was present when one or more of the charges recorded at the end of Matthew, Mark, and Luke was given
It is correct to say that from the time of Acts 15 Paul was troubled deeply in his spirit about the situation in Jerusalem
Because of his heavy burden concerning this, during the course of his third journey of ministry, he was not able to forget Jerusalem
Apparently, Paul purposed to go to Jerusalem in order to bring financial help from the Gentile believers to those in Judea
In Paul's spirit and heart was the concern for the dreadful situation in Jerusalem, which was the source of the Lord's move on earth
He knew that no matter how much work he accomplished in the Gentile world, the polluted stream from Jerusalem would flow there
It seems that when Paul went to Jerusalem the last time, he did not have the opportunity to help matters there
Rather, the door was firmly closed, and he was pressed by James and the elders into a very difficult situation
Having no way out, he acted on the proposal to go to the temple in order to be purified with the four who had a Nazarite vow
In having a vow in the Jewish way Paul was living not as a Christian but as a Jew for he was following a Jewish practice not a Christian one
He intervened first to rescue Paul from the mixture in Jerusalem and then from the Jews who were plotting to kill him
In particular, Paul was given the opportunity to write the four crucial Epistles of Hebrews, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians
God now cares only for Christ's unique sacrifice, which has terminated and replaced all the Old Testament sacrifices
Turn from all the mixtures and the things replacing Me in the degraded churches and come back to Me as your everything'
Our need today is to experience a transfer from degraded religion to the reality of the all-inclusive Christ in the way of enjoyment
Rather, it offended them and it stirred up their jealousy and hatred to the uttermost, so that they made a plot to do away with him
Literally, the Greek words translated 'the people ran together' mean 'a running together of the people occurred'
Acts 213133 say And as they were seeking to kill him a report came up to the commander of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion
He took soldiers and centurions at once and ran down to them; and when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they ceased beating Paul
In His sovereignty, the Lord used the intervention of this Roman commander to rescue Paul from the Jews, who were seeking to kill him
In verse 5 Paul continued by saying that the high priest and all the council of the elders could testify for him
As we have pointed out, the 'Me' in verse 7 was a corporate Me, including Jesus the Lord and all His believers, all the members of His Body
The Lord indicated that Paul, by persecuting His followers, who were united to Him through their faith in Him, was actually persecuting Him
To say that they did not hear the voice means that they did not hear in the sense of understanding, as in Mark 4:33 and 1 Corinthians 14:2
The Lord said to me Rise up and go into Damascus and there it will be told you concerning all things which have been appointed for you to do
Hearing the word 'Gentiles,' they began to shout, 'Away with such a man from the earth, for it is not fitting for him to live'!
In chapter twenty-one Paul was forced into a very difficult situation, and he had no way to be released from it
We may be surprised that so many soldiers, horsemen, and spearmen were involved in transferring Paul from Jerusalem to Caesarea
In this message we shall focus our attention on Ananias' word to Paul in verse 16: 'And now, why do you delay?
Others know that in baptism they were transferred out of Adam into Christ, but for them this is only a doctrinal matter
No longer should we live in the sphere of Adam; instead, our living should absolutely be in the sphere of Christ
It would be a good practice for us when baptizing new believers to charge them to call on the name of the Lord Jesus
Just as we breathe and eat at the same time, so a person may be baptized and call on the Lord at the same time
No doubt, the most serious sins, according to Ananias, were the sins of persecuting and arresting those who called on the name of Jesus
But that was not only part of his conversion; it was also the beginning of his transfer from one realm into another
It is better to call on the Lord's name than to be silent, dead, and without any genuine contact with the Lord
To this we may reply, 'Perhaps you have never heard this kind of teaching, but certainly you have heard believers call on the Lord's name
It is likely that in the years you have been a Christian you have had at least some experience of calling on the name of Jesus yourself'
There have been many cases of those who called on the Lord's name without receiving any teaching concerning this practice
That brother who was hit by a car while riding a bicycle spent some days in the hospital, and day by day he called, 'O Lord Jesus'
If you call on the Lord's name day by day, you will be able to testify many things concerning your experience of the Lord
If a married brother will call on the name of the Lord Jesus, he will experience a genuine change in relation to his wife and truly love her
We are brought into another realm; we are brought into the kingdom of God, which is actually the propagated Christ Himself
If we realize this, we shall understand why the matter of calling on the name of the Lord is emphasized so much in the Bible
As the Spirit, He is omnipresent, and He is now working within us, waiting for the opportunity to spread in us
We have seen that in 21:31-39 the Roman commander intervened to rescue Paul from the Jews who were seeking to kill him
Following mans fall and his being sent out of the garden of Eden God wanted man in His dispensation to be responsible to his own conscience
Before fulfilling His promise to Abraham concerning the blessing of the nations in Christ , God put man under the test of the law
To conduct oneself 'in all good conscience before God,' as Paul did, was a great return to God from man's fall
Paul spoke this word to vindicate himself before those who accused him of being a lawless and even reckless person
Acts 23:2 and 3 continue, 'And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth
Paul replied I did not know brothers that he is the high priest for it is written You shall not speak evilly of a ruler of your people
For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge both
Paul wisely used this situation to his benefit, knowing that the Pharisees would take sides with him and then fight with the Sadducees
When Paul realized that it was helpful to him to take his stand as a Roman citizen, he did so, and this frightened the Roman officials
He cried out that he was a Pharisee, knowing that this would cause a fight between the Pharisees and Sadducees
Ministry is mainly related to work, to what the minister does; testimony is related to the person, to what the witness is
Assured by this clear word from the mouth of the Lord, Paul knew that he would go to Rome and there bear the testimony of the Lord Jesus
The plot in verses 12 through 15 manifested the falsehood and satanic hatred in the hypocritical religionists of Judaism
They came to the chief priests and elders and said, 'We have bound ourselves with a curse to taste nothing until we kill Paul
Literally, the Greek words translated, 'We have bound ourselves with a curse,' mean 'We have cursed ourselves with a curse'
It seems that the forty conspirators were saying that if they could not kill Paul, then they themselves would not live any longer
Acts 23:16-18 say, 'But the son of Paul's sister heard of the ambush, and he came and entered into the barracks and reported it to Paul
Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, Bring this young man to the commander, for he has something to report to him
During the night, the Roman commander sent Paul out of Jerusalem in the midst of a procession of four hundred seventy soldiers
Acts 23:31 says, 'So the soldiers, according to what was directed them, took up Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris'
Paul, however, was full of positive germs-the germs of the resurrected Christ for the propagation of Christ by imparting Him to others
As we have pointed out, the way, mentioned several times in Acts , denotes the Lord's full salvation in God's New Testament economy
In verse 14 Paul testified that according to the way the opposers called a sect he served the God of their fathers
The resurrection of the righteous, which is the resurrection of life, also includes the first, or the best, resurrection
All believers who are dead in Christ will participate in the resurrection from among the dead at the Lord's coming back
We have pointed out that in Acts 24:15 Paul says that there will be a resurrection both of the righteous and the unrighteous
Because they will be condemned to eternal perdition, their resurrection will be of shame and everlasting contempt
We have seen that for Paul to conduct himself in all good conscience before God was a great return to God from man's fall
Paul spoke such a word to vindicate himself before those who accused him of being a lawless and even a reckless person
Literally, the Greek word rendered 'was reasoning' means to say thoroughly, discuss , dispute; the same as in 17:2 and 18:4, 19
Because of Felix's intemperate lust, Paul, in order to show Felix's sinfulness, also reasoned with him concerning self-control
In their preaching to the Gentiles, both Peter in 10:42 and Paul here and in 17:31 stressed the coming judgment of God
The resurrected Christ at His coming back will be the Judge of the living before the millennium on His throne of glory
In order to gain favor with the Jews and with the hope of receiving money from Paul and his friends, he kept Paul in custody for two years
In 24:1-9 Paul was accused by the Jews' advocate, and in 24:10-21 he defended himself before Felix, the Roman governor of Judea
No doubt, the divine revelation Paul received from the Lord in Arabia came through his knowledge of the Old Testament
An example of this insight is Paul's allegorizing Sarah, Abraham's wife, and Hagar, Abraham's concubine, as two covenants
As indicated by his writings, Paul could understand the types in the Old Testament concerning Christ's Person and work
In Romans 7, in addition to the law of God , Paul speaks of 'the law of my mind' , which is the law of doing good
In contrast to the law of God, the law of doing good, the law of sin and death, and the law of the Spirit of life are not written laws
The human life has its own law, the satanic life has a sinful law, and the divine life, which is the highest life, surely has a divine law
To be sure, from his Christian experience Paul discovered that there is a higher law within him-the law of the divine life
Paul certainly received the revelation concerning the law of doing good, the law of sin and death, and the law of the Spirit of life
The point we are emphasizing here is that Paul must have received a great deal of revelation from the Lord during the time he was in Arabia
Although Peter and John were with the Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration they were silent concerning Gods New Testament economy in Acts 21
As we consider the scene portrayed in these chapters of Acts, we see that the central figure was actually the Lord Himself
Although Felix's purpose was to get money, the Lord had His own purpose in keeping Paul in custody in Caesarea
The content of Hebrews, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians may have been deep within him during the years in Caesarea
It would be very helpful to review especially Hebrews, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians against the background of Acts 15 through 24
Although he was not able to continue to work this out personally, he was given the opportunity to write the divine revelation
Without the books of Colossians, Philippians, Ephesians, and Hebrews, we would not have a clear view of God's New Testament economy
Although Paul uses this word in 1 Corinthians 917 he does not use it there for the specific purpose of unveiling Gods New Testament economy
Through Christ's human living, death, resurrection, and ascension, everything necessary for the accomplishment of God's economy was done
After breathing the Spirit into the disciples essentially , the Lord, in His ascension, poured out the Spirit upon His Body economically
The crucial focus of God's New Testament economy is the all-inclusive Christ as our life, our person, and our everything
If we see the vision of the divine economy, we shall praise the Lord for the two years He kept Paul in custody in Caesarea
Those years were a time of preparation for Paul, a chosen vessel, to put forth the completing revelation which he received of the Lord
Paul told Timothy to 'pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart'
We see that calling on the name of the Lord has a definite place in the carrying out of the New Testament economy of God
Not only should we ourselves call individually; we should also call on Him with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart
After considering the remaining chapters of this book, we shall have an even clearer view of the carrying out of God's New Testament economy
The Jewish religionists had the holy Bible the holy land the holy city the holy temple the holy priesthood and all the other holy things
Acts 25:1-3 says, 'Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea
What was practiced among the Jewish religionists in the case of Paul was not only fleshly and sinful but even devilish and hellish
Felix was more corrupt than the commander, Festus was more corrupt than Felix, and Agrippa was more corrupt than Festus
Felix's corruption is also seen in his sending for Paul frequently in the hope that money would be given him by Paul
When Paul was in custody for two years in Caesarea, he must have been disappointed with the church in Jerusalem
It seems that no one in the church was bold enough to stand for the revelation they had received and the vision they had seen
In the midst of that situation Peter should have stood boldly for the revelation he had received of the Lord, but he failed to do this
As we read from Acts 15 onward and also read Galatians 2, we see that Peter eventually was exposed in his weakness and even in his hypocrisy
In the parables in Matthew 21:33-46 and 22:1-14 the Lord Jesus expressed God's anger concerning the situation in Jerusalem
In Matthew 22:7 the Lord prophesied that God would send 'his troops,' the Roman troops under Titus, and destroy the city of Jerusalem
Because of James' compromising attitude and Peter's weakness, the church in Jerusalem may have been destroyed along with the city
The situation concerning the church would have been different if Peter and John had been as bold in Acts 21 as they were at the beginning
They called together a congregation and asked James to speak to them, thinking that he would speak positively about Judaism
They had received a mistaken impression of James because so many Jewish believers in Jerusalem were zealous for the law
From the record in Acts 21 we see that James even went so far as to push Paul into the 'trap' of an extremely difficult situation
Rather, the church there was allowed to remain in a declining condition, and Paul should have been very unhappy about that situation
Paul knew that he could not continue his work in the Gentile world until the situation in Jerusalem had been dealt with
Knowing that the main thing that was damaging the church life in the Gentile world was Judaism, Paul was burdened to go back to Jerusalem
Luke goes on to say, 'And when we heard these things, both we and those in that place entreated him not to go up to Jerusalem
By the Lord's sovereignty Paul was rescued from the hand of the rioting Jews into the hand of the Roman commander
After Paul defended himself before the Jews was bound by the Romans and defended himself before the Sanhedrin he was encouraged by the Lord
Sovereignly the Lord rescued him from that situation, and then He came to assure him that he would testify of Him in Rome
The religious people in Judaism were blind, devilish, and full of hatred, and the Roman politicians were corrupt
God's New Testament economy is to propagate the processed Triune God in the Person of the all-inclusive, resurrected Christ
What is needed is for us to allow God to carry out His New Testament economy in propagating the resurrected Christ
Not long after Paul presented a clear view of Gods New Testament economy by completing his writings of the divine revelation he was martyred
The degradation consisted of the loss of the all-inclusive Christ and the taking in of other things as replacements of Christ
As a result, many of us, including me, were born into an organized Christianity that had very little of Christ
Through the Lord's enlightenment we can see that Paul was burdened for the full revelation of God's New Testament economy
Paul's vision concerning God's New Testament economy is fully revealed and developed in his last eight Epistles
In the foregoing message we considered Paul's situation in relation to that of the Jewish religion, Roman politics, and the church life
Acts 25:1-3 says, 'Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea
Two years earlier, the Roman commander had used four hundred seventy soldiers to take Paul from Jerusalem to Caesarea
Now these Jewish leaders entreated Festus to bring Paul back so that they could set an ambush in order to kill him
He says, let able men from among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him'
In dealing with Paul, Festus was a fox and proposed that Paul go up to Jerusalem and be judged there before Festus
Without this appeal, he would have been killed by the plot of the Jews , and he would not have been able to write his last eight Epistles
Before his appeal to Rome, Paul had written only six Epistles: 1 and 2 Thessalonians, Galatians, Romans, and 1 and 2 Corinthians
Without these last eight Epistles, what a lack the divine revelation would have had and what a loss the church would have suffered!
Acts 25:12 says, 'Then when Festus had conferred with the council, he answered, To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go'
No doubt, the Roman politicians were corrupt, but the Roman government had strong laws which gave Paul a basis to appeal to Caesar
Verse 13 says, 'Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus'
Although Festus referred Paul's case to Agrippa and conferred with him about it, this case actually was not in Agrippa's jurisdiction
As we read 25:13-22 we see that Festus and Agrippa, officials of the Roman government, were 'playing' with Paul's case
The more we study the conversation between Festus and Agrippa, the more we realize both the Roman politicians were evil
In verse 26 the Greek pronoun rendered 'you' is in plural and refers to the commanders and prominent men who were present
As we shall see, Agrippa then gave permission to Paul to speak for himself, and he proceeded to defend himself before Agrippa
We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that in these chapters of Acts Paul was a genuine witness of Christ
As we have pointed out, Paul wrote Ephesians, Colossians and Philippians during his first imprisonment in Rome
No doubt, he intended to find a time in a quiet environment where he could write down the revelation concerning God's New Testament economy
In these four books we see a number of crucial points concerning the dispensational transfer that we have been emphasizing in these messages
Christ is the only offering God cares for, and all the Old Testament offerings were simply types of this unique offering
Now that Christ has come, all the other offerings should be terminated, and in fact they have been replaced and terminated
In 2120 James said to Paul You observe brother how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed and all are zealous for the law
Many messages are also given from Ephesians 5:22-25 about wives submitting to their husbands and husbands loving their wives
Although the ordinances and all racial differences were abolished by Christ on the cross, who preaches this word today?
Even in the twentieth century, racial differences are still promoted in order to maintain a separation of the races
Many of those who attended Bible schools and seminaries can testify that they were never taught that Christ with
You also need to consider yourself, in particular where you are in relation to the carrying out of God's New Testament economy
As we shall see in chapters twenty-seven and twenty-eight of Acts, it took quite a long time for Paul to travel from Caesarea to Rome
The Greek words rendered, 'Especially since you are an expert,' may also be translated, 'Since you are especially expert'
Paul vindicated himself by saying that, even before his conversion, he was a proper person and lived the strict life of a Pharisee
Resurrection, therefore, is related to one's eternal future, whether he will be happy in eternity or suffer perdition
From this we see that resurrection is an important matter in the Scriptures, for it concerns our eternal destiny
We have strongly emphasized the fact that this 'Me' is corporate, comprising Jesus the Lord and all His believers
Rather the Lord wants to use a body of His witnesses who bear a living testimony of the incarnated crucified resurrected and ascended Christ
In His appearing to Paul on the way to Damascus, the Lord clearly told him that He appointed him not only a minister but also a witness
We have seen that as a living witness of Christ, Paul had testified concerning Him in Jerusalem and would testify of Him in Rome
In all the trials through which he passed Paul was not merely teaching or ministering; he was continually bearing a testimony
Of speaking this way, Paul testified to Agrippa that the Lord had met him and appointed him a minister and a witness
There is a great difference between studying the Bible to learn theology and studying the Bible in order to see Christ
As Paul was on the way to Damascus, Christ revealed certain things to him, and in those things Paul saw Christ
The Lord indicated that He would reveal more things to Paul, and in those things the Lord Himself would appear to him
The book of Revelation is an excellent illustration of the Lord appearing in the things revealed to the apostle John
In this vision of the lampstands John saw the Lord walking among the lampstands as the High Priest dressing the lamps
Our consideration of the phrase 'in which' in Acts 26:16 may be helpful in showing us the way to study the Bible
Acts 26:18 speaks not only of the opening of the eyes but also of the turn from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God
He has his authority and his angels , who are his subordinates as principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world
To be transferred to God is to be transferred to the authority of God, which is God's kingdom belonging to light
James said to Paul, 'You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed, and all are zealous for the law'
In Colossians 1:12 Paul says that the Father has qualified Us 'for a share of the portion of the saints in the light'
In the Old Testament the twelve tribes of Israel each received an allotment, a portion, of the good land for an inheritance
Paul spoke of light instead of life because both the religious people and the Roman politicians were in darkness
Acts 26:24 goes on to say, 'And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with loud voice, You are insane, Paul!
In chapters twenty-seven and twenty-eight of Acts Luke gives us a long narration of Paul's voyage from Caesarea to Rome
The first of the points conveyed in Luke's lengthy narrative of Paul's voyage is Satan's attack on the apostle
Acts 27:4 says, 'And from there we put out to sea and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were contrary'
Later, after boarding an Alexandrian ship, they 'sailed slowly for a considerable number of days and came with difficulty off Cnidus'
Eventually, after putting out to sea again, 'there beat down from the island a hurricane wind called a northeaster'
The Lord was sovereign over the centurion named Julius who brought Paul to Rome and over all the soldiers who were with him
As we shall see, this word indicates that there on the boat Paul had a little kingdom composed of two hundred seventy-six citizens
If we read this portion carefully, we shall see that here Paul was living the very life that he aspired to live in Philippians 3
In his account Luke says that at Myra 'the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it'
The sailors were experts in sailing the ship, and they knew all about the wind and the sea, but they did not have the insight that Paul had
Verses 15 through 17 continue And when the ship was caught by it and was not able to face the wind we gave way to it and were driven along
To get control of the small boat' was to secure on deck the small boat which, in calm weather, was attached by a rope to the vessel's stern
According to verses 18 and 19, they began to jettison the cargo and throw the ship's gear, or furniture, overboard
Luke's narration, as an account of the Lord's move on earth, does not stress doctrine but the testimony of the Lord's witnesses
Because he spoke such a definite word about running aground on a certain island, we may consider this word a prophecy
In 27:27-44 we have a contrast between the base thought and folly of the sailors and the soldiers and the ascendant wisdom and care of Paul
The sailors attempted to flee out of the ship, but they were caught by Paul, who was watching over them like a king
Verse 35 says, 'And when he had said these things, he took bread and gave thanks to God before all; and he broke it and began to eat'
What the centurion did in keeping the soldiers from their intention was once again the sovereignty of the Lord to preserve His servants life
Because of the Lord's sovereign protection of Paul, all those on the ship were brought safely to land, to an island called Malta
Acts 28:1 and 2 say, 'And having been brought safely through, we recognized then that the island was called Malta
While they were expecting for a long time and beheld nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god'
Paul, who had been living like a king ruling over his kingdom, now became a physician to heal the father of Publius
Verse 9 goes on to say, 'And when this happened, the rest also in the island who had sicknesses came to him and were healed'
No wonder the people honored him and his companions with many honors , that is, with the best respect and highest regard!
Acts 28:10 says, 'And they honored us with many honors; and when we put out to sea, they put on board the things for our needs'
After staying three days in Syracuse, they arrived at Rhegium, and then they came to Puteoli, where they found brothers
Apparently the apostle, as a prisoner in bonds, had entered the area of the dark capital of the Satan-usurped empire
It was in Paul's uplifted humanity with its human virtues that Christ with His divine attributes was expressed in his voyage
The important matter is that here we see a picture of the church life in ancient times, a church life that was very enjoyable
The Judaizers had tried to frustrate him from going to the Gentiles, but the Lord sovereignly brought Paul to Rome
Paul's being in Rome was a strengthening to the church in Rome, in particular because a good number of Jews had been saved
Acts 28:30 says, 'And he remained two whole years in his own rented dwelling, and welcomed all those coming in to him'
The Lord indicated that it was not for them to know times or seasons, which the Father had placed in His own authority
If we live Christ only in a situation that is according to our culture, character, constitution, and disposition, our living is not genuine
After Paul arrived in Rome as described in chapter twenty-eight, he wrote the Epistles of Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Hebrews
As he was writing this, Paul may have been saying to himself, 'All the ordinances of the law have been abolished
By the time Paul wrote Ephesians 2, he was much more thorough than he was when he circumcised Timothy in Acts 16
His experiences in chapters fifteen through twenty-eight of Acts caused him to be more thorough regarding circumcision

He changed from being One who had only the divine nature to the One who now has both the divine nature and the human nature
When Paul wrote this portion of Hebrews, he may have been saying to himself, 'I was wrong to go back to Jerusalem
There was no need to go back to Jerusalem in order to take care of Judaism, for that was to go back to the camp
When he was making the voyage from Caesarea to Rome, he was outside of Judaism bearing reproach as one in bonds
