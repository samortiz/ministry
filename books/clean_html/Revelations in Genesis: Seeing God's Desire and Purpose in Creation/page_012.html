<h2 class="head3">Ruling for God in Order to Recover the Earth</h2>
<p>God gave man authority so that man might rule for Him in order to recover the earth. Because of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, the earth was usurped by Satan; hence, God&rsquo;s desire is to recover and regain the earth. Therefore, verses 26 and 28 speak of God&rsquo;s giving authority to man so that man would have dominion over the earth. If man reigns over the earth, God can recover the earth under His authority through man.</p>
<p>Man always feels that the heavens are good. But according to the Bible, God feels that the earth is good. If man could choose between the heavens and the earth, he would prefer to live in the heavens. God, however, prefers the earth. God desires and yearns for the earth. In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord taught the disciples to pray to the Father who is in the heavens, &ldquo;Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth&rdquo; (6:9-10). Proverbs 8:31 says, &ldquo;Rejoicing in His habitable earth; / And my delight was in the sons of men.&rdquo; This means that when the Lord created the world, He rejoiced in His habitable earth and delighted to dwell among the sons of men. Psalm 8:1 says, &ldquo;O Jehovah our Lord, / How excellent is Your name / In all the earth.&rdquo; The last verse of this psalm says, &ldquo;How excellent is Your name / In all the earth!&rdquo; (v. 9). The thought in this psalm is the same as the thought in Genesis 1 that is focused not on the heavens but on the earth.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that God wants to return to the earth in order to gain the earth. God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages is also to recover the earth so that He may return to the earth. God desires His authority to reach earth. For this reason, the Lord taught the disciples to pray to the Father who is in the heavens, saying, &ldquo;Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth&rdquo; (Matt. 6:9-10). When Satan rebelled, the earth was occupied by him and became the sphere of his rule; consequently, the will of God cannot be done on earth as in heaven. Therefore, the Lord told us to pray in this way and ask God to work so that His authority can be carried out on the earth. When God&rsquo;s authority is carried out on earth, the kingdom of God is on the earth. A kingdom is a realm for ruling, and the extent of a kingdom is the extent of its authority. Today the kingdom of God does not yet encompass the whole earth. As a result, the authority of God is not yet exercised over the whole earth, and the will of God cannot be done on the earth. Throughout the ages God has been seeking to resolve this problem.</p>
<p>When the Lord comes again and the millennial kingdom begins, the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ (Rev. 11:15). In eternity the dwelling place of God will descend onto the new earth. Hence, in Revelation 21:1-2 the apostle John says, &ldquo;I saw a new heaven and a new earth...And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.&rdquo; At this time the earth will be taken back from Satan and fully recovered by God.</p>
<p>When the earth is recovered by God, His authority will be carried out on the earth. Furthermore, His kingdom, His will, and His glory&mdash;the three major things that the Lord prayed about in Matthew 6&mdash;will be accomplished (vv. 10, 13). The kingdom of God will be on the earth, the will of God will be done on earth as it is in heaven, and the glory of God will be manifested on the earth. This was God&rsquo;s original intention when He gave man authority to rule for Him. If man had not failed but had remained in God&rsquo;s hand to rule for Him, God&rsquo;s enemy would have been dealt with, the earth would have been recovered by God, and the authority of God would have been carried out on the earth. God&rsquo;s twofold purpose would have been fulfilled in man in the beginning.</p>
<p>We should worship and praise God, because His twofold purpose will be accomplished in man. His purpose in the beginning is still the same today. The Bible reveals that after man was created, the struggle between Satan and God was centered on man. God wants to gain man to fulfill His purpose, but Satan also wants to gain man to carry out his evil intent. Regardless of when or where, as long as God gains man, He has a way to fulfill His purpose to be expressed and to exercise His authority. However, if man is gained by Satan, Satan has a way to carry out his evil intent to destroy God&rsquo;s plan, frustrate God&rsquo;s expression, and hinder the authority of God. Hence, man is the central figure in the universe; man is the focus of the struggle between God and Satan. God has given man such a high and noble status. May God have mercy on us so that we may see this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Having Rest</h2>
<p>God desires man to have His image to express Him, and He desires man to have His authority to deal with His enemy. God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages has been focused on fulfilling these two aspects of His desire. God is working to fulfill His desire, He created us for His desire, and He saved us for His desire. When these two aspects of His desire are accomplished, that is, when man has the image of God to express Him and the authority of God to deal with His enemy, God will have rest.</p>
