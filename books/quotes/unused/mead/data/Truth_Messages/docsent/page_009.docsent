   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD S CONCEPT OF LEADERSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we need to cut straight the Word concerning leadership in the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The meaning of leadership in the Bible is completely different from our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What the Lord said about leadership in Matthew 20:20-28 and 23:8, 10, and 11 shatters the human thought of leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the natural, human concept, a leader is higher than others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in these chapters the Lord says that whoever desires to be great among His people must be a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the Lord s concept of leadership is the opposite of the natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yes, there is a need for leaders among the Lord s children today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These leaders, however, need to realize that, in God s New Testament economy, leadership means slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you would be a leader among the Lord s children, you must be a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are genuine and honest, we shall admit that we love leadership, but not slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such is the human heart.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even the young sisters like to be leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If they cannot be number one, or at least be number two, they are disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not bring the natural concept of leadership into your reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Bible, I repeat, leadership means slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you are truly a slave among the Lord s people, you must be willing to clean the rest room, vacuum the floor, arrange the chairs, and serve as an usher.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How different this is from the worldly view of leadership!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Lord s recovery we should not ask for the janitor when we see the need for cleaning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, we should all serve as janitors.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Let us drop our natural concept of leadership and return to the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>CHRIST, THE ONE LEADER</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to God s economy, there is just one leader among His people the Lord Jesus Christ: Neither be called leaders, because One is your Leader, the Christ Matt 23:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Anyone who considers me the leader in the Lord s recovery is not practicing the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If anyone asks you who is the leader in the church, you need to say that the leader is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To answer in this way indicates that we know the truth and practice the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If someone claims that Witness Lee is the leader, you need to tell him, Witness Lee is our slave.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Catholic Church claims that Peter was appointed by Christ to be the unique leader.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Testament, however, reveals otherwise.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yes, in the Gospels and the first part of Acts Peter is first, and his name is mentioned first.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But Galatians 2:9 says, James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here Peter Cephas is mentioned not first but second.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Peter stood up with the eleven on the day of Pentecost, he was as strong as a lion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, in Galatians 2 he was cowardly, for when the brothers came from James, Peter refused to eat with the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Prior to that time, he practiced the truth concerning eating with Gentile believers according to the vision he received in Acts 10.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when the brothers came from James, he no longer practiced the truth in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Paul saw that Peter and the others did not walk uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, he rebuked Peter before all Gal 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through his weakness, Peter was damaging the truth of the gospel, the truth that both Gentile believers and Jewish believers are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This indicates that in Galatians 2 Peter s spiritual capacity had diminished.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Peter was not backslidden, but his spiritual capacity was less than that of James.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this reason, in Galatians 2:9 the name of James is mentioned before the name of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, the fact that brothers came from James indicates that James represented the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Another indication that James, and not Peter, represented the church in Jerusalem is seen in Acts 21:17 and 18: And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here we are told that Paul and his co-workers went not to Peter but to James, for all the elders, including Peter, were in James home.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>James was the one who represented the church in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A further indication of this is seen in the conference held in Acts 15.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this conference of apostles and elders, Peter spoke first and then Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In a conference the leading one does not speak first, but last.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The final word in this conference was given by James, as indicated by these words: And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me Acts 15:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then in verse 19, James gave his decision: Wherefore I decide that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>. When we put all these verses together, we see that Peter was not the unique leader in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When Catholics claim that Peter was such a leader, we need to know how to cut straight the Word regarding this so we can present a clear picture to them.</S>
