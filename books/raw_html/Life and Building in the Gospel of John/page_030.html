        <h2 class="head1">RECEIVING GRACE ACCORDING TO HIS FULLNESS</h2>
<p>Our initial salvation is the first step in our receiving of His fullness; we experience that the Lord Jesus is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world, who was judged by God, and who suffered the penalty of death on the cross. When we heard the gospel and realized that we were sinners, we did not feel peaceful within and our conscience condemned us. At that time, the Holy Spirit declared to us that the Lord is the Lamb of God (16:13), who bore our sins on the cross and received God&rsquo;s judgment on our behalf, shedding His redeeming blood so that our sins could be forgiven. Quite spontaneously, we thanked the Lord for bearing our sins, suffering judgment on our behalf, and shedding His blood. Thus, we received of His fullness, which includes His bearing of our sins, His redeeming us from sins, and His suffering judgment on our behalf. We escaped judgment and received the forgiveness of sins through grace according to His fullness.</p>
<p>When we received Him, thanked Him, and worshipped Him, our inner being became bright and full of light. Furthermore, we became clear concerning our relationship with God, our origin and destiny, and the meaning of human life, which were previously confusing and incomprehensible to us. At the time of our salvation, even though we could not explain the light in our inner being nor speak of Him being light in us, this was our true condition. Thus, in addition to receiving Him as the Lamb, we received of His fullness as light.</p>
<p>When we received the Lord and there was the shining of light in us, we had a sense to no longer speak as we once did and even to no longer go to the places we once enjoyed. Spontaneously, we stopped doing many things. Even the things that we once looked at no longer appealed to us. Without any conscious decision, our taste for things changed. The only explanation was that the Lord as life was living in us. When we received Him as life, our taste spontaneously changed. We no longer liked the things that we formerly liked, and we no longer loved the things that we formerly loved. Spontaneously, our taste for our hobbies fell away. This was an issue of receiving of His fullness.</p>
<p>After we believed in the Lord Jesus, we felt that we were close to God and more transcendent than before, but we also were more willing to be lowly. Formerly, the further we were from God, the more we felt that we were great and noble, but after we were saved and closer to God, there was more of a willingness in us to be lowly. On one hand, we fellowshipped with God and were transcendent, but on the other hand, we were very lowly before others. This is an experience related to incarnation. When the Lord came to the earth, He was God, but He was also a lowly man from Nazareth. This shows that we received the content of incarnation according to His fullness.</p>
<p>As we follow Him and fellowship with Him, we will have many experiences related to His fullness. We will sense the Lord&rsquo;s kingship, realizing that the Lord Jesus is not only the Savior but also the King. When we began to meet in northern China over thirty years ago, I came across a portion in the Psalms that says, &ldquo;O Jehovah of hosts, my King and my God&rdquo; (84:3). This verse was so powerful that it caused me to prostrate myself before God and say, &ldquo;O God, I have never acknowledged You as my King. Thank You and praise You! Today I have a deep feeling that You are not only my Savior, my Lord, my God, and my Father, but also my King. I want to submit to Your authority.&rdquo; At that time I began to understand the meaning of being prostrate before the Lord. After following the Lord for a period of time, many children come to the realization that our Lord is the glorious King. This is an experience of receiving of His fullness.</p>
<p>When we receive grace according to His fullness, we also will experience His sweet and balanced humanity. The more we love God, look like God, and are filled with God inwardly, the more we will express such a humanity outwardly. When I began to serve the Lord, I was rather strict. For example, when I was invited to a meal, I would sit without swaying my body or speaking loosely. When someone politely passed a dish to me, I would feel that he was being artificial. When the host remarked that not enough food had been prepared, I would think, &ldquo;This is not truthful. There are so many dishes on the table, but he still says that there is not enough food.&rdquo; Although I outwardly partook of the meal in a proper way, I would condemn others inwardly for being hypocrites and full of pretense. As I began to receive more of the Lord&rsquo;s fullness, however, I began to realize that my attitude was lacking in simple humanity. I was more like a stiff piece of wood than I was a man. Thankfully, the flavor of my humanity has increased over time.</p>
<p>About twenty years ago, I was having fellowship with some brothers and sisters in northern China. They were asking many questions, and I was answering them continually. We talked from the morning until one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. Realizing that they must be hungry, I asked, &ldquo;Are you all hungry?&rdquo; A recently saved sister immediately replied, &ldquo;Oh, we are not fleshly.&rdquo; This word was very strong, and it sounded as if eating would cause them to be fleshly. I could only smile. Then they continued to ask questions, and I continued to answer them. After two o&rsquo;clock I said, &ldquo;There are probably many brothers and sisters who need to eat.&rdquo; Another new sister replied, &ldquo;None of us wants to be a Martha.&rdquo; These comments showed that the newly saved ones were lacking in a flavor of genuine humanity. They had the Word, but in their experience the Word had not become flesh. If we truly have the Word in our experience, the Word will become flesh. Christians should not merely pursue spirituality and neglect practical things. If a meal had been prepared, we could have continued our fellowship in an even more pleasant environment. Preparing a meal does not make one a Martha but rather a man, like Jesus the Nazarene. There is nothing fleshly about being concerned for the saints; it is even more spiritual because it testifies of the Word becoming flesh.</p>
<p>The fullness of the Lord Jesus is too great. In the Gospel of John alone there are at least thirty-one items of what He is. He is high, because He is God; He is low, because He is a man, even a man from a poor family and a despised place. He is truly high and truly low; He is truly great and truly small. The content of God is in Him, and the content of man is in Him as well. He is so full.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
