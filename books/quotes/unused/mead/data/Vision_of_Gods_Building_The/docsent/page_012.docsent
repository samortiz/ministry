   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BABEL AND SODOM VERSUS ABRAHAM'S TENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Noah's example of walking in God's presence and being for God's building did not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Soon after the flood Noah's descendants began to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They joined together and forgot about living in a tent with an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead they began to build a city named Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"And they said one to another go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And they said, go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth" Gen 11:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Notice that these fallen people built their city with mud, straw, and brick, rather than stone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These are the exact materials used later by Pharaoh of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Stone is a creation of God, while brick is a product of human hands.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's building is always of stone, while Satan's counterfeit building is always made with brick, the work of human hands.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The people of Babel began to build a tower, for their intention was to reach unto heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Fallen man always has the thought of going to heaven, but God's desire is to come down to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Basically, this tower signified man's intention to accomplish something in opposition to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These fallen builders, in the same character as Cain, said "Let us make us a name " They forgot God's name and sought to make a name for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How many cities there are today which are named after famous men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Human builders always seek to enhance their own names.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But "the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded" Gen 11:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God beheld a strange sight in this city.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The people were one, for they had one language.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They were built up, but not in the way of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Their building and the way of their building was Satan's counterfeit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And the Lord said, "Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language" v. 7 . The Lord said, "Let us " This signified the three persons of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Triune God came down and judged this city, destroying fallen man's work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The name of the city was called Babel, because "the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Babel is an Old Testament Hebrew name of which the Greek rendering is Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Both have the same meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Babel was the source, the commencement of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let us now see the building of God in contrast to this second city built by fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God called a man named Abraham out of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Abraham was typical of the local people but God separated him from the building of fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Notice now what Abraham did.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He did not start to build another city, calling it by his own name.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He did not even build a city in the name of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God brought Abraham to an elevated place called Canaan and there told him to build an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Abraham obeyed, erecting an altar and pitching a tent for his dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Again we see the tent with an altar in contrast to the city built by fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Again God recovered the life of His building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Noah's descendants had lost it, but God recovered His building with the calling out of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, Abraham in the land of Canaan was still in a dangerous position.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On one side was the city of Babel, and on the other side the city of Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Abraham was separated from Babel and kept also from Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But Abraham's nephew Lot drifted into the city of Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day while Abraham was sitting in the door of his tent three men appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was the Lord with two angels Gen 18:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord asked Abraham, "Where is Sarah thy wife?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He replied, "In the tent."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That is a good answer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After a time of fellowship Abraham's visitors arose and journeyed toward Sodom, the city of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Abraham, unwilling to leave their presence, brought them on their way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As they went towards Sodom, "Abraham stood yet before the Lord" v. 22 . He was in the presence of the Lord, not in the city of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Chapter 19 of Genesis tells a pitiful story.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There came two angels to Sodom the Lord was not included He would not go there .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The angels did not visit the city in the day while the sun was shining, but in the evening at the setting of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As darkness was descending, the two angels followed Lot, sitting not at a tent door like Abraham, but in a gate of Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a picture of a man in a fallen state, fallen in the darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>History reveals that Babel was principally a city of idol worship.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But Sodom was a city of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many today find it easy to be separated from the "building" of idol worship.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But it is not so easy to be kept from drifting into the city of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must see these contrasts.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Abraham lived in a tent opposite to Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>And then he lived in a tent opposite to Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Here we see the contrast between a tent and the fallen cities of man.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Notice also how Abraham trained his son Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Genesis 24:67 reveals how Isaac brought his new bride into his mother's tent.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>And in Genesis 26 Isaac is again shown in his old age pitching his tent in the valley of Gerar.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is all very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Abraham's grandson, Jacob, also dwelt in a tent Gen 25:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Esau, Jacob's brother, was a hunter, a man of the field; but Jacob was a man who dwelt in a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, three generations Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob dwelt in a tent, not in any city.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God is called the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Spiritually speaking, this signifies that these men lived in God's building rather than in the building of the fallen human race.</S>
