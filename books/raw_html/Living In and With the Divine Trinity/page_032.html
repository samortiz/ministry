<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EPHESIANS 6:10-11, 17</H2><P>All six chapters of the book of Ephesians are constructed with the Triune God. In Ephesians 6 the Divine Trinity is moving for the defeating of His enemy, for dealing with His opponent. For the Triune God to defeat His enemy, we need to be empowered in the Lord [the Son] and in the might of His strength (v. 10). Then we need to put on the whole armor of God [the Father], that we may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil (v. 11). Finally, verse 17 says that we need to receive the sword of the Spirit which [the Spirit] is the word of God [the Father]. Through the Divine Trinity, we receive the power and strength, we have the armor, and we also have the sword. If we did not have the power or the strength, we could not fight. For this we need to trust in the Son. We also need a covering to protect us. This is the armor, and the armor is of the Father. Then we need an offensive weapon against the enemy. This is the Spirit as the sword. The Son is the power and the strength for our fighting, the Father's armor is our covering, and the Spirit's sword is our offensive power. This shows that even in the spiritual warfare, we need the Divine Trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FIRST JOHN 4:2</H2><P>In 1 John 4:2 we can again see the coordination of the Divine Trinity. This verse shows us the Spirit of God [the Triune God including the Father], confessing Jesus Christ [the Son], being out of God [the Triune God]. The Spirit is not independent. He is of Someone, of God the Father. Furthermore, He does something, not for Himself but for the Son. He confesses Jesus Christ, the Son. Again we see the Three working together for one goal&#151;to exalt the Son as the very embodiment of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FIRST PETER 4:14</H2><P>First Peter 4:14 says, "If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you." When we are reproached in the name of Christ [the Son], we are blessed. We are blessed because the Spirit of glory and of God [God the Father] rests upon us. Even in the persecution of the believers, the Three of the Divine Trinity are fully involved. They are wrapped up with the persecuted believers. When the believers of the Son are reproached, the Triune God is enjoying His rest by staying with them in their persecution. The Spirit of glory and of God the Father is resting upon the believers. "Resting" in this verse is a kind of staying, abiding, comforting, sustaining, covering, and protecting. While the Spirit of glory is staying with us, the suffering ones, He becomes our sustaining power, our protection, our covering, and our victory; yet with Him it is a resting. This explains the real situation of Christian persecution. When we are being persecuted, our Triune God is covering us, protecting us, sustaining us, and comforting us. He is resting upon us.</P>
