In this Passover, Christ is not only the Passover lamb but also the entire Passover. To be our Passover, He was sacrificed on the cross that we might be redeemed and reconciled to God. Thus, we may enjoy Him as a feast before God. In this feast no leaven is allowed to be present. Sin and the redeeming Christ cannot go together.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

The passover portrayed in this chapter is an all-inclusive type of Christ as our redemption to begin our experience of God's salvation. It is a full development of Christ's redemption first indicated in Gen. 3:21 (see notes there). The entire passover is a type of Christ (1 Cor. 5:7); Christ is not only the lamb of the passover (John 1:29) but also every aspect of the passover.

At the time of His crucifixion Christ was both a sheep and a goat: in Himself He was altogether good, but as our Substitute He was a sinner, in that He was made sin on our behalf (2 Cor. 5:21).<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

An enemy needs reconciliation, which includes propitiation and forgiveness but goes further, even to resolving the conflict between two parties. Our being reconciled to God is based on Christ's redemption and was accomplished through God's justification (3:24; 2 Cor. 5:18-19).

The separation of blood and flesh indicates death. Here the Lord clearly indicated His death, that is, His being slain. He gave His body and shed His blood for us that we may have eternal life. To eat His flesh is to receive by faith all that He did in giving His body for us; and to drink His blood is to receive by faith all that He accomplished in shedding His blood for us. To eat His flesh and drink His blood is to receive Him, in His redemption, as life and the life supply by believing in what He did for us on the cross. By comparing this verse with v. 47, we see that to eat the Lord's flesh and drink His blood is to believe in Him, because to believe or to believe into is to receive (1:12).<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12038' href='#ref_12038'>Exo 12:15</a></span> Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread; on the first day you shall remove leaven out of your houses, for whoever eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel.<br><b>fn 2 </b>In the Feast of the Passover the lamb was to be eaten with unleavened bread (v. 8 and note 2). In the continuation of the Passover the eating of unleavened bread for seven days (a full course of time) signifies that for our entire Christian life, from the time we receive Christ and are saved, we should continue our enjoyment by eliminating everything sinful. During the seven days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, no leaven was to be found in the houses (v. 19), and no leaven was to be seen among the people of Israel (13:7). This signifies that, although it is impossible for us to be completely without sin, we must eliminate any sin that is seen; i.e., we must forsake the sin of which we are conscious (cf. Heb. 12:1). To deal with manifested sin is to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread (1 Cor. 5:7-8). If we tolerate sin once it is exposed, we will lose the enjoyment of the fellowship of God's people (v. 19; 1 Cor. 5:13). The only way to eliminate sin is to daily eat Christ as the crucified, resurrected, and sinless life, signified by the unleavened bread.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, It is the bread which Jehovah has given you to eat.<br><b>fn 1 </b>Heb. man hu, from which the word manna derives. Manna is a type of Christ as the heavenly food that enables God's people to go His way (John 6:31-35, 48-51, 57-58). According to God's economy, Christ should be the unique diet, the only food, strength, satisfaction, and sustenance, of God's chosen people, and they should live by Him alone (Num. 11:6; John 6:57). In order to be food to us, Christ was incarnated, crucified, and resurrected to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit to indwell our spirit (John 6:63 and notes).<br>Although it is known that manna came from heaven (v. 4), the element and essence of manna are a mystery. Manna did not belong to the old creation; nevertheless, it could nourish man's physical body. Thus, it must have contained certain elements and minerals that were a part of the old creation. As the real manna, Christ also is mysterious. In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), yet He has a body that can be seen and touched (Luke 24:36-43). Thus, it is difficult to say whether Christ is spiritual or material.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

Manna was fine (v. 14), indicating that Christ is even and balanced and that He became small enough for us to eat; round (v. 14), indicating that as our food Christ is eternal, perfect, and full, without shortage or defect; white (v. 31), showing that Christ is clean and pure, without any mixture; like frost (v. 14), signifying that Christ as our heavenly food not only cools and refreshes us but also kills the negative things within us; like coriander seed (v. 31), indicating that Christ is full of life that grows in us and multiplies; solid (implied in the fact that the people ground it between two millstones or beat it in a mortar, then they boiled it in pots-Num. 11:8), signifying that after gathering Christ as manna, we must prepare Him for our eating by grinding, beating, and boiling Him in the situations and circumstances of our daily living; like bdellium in appearance (Num. 11:7), indicating the brightness and transparency of Christ; in its taste like the taste of cakes baked in oil (Num. 11:8), signifying the fragrance of the Holy Spirit in the taste of Christ; in its taste like wafers made with honey (v. 31), signifying the sweetness of the taste of Christ; and good for making cakes (Num. 11:8), indicating that Christ is like fine cakes rich in nourishment.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.<br><b>fn 3 </b>The water flowing out of the smitten rock typifies the Spirit (John 7:37-39). Through incarnation Christ came to the earth as a rock. On the cross He was smitten by the authority of God's righteous law to accomplish God's redemption. His side was pierced, and living water flowed out for God's people to drink (John 19:34 and note). This living water is the water of life in resurrection, the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit as the ultimate issue of the Triune God (1 Cor. 15:45; see note 391 in John 7). The source of the water of life is the throne of God and of the Lamb-the redeeming God (Rev. 22:1). Hence, the water of life is the Triune God flowing out to be our life. The flow of the living water began from the throne in eternity, continued through the incarnation, human living, and crucifixion of Christ (John 4:10, 14; 19:34), and now flows on in resurrection to supply God's people with all the riches of the divine life (Rev. 22:1-2). When we identify ourselves with the smitten Christ, the divine life as the living water flows out of us (John 7:38). The flowing of the water of life in resurrection is for the building up of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13) and the preparation of the bride of Christ (Rev. 19:7), both of which will consummate in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:9-10; cf. Eph. 5:23, 28-30).<br>To drink of the water of life, we first need to be positioned to drink (1 Cor. 12:13), and we also need to be thirsty (John 7:37; Rev. 21:6). Then we need to come to the Lord (John 7:37; Rev. 22:17), to ask of the Lord (John 4:10), to believe in the Lord (John 7:38), and to call on the name of the Lord (Isa. 12:3-4; Acts 2:21).<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

For our running of the race we should all drink the same spiritual drink and should not drink anything other than the all-inclusive Spirit.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

The land of Canaan with all its riches typifies the God-given Christ with all His unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8; Col. 1:12-13). For the carrying out of His economy, God needs a people and a land (see note 3<sup>1</sup> in Gen. 15). For Christ's person in God's economy, there is the need of a people to be His genealogy to bring Him into humanity. For Christ's kingdom, there is the need of a land. Although the earth was created by God, it has been usurped by Satan. Thus, God uses His people to gain a part of the Satan-usurped earth to serve as a base for Him to set up His kingdom.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
