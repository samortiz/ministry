   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BOUNDARY OF A LOCALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that all the churches in Scripture are local churches, but the question naturally arises, What is a scriptural locality?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we note what places are mentioned in God's Word in connection with the founding of churches, then we shall be able to determine what the extent of a place must be to justify its being regarded as a unit for the forming of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Scripture the localities which determine the boundary of a church are neither countries, nor provinces, nor districts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nowhere do we read of a national church, or a provincial church, or of a district church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We read of the church in Ephesus, the church in Rome, the church in Jerusalem, the church in Corinth, the church in Philippi, and the church in Iconium.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now what kind of places are Ephesus, Rome, Jerusalem, Corinth, Philippi, and Iconium?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are neither countries, nor provinces, nor districts, but simply places of convenient size for people to live together in a certain measure of safety and sociability.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In modern language we should call them cities.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That cities were the boundaries of churches in the apostolic days is evident from the fact that on the one hand Paul and Barnabas "appointed elders for them in every church" Acts 14:23 , and on the other hand Paul instructed Titus to "appoint elders in every city" Titus 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Word of God we see no church that extends beyond the area of a city, nor do we find any church which does not cover the entire area.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A city is the scriptural unit of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From Genesis and Joshua we learn that cities in olden days were the places where people grouped together to live; they were also the smallest unit of civil administration, and each possessed an independent name.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Any place is qualified to be a unit for the founding of a church which is a place where people group together to live, a place with an independent name, and a place which is the smallest political unit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such a place is a scriptural city and is the boundary of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Large cities such as Rome and Jerusalem are only units, while small cities such as Iconium and Troas are likewise units.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Apart from such places where people live a community life, there is no scriptural unit of the churches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Questions will naturally arise concerning large cities such as London.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Are they counted as one unit-locality, or more than one?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>London is clearly not a city in the scriptural sense of the term, and it cannot therefore be regarded as a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even people living in London talk about going "into the city," or "into town," which reveals the fact that, in their thinking, London and "the city" are not synonymous.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The political and postal authorities, as well as the man on the street, regard London as more than one unit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They divide it respectively into boroughs and postal districts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What they regard as an administrative unit, we may well regard as a church unit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As to country-places which could not technically be termed cities, they may also be regarded as unit-localities.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is said of our Lord, when on earth, that He went out into the cities and villages Luke 13:22 , from which we see that country-places, as well as towns, are considered to be separate units.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This division of churches according to locality is a demonstration of the marvelous wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Had God ordained that the Church be divided into churches with the country as their boundary, then in the event of one country being vanquished and absorbed by another, the church would have to change its sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Were a province to mark the limit of a church, the sphere of the churches would be frequently altered because of the frequent change of provincial boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The same holds true in respect of a district.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The most stable of all political units is a village, a town, or a city.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Governments, dynasties, and countries may change, but cities are seldom affected by any political change.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are cities that have passed from one country to another and still have their original name, and there are cities in existence today that have retained the same name for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So we see the divine wisdom in decreeing that a locality should fix the boundary of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since the limits of a locality mark the limits of a church, then no church can be narrower than a locality, and none wider.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Word of God recognizes only two churches, the universal Church and the local churches; there is no third church whose sphere is narrower than the local, or else wider than the local and yet narrower than the universal Church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A local church admits of no possible division, and it admits of no possible extension.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You cannot narrow its sphere by dividing it into several smaller churches, nor can you widen its sphere by linking several local churches together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Any church smaller than a local church is not a scriptural church, and any church larger than a local church, and yet smaller than the universal Church, is not a scriptural church either.</S>
