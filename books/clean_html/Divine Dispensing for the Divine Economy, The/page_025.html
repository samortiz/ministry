<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Lamb-feeding</H2><P>The issue of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity as the divine life is also lamb-feeding (John 21:15, 17). After a new believer is baptized, we should sit down with him to feed him, and come back as soon as possible to have a meeting in his own home. Then we can return regularly to feed him. In feeding the new believers, we should not talk too much. Mothers feed their babies in a very simple way. They know what the babies need, and they know how to feed them in just a few minutes. If we converse with new believers in the old way, they will not be helped.</P><P>The first need of the new believers is to breathe the Lord. Therefore, we must feed them with calling on the name of the Lord. After their baptism we may spend ten minutes to tell them in a simple way, "Now, Jesus is your Lord. He is the Spirit within you. You need to call on Him: Oh Lord Jesus!" This will help them very much. We should teach the new ones in this way. Children practice many things that their mothers teach them, even though they may not understand them.</P><P>If possible, on the day after their baptism, we should return to feed the new ones with reading and pray-reading the Bible. We may tell them to read two or three verses from the Gospel of John every day. Then we can open to John 1:1 and read it and pray-read it with them. After this, the new believers will know how to pray-read. We should not help the new ones merely in a human way. We should care for them in a divine way by helping them to keep pray-reading. Then spontaneously we may sing a short song. On another occasion a new one may confess a wrongdoing to us. We can then pray with him, and he may spontaneously have the feeling to rectify the wrongdoing. We do not need to teach the new ones too much. They will learn to do what we do. If we kneel down and pray, they will also kneel down and pray with us. This is the new way, and this is the best way to feed them. The old way is too traditional, habitual, and religious. The new way is practical and very effective. We must not take the old way of conversing, teaching, and charging. We should instead go to the new believers and live a proper Christian life in front of them in a very simple way. They will learn by this and follow us. After a month of meetings in this way, the new ones will grow much.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Increase of Christ<br>as the Body of Christ and the Bride of Christ</H2><P>The issue of breathing, drinking, and eating Jesus is the flow of the living water, fruit-bearing, and the feeding of the lambs. The divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity as the divine life also issues in the increase of Christ, which is the Body of Christ and the bride of Christ (John 3:29-30). John 3:29 says, "He who has the bride is the bridegroom." The bridegroom is Jesus. As the issue of feeding on Him, drinking of Him, and breathing Him in, we will go to bear fruit and feed the new believers, who are the members of His Body, which is His bride. This is the message of the Gospel of John.</P><P>We must not merely learn the techniques of bearing fruit and feeding the new ones. We have to live a daily life of breathing, drinking, and feeding on Christ, taking Christ every day as our very element and essence. We must not only receive Him, but also digest Him, assimilate Him, and let Him become the content of our being. Then we will be one with Him. When we go out for the gospel, we will go out in oneness with Him and with His authority. Our going out must also be in the new way, not in the old, traditional, habitual way. We have the living Lord within us. We can always follow Him to know what to do and what not to do. In this way we will baptize sinners and return again and again to feed them. Then we can bring them into our group meetings to be taught and perfected, and they will also spontaneously learn how to prophesy that the church may be built up.</P>
