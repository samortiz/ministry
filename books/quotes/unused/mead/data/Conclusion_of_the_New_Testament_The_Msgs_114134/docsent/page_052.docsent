   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is righteous, holy, and living.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, our defiled conscience needs to be purified so that we may serve Him in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, in our conscience we have been washed positionally by the blood of Christ.</S>
