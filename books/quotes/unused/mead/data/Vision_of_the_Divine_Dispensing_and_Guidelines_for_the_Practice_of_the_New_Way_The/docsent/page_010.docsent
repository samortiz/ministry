   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and Asking Them to Begin Reading</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One Chapter of the Bible Before They Go to Bed,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Beginning That Very Evening</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In addition to calling on the name of the Lord, we should tell them that we, the Christians, not only have to pray, but must read the Bible as well.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason, we need to teach them how to pray-read the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After this, we should start having a morning revival time with them the next morning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should ask them to get up fifteen minutes earlier than usual and make an appointment to have morning revival with them over the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In addition, we should ask them to start reading a chapter of the New Testament every night before they go to bed, starting from that very same evening.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can ask them to start from the book of Romans or from 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This will not only assure them of having a good sleep, but will give them much long-term benefit.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Supplying Life to Them and Leading Them On</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, we should have morning revival over the telephone every day, and on the other hand, once every three or four days, we should visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During the first month after baptism, we should visit them seven or eight times and should fellowship with them face to face, supplying life to them and leading them on step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What I have fellowshipped with you has been tested and tried to quite an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is definitely a workable way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not only should we all receive it, but we should practice it accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do this we will not be disappointed, but will reap at least a thirty percent increase.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May the Lord bless all of you.</S>
