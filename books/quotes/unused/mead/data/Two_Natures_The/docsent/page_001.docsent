   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO NATURES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A TALK WITH YOUNG BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The following article first appeared in Vol. 1, No. 5 of The Christian magazine in March 1926.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A great number of people who have believed in the Lord Jesus as their Savior have discovered a new experience soon after they have believed: in their hearts it seems that there are two natures.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These two natures are incompatible with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of the two natures, one is evil and the other is good.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes, when the good nature gains the upper hand, a person becomes very loving, patient, good, and meek.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes, when the evil nature prevails, the person becomes very jealous, ill-tempered, wicked, and stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those believers who are under this kind of condition experience sudden ups and downs in their life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes, their spiritual condition seems to be on the mountaintop; at other times, it seems to be in the deep valley.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This kind of spiritual life is also like the waves of the sea, at times high and at times low.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Believers under this kind of condition are bewildered!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why is there the joy?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why is there the sorrow?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why do we sometimes love a certain person that much and have the ability to tolerate so much of others' ridicule?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why at other times are we so void of love and so impatient?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When such a person is at his spiritual peak, he experiences unspeakable joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he is spiritually low, he is filled with sorrow and depression.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before such a person believed in the Lord, he did not have much feeling even when he sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But now it is very different.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He may speak a wrong word or commit a wrong act by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Formerly, these things would have been considered trivial, and the conscience would not have been bothered at all.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But now, he falls into much self-condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although no one condemns him, he rebukes himself for doing these things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such self-condemnation is quite unbearable.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It causes the believer to feel ashamed and embarrassed, to feel guilty and condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only after he finds out that the Lord has fully forgiven his sins and he has recovered his spiritual joy can he feel happy again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, this kind of happiness does not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those believers who remain on this level of life soon find themselves caused to stumble again and their previous joy once more lost!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Soon after, they find themselves committing the same sin they committed before!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It seems so natural to fall into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is as if a power from within has overpowered them in an instant; they are led uncontrollably to speak the wrong words and do the wrong things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Under such a condition, the believers invariably become penitent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They invariably make many vows and resolutions before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They set up for themselves many ordinances to bind themselves, in the hope that they will not commit the same error again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the same time, they ask for the cleansing of the Lord's blood afresh and seek for another filling of the Holy Spirit by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After this, they seem quite satisfied and think that their last sin is behind them, that from now on they are on their way to holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, the fact always turns out contrary to their wish.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Soon, perhaps a few days later, they fail again!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once more they fall into deep remorse, bemoaning their own failure and feeling sorrowful at heart; their hopes for holiness have been dashed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All their resolutions and regulations cannot help them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although they may receive the Lord's forgiveness after this, it becomes difficult for them to believe that they can keep themselves from sinning again.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although they still pray that the Lord would keep them, their heart is full of doubts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They begin to wonder if the Lord can really keep them from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Young believers frequently fall into this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Almost daily they come under self-condemnation and sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes they may condemn themselves several times a day or even several dozen times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Such a life of wandering in the wilderness causes them to doubt even their own regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Does not the Scripture say, "He cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God" 1 John 3:9 ?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They think that if they always sin, it probably means that they are not yet regenerated!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The despondency and disappointment at such times are difficult to express even with their tears.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since these ones have experienced much failure, they make up their mind to be on the alert, to resolve to fight the last battle against the indwelling sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They remind themselves to watch out for their former weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They try purposely to improve themselves in areas where they constantly failed before.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They resolve as best they can to put off "the sin which so easily entangles us" Heb 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This of course affords them much help in their outward conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yet the inward activities of sin continue as before; there is no quelling of its energy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the end, they fail again.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Consider the example of the temper.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After a believer realizes that his besetting sin is his quick temper, he will try to control himself in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This may work with lesser irritations; it may work in one or two temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, though he may hold back his temper temporarily, further irritations from others will cause his temper to break loose.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He may succeed a few times, but as soon as he becomes a little careless, he loses his temper again.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At the time of the temptation, he may experience much conflict in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the one hand, he thinks that he should not lose his temper and should be gentle.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>On the other hand, he considers the unreasonableness and offense of the other party, and he feels it necessary to vindicate himself by punishing such behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This kind of conflict is found commonly among believers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Unfortunately, the result is often failure rather than victory.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Once they exhaust their patience, they fail again.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A genuinely regenerated person often goes through this kind of experience at the beginning of his Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We do not know how many tears are shed because of defeat in this conflict!</S>
