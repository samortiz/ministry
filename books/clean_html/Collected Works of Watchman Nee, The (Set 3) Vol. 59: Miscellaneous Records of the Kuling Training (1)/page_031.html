<h2 class="head1">RESURRECTION</h2><h2 class="head2">The Need for Resurrection</h2><p>While the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was perfect in His character but not in His power. Our Lord was limited in power. This is the reason it was not enough for Him to live thirty-three and a half years. He needed to go through resurrection. This is something beyond our mental power of comprehension. Brothers and sisters, this is a tremendous matter, but it is useless to try to fathom it with the mind. Without revelation, no one will be interested in this subject, just as a village simpleton has no interest whatsoever in the atomic bomb. Why did the Lord need resurrection? He was limited in time and space on earth. Some who came and looked for Him had to remove a roof to reach Him (Mark 2:1-4). One had to press against the crowd to touch the hem of His garment (5:24-27). The centurion was an exception; he had a faith that bypassed the pressing of the crowd. The Lord commended his faith as being great. His servant was ill, and he asked the Lord to say a word so that his servant would be healed (Luke 7:6-10). The centurion's word, in effect, acknowledged that the Lord was beyond time and space. His servant was immediately healed. Here was a man who had revelation. The Lord was conceived through the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:20; Luke 1:35). As far as His character was concerned, He was the pinnacle of God's creation of man. Yet as far as His power was concerned, He was still limited. This is the reason there is the need of resurrection.</p><h2 class="head2">Resurrection Securing for God<br />the Representative Man</h2><p>Let us consider the meaning of resurrection. Resurrection means that God has secured a representative man for Himself. Hebrews 1:5 says, "You are My Son; this day have I begotten You." According to Acts 13:33, this verse refers to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Resurrection means that the model man Jesus is now no longer bound by anything. He lives now for eternity. The Lord's resurrection broke all the barriers of the natural realm. First Peter 1:3 says that we are saved and regenerated through His resurrection. There was the possibility of the Lord's death when He lived on the earth, but after His resurrection, death was destroyed, and He lives forever and ever. The potential and the power of death were forever destroyed.</p><p>Hallelujah! God worked on man for four thousand years. The man He sought after is finally here. God declared to the Lord Jesus at His resurrection, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You" (Acts 13:33). He did not declare this in Bethlehem at the Lord's birth. It was after the Lord's resurrection from the dead that God pronounced with joy, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You." Through the Lord's resurrection God secured the man He wants.</p><h2 class="head2">Resurrection Annulling<br />the Limitation of Time and Space</h2><p>What is the meaning of resurrection? It means that a man has broken through all barriers, even the greatest barrier of all&mdash;death. All barriers were destroyed through the Lord Jesus in His resurrection. The New Testament speaks a few times of the raising of the dead. For example, there were the widow's son in Nain (Luke 7:11-15), the daughter of Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue (Matt. 9:18-25), and Lazarus (John 11). However, even the raising of Lazarus was merely a kind of coming back to life or resuscitation. He was bound by grave clothes and would not have been able to walk if others had not loosed him. Eventually, Lazarus still died. Only the Lord's resurrection was a total destruction of death. When He resurrected, He faced death no longer. The Bible shows us that only the Lord is resurrection. Mr. T. Austin-Sparks said in reference to the Lord's resurrection that with Him there is no such thing as coming and going. With Him there is only a matter of appearing and disappearing. He does not come; He appears. He does not go; He disappears. It is no longer a question of coming and going but of being visible or not visible. In John 20:16-17, on the morning of His resurrection, the Lord told Mary the Magdalene not to touch Him because He was not the same as before. As for Thomas's touching His side, it was a matter of faith. He wanted Thomas to touch in faith. It is possible to touch the resurrected Lord by faith. It is not a matter of coming and going with the resurrected Lord; it is altogether a matter of revelation. Man's biggest limitations are time and space, but these two things cannot limit the Lord. Resurrection means that all limitations have been broken. Hallelujah, our Lord Jesus is no longer bound by anything today! As long as we live in the Holy Spirit, we can touch the Lord. The Lord is in our midst, and all barriers are broken.</p><p>The Lord journeyed from beyond the Jordan to Judea after Lazarus died. When He arrived, Martha said, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died." The Lord said, "Your brother will rise again." She answered, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day" (John 11:21-24). The Lord immediately replied, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live....Do you believe this?" (vv. 25-26). In effect, the Lord was saying, "I am the last day! If you believe into Me, you will see resurrection now. Wherever I am, time no longer exists, and the `last day' no longer exists." As soon as resurrection comes in, the element of time is over. If resurrection is absent, time is a big factor, but wherever resurrection is, time is no longer an issue because resurrection is not bound by time.</p><p>Moreover, resurrection is not bound by space either. The two disciples on the way to Emmaus saw the resurrected Lord, but the disciples in Jerusalem also saw Him on the same day (Luke 24:13-35). When the Son of God resurrected, He transcended geography and time. In His resurrection there is no such thing as a sequence of time. He does not have a time schedule for His work. He does not have to wait three or five years for something to happen. The matter of time and space no longer exists. Today everyone on the whole earth can touch Him at the same time.</p>
