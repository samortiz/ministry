   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our Christian life is a life of holding forth the word of life to present it to others as an offering, a contribution.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We hold forth the word of life as luminaries shining in this age v. 15 . As to our location, we are in the world; as to our condition, we are in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This age is corrupt, dark, evil, and perverted.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But we are on this earth shining in this age as luminaries to reflect the divine light of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A luminary does not have light in itself, but it reflects the light of the sun.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul tells us to work out our own salvation, and then he mentions that we need to do all things without murmurings and reasonings v. 14 . As we have pointed out, both murmurings and reasonings frustrate us from carrying out our salvation to the fullest extent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to carry out our salvation, to bring it to its ultimate conclusion, by our constant and absolute obedience with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have received this salvation by faith, but now we must carry it out by obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To receive it by faith is once for all, whereas to carry it out is lifelong.</S>
