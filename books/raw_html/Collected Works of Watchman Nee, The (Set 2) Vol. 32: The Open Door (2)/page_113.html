<h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Chen Jai-seng,<br />Han-Jiang</h2><p>Last month I went with Brother Chai Gi-chen and others to Si-Shan, Di-Lu, to learn to work on sowing. I received much teaching and encouragement through this hands-on experience in the field. One feels satisfied when he stays at home and realizes his emptiness when he travels around. I felt ashamed when friends visiting asked for help and I could not render them any. In my spirit I have often mused over Revelation 3:17 and have felt unqualified to work for the Lord. O Lord, be merciful to me and bend me. Please do not forget to pray for me. I have received and read Issue No. 18 of The Open Door. The two things that Brother Witness Lee spoke of are indeed our present need.</p><p>I heard that the Lord provided Brother Nee a smooth journey back to Shanghai. We are very pleased about this. Thank the Lord. We hope that we can grasp some of the riches of grace the Lord has given to him. I heard that Brother Chen Ke-san is conducting a Bible study in Sien-You, while Brother Chai Gi-chen is staying in Pu-Tien. I no longer rent the house in Gung-Kou. On July 17 I moved to Shang-Lin-Chun. This little village has about thirty local brothers and sisters. They have been persecuted for many years by their fellow villagers. But by the grace of the Lord, they have been able to stand fast. They have all experienced household salvation. Because there are meetings in this village, the believers in neighboring villages come to worship and remember the Lord together. May glory be unto Him forever, amen. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Jai-seng<br />August 4</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Wu Ren-jieh</h2><p>Because our distance from the throne is the same, I have been remembering the kinfolk in Christ while looking daily to the unmatched One. May He gain the fullness, the glory, and everything in the church, amen.</p><p>Brother Nee's word on the natural strength being dealt with and Brother Lee's word on being careful in touching the Lord's work have given me a deeper understanding of the words: "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling." I am always willing to be taught. Brother Chai Wen-bin, a responsible brother, has the burden to start an orphanage here. Originally, he intended to start one in Chuenchow but has not found anyone whom the Lord can entrust the matter to. Furthermore, the political situation is unsteady, and it is not wise to proceed. When he read The Open Door, he found that Brother Lan Tsi-yi had started such a work in Hankow, and he would like to offer X dollars. Please direct this sum to Brother Lan. We are happy that Brother Nee has returned safely. Please give my regards to all the co-workers.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Wu Ren-jieh<br />August 16</p>
