   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let me illustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are some brothers and sisters who, whatever they do, do it most unobtrusively.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If they bring you a drink of water, they watch for an opportunity when you are looking out of the window, then steal in quietly, put down the water, and steal out again.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When you turn around you see a glass of water but have no idea who put it there.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have met many brothers and sisters who do things like that.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When they do anything for you, they do it so silently and secretly, you don't know who has done it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And we say That's their temperament!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But there are brothers and sisters of a totally different disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They always make a great display.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If they bring you a glass of water, they bang the glass so that the noise reaches you before the water does; then in they walk with a great flourish and say, "A glass of water, Brother So-and-so!"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once I visited a certain church where one of the sisters had been appointed to act as hostess.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Oh! that sister simply filled the place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>She was so big she obscured the whole church; I could not catch sight of the elders, or the deacons, or the brothers, or the sisters for the sight of her.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Wherever I looked, there she was.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If she brought you anything, she always did it ostentatiously.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let me tell you, brothers and sisters, that was her temperament!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let me tell you, our God is not like that.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He never makes any display: He is too great.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the marvel is that He remains so hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We know He is great, exceedingly great, unutterably great; yet He could make Himself small enough to take up His abode in a man, Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And this man belonged to a poor home and grew up to be a carpenter a very ordinary carpenter, working in a very small way, until He was thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Who ever would have thought He was indwelt by God, the infinite God?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>True, after He entered upon His public ministry, He did at times work signs and wonders, and He did at times say extraordinary things; but then He would withdraw and hide Himself again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you study the Scriptures carefully, you will see that God has the kind of temperament that dislikes ostentation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He likes to work secretly rather than openly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He created the universe and then hid Himself in it, until we do not know where to find Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He took up His abode in a man, but that man was almost unknowable.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On first meeting Him, men just saw a man called Jesus, of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On meeting Him a second time, they recognized in Him a man of more than average intellect; and on the third time of meeting, they thought He must be a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When they met Him still later, they felt, "Oh, this man is surely more than a prophet!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But to discover exactly who He was, was no easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even His disciples, during their three and a half years in His company, did not arrive at a true knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All this tells us that He was continually hiding Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He would manifest Himself for a moment and then would conceal Himself again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once, on the Mount of Transfiguration, He revealed Himself clearly; but He hid again and even told the three who were with Him not to tell others what they had seen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And though they had been witnesses of the transfiguration, later on they themselves were tossed between faith and doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What was the cause of their bewilderment?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Just this that no sooner had He revealed Himself than He would hide Himself once more.</S>
