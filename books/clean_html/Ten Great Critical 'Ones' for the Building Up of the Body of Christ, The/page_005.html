<h2 class=head4>c. Any Interpretation of the Unique Bible Should Take Care of Its Minor Revelations but Should Not Have Any Minor Revelations Interpreted against the Major Revelation of This Unique and Consistent Bible</h2><p>The main revelation is the center of the Bible. Besides the main revelation, the central revelation, there are minor revelations. They are branches of the major revelation. A tree has a trunk with branches. The trunk is one, but the branches are many. We should stress the trunk, the central revelation of the Bible, but we should not forget the “branch” revelations, the minor revelations.<p>Also, any interpretation of the unique Bible should not have any minor revelations interpreted against, not in line or in harmony with, the major revelation of this unique and consistent Bible. First Corinthians 11 speaks of a revelation concerning the headship in which all the sisters should cover their head, but head covering is not the Bible’s central revelation. We should not neglect this branch revelation, but we should not be legalistic about it either. Some people argue about what color or what shape of head covering the sisters should wear. These arguments are nonsense. Head covering reminds us that we all have to be under the headship of our Head, as Christ is under the headship of God the Father. We must have the reality of the branch revelations.<h2 class=head2>B. The Unique, Major Revelation of the Unique Bible</h2><p>The unique, major revelation of the unique Bible is the unique contents of God’s economy (see point II. D.). The Bible has been studied by Christians for nearly two thousand years with many interpretations. It is hard to decide which interpretations are correct. Brother Watchman Nee spent much time to study and collect all the proper, major interpretations of the Bible. Thank the Lord that when I was laboring closely with him for eighteen years, he told me what he had collected. Thus, today our interpretation of the Bible is according to the proper interpretations throughout the past nineteen centuries.<p>The Recovery Version actually is not my version because my understanding of the Bible depends absolutely on Watchman Nee’s interpretation. Furthermore, Brother Nee’s interpretation depended upon the proper interpretations of all the saints in the past nineteen centuries. This does not mean that Brother Nee or I did not see anything by ourselves but that we have laid our understanding upon the proper foundation.<h2 class=head1>II. ONE GOD—ONE ECONOMY</h2><p>God is self-existing and ever-existing (Exo. 3:14), and God is triune—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14). The Triune God has one heart’s desire (Eph. 1:5, 9). According to His heart’s desire, God made His eternal economy (1 Tim. 1:4b; Eph. 1:10; 3:9) to make man the same as He is in life and nature but not in His Godhead and to make Himself one with man and man one with Him, thus to be enlarged and expanded in His expression, that all His divine attributes may be expressed in human virtues.<p>God carries out His eternal economy through a number of steps. First, He created man in His image and after His likeness (Gen. 1:26-27). Then God became a man in His image and after His likeness. He became a man in His incarnation to partake of the human nature (Heb. 2:14a). He lived a human life to express His attributes through man’s virtues. He died an all-inclusive death and resurrected to produce the firstborn Son of God and become the life-giving Spirit (Rom. 8:29; Acts 13:33; 1 Cor. 15:45). This was all for Him to dispense Himself into His chosen people to regenerate them with Himself as their life for producing many sons—many God-men (1 Pet. 1:3)—for the forming of the churches with His many sons and for the building up of the Body of Christ with His brothers as the members to be the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God, consummating in the New Jerusalem as His eternal enlargement and expression.<p>We may say that we have already heard the truth concerning God’s economy, but to hear is not sufficient. We have to present this truth to others, to give messages to them. Paul exhorted Timothy to stay in Ephesus to charge some there not to speak things other than God’s economy (1 Tim. 1:3-4). We have to be controlled by the vision of God’s economy. We should not speak anything other than God’s economy.
