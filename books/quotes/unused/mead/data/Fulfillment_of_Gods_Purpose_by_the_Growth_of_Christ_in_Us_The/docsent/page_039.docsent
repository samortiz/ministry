   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING TO DISCERN OUR SPIRIT FROM OUR SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to learn to discern our spirit from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hebrews 4:12 says that the word of God is living and operative as a sharp two-edged sword piercing to the dividing of soul and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Just as we illustrated before, our mind as a part of our soul may doubt that we are a child of God, but our spirit still has the assurance that we are a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our mind is doubting, but our spirit is praising.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we consider a certain brother in our mind, we may be unhappy with him, but deep within us, in the spirit, we would say that he is a good brother.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, we can see the difference between the soul and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The question is always, "Would we go along with our soul or with our spirit?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many times we go along with the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We do not care for our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we go along with our spirit, we are one with all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When a sister goes shopping, she may feel good in her soul about buying something, but there is a "no" deep within her spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many times we are clear about the difference between our soul and our spirit, but we are short of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We would not go along with the sense in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead, we go along with our soul, and we are deadened by our unwillingness to follow the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many times in our soul we like to talk and tell others certain things, but deep within our spirit we have the sense not to say much.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At this time do we go along with our soul or with our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many times we go along with our soul to talk, and the more we talk, the more we are deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This again shows us the difference between the soul and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Doctrinally, it is hard to discern the difference between the soul and the spirit, but practically, it is somewhat easy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to look to the Lord for His mercy that we could have the grace to go along with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The best way to take grace at such a juncture is to say, "O Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we are in the department store, there might be a struggle between our soul and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we call, "O Lord" repeatedly, this will bring us the grace to make us strong in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The grace will strengthen us to go along with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we exercise our spirit in this way, a habit will be built up in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever there is a struggle between our soul and our spirit, we should always say, "O Lord, O Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we say, "O Lord," we are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we open up our mouth to call on the name of the Lord, Satan will be chased away.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the simple way to turn ourselves to the spirit.</S>
