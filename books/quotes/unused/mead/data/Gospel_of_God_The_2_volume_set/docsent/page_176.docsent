   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If a person were to lose his salvation after his believing in the Lord Jesus, what would he do with God's collateral?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For instance, I have a house which rents for fifty dollars a month.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A brother comes to rent it by first putting down five dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is short of forty-five dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He says that the forty-five dollars will surely be given to me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If after a while he does not give me the forty-five dollars, what should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I would confiscate his five dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, God cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, the promise God has given us cannot fail.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even if God had not given us the deposit, as long as He has spoken, He will fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even if God does not give us a pledge or a deposit, when He says that He will give us an inheritance, He will surely keep His word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because our mind is full of legality, God gave us the Holy Spirit as the proof for us to know that God has given us the deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since we have the deposit, will He not give us the inheritance?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is a wonderful portion in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Genesis 24 shows us the old servant of Abraham seeking a wife for Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The servant brought with him a lot of riches and precious things from Abraham's house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After he had settled with Rebecca concerning her marriage to Isaac, he gave all these things to Rebecca as engagement gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, the old servant gave her all these, such as what was on her nose, fingers, head, neck, and hand, to adorn her.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the other hand, all these things were an indication to Rebecca that they were only a little token, that eventually all of Isaac's possessions would be hers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After we are saved, due to our unbelief, we may think that God did not have the intention to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We wonder what would happen if salvation were merely God's toy for us, which, after a few years or a few decades, may be lost and we may become lost again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is concerned that there may be doubts in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He puts the Holy Spirit within us as the proof to assure us that He will definitely give us the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>My friends, when we look at the Holy Spirit within us, we will realize that we definitely will obtain the eternal inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If God is not going to give us the future inheritance, why did He give us the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If God is not going to give us the future inheritance, the pledge of the Holy Spirit is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our salvation cannot be lost, because the Holy Spirit has been given to us as the pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as this Holy Spirit is with us, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible says that He will be with us until the day of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we can say assuredly and with concrete proof that we will obtain the future inheritance.</S>
