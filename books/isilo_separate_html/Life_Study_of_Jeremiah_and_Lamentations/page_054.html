The Bones of the People<br>Being Brought Out from Their Graves<br>and Spread Out to the Sun,<br>to the Moon, and to All the Host of Heaven</H2><P>The bones of the kings of Judah, of its princes, of the priests, of the prophets, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will be brought out from their graves and spread out to the sun, to the moon, and to all the host of heaven, which Israel has loved and served and which she has gone after, sought, and worshipped. These bones will not be gathered up or buried; rather, they will be left like dung on the surface of the ground. Death will be chosen rather than life by the remnant of her evil family that remains in all the places where Jehovah has driven them (8:1-3).
