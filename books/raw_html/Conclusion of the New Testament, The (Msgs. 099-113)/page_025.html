<h2 class=head3>d. In the Millennial Kingdom</h2><p>It will be in the millennial kingdom that the believers will be co-kings of Christ. Revelation 20:4 and 6 both speak of the overcoming believers reigning with Christ “a thousand years,” referring to the coming age of the millennial kingdom.<h2 class=head2>13. Partakers of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Hebrews 6:4 reveals that the believers are partakers of the Holy Spirit. As such partakers, we share in the Holy Spirit and enjoy Him. The Holy Spirit is what God promised to give man in His gospel (Gal. 3:14). In His gospel God has called us from the heavens to the heavenly things that we may partake of His Holy Spirit. Now by the Holy Spirit we taste the heavenly gift, partake of the divine holiness, and live a heavenly life on earth. As partakers of the Holy Spirit, we partake of the Triune God as our enjoyment.<p>The book of Hebrews reveals that the all-inclusive Christ is superior to the angels, Moses, Aaron, and the old covenant. In our practical experience, however, this all-inclusive Christ is the Spirit. Hebrews does not tell us that we are partakers of the all-inclusive Christ, but that we are partakers of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God and also the reaching to us of the Triune God. This Spirit is much superior to the angels, Moses, and Aaron, and He is the reality of the new covenant, which is much superior to the old covenant. Now we are partakers of this Spirit. As partakers of the Spirit, we partake of and enjoy the processed Triune God with all His riches.<h2 class=head3>a. Having Been Enlightened</h2><p>Those who are partakers of the Holy Spirit have been enlightened by the Spirit. Hebrews 6:4 speaks first of being enlightened and then of becoming partakers of the Holy Spirit. In Luke 15:8 the Spirit is symbolized by the fine woman lighting a lamp, sweeping the house, and carefully seeking a lost silver coin until she finds it. As portrayed by the parable of the seeking woman, the Spirit works to enlighten us inwardly. Little by little, in a fine, careful way, the Spirit enlightens our inner being. Before we were saved, we were in the darkness of sin. Therefore, the Spirit came to enlighten us that we might wake up, repent, and turn to God. Having been enlightened by the Spirit, who is able to penetrate the depths of our being, we have become partakers of the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head3>b. Having Tasted of the Heavenly Gift</h2><p>Hebrews 6:4 tells us that we have also tasted of the heavenly gift. The heavenly gift includes the heavenly things given to us by God at the time of our salvation. This means that the heavenly gift is actually an aggregate of a number of items. The first of these items is forgiveness. Because God forgives us from the heavens, the forgiveness of sins is part of the heavenly gift. Other aspects of this gift are the washing of the blood, justification in Christ, reconciliation, and redemption. Regeneration is also a crucial aspect of the heavenly gift. Furthermore, this gift includes the divine life and sonship. The heavenly gift even includes the Holy Spirit.<p>As believers in Christ, we surely have tasted of the heavenly gift. For instance, we have tasted the sweetness of God’s forgiveness of our sins. We have also tasted the sweetness of Christ’s washing through His precious blood. Formerly, we were under the burden of our sins. But now that we have been washed in the blood of Christ we have been released. We also enjoy justification, reconciliation, redemption, regeneration, the divine life, and the divine sonship. Today we continue to enjoy these matters in our daily life. In addition to all this, we enjoy the Holy Spirit. As partakers of the Holy Spirit, we certainly have tasted of the heavenly gift.
