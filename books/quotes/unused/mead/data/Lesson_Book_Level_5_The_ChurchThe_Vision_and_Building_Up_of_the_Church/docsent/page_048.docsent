   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The First Local Church the Church in Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first local church was the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first mention of the church in Acts is in 5:11.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Great fear came upon the whole church.''</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Acts 8:1 clearly speaks of "the church in Jerusalem.''</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was the first church established in a locality within the jurisdiction of a city, the city of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was a local church in its locality, as indicated by the Lord in Matthew 18:17.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was not the universal church, as revealed by the Lord in Matthew 16:18 but only a part of the universal church, which is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The record of the New Testament concerning the matter of the establishment of the church in its locality is consistent throughout Acts 13:1; 14:23; Rom 16:1; 1 Cor 1:2; 2 Cor 8:1; Gal 1:2; Rev 1:4, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Composed of: a. The Elders</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church in Jerusalem was composed of the elders, the serving ones, and the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Acts 11:30 speaks of a gift sent "to the elders through the hand of Barnabas and Saul.''</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that in the early days the finances of the church were under the management of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>An elder is an overseer 1 Tim 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The two titles refer to the same person: elder, denoting a person of maturity; overseer, denoting the function of an elder. b.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Serving Ones</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Acts 6:3-6 speaks of seven serving ones in the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts 6:3 says, "Now brothers, select seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we shall appoint over this need.''</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Seven brothers were chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since these seven were chosen to serve tables, they may be considered deacons, just as those whom Paul and his co-workers appointed later in the churches Rom 16:1; Phil 1:1; 1 Tim 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is significant that in the appointment of the seven serving ones no leader was appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that no rank or position was regarded.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the serving ones are the servants to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a good pattern for us to learn and follow that we may avoid leadership in rank and position in any form. c.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Believers</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Two verses that speak of the believers who composed the church in Jerusalem are Acts 2:44 and 5:14.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Acts 2:44 says, "All those who believed were together and had all things common,'' and 5:14 says, "Believers were all the more being added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and of women.''</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The designation believers denotes those who have believed in Christ as the Son of God according to God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This designation, of course, indicates the matter of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Anyone who does not have faith in Christ, who does not believe in Christ, is certainly not a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The believers are also those who have received Christ as their generating life for them to become the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, the believers are those who have believed into Christ as the Son of God to have an organic union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church is composed of such believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>B. Spreading to Judea, Samaria, and Galilee</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The establishing of the churches spread quickly from Jerusalem to Judea, Samaria, and Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Acts 9:31 says, "So the church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it was multiplied.''</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This verse speaks of Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, all of which were provinces in the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Judea was in the southern part of the Jewish land, Galilee was in the north, and Samaria was between the south and the north.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There were churches in all three of these provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Jews considered Galilee a despised region and Samaria a region full of mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nevertheless, 9:31 speaks of the church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This indicates that no matter how much Galilee was despised and Samaria was rejected by the Jews in Jerusalem, the churches raised up in those regions were all considered one church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the local sense, they were the churches, but in the universal sense, all these churches are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here we have a basic revelation concerning the oneness of the church universally.</S>
