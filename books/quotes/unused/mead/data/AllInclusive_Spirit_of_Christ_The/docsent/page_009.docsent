   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>One Spirit with the All-inclusive Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must realize that we are one with this all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, "He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord, as we have seen, is this all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are joined to the Lord, we are joined to this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we are one with this all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All He is and all He has, all that is in Him, is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is the Spirit of truth John 14:17; 16:13 , that is, the Spirit of reality the reality of God, of man, of the Father, of the Son, and of all the elements to which we have referred.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today He is within us as the foretaste Rom 8:23, "firstfruits" means "foretaste" through whom we enjoy all the riches of Christ with all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The All-inclusive Spirit in Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 2 Timothy 4:22 we have a wonderful word "The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit!"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since the Lord Jesus Christ is the all-inclusive Spirit, this word means that the all-inclusive Spirit is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is so wonderful and marvelous; yet He is within us!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is so all-inclusive and bountiful; yet He is in our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is so rich, yet so available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is so easy for us to contact Him and apply Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we just turn to our spirit, we will meet Him!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we just exercise our spirit a little, we can apply Him!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Way the All-inclusive Spirit Works within Us</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although this all-inclusive Spirit is so bountiful, so rich and powerful, so all-inclusive, He works within us in a very silent, normal and ordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is also called the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With any kind of life there is a natural element which is so ordinary and silent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Look at the trees and the flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How silent they are!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How natural they are!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They grow a little today and a little tomorrow, and many wonderful and beautiful things come out of this gradual growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The riches and beauty of life spring forth in such a silent, natural and ordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the way the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ works within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our only need is to cooperate, to go along with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must learn to take care of the deep, inner registration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need not expect the extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more gentle and ordinary, the better!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must be faithful to Him and attend to the small, inner sense of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must be obedient and submissive to His inner working.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then day by day and moment by moment we will experience the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many times I have had just a little sense, just a small feeling very deep within me, telling me to do a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This sense is so silent, so normal, and seems so human.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have doubted that it is of the Lord and thought it must be something from myself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet while I am doubting, the sense within continues.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not so strong, but it is so constant.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Finally, I have to obey; there is no other choice.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even while I am about to do it, there is still a lingering doubt that it is of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, when I completely obey what I have sensed deep within, it proves to be wholly of God!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the way the all-inclusive Spirit of the New Testament works within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we cooperate with Him, we will experience His reality and will gradually be saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The process seems so slow, but it is so steady.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not expect the Lord to give you some supernatural experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are such experiences, but they are not normal.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The normal way for us to experience Christ by His all-inclusive Spirit is in such a silent and ordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we go along with Him in this way, we will be saturated and permeated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We will be transformed from glory to glory into the image of the Lord.</S>
