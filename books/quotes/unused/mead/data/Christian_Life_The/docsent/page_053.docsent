   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BEING THE REALITY OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The life-giving Spirit as the resurrected, pneumatic Christ is the reality of Christ's resurrection Rom 8:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In His resurrection, Christ became altogether pneumatic.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Christ was in the flesh, He was visible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But He became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and now He is invisible.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For us to be pneumatic as Christians is for us to be full of the Spirit, full of the divine air.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>AS THE COMPOUND OINTMENT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The resurrection of Christ is an element of the compounded, all-inclusive Spirit as the compound ointment Exo 30:23-25 ; this makes the resurrection of Christ all-inclusive in the riches of Christ Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We call the life-giving Spirit the all-inclusive Spirit because He is now the compound Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is one unit of olive oil and four spices.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These four spices are in three units of five hundred shekels each.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One indicates the unique God, three refers to the Trinity, and four refers to the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this Spirit is Christ who is God, the divine One, and man, the human one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This Spirit also has all the elements of Christ's all-inclusive death and all-inclusive resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, this Spirit is an all-inclusive dose.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But what is Christ?</S>
