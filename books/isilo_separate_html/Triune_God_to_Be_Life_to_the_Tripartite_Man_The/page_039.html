Transformation is not merely a change in outward appearance. Transformation is an inward, metabolic change, which involves something organic. Suppose I am pale in my facial color. I can put different colors on my face in order to change the color of my face. That would be a change, not a transformation, of the color of my face.</P><P>Transformation is an entirely different thing. Transformation is a metabolic change. This metabolic change includes the introduction of something organic into a living entity, thereby causing an inward change. Such a metabolic change is the addition of a new substance into our being which, on the one hand, nourishes our being with new elements, and on the other hand, discharges the old things from our being. The old things are discharged, and the new elements are mingled with our being. This causes a metabolic change. Paul used the word transform in order to stress the need of an organic change. This organic change is brought about by the divine element being added into our being to discharge the elements of our old nature and to supply us with new elements. We are transformed by the life-giving Spirit from our natural being. You may be a person who is very nice, mild, and kind by birth. Everyone may like you. But you have to realize that this is your natural being, and it must be transformed.</P><P>Transformation is by the renewing of our mind (Rom. 12:2b). Formerly, our mind was set on the flesh. Now, we must change the position of our mind by setting it on the spirit. The mind set on the spirit is life and peace (Rom. 8:6). Changing the position of our mind will transform our mind.</P><P>We are transformed by the metabolism in the element of the divine life (Col. 3:4). Christ is our life. In any kind of organic life, there is an organic element. Christ is the organic element which grows within us and transforms us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>By Being Built in the Body of Christ<br>from Individualism</H2><P>We are saved in the divine life of Christ from individualism by being built in the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:5). Today on this earth there are very few Christians who have been built into the Body of Christ. All of us are still on the way of being built in the Body of Christ. We are still too individualistic. There is a certain percentage of individualism which still remains in us.</P><P>We are built in the Body of Christ and saved from individualism by presenting our bodies a living sacrifice (Rom. 12:1) and by not thinking more highly of ourselves than what we are (v. 3). This is not so easy. Most of the troubles in the church life mainly come from thinking more highly of ourselves than what we are.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> </body></html>
