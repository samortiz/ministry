<P>Verse 10:"And as they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast. And the door was shut." Eventually, the five foolish virgins needed the oil, and so they had to go and buy. Unfortunately, when they went to buy, the Lord came. Those who were ready were caught up into the clouds to join Him in the air. The Lord did not call these the "true" virgins. The question is one of being ready or not being ready. It does not mean that the five raptured ones are the true virgins, while the others are not. There are many true Christians, but not many are prepared.</P><P>"The wedding feast" here is the marriage feast (Rev. 19:7, 9; 21:9-10). The bride is the New Jerusalem, including all who are joined to God in the Old Testament age and the New Testament age. Revelation 19 precedes the kingdom, whereas Revelation 21 is after the kingdom. Between the two there is a period of one thousand years. To be a bride is a one-time thing. From this we know that the time of the marriage feast will be a thousand years. This thousand years is the millennial kingdom. Since after the kingdom there is still the bride, the feast lasts the same length of time as the kingdom.</P><P>The marriage feast is the sharing of joy with the Bridegroom. No one else can have this joy. That is why Revelation 19:9 says, "Blessed are they." This blessedness refers to this joy. The blessedness in Revelation 20:6 refers to authority, which is similar to that found in Revelation 3:20-21. The word "blessed" is used seven times in Revelation (1:3; 14:13; 16:15; 19:9; 20:6; 22:7, 14). Why does Matthew 25 not use the word "bride"? It is because the bride is corporate, whereas the virgin is individual. There cannot be five brides. The "door" here refers to the door of the kingdom, that is, the door to eating, drinking, and rejoicing. "The door was shut." Not the door of salvation, heaven, and eternal life, but the door to the enjoyment of the marriage feast, was shut. They lost the enjoyment of the marriage feast. Whoever is prepared can go in, but those who are not prepared cannot go in. Not being able to go in is in itself a punishment.</P><P>Verse 11:"And later the rest of the virgins came also, saying, Lord, lord, open to us!" In verse 11 we have the pleadings of the foolish virgins. By now they have bought the oil. The five prudent and the five foolish were all virgins; they all had lamps, oil, and light. They all went forth to meet the bridegroom. They all slept, heard the cry, and arose. They all trimmed their lamps, and by now they all have oil in their vessels. The only difference is time; some are faster than others in discerning the time. On the road to Emmaus the Lord rebuked the two disciples saying, "O foolish and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!" (Luke 24:25). In like manner, the Lord rebuked Thomas in John 20:29. The question of time is crucial. Those who suffer in hell all believe in the Lord, but they believe too late. The foolish do not redeem the time, but the wise redeem the time. They are the ones who are filled with the Holy Spirit (Eph. 5:17-18). Brothers and sisters, since we have to be filled by the Holy Spirit anyway, why not let it be today? Why choose to wait until that time when the rapture takes place?</P><P>Here we see at least two raptures. Those who are not yet saved will not even have the opportunity to go to the Lord to knock on the door. Only those who are saved will have the possibility of being raptured to the Lord. The difference, however, is in the time. As soon as we mature, we will be raptured. Therefore, in a sense, we determine our own time of rapture. We decide for ourselves whether we will be wise or foolish.</P><P>Verse 12:"But he answered and said, Truly I say to you, I do not know you." Here they are still virgins. To the bridegroom their relationship is still that toward the "lord." He opens the door to us, and we enter into the enjoyment of the bliss of the kingdom.</P><P>"I do not know you." Many use this, together with the fact that the foolish do not have oil, as a basis to say that those five are unsaved ones. How can the Lord say that He does not know the saved ones? Let us consider this carefully.</P><P>(1) "But He answered." "But" means contrary to the ordinary, unexpected. In Luke 15:22 the word "but" points out the father of the prodigal son's intention, hope, and expectation. Therefore, the word "but" here proves that the "do not know" is not a common "do not know."</P><P>(2) The Lord knows all those who are saved (2 Tim. 2:19; Gal. 4:9; John 10:14). There are two words in the Greek language that mean "to know": ginosko and oida. The former is objective, whereas the latter is subjective. In Timothy and Galatians it is ginosko, and in Matthew 25 it is oida.</P><P>(3) Oida in the Bible has these uses: to command, to praise, to approve, and to like. John 1:26 says, "You do not know (oida)." The Jews did ginosko the Lord, but they did not oida the Lord; they did not love the Lord. John 1:31 says, "Did not know (oida) Him." John and the Lord were cousins; hence, naturally, they ginoskoed each other, but there was not the deeper knowing. John 8:19 says, "Know (oida) neither Me." The Jews, on the surface, ginosko the Lord very well. The meaning here is that the Jews do not approve or accept the Lord. Luke 13:22-30 depicts the situation in the kingdom. They ginosko the Lord the most, for they drank and ate in His presence. They also heard His teachings. Yet the Lord said that they were workers of unrighteousness. "Unrighteousness" should be translated "lawlessness." The knowing in 1 Corinthians 16:15 is oida, a knowing even of the household matters. In 1 Thessalonians 1:5 the word is oida. In that verse there is the meaning of trusting; hence, it is subjective knowing.</P><P>(4) Matthew 10:32 and Luke 12:9 refer to matters that take place before the kingdom. The same is true of Matthew 12. The Christian who believes in secret is not lost, but in the kingdom he will not be commended by the Lord. In Matthew 26:70 the Greek word for "know" is oida, while that for "deny" is arneomai. Arneomai also means "reject, overthrow" (v. 72). I do not oida the man; hence, I arneomai him. I do not oida; therefore, I deny (that is, I overthrow, I reject). Hence, "I do not know." Matthew 10:33 speaks of the disciples. It does not refer to salvation. Those who do not testify will also be arneomaied by the Lord.</P><P>(5) The Old Testament also speaks of oida (1 Sam. 3:7). Samuel already objectively ginoskoed Jehovah, but he did not subjectively oida Him.</P><P>(6) The reward of the kingdom is altogether righteous. For the Lord not to acknowledge them is also an aspect of righteousness. The tone is like that of a judge judging his son; he must ask for his son's name. "I do not know you" here carries the sense of honoring only the subpoena but not the person. There is also the sense of not caring and not accepting.</P>
