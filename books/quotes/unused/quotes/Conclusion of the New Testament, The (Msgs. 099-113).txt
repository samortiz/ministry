In these messages on the believers we shall cover the believers' status, designations, symbols, life, nature, past, present, and future
We shall begin with the believers' status, and in this message we shall cover the believers' status before they were saved
They were sinners, sons of disobedience, children of wrath, children of the Devil, enemies of God, and sons of Gehenna
We sinners were not only under the requirements of God's righteousness but also under the demand of God's glory
As a result of Adam's disobedience, the many, including us, were not only made sinners but were constituted sinners
We are sinners by constitution, not by accident, for sin has been wrought into us and constituted into our being
Sin came from Satan as the rebel against God , entered into man , and made man not only a sinner but sin itself under God's judgment
When Christ became a man in flesh , He was made sin on our behalf to be judged by God that we might become God's righteousness in Him
Revelation 20:15 says, 'If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire'
Because unbelievers follow the Devil, they will share the Devil's judgment and will become joint partakers of the Devil's eternal torment
Unbelievers are condemned by the Lord because of their evil deeds, but they will perish because of their unbelief
Ephesians 2:2 also reveals that the sons of disobedience walk according to the ruler of the authority of the air
The likes of the flesh refer to evil things, and the likes of the thoughts refer to things that may be somewhat better
Even worse than being sinners, sons of disobedience, and children of wrath, as unbelievers we were children of the Devil
Because our human nature was fully poisoned by the old serpent, before we were saved we were a brood of vipers
In the sight of God, all unbelievers are serpents, the offspring of the Devil, full of the poison of the old serpent
Those who are sinners, sons of disobedience, children of wrath, and children of the Devil surely are enemies of God
All sinners, who are sons of disobedience, children of wrath, children of the Devil, and enemies of God, are also sons of Gehenna
John 3:1 says, 'See what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and we are'
Surely it is the greatest wonder in the universe that human beings could be begotten of God and sinners could be made children of God
We see that the children of God have been born of God, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man
He is not our adopted father or our father-in-law, but the One who has given us His life that we may be His genuine children in life
Because the life of God is the content of God, in it is hidden the fullness of God, and in it is contained the nature of God Himself
Entering into us, it caused a spiritual birth to take place, and this birth brought about an organic union between us and the Triune God
Just as a man's son partakes of his life and nature, so we as God's sons partake of the divine life and nature
Galatians 4:6 says, 'Because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father'!
As the sons of God, we have the position with the full right to participate in the Spirit of God, who has the bountiful supply of life
The sons of God will participate in all the enjoyment of the New Jerusalem, especially the enjoyment of the water of life
Galatians 4:5 reveals that God sent His Son that 'He might redeem those under law, that we might receive the sonship'
When the Spirit comes, the sonship is made real, and we fully realize God's sonship in life, maturity, position, and right
With that glory there will be freedom, and that freedom will be a kingdom, sphere, realm, into which we shall be brought
When we are brought into this freedom, or kingdom, or glory, creation will be delivered from vanity, corruption, and slavery
Having received the divine life at the time of our regeneration, we must now go on to enjoy what God is in His nature
In order that we may enjoy all that He is, God will do many things for us according to His precious, exceedingly great promises
Although we received the divine life at the time we believed, the divine nature must be continually enjoyed by us
During the entire course of our Christian life on earth and even in eternity, we shall be partaking of the divine nature
The more we partake of the divine nature, the more we shall escape the corruption that is in the world by lust
If this cycle works within us in a strong, rapid way, it will be difficult for us to take in any of the corruption of the world
The more we stay away from the corruption of the world, the more we shall enjoy the riches of the divine nature
We have seen that in their status after being saved the believers are children of God, sons of God, and partakers of the divine nature
In God's New Testament economy, the believers as God's chosen people, being sons of God, are such heirs, not under law but in Christ
It is not only everlasting, lasting forever, with respect to time, but in its nature it is also eternal and divine
The eternal life of God is given to all believers in Christ and is the main element of the divine grace given to us
Eternal life and its consequent incorruption have been brought to light and made visible to men through the preaching of the gospel
Eternal life is not only for us to partake of and enjoy today, but also for us to inherit in its full extent for eternity
Regeneration enlivens us with God's life and brings us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with God
The 'Holy Spirit of the promise' is the 'pledge of our inheritance, unto the redemption of the acquired possession'
God would not give the Spirit to us as a pledge for a heavenly mansion, for in such a case the pledge would not match the inheritance
A material mansion would not need the divine person of the Spirit as a pledge, sample, foretaste, and guarantee
Since the pledge of our inheritance is a divine person, the inheritance must also be a divine person-the Triune God Himself
As the pledge of our inheritance, the Spirit guarantees that the Triune God will be our portion for our enjoyment
Ephesians 1:14 says that the Spirit is the pledge of our inheritance unto the redemption of the acquired possession
We, God's redeemed ones, the church, are God's possession acquired by His purchase with the precious blood of Christ
The crucial matter in Ephesians 1:14 is that the Spirit is pledged into us as a guarantee that God will be our inheritance in full
The divine Trinity is our inheritance, and His consummated Spirit has been imparted into our being as a pledge
Now this pledge is working within us to redeem God's possession until the day we enjoy Him as our portion and He enjoys us as His possession
In their status as heirs of God, the believers share with all the saints in the light the Triune God embodied in Christ as their portion
Acts 26:18 speaks of the forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Christ
In Colossians 1:12 Paul says that the Father has qualified us 'for a share of the portion of the saints in the light'
In the Old Testament the tribes of Israel each received an allotment, a portion, of the good land for an inheritance
Just as the land of Canaan was everything to the children of Israel so Christ the reality of the type of the good land is everything to us
Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, is our inheritance, which we share with all the saints in the light
Supposedly, the glorification of the believers will take place instantaneously at the coming of the Lord Jesus
Christ is not leading us into some objective glory but into the very glory that has been sown into us as a seed
Verse 4 goes on to say, 'Unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for you'
Our daily experience of eternal life is also an experience and enjoyment of the inheritance kept for us in the heavens
Our heavenly divine spiritual inheritance is kept in the heavens yet it is continually being transmitted into our spirit for our enjoyment
The everlasting expression indicated by the word 'unfading' is the Son as the expression of the Father's glory
Although these items are not the Triune God directly, they are related to the divine life, which is God Himself
Through the sealing of the Spirit God is working His essence into our being that He may enjoy us His acquired possession as His inheritance
When the New Jerusalem comes, we shall see that it will be altogether a valuable inheritance, shining with God's glory
The fact that the believers are becoming Gods glorious inheritance a precious treasure to Him indicates that He is working Himself into us
God pledges Himself as the Spirit within us for our enjoyment, guaranteeing that we shall eventually have the full taste of the Triune God
In the New Jerusalem we shall enjoy the Triune God as our eternal inheritance, and He will enjoy us as His eternal possession
His dispensing makes us His inheritance, and through the enjoyment of Him as our inheritance we become His inheritance
When Peter received the revelation from the Father concerning the Lord Jesus, he said, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God'
In His person the Lord Jesus is the Son of God, and in His work He is the Christ, the One anointed by God to carry out God's commission
In this matter Satan has been defeated by the redeeming blood of Christ, the blood that loosed us, released us, from the hold of our sins
It will be intensively practiced in the millennial kingdom , and it will be ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem
Revelation 5:9 says, 'You were slain and did purchase to God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation'
One aspect of our status as believers is that we are priests of God; another aspect is that we are slaves of God
Romans 622 says Having been freed from sin and having been enslaved to God you have your fruit unto sanctification and the end eternal life
As the Firstborn Christ has both humanity and divinity, and as His brothers we have both divinity and humanity
Marking out beforehand is the process, whereas predestination is the purpose to determine a destiny beforehand
Before the foundation of the world, God marked us out to a certain destiny-being conformed to the image of His Son
To be conformed to the image of the Firstborn is to be saved from self-likeness, saved from the expression or appearance of the self
Every kind of life has four basic features: the life-essence, the life-power, the life-law, and the life-shape
As the divine life grows within us and transforms us, it spontaneously shapes us into the image of the firstborn Son of God
Concerning this only one thing is prevailing-the divine life that grows in us, sanctifies us, transforms us, and shapes us
Before we became part of the old creation, we were already part of the new creation through Christ's resurrection
By receiving His life they were reborn, regenerated, and became His brothers, having the same life as the Lord
Christ's many brothers, as the many sons of the Father, are the church to be a corporate expression of God the Father in the Son
Hebrews 211 says He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers
For this, He had to pass through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, glorification, and exaltation
The firstborn Son declared the Father's name to His brothers after He resurrected from the dead and met with the Father's sons
Although the Jewish people in ancient times knew God as the Creator, they did not know Him as the Father who begets
On the day of resurrection the Lord Jesus came to them to declare the Father that they might know the Father as the source of life
The fact that the church is a composition of the brothers of the firstborn Son of God indicates that the church is both human and divine
Now in the church meetings He is waiting for the opportunity to cooperate with us in singing hymns of praise to the Father
Christ indwells our spirit, and from our spirit He spreads throughout our entire being, thereby making His home in our heart
Christ and the church being one spirit , as typified by the husband and wife being one flesh, are the great mystery
The fact that Eve had the same life and nature as Adam signifies that, as members of Christ, we have the same life and nature Christ has
A member of Christ is a person produced with the element of Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit
As members of Christ produced out of Him to be His parts, we are composed and tempered together by God to be Christ's Body
In verse 24 he says, 'God has tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked'
In the church believers of many races and nationalities meet together and experience the blending, the mixing, the compounding
Such a tempering of all the different members of Christ together in the Body requires a great deal of transformation
For the practical Body life we need to be transformed by the Spirit from the natural life to the spiritual life
Those who are higher need to come down to the level of the low ones, and the low ones need to learn to be uplifted
Those who do not function must learn to function, and those who function more than they should must learn not to function too much
If we do not cooperate with each other, we are detached members, and the Body life cannot be realized in a practical way
In the church at Corinth there were Jews, Greeks, and Romans, all of whom were tempered together to be the one Body
As members of Christ, we have been produced out of Him, and we are being composed and tempered together by God to be the Body
The Son of God has been appointed to carry out God's plan and to head God's corporation, which is a corporation of glory
The Greek word for 'partners' in Hebrews 3:14, metochos, is the same word for 'partakers' in Hebrews 3:1; 6:4; and 12:8
In those three places it means that we share in the heavenly calling, the Holy Spirit, and the discipline; so we use the word partakers
We are partakers of heavenly, holy, and spiritual things, sharing in the heavenly calling, the Holy Spirit, and the spiritual discipline
As His partners, we are working together with Him and cooperating with Him to fulfill God's desire to have a corporate expression of Himself
We see again that in Gods economy Christ is Gods appointed One to accomplish Gods plan and we are Christs partners in the divine interest
God the Spirit poured Himself out as the anointing oil upon Christ, the appointed One, anointing Him to be the operator of God's corporation
We are not only partakers of Christ enjoying Him but also partners of Christ sharing in His operation under God's anointing
Hebrews 3:14 tells us that we are partners of Christ by holding fast the beginning of the assurance firm to the end
If we hold fast the beginning of the assurance firm to the end, we shall keep ourselves in the partnership with Christ
He who was called in the Lord when a slave is the Lord's freedman; likewise, he who was called when free is Christ's slave'
The Lord's calling does not change the outward status of His believers, but it does change their inward reality
In Ephesians 6:6 Paul says, 'Not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul'
Revelation 20:6a says, 'Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection: over these the second death has no authority'
Those believers who live in the reality of the kingdom in this age will be co-kings with Christ in the millennium
Speaking of the overcoming believers, Revelation 20:4c says, 'They lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years'
As they reign over the nations, they will shepherd them, for in the millennial kingdom the ruler is the shepherd
In His gospel God has called us from the heavens to the heavenly things that we may partake of His Holy Spirit
Now by the Holy Spirit we taste the heavenly gift, partake of the divine holiness, and live a heavenly life on earth
The book of Hebrews reveals that the all-inclusive Christ is superior to the angels, Moses, Aaron, and the old covenant
Hebrews does not tell us that we are partakers of the all-inclusive Christ, but that we are partakers of the Holy Spirit
Having been enlightened by the Spirit, who is able to penetrate the depths of our being, we have become partakers of the Holy Spirit
Other aspects of this gift are the washing of the blood, justification in Christ, reconciliation, and redemption
We also enjoy justification, reconciliation, redemption, regeneration, the divine life, and the divine sonship
The New Testament says that God loves the world, that Christ is our Savior, and that Christ died on the cross for our sins and even for us
We have been enlightened and we have tasted of the heavenly gift, the good word of God, and the works of power of the coming age
The works of power, which in the New Testament are synonymous with miracles, belong to the coming age, the age of the kingdom
The believers are a new creation , not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life
It is crucial for us to see that miracles, works of power, do not belong to God's new creation but to the restoration of God's old creation
During the age of grace, the age of the new creation, for certain purposes the Lord may borrow the works of power from the coming age
One kind belongs to the spirit with the divine life, and another kind, which includes the works not of life but of power, involves miracles
We do not care much for the miraculous work, because that work belongs to God's work of restoration in the coming age
We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that God's intention in His economy for us in this age is not to restore our body
The restored nations will be healed by the leaves of the tree of life, taking the deeds of Christ as their guide and regulation outwardly
When he himself had a thorn in the flesh and prayed three times for the Lord to remove it, the Lord did not heal him
The reason for this is that the age of grace is not the time for the Lord to rescue our bodies from sickness and death
Today, however, there is not much miraculous healing, but there is much experience of regeneration and transformation
Most of the healing we experience comes from the indwelling Spirit giving life through our spirit and mind to our mortal bodies
Because our citizenship is in the heavens, we should not be occupied with earthly things, with the physical things needed for our existence
If we love the earthly things needed for human life, this is an indication that we do not treasure our heavenly citizenship
We all need to remember that our citizenship is in the heavens and that we are a heavenly people sojourning on earth
In God's economy, in His full salvation, we have been called by God from the heavens and have been called to everything that is heavenly
He is the heavenly Christ ministering the heavenly life supply to us that we may live a heavenly life on earth
God's salvation by life has brought us into a heavenly place and into a heavenly atmosphere with a heavenly characteristic
We need to open our spirit and our whole being to the heavens that the divine transmission may flow into us unceasingly
The riches of Christ in His heavenly ministry will be transmitted into us, and we shall be transformed and constituted of Christ
Matthew 5:1 says, 'Seeing the crowds, He went up into the mountain; and when He sat down, His disciples came to Him'
The designation 'believers' designates those who have believed in Christ as the Son of God according to God's New Testament economy
Strictly speaking, in the New Testament we cannot find such expressions as 'believe Jesus' or 'believe in Jesus' or 'believe Christ'
The Greek preposition here and in many other verses in the Gospel of John means 'into' and signifies union with Christ by believing into Him
The New Testament does not tell us to believe in Him as a man, but tells us to believe in Him as the Son of God
He works for God by the life of God so that by believing in Him we may have the life of God to become children of God
We must believe in Him as the One who is the divine person coming to carry out God's commission for His eternal purpose
The dispensation of God is a matter in faith, that is, in the sphere and element of faith, in God through Christ
Faith refers both to the truths which we believe and to the act of our believing, that is, the action and function of our believing
Once we have such a faith, we can never lose it, for it has been infused into us and constituted into our being
As a result, we have the divine life and the divine nature to become sons of God, members of Christ, and parts of the new man
Verse 23 says, 'Before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed'
In John 16:9 we are told that the Spirit will convict the world concerning sin because of not believing in the Son of God
On our side faith is related to hearing, appreciating, calling, receiving, accepting, joining, partaking, and enjoying
If we do not have faith, all that has been accomplished on God's side will remain objective and will not be personally related to us
The believers are those who have received Christ as their generating life for them to become the children of God
Literally translated, the phrase 'believes in' in verse 36, as well as in verses 15, 16, and 18, should be 'believes into'
By believing into Him we are identified with Him in all that He is and in all that He has passed through accomplished attained and obtained
It is by faith in the Lord, by believing into Him, that we receive forgiveness, the release from God's condemnation negatively
It is also by faith by believing into the Lord that we receive eternal life the life of God the divine life positively for our regeneration
There is no need of our work, only of faith in Christ's finished, completed, and all-inclusive redemptive work
After passing through death, the Lord, by resurrection and in resurrection, has released His life and has become the life-giving Spirit
Now in resurrection He is the Spirit of life, with all the virtue of His redemptive work, waiting for us to believe into Him
In this message we shall cover the two remaining designations of the believers in the New Testament-saints and Christians
Corinthians 1:2 says, 'To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints'
The expression 'called saints' indicates that the believers in Christ are the called saints; they are not called to be saints
According to grammar, in 1 Corinthians 1:2 'to the church of God' is in apposition to 'to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus'
If we turn away from ourselves and look at Christ, in whom we have been sanctified, we shall be able to declare that we are saints
As a result, we have been sanctified; that is, we have been separated unto God for the fulfillment of His purpose
God has put us into Christ, and this makes it possible for us to experience the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity
Because we have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, we may have the boldness to declare that we are holy, that we are saints
Paul does not tell the Corinthians that they were sanctified in themselves, but that they had been sanctified in Christ Jesus
Hebrews 13:12 says, 'Wherefore also Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate'
Christ's body suffered the death of the cross outside the gate, and His blood was brought into the Holy of Holies for our sanctification
The book of Hebrews unveils that God's heavenly calling is to make us a heavenly people , a people who are sanctified unto God
Concerning subjective, dispositional sanctification, Romans 15:16 says that the believers are being 'sanctified in the Holy Spirit'
Because God has put us into Christ, the Spirit has entered into us and has become the sanctifying Spirit within us
By this we are thoroughly saved from all old and negative things and made a new creation to obtain the Lord's glory
All day long the Spirit is sanctifying us, applying to us what the Father has planned and what the Son has accomplished
The Spirit has been commissioned to sanctify us; He has been given to us for the purpose of completing the work of sanctification
Through our experience we have come to realize that, as the sanctifying Spirit, the Spirit is dispensing His element into us
The sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit is to dispense His element and essence into our being to sanctify us dispositionally
The designation 'Christian' is used again in 1 Peter 4:16, where it denotes those who are adherents of Christ, bearing His reproach
In the name of Christ' is actually in the person of Christ, in Christ Himself, because the name denotes the person
The believers, having believed into Christ and having been baptized into His name , that is, into Himself , are in Christ and one with Him
The ending -ianos, denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire
Those who worshipped the emperor the CaesarKaisarwere called Kaisarianos which means the adherents of Kaisar the people belonging to Kaisar
When people believed in Christ and became His followers, this caused some in the Empire to consider Christ a rival of the Kaisar
At Antioch some began to call the followers of Christ Christianos , adherents of Christ, as a nickname, a term of reproach
Now as Christians, those who are of Christ and are one with Him, we need to live by Him, and even live Him, in our daily life
If we are truly seeking the Lord the day will come when we shall see that what God desires is not our doing behavior or virtues but Christ
The key to living Christ is to realize that, as Christians, the life we have received is Another's, yet it is not lived by Him but by us
According to Matthew 13, the wheat of life grows with the tares, the false believers, and will be reaped into the Lord's barn
When the Lord's slaves were sleeping, not watching, His enemy, the Devil, came and sowed false believers amidst the true ones
The sons of the evil one are the false believers, believers only in name, who do not have the divine life in them
The church is not to tolerate the false believers, but both the false and the true are allowed to grow together in the world
The Lord told His slaves not to separate the wheat from the tares but to allow them both to grow together until the harvest
The wheat, the righteous, will be brought together into the King's barn, the kingdom of their Father, to shine forth as the sun
On the one hand, the Lord Jesus says that the believers are wheat; on the other hand, He tells us that the believers are the good seed
The good seed, as well as the wheat, is the sons of the kingdom, the real believers, those regenerated with the divine life
The sowing of the good seed is a kind of martyrdom, for the seed experiences a real crucifixion and is put to death
Those who are not willing to be sown into the ground, who are not willing to be put to death, will be barren and unfruitful
Eventually, on the day of Pentecost, Peter became the first great fisher for the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens
To be a fisher of men is to bring men out of the world, signified by the sea with its death waters, into the kingdom of the heavens
After Peter gave a hasty answer concerning Christ's paying the half-shekel, the Lord Jesus asked him, 'What do you think, Simon?
Patiently we should contact others again and again until they are 'caught' and brought out of the world into the kingdom of the heavens
The kingdom is the center, the hub, and all the other items may be considered the spokes, which are centered on the hub
The gospel of life is for the kingdom, the gospel of salvation is for the kingdom, and the gospel of forgiveness is for the kingdom
Through its killing and preserving function salt brings the earth back to its original condition or keeps it in its original condition
To the corrupted earth the people of the kingdom of the heavens are the element that keeps the earth from being fully corrupted
If we are poor in spirit, mourning, meek, righteous, merciful, and pure in seeking God, we shall have a salting function
The darkness is not upon the earth; rather, it is in the world, which denotes human society, a system of Satan
The kingdom people as the lighted lamp should not be covered by the bushel, an item pertaining to eating, a matter which causes anxiety
In ancient times a bushel, as a measure for grain, was something related to eating and therefore related to the matter of making a living
According to the context, the main point is that the shining of the light has two aspects: the outward aspect and the inward aspect
The light as a city on a mountain shines over the outsiders whereas the lighted lamp on the lampstand shines over those who are in the house
The outward shining of the kingdom people, likened to that of a city situated on a mountain, is general, and all of society can see it
When others see that we are not anxious about our living, the light of the lamp will penetrate into their being and shine within them
Thus let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in the heavens'
The title 'your Father' indicates that the Lord Jesus is speaking to those who are regenerated children of God
The good works here are the behavior of the kingdom people through which others may see God and be brought to Him
Some may wonder why the Lord Jesus uses a city on a mountain as an illustration of the believers as the shining light
If the saints in the church in your locality are not built up, but are scattered, divided, and separated, there is no city there
As long as there is no city, there is no light, because the city is the light; the light is not an individual believer
The local church, which is the lampstand, is likened by the Lord to a builded city set on the top of a mountain
Revelation 21:18b says, 'The city was pure gold, like pure glass,' and verse 11 says, 'Having the glory of God
It is impossible for our natural life to gain this surpassing righteousness; it can be produced only by the resurrection life of Christ
When in the millennium the overcomers enjoy the Father as light, they will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father
Matthew 251 says Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom
Believers, who are the kingdom people, are like chaste virgins, bearing the Lord's testimony in the dark age and going out to meet the Lord
It was a woman who broke the alabaster flask of ointment and poured the ointment of very costly, pure nard upon the Lord Jesus
Paul could say to the believers in Corinth, 'I betrothed you to one Husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ'
As virgins, we are not settled in this world; we are going out of the world to meet the coming Christ as our Bridegroom
The planting and watering are done by the apostles, but the growth is given only by God who is the source of life
According to John 1:42, when the Lord Jesus first looked at Peter, He said, 'You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas '
The significance of a stone is that it denotes a work of transformation to bring forth material for God's building
At regeneration we received the seed of the divine life, which by its growth in us transforms us into living stones
When Peter received the revelation concerning Christ, the Lord revealed further that He also was the rock-a stone
In the New Jerusalem there will not be any clay, for all the clay will have been transformed into precious stone
Christ is the door through which His believers may come out of any kind of fold and come into Him as the pasture
The sheep in John 10 are the Gentile believers, who were brought in by Christ to be one flock with the Jewish believers
As our Shepherd, Christ has brought us into the flock, where we are in the pasture enjoying Him as our life and life supply
The sheep in the one flock have Christ as their Shepherd, who laid down His soul life for them that they may have the divine life
In verse 11 the Greek word is psuche, the same word for soul, which means the soulish life, that is, the human life
In order to be our Savior, He, as a man, laid down His human life to accomplish redemption for us so that we may receive His zoe life
He laid down His human life in order that we, after being redeemed, might have His divine life, the eternal life
If we do not live by the divine life, there can be no flock, for the flock is produced, formed, and maintained by the divine life
John 12:24 says, 'Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
In 12:24 the Lord Jesus clearly refers to Himself, God incarnate, as the unique grain of wheat that falls into the ground and dies
In His work on the cross the Lord Jesus died as a grain of wheat falling into death for the release of the divine life
As a grain of wheat He died to release the divine life and to enliven God's redeemed ones in order to produce many grains
He was a grain of wheat, and there was no other way for that grain to increase except to fall into the ground and die
In His death Christ was sown into the earth as a grain of wheat to produce a multiplication through the release of the divine life
As a grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died, the Lord Jesus has brought forth much fruit in resurrection
The many grains are the multiplication of the one grain, and this multiplication is the propagation of that grain of wheat
The many grains of wheat produced through Christ's death and resurrection are for the formation of one bread-the Body of Christ
After the many grains have been produced, they need to be crushed, ground into flour, and blended together in a loaf to be offered to God
The believers are members of the Christ of God to form the organism of the Triune God in the divine dispensing
In John 15:1 the Lord Jesus declares, 'I am the true vine,' and in verse 5 He says, 'I am the vine, you are the branches'
Christ and the believers, the vine with the branches, form the organism of the Triune God in the divine dispensing
The Father is a husbandman, a farmer, cultivating the true vine, Christ, with its branches, the believers in Christ
Now as branches we are filled with Christ as life, for to be a branch in the vine means that Christ has become our life
No plant other than the vine can illustrate adequately the living relationship between the believers and Christ
The branches, the believers in the Son, are for the expression of the Son with the Father through fruit bearing
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in Me
Because we are branches to the Lord and the Lord is the vine to us, we must abide in Him and let Him abide in us
Once we see the fact that we are branches in the vine, we need to maintain the fellowship between us and the vine
A little disobedience, a sin, or even a sinful thought can be the insulation that separates us from the riches of the vine
With the vine we have the glorification of the Father through the expression of the riches of the divine life in fruit bearing
In John 15:8 the word 'glorify' means to have the intent, the content, the inner life, and the inner riches released and expressed
Today the Triune God is within us as our life and nature and the expression of the life and nature of the Triune God from within us is glory
In John 17:22 the Lord Jesus prayed concerning the glory which the Father had given Him and which He had given to His disciples
The glory given by the Father to the Son and by the Son to the disciples is the divine life with the divine nature for God's expression
Romans 9:21 says, 'Has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor'?
Verse 23 goes on to speak of God's making known 'the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory'
According to our natural condition, we were far removed from God, totally unworthy of His grace and eligible to receive only His mercy
Concerning the gospel, the ministry of life, and the church life, God, in His sovereignty, has had mercy on us
God's selection, on the contrary, does not depend on what we are; it depends entirely on God's sovereignty and His desire
Or has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor'?
We were predestinated by His sovereignty to be His containers, vessels of mercy unto honor and glory to express Him
We have pointed out that in 916 Paul tells us that it is not of the one who wills nor of the one who runs but of God the One who shows mercy
Our concept is that the one who wills will gain what he wills to obtain and that the one who runs will gain what he runs after
If this were the case, then God's selection of us as vessels of mercy would be according to our effort and labor
In His creation of man, God made man a vessel to contain Him with the intention of coming into this vessel and filling it with Himself
We thank the Lord for showing us the fact that man is a vessel to contain God and that God feels at home in this vessel
God's selection in His sovereign mercy has a goal, and this goal is to have many vessels to contain God and express Him eternally
Romans 9 reveals that the climax of our usefulness to God is that we are vessels to contain Him and express Him
For this reason we cannot believe that the great house refers to the church as the house of the living God in 1 Timothy 3:15
Just as many unclean birds lodge in the big tree, so in the great house there are vessels unto dishonor, wooden and earthen vessels
The word 'these' in verse 21 denotes the vessels unto dishonor, including those mentioned in verses 16 through 18
Unto honor is a matter of nature sanctified is a matter of position useful is a matter of practice and prepared is a matter of training
In order to be vessels unto honor we need to separate ourselves, cleanse ourselves, from the dishonorable vessels
As vessels of mercy unto honor and glory we have been prepared by God unto glory through glorificationthe last step of Gods full salvation
In this final step of His salvation God will redeem our fallen and corrupted body by transfiguring it into the body of Christ's glory
Our body will be freed from the slavery of corruption of the old creation into the glory of God's new creation
The cultivated olive tree in Romans 11:24 is the God-chosen race of Israel with Christ as the reality of their life and everything
Hosea 11:1 and Matthew 2:15 prove that Christ is the reality of the life of Israel as the cultivated olive tree
If the stump and branches of a tree are regarded as the tree, surely the root of the tree must even the more be considered the tree itself
For the branch of a wild olive tree to be grafted into the cultivated olive tree is for it to receive the life of the cultivated tree
In the New Testament all the overcoming believers, not only the apostles, are likened to such a spectacle, such a gazingstock for the public
The last act, the last show, was that of condemned criminals fighting with wild beasts for the entertainment of the people
Hebrews 10:33b speaks of the apostles and the overcoming believers 'having become partakers with those who experienced the same'
On the one hand, we are made a spectacle; on the other hand, we become partakers with those who have experienced the same thing
Now the apostles and the overcoming believers are partakers with them, being the continuation of such a gazingstock
We in the Lord's recovery should be like the apostles-criminals doomed to death and a spectacle both to angels and to men
We should give others the impression that we are as criminals condemned to death and a spectacle to the whole universe
In 1 Corinthians 4:13 Paul says, 'We have become as the offscouring of the world, as the scum of all things until now'
They may be extremely successful and wealthy, but we have become the offscouring of the world and the scum of all things
In 1 Corinthians 3:16 Paul asks, 'Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you'?
In 1 Corinthians 620b Paul concludes his word concerning the believers being a temple of the Holy Spirit Therefore glorify God in your body
Another crucial matter related to this is Paul's word in verse 14 that the Lord 'will raise up us through His power'
The key to our being the temple of the Holy Spirit is that the indwelling Spirit of the resurrected Christ imparts life to our mortal bodies
Because this is the key, we must exercise and practice to experience the Lord as the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit
If we exercise ourselves to experience and enjoy this, we shall open the way for the Lord to impart life to our physical bodies
When our body becomes a member of the indwelling Christ, it automatically becomes the temple, the dwelling place, of the Holy Spirit
According to the context, those who labor in word and teaching may be fully occupied, devoting all their time to this
Everyone who contends exercises selfcontrol in all things those therefore that they may receive a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible
Eternal salvation is by faith, having nothing to do with our work , whereas reward is for our work after we are saved
We may not receive a reward but rather suffer loss, even though we are saved, because we are void of the work which the Lord would approve
The runners in a race must strip off every unnecessary weight every encumbering burden that they may have no impediment to running the race
If we would run the Christian race, we need to put off every encumbrance, every unnecessary burden or impediment
In order to run the race, we must suffer the opposition with endurance, never growing weary or fainting in our souls
Timothy 2:15 says that Timothy should present himself 'approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth'
In 1 Thessalonians 2:7 Paul says, 'But we were gentle in your midst, as a nurse would cherish her own children'
Guides give instructions and directions to the children under their guardianship; fathers impart life to their children whom they beget
In Matthew 16:18 the Lord says He will build His church; yet here the apostle says he is a builder, even a wise master builder
In 1 Corinthians 4:1 Paul considers himself and his co-workers as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God
The Greek word for stewards is the same root as the word economy or dispensation in 1 Timothy 1:4 and Ephesians 1:10
God is celebrating His triumph over His enemies; Paul is a captive following in the train of the triumphal procession
After he was captured, he was placed in Christ's triumphal procession as one of the captives in a train of defeated foes
As a captive in the triumphant procession, Paul did not do anything according to his own choice, preference, or taste
As the metaphor in 2:14 indicates, Paul considered himself a captive who had been placed in Christ's triumphal procession
Their move in their ministry for Christ was like a triumphal procession from one place to another under God's leading
Paul and his co-workers had been conquered by Christ and had become His captives in the train of His triumph, celebrating His victory
As such captives we are witnesses that once we were enemies of Christ but we have been defeated subdued captured and made submissive to Him
Paul says in 2 Corinthians 2:14b that through us God manifests the savor of the knowledge of Christ in every place
The believers are such incense-bearers in their ministry of Christ as well as captives in the train of His triumph
Because we have been captured, subdued, possessed, and gained by Christ, He has the liberty to saturate us with His fragrance
In 2 Corinthians 2:15 Paul says, 'We are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing'
In verse 16 Paul continues, 'To the one a savor from death unto death, to the other a savor from life unto life
Only the captives of God in Christ, who are saturated with Christ by the Spirit, are sufficient and qualified for this
In verse 3 Paul says that the letter of Christ is inscribed 'not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart'
We are living letters of Christ, living epistles, and others can read the Christ who has been inscribed into us
If, by the mercy and grace of the Lord, all the veils are removed, we shall be mirrors beholding and reflecting the Lord with unveiled face
With an unveiled face we shall behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, and we shall be transformed into His image from glory to glory
The 'same image' means that we are being conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, being made the same as He is
In 2 Corinthians 4:7 Paul says, 'We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us'
Because of the shining in our hearts, we have this treasure, a treasure that is wonderful, precious, and marvelous
The Christ of glory as the excellent treasure is received by the believers through the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ
According to 2 Corinthians 4:7, we have this treasure in earthen vessels 'that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us'
We need to have the consciousness that we are captives of Christ and also His incense-bearers, those bearing Him as incense
We need to consider these symbols again and again, for they illustrate matters that are deep, profound, and experiential
The pillars are also the overcomers among the believers in the temple of God in the coming age and in eternity
The Lord makes us pillars by transforming us, that is, by carrying away our natural element and by replacing it with His divine essence
From this we see that being made a pillar involves the Triune God being mingled with and constituted into the faithful overcomers
Whenever we cooperate with God's inward operation according to the divine life and nature, we shine with the light of Christ
As lights, or luminaries, the believers shine among the sinful generation by reflecting the light of the sun, Christ
The matter of our material, physical life should not entangle us as we are endeavoring to minister Christ to others
On the one hand, the priestly service is a ministry to God; on the other hand, it is a warfare against God's enemies
As the priests were bearing the ark of testimony, they had to be prepared to fight against those who might attack this testimony
Just as a soldier must win the victory and an athlete must receive the crown, so a husbandman must partake of the fruits, the food
James 57 says Behold the farmer awaits the precious fruit of the earth being longsuffering over it until it receives the early and late rain
They may not be responsible for the affairs of the church, but they are responsible for bearing the testimony of Jesus
It is certain that they are the faithful ones, the genuinely spiritual ones, the overcoming ones among the saints in the church
What the Lord Jesus wrote to the messengers, the stars, in Revelation 2 and 3 was what He wrote to the whole church
In Revelation 3:1 the Lord Jesus refers to Himself as 'He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars'
Revelation 121 describes this woman as being clothed with the sun and the moon underneath her feet and on her head a crown of twelve stars
In Genesis 37:9 Joseph in his dream saw the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars, signifying his father, his mother, and his eleven brothers
There the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars plus Joseph himself signify the total composition of God's people on earth
The moon is under the feet of the woman, for the age of the moon was the age of the law, which should not be exalted as the stars
Through the three dispensations of the patriarchs, the law, and grace, God has gained a people who compose the universal bright woman
In the Bible these are considered a collective unit-the man-child-fighting the battle for God and bringing God's kingdom down to earth
Revelation 12:11 indicates that a number of those who compose the man-child have been martyred for the Lord's testimony
The rapture of the man-child differs from that of the majority of the believers, as mentioned in 1 Thessalonians 4:17
There, the rapture of the majority of the believers will be to the air and at the last trumpet , which will be the seventh trumpet
The firstfruit will be raptured not to the air but to the third heaven in order to be in the presence of God and Christ
Speaking of the firstfruit, Revelation 14:4 says: 'These are they who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins
In order to be a living overcomer we must be kept by the Lord's grace from every defilement and pollution and live on earth like virgins
That no lie was found in the mouth of the living overcomers indicates that there is nothing of Satan in their expression
To escape is to be taken, raptured, before the great tribulation , which will be a severe trial upon the whole inhabited earth
These overcoming ones, the first ones to ripen among the believers in God's field on earth, will be raptured to the third heaven
For the firstfruit to be purchased from among men indicates that they are no longer among men but are in the heavens
Those who stand with the Lamb on mount Zion are raptured to the heavens before Antichrist's persecution of religion
The fact that the firstfruit have the name of the Son and the Father indicate that they are wholly constituted of the Son and the Father
All the believers since that time who have received Him as the seed of life have become the crop of God on earth
The majority will ripen with the help of the sufferings in the great tribulation and will be reaped near the end of the great tribulation
Revelation 1416 says of Christs reaping of the harvest He who sat on the cloud thrust His sickle over the earth and the earth was reaped
From this we see that the firstfruit will be taken to God's house-to mount Zion in the heavens-and the harvest will be taken to the air
Now we come to the last, consummating, and most striking symbol of the believers in the New Testament-jasper and other precious stones
Jasper signifies the appearance of God shining with the glory of God as the light of the New Jerusalem for the expression of God
The other precious stones signify the riches of the beauty of Christ in different aspects for the foundation of God's eternal dwelling
Because the foundation is built upon the faithfulness with which God keeps His covenant, it is trustworthy and reliable
