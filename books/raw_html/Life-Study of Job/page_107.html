<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Christ Overcoming Death<br>and Entering into the All-producing Resurrection<br>and Being Begotten to Be God's Firstborn Son</H2><P>Christ overcame death and entered into the all-producing resurrection and was begotten to be God's firstborn Son, bringing humanity into divinity (Acts 13:33). In resurrection Christ also became the life-giving Spirit for the producing and the constituting of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 15:45).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Christ Accomplishing<br>the All-transcending Ascension to the Heavens</H2><P>Next, Christ accomplished the all-transcending ascension to the heavens and was made Lord, Christ, Leader, and Savior (Acts 2:36; 5:31) for His propagation and for the building up of the church as His kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. In His Death, Resurrection, and Ascension<br>Christ Making All His Believers One with Him</H2><P>In His death, resurrection, and ascension Christ made all His believers one with Him. Thus, His death, resurrection, and ascension have become theirs (Rom. 6:5-6; Eph. 2:5-6); hence, His experiences have become their history.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. God Redeeming Us in Christ</H2><P>God redeemed us in Christ, forgave our sins, washed us, justified us, and reconciled us to Him (Eph. 1:7; 1 Cor. 6:11; Rom. 3:22; 5:10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. God Having Put Us into Christ</H2><P>God has put us into Christ and has made Him our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1 Cor. 1:30). By Christ as our righteousness (for our past) we have been justified by God, that we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life. By Christ as our sanctification (for our present) we are being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will, with the divine life. By Christ as our redemption, (for our future), that is, the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23) we will be transfigured in our body with the divine life to have His glorious likeness (Phil. 3:21).</P>
