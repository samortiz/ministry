   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE MIND OF PRAYER I. THE POSITION OF THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all know that man was created with three parts: spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The soul is the medium between the spirit and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The soul is our personality, our ego.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Within the soul, the leading part is the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both the emotion and the will are subordinate to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Man's going forth and coming in hinge on the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Going forth is his expression, and coming in is his reception.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether we express what is within us or receive what is without, both need to pass through the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, the mind not only occupies the leading position in the soul, but is also a very significant part of our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christians use the word "mind" as a specific term in relation to biblical truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When talking about the mind, unbelievers refer to it as the brain or the psyche.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The term "brain" is used in reference to the physical entity, and the term "psyche" is used in reference to the psychological entity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Worldly education educates the human brain, or psyche.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every kind of knowledge, whether science, philosophy, ism, or any theory, deals with the human brain, and/or psyche.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the present educational system, one needs at least twenty years of formal education before he can obtain a bachelor's degree.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It requires twenty years of training to sufficiently develop the human brain to make it useful for human living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By this we can see how important a position it occupies in man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the mind needs to be educated for our human living, how much more it needs to be trained for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Unless it has been educated, the mind can neither receive nor discharge the burden of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether a person desires to receive or discharge a burden in prayer, a functional mind is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although prayer issues forth from the spirit, it must pass through the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once the mind becomes improper, there is a problem with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, in order to be a man of prayer, it is imperative that we pay attention to the exercise of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE RENEWING OF THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Scriptures show us that due to the fall of man the human mind has become darkened and numb.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because man sinned, his mind became vain and perverted.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, he does not take heed of the things that he ought but rather of the things that he ought not.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today, concerning the matter of committing sins, man has a very clever mind, but concerning the matter of seeking God and listening to His truths, his mind is very inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This proves that the mind of a sinning one is darkened and perverted.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, Romans 12:2 says, "be transformed by the renewing of the mind."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the time of our regeneration our spirit became renewed by the entrance of the Spirit of God into it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thereafter the Holy Spirit began to spread out from our spirit into the various parts of our soul, especially into our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Holy Spirit shines forth the light from our spirit to enlighten our mind, dispel its darkness, and correct its perverseness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This dispelling of the darkness and correcting of the perverseness are the renewing work of the Holy Spirit in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In renewing our mind, God not only corrects it and shines into it through the Holy Spirit in our spirit; He also gives us His Holy Word, the Bible, outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we read the Bible, it is not just to touch God and know His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is also that through the Word our darkened mind may be enlightened, our perverted thoughts may be corrected, and our old mentality may be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Alas, sometimes in reading the Word, instead of reading the Word into himself, one reads himself into the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Such a one does not have a humble heart to receive instruction and correction from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the contrary, his intention is to read his own views and ideas into the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, he does not allow the Word to renew his mind and loses the real benefit of reading it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Anyone who desires to read the Word properly should learn to lay aside his views and abandon his ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He should come to the Word in a humble manner and without prejudice.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we come to the Word with such an attitude, we can receive the teachings of the Word into us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once the biblical teachings get into us, the ideas, views, and opinions in our mind will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Holy Scripture from without corresponds to the Holy Spirit within to enlighten our mind and correct our mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This causes our darkened, perverted mind to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, with one who loves the Lord and walks according to the Spirit, the more he reads the Word and is instructed by the Word, the more intelligent and proper his mind becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He will become dull in evil things, but very alive in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only a mind that has been thus renewed can cooperate with the spirit of prayer to pray.</S>
