   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Beginning of the Meeting in Fang Yen Hsia</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This meeting turned from an Independent Church to meet in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the summer of 1932, there was a conference here.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The person who spoke at that conference did not mention the matter of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He only spoke on a few matters concerning the building up of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when the brothers received the light of the truth, they themselves saw that many things in the organization of the denominations were not according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They began to leave the denominations, drop the names of the meetings, then began practicing baptism and breaking bread, etc. Now there are more than thirty brothers and sisters who break bread together on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are between seventy and eighty who come to listen to the Word but still do not participate in the table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Lin Tze Hua has been bearing the responsibility recently.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Experience of the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>in Lu Pien from Its Beginning</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This meeting began in the winter of 1932.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But before it started, it went through two years of struggle because the brothers were in the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This particular group of the China Inland Mission was in Yi Shan Town about three miles from Lu Pien.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There were many people in that group, but there was no godliness in their worship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In their meetings they crowded into the hall, talking and clattering continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then Brother Huang Lu Ch'uan came to work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, he spoke concerning the matter of the church and pointed out the error of the denominations; on the other hand, he organized the content and dignified the worship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He had not done this work for very long when half of the brothers and sisters obeyed the truth and were willing to leave the error of the denominations to meet according to the principles of 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the other half of the brothers and sisters did not understand at all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some rejected the truth because they despised others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some were unwilling to obey because they wanted to keep their position.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some were unwilling to drop their own will, so they created much criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There were many other complicated reasons that are difficult to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this way, the spirits of the brothers and sisters were almost entirely surrounded by an atmosphere of debate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At this time, the brothers and sisters who loved the Lord felt that it was a great suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If they did not go to worship, they were not peaceful in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If they went to worship, it was not real worship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, they had to listen to and be filled up with the words of the debates, which was a very tasteless experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the brothers in one accord had a mistaken concept at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They thought that the entire congregation had to change before they could be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They thought that if they left, others would say that they were dividing the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It seemed that they were caught in a dilemma.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They were in this kind of situation for a little more than two years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later, because the brothers in Chia Ti had already left the denominations, some of the brothers from Yi Shan Town went to Chia Ti for the table meetings, and they were very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They learned that new wine could not be put into old wineskins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They must leave to resolve the dilemma.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The brothers went in one accord to find an appropriate building and buy equipment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Lu Pien they got two small buildings and began to meet according to the principles in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is a table meeting every Lord's Day morning.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the afternoon, there is a meeting for preaching the Word and building up sometimes it is also a gospel meeting .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It has been more than a year since the beginning of this kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this year the Lord has really blessed the church and has gradually added saved ones to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now there are more than thirty brothers and sisters who break bread together.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are seventy who come to listen to the Word but do not break bread yet.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are more than twenty newly saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brothers Huang Lu Ch'uan, Huang Ting Yi, Lin Pu Chin, and Hsueh Chung Chu all bear the responsibility for the work and affairs of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Beginning and Recent Condition</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>of the Meeting in Hsiao Chia Tu</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The meeting here was part of an Independent Church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In April 1931, the responsible brother of this locality went to a conference in Chin Hsiang, where he received the enlightenment of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When he returned, he knew that to work as he had before was worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the time, he knew he must have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He gained the consent of the brothers in the locality, and they left the denominations and began meeting in the Lord's name in their original meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There are about thirty brothers and sisters breaking bread every Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There are also more than ten men and women who come to listen to the Word but do not break bread yet.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Three of these have already been saved and are waiting to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One aspect of the Lord's grace is particularly manifested among them: the brothers' hearts are able to be one in obeying the Lord's truth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, their spiritual life has not grown very much because they have not been very diligent in the matters of reading the Bible and prayer , and they lack the gift of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In these past years, there has been only one brother with the gift, aside from the responsible brother, Yang Li Jen.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is a tailor, Brother Chen Ts'ung Yi.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When Brother Yang goes on a trip, Brother Chen helps the meeting to speak some truths.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Because this brother is limited by his craft, his heart is divided to the extent that he cannot serve the brothers with his whole strength; the strength of his testimony is also weakened by this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I ask the brothers and sisters who love the Lord to pray for the brothers and sisters in Hsiao Chia Tu so that the Lord would raise up the gift of prophesying and give them life that they could grow quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Pray that they will read the Bible and pray more in order that they can contact the Lord and glory can be given to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Amen!</S>
