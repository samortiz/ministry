   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SIX</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's blessing is like a bird that will only fly from the outside into a room by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When it is at the window, we cannot call it to come in. If it comes in, however, it is very easy to chase away.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God will bless what He wants to bless; we cannot force Him to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Like the bird, it is difficult to lure in and easy to chase away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With just a little carelessness, we can chase the blessing away.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Over the past two or three years, I have observed our co-workers doing many things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One co-worker said something to another co-worker, and they had an argument.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was absolutely right in what he said and did, but in my heart, I wanted to say, "Brother, you are right, but should we behave according to right and wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Or should we behave according to what will bring in God's blessing?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We often may do something right, but what can we do if God does not bless us when we do things right?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not ask whether our every action is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, we should ask whether we have God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are not here to argue about right and wrong; we are here to ask God to bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Seeking God's blessing on our work will limit us much in our speaking and in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may be right, but will God bless us?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is very easy for us to cut off our blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is also very easy to cut off the blessing of others as well.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our standard is not right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We look for God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Both may be right, but can God bless such a work?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our lives must be governed by God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In God's work He will not bless what is wrong, but He will not bless what is right either.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we stand together in one accord, the blessing comes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, I want us to know that it is a very serious matter when the brothers argue with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may be absolutely right in the matter, but the blessing will stop!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brothers, let me solemnly warn about speaking loosely or thinking that it is good enough just to be right.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The brothers have to be careful about speaking among themselves and criticizing one another.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It does not matter if we are right.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are right and God does not bless us, what is the use of being right?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The work is not built upon our abilities, nor is it built upon our gifts, faithfulness, or labor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we miss God's blessing, everything is finished.</S>
