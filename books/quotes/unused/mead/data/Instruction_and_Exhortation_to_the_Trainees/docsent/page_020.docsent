   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Church Meetings, to Build Up the Church</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Teaching and perfecting the saints by informal group meeting is for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is a little difference between the building up of the Body and the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The group meetings cannot directly build the church because a group is not the church; a group is only a part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, we must feed the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we must teach and perfect them to build each other up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is to build up the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, when we come to a local church meeting, we must prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Ephesians 4 the perfecting of the saints is for the building up of the Body of Christ v. 12 . In 1 Corinthians 14 prophesying is for the building up of the church vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The building of the church is local, but in the small groups we build up the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You must not forget these four points.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It does not matter whether you know how to carry them out or not.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When you return to your locality, you must look to the Lord for His grace so that you can practice these points and live such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You should not tell people that you are going to do a work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To promote such a work is wrong and will stir up trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You do not need to say anything, but just live such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As you live such a life, you spontaneously go to bring people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some will see what you are doing and will want to have fellowship with you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They may then become your team members and go out together with you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no need for any kind of promotion or propaganda but a daily practice.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To repeat, first go out and bring people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No one will criticize you for doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Immediately after their salvation, you should go back to cherish and nourish them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When there are a few of you doing the same thing with these three or four, you can bring them together for an informal group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then you need to bring them to prophesy in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>AVOIDING DISCORD, SEPARATION, AND DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eleventh, you need to avoid three things: discord, separation, and division.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the New Testament there are three cases to illustrate these.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Discord is illustrated by the two sisters Euodias and Syntyche in Philippians 4:2.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They were co-workers who were not in one accord and spoke different things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a case of discord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The story of Barnabas and Paul illustrates the second point.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They were very intimate co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was Barnabas who brought Saul into the ministry Acts 11:24-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At the beginning of their ministry journey, Barnabas took the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The record in Acts mentions Barnabas first, then Saul Acts 11:30; 12:25; 13:2, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Acts 13:9 records that at a certain point in their journey, Saul's name was changed to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From this point on, Paul took the lead in the apostolic ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was probably due to the fact that Barnabas did not have as much of a speaking ministry as Paul Acts 14:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although they worked closely together, something happened.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After they had agreed to go back and visit the new believers, Barnabas proposed to bring his cousin Mark with them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, Paul was unwilling to bring him along because he withdrew during their first trip Acts 13:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore they separated from each other Acts 15:37-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They were not divided, but separated.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 1 Corinthians 1:10-13 there is the case of division among the Corinthian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They were divided by their differing appreciations of the gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They cared for their preferences and neglected the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By this they made divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Wherever you are, you must try your best to avoid creating any kind of discord, separation, or division.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>First, discord comes when two of you hold on to your own opinions so that you cannot speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This may cause a separation between you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Separation comes out of discord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After separation will come division.</S>
