   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. PSALM 102 BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A PRAYER OF AN AFFLICTED ONE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The title of Psalm 102 is "A Prayer of an afflicted one, when he is fainting and he pours out his complaint before Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This psalm is therefore an expression of the psalmist's sentiment, with his affliction vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1-5, 9-11 referring to the affliction of Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>6-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>CHRIST BEING THE KEY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THAT TURNS THE EARTH TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verses 6 through 8 and 12 through 27 reveal that Christ is the key that turns the earth to the Lord and that recovers God's title and right over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without Christ this cannot be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A. Based upon His Suffering</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ's being the key that turns the earth to the Lord is based upon His suffering vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>6-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 7 says, "I lie awake, and I am like/A lone sparrow on a housetop."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The "housetop" here refers to the flat roof of a Jewish house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>People would often go to the housetop to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Peter did this in Acts 10:9.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since Psalm 102:7 refers to Christ, this verse indicates that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, probably there were times when in the night He, like a lone sparrow on a housetop, would watch and pray, caring for God's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was also the situation of the writer of this psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because of the devastation of Zion, he could not sleep nor stay in bed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, he went to the housetop where he poured out his complaint to God, asking Him to look upon Zion, the city, and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Psalm 102:7 is a particular verse concerning Christ's suffering, His affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His affliction was related to His zeal for God's house John 2:17; Psa 69:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In His suffering Christ was a watcher, caring not for His own interest but for the interest of God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, He likened Himself to a lone sparrow on the roof of a house.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As He was watching for God's interest, He was like a lone sparrow on a housetop.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was an aspect of Christ's suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we have pointed out, Christ's suffering was for the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today's Christians realize that Christ's suffering, which consummated in His death, was for redemption, but very few realize that His suffering was also for the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to see that Christ's death was for redemption to produce the church.</S>
