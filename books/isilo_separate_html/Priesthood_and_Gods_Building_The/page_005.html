<p>In the past we were very short in regard to the matter of fellowship in the spirit. On one hand, many serving ones were lacking in their fellowship with God, and on the other hand, when we came together, we lacked a genuine fellowship in the spirit with one another. For example, in the elders&rsquo; meeting many things are discussed and many opinions are voiced, but it is rare for our spirits to come forth and be blended as one in the Spirit, touching God&rsquo;s feeling in our fellowship. This indicates that we are lacking in the matter of fellowship in the spirit. This situation also exists among the co-workers. In a recent meeting some co-workers acknowledged that there was no fellowship in the spirit among the co-workers, even though they lived, ate, and served in the same place, and even though there was never disagreement or disharmony.</p>
<p>Many of us have been meeting and bearing responsibility in the same place for many years, but how frequently are our spirits open to one another and blended as one in order to have genuine fellowship? Many responsible brothers and sisters in the districts admit that they rarely have fellowship, even though they serve together. Although they do not fight, argue, or strive, they also do not fellowship.</p>
<p>When we were first raised up by the Lord and were serving Him zealously, we were very fresh and genuine, but we were also rather childish. When we served together, we would speak whenever we felt to say something, and we would argue with one another whenever we disagreed. After a period of time, we learned to be political. On the surface, we were at peace with one another, but when we came together, we could not touch one another&rsquo;s spirit. If a brother made a suggestion, the other brothers would agree, and the sisters would indicate their support of the brothers&rsquo; decision. However, our real feeling often was far different, but no one was willing to speak up. Some learned not to say anything or complain, and others would begin to complain as soon as the meeting was over.</p>
<p>This is also the case when we pray. In the service meeting many prayers are perfunctory and not out of the spirit. This can be likened to a business with two sets of accounting books: a public set that meets the requirements of the tax agencies and a hidden set that has the actual numbers of the business. We must ask ourselves whether we have two sets of prayers and two faces when we pray. Do we have a public set when we deal with others?</p>
<p>Currently, in every meeting hall there are several elders and co-workers, and we come together once a week to pray and fellowship. Nevertheless, I am concerned that when we come together and serve, we never open up our spirits to one another. We sit down to discuss and arrange things, but we do not exercise our spirits and allow our spirits to come forth to be blended with one another. When a senior brother takes the lead in a certain matter, our spirits are closed. Sometimes we may participate in the prayer with a few words, asking the Lord to bless whatever is decided. This kind of prayer, however, is rather perfunctory, because our spirit is not stirred up. In contrast, when we give a message, we know that our spirit must come forth; consequently, we pray desperately to release our spirit. On one hand, we do not have adequate fellowship with God, and on the other hand, we lack fellowship with one another. Due to this severe lack, I feel that we cannot speak on the matter of building so quickly. Instead, we must strengthen our fellowship, recover our fellowship, and let fellowship balance the exercise of authority.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECOVERING THE FELLOWSHIP AND<br />
BEING BLENDED INTO ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>I have a very heavy burden. When the saints in various districts come together to coordinate, we should try our best to change the focus of our meeting to one that pursues fellowship. In this kind of meeting, every saint should open his spirit to God and to the brothers and sisters. When we come together, instead of considering so many things, we should simply release our spirit. When I pray, I should release my spirit. When you pray, you should release your spirit. This will allow our spirits to come forth in a genuine way without any outward pretense. If we practice to worship, praise, give thanks, and petition together, there will be a fellowship and blending in the spirit.</p>
<p>If we fellowship and blend in one spirit in this way, we will quickly be harmonized, even if we have different opinions. However, if we do not have adequate prayers that blend us in the spirit, we will only voice our opinions when we discuss matters, and the more we discuss, the more opinions we will have. Furthermore, there will be no edification in the spirit. When we come together, we should not care for our opinions, we should care only that our spirits would come forth. If we release our spirits, we will be blended as one in a thorough fellowship. In this way the Holy Spirit will bring us to a point where we have the same feeling, the same view, and touch the heart of God. Then when we speak of building up and practice the building up, authority and order will be balanced by fellowship. This is the genuine fellowship and blending in the spirit and the genuine building up.</p>
<p>I hope that we can all see this need. We must begin to make adjustments. The elders should change the way that they meet. When they arrive in the meeting, they should first release their spirits, and discuss things only after they exercise their spirits and fellowship. We must release our spirits in order to truly honor one another. We should release our spirits by worshipping, giving thanks, praising, and petitioning the Lord together. When we are blended in the spirit in this way, it will be easy to take care of everything. Similarly, when the co-workers come to the co-workers&rsquo; meeting, they should not care for anything other than being blended in the spirit. All the brothers and sisters who serve should come together and be blended in the spirit.</p>
<p>I hope that we can learn to first be blended together in the spirit, putting practical matters temporarily aside. Rather than starting with the needs of the brothers and sisters or even the affairs of the whole church, we should first blend our spirits together. Similarly, the brothers and sisters who are serving should also come together and blend their spirits. This is a severe lack among us. We are busy discussing and making arrangements, but we lack fellowship in the spirit. This puts the cart before the horse and sacrifices substance for the shadow. Now when we serve, we are like the dry bones in Ezekiel 37; we are piled together, but we are not fresh or living, and we are not joined, or linked, together. Instead, we are separated and scattered.</p>
<p>In addition to the bread-breaking meeting, we should come together often during the week to blend our spirits together. We should come together in the morning and in the evening to blend our spirits together; our spirits must be blended. Before doing anything, we first must blend our spirits together. This can be likened to mixing flour. If the flour is not well mixed, it will not be possible to make steamed buns or dumplings. If we do not blend our spirits well, our leading in a meeting or our visitation with the brothers and sisters will be futile. Without fellowship and blending, our leading will be dry, and our visitation will be dead and empty. It is not too much to say that our spirits are scattered and isolated from each other. Our spirits need to be released from layer upon layer of bondage. When we begin to practice this, we will not be accustomed to releasing our spirit with others. This can be likened to the hinges on a window being rusty and stiff because of a lack of use. A door with rusty hinges may need to be pried open with a little force. Furthermore, the door will need to be opened with regularity in order to not become stuck once again. As we begin to practice the matter of fellowship and blending, we may need to use a little &ldquo;force&rdquo; in order to release our spirits.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
