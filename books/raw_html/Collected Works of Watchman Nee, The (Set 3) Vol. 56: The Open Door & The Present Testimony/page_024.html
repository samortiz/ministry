<h2 class="head2">They Actually Treat Us Well (Canton)</h2><p>Thank the Lord that the situation of the church here is very good. The brothers and sisters are all well taken care of. Please do not worry about us. The government somehow has become aware of us. Last month Sister Liu Mu-zhen came from Chingyuan. She said that the church there is able to stand firm. Before the Party Officials entered the county, the Farmers' Cooperative took the opportunity to damage our church. Later, after the Party Officials arrived, the Farmers' Cooperative made accusations concerning our sister to them. All their accusations proved to be false in the end. The Party Officials actually treat our church (in Chingyuan) well. They even called a meeting of all the population (including those who had accused our sister) to explain and prove that our sister was a good person. They also made a Peoples' order exhorting everyone to repair the damaged tiles on the roof of the sister's house (the meeting hall).</p><p>I am in the steamship business as my "Gospel Business." The Lord has really blessed it. I stand on the ground of a Christian in carrying out my business. I maintain the attitude in Philippians 3:7-8 to spend the rest of my days for the Lord. Thank the Lord that He has led us into the correct way. He told us and ordered us to do this long ago. By the Lord's grace, may we go on well in the way before us.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chien Yao-ji<br />January 27, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">In Need of the Supply of the Word (Hsuchang)</h2><p>The church in Hsuchang began to have the Lord's table in May 1945, but there were only seven brothers and sisters in the fellowship. We only had prayer, fellowship, and Lord's table meetings because we did not have a fixed meeting place. We have recently built two small huts for the meetings. Three sisters were baptized this spring. When we preached the gospel over the Chinese New Year, twenty men and women registered as believing in the Lord. Now more than thirty people come to the meetings. There are twelve brothers and sisters in the Lord's table meetings.</p><p>The meeting in Zhengzhou began last year. The meeting in Kaifeng began to stand on the ground of locality last month.</p><p>All the meetings in Honan province are very immature. We really need the leading brothers to come help us and lead us. If you do not, the brothers and sisters in the inland, or we should say, the churches in the inland, will never meet God's requirements for the church. The stature of the church is closely related to the supply of the word; therefore, we hope that someone can come help us. We hope that brothers with jobs would migrate to live among us. It would be best if they would come with their families.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Wu Chong-san, Kuo Tien-en<br />October 11, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">Continually Making a Turn (Xiaoshan)</h2><p>On May 10, 1950 (the Lord's Day) scores of brothers and sisters here determined to leave the denominations because of the light of the truth, the testimony of the Body of Christ, and the leading of the Holy Spirit. We spent three days fasting and praying before beginning to meet in the Lord's name in Xiaoshan. Over the past few months, we have been enlightened by the Lord, and another score of people have continually made the turn. There are now around seventy or eighty people in the meetings on the Lord's Day. We really praise and thank the Lord. The Lord Himself has been steadily leading this group of weak, scrawny lambs. We still hope the brothers and sisters in the Lord would pray for us that we would see more light, understand more of the truth, and be able to start the Lord's table. We are all happy to offer up ourselves, and everyone is willing to speak for the Lord that His name would be glorified.</p><p>Lin Wang-ho, Kao De-chun,<br />and Lee Run-sheng<br />September 24, 1950</p>
