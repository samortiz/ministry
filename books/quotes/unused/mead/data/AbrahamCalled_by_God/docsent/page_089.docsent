   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ISHMAEL'S MOCKING OF ISAAC</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to Genesis 21, it was not the birth of Isaac that stirred up trouble; it was his growth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Isaac was born, Hagar and her son Ishmael were not bothered very much.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But after Isaac had grown up, Ishmael began to mock him v. 9 . In the biblical sense, this means that Ishmael was persecuting Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God even counted Ishmael's persecution of Isaac as the beginning of the four-hundred-year persecution of His people 15:13; Acts 7:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ishmael's mocking was a serious thing because Isaac was God's ordained seed and Ishmael was the counterfeit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The counterfeit always hates the ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We, the ordained seed, are hated by the counterfeit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As Paul says in Galatians 4:29, "But as then he that was born according to flesh persecuted him that was born according to Spirit, so also it is now."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The growth of Isaac stirred up that persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>HAGAR AND ISHMAEL CAST OUT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sarah, the one who represented grace, would not tolerate Ishmael's mocking of Isaac and said, "Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac" v. 10 . When I read this verse as a youth, I did not agree with Sarah, thinking that she was jealous and unfair.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was she who proposed to Abraham that he have a son by Hagar and now she tells him to cast Hagar and Ishmael out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to my youthful understanding, I would have cast Sarah out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But one day, as I was thinking in this way, God rebuked me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That day I was arguing in favor of Hagar and Ishmael and sympathizing with Abraham, for "the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son" v. 11 . Although I thought that Abraham should have answered Sarah, telling her that she was cruel, he said nothing to her.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, God came in and told Abraham, "Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called" v. 12 . The heavenly Judge made the final decision, telling him to do what Sarah requested.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only Isaac, not Ishmael, was to be counted as the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although Abraham had failed God in chapter twenty, he was quick to obey Him in chapter twenty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 14 says that Abraham rose up early in the morning and sent Hagar and Ishmael on their way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to see the spiritual significance of the casting out of Hagar and Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Like all Christians, you have been trying to do good since the day you were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But God has dealt with you, and many times you have been disciplined and cut.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you are a married brother, God has undoubtedly used your wife as the knife to cut your natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every wife is such a sharp knife in the divine hand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many Christian husbands can only be thoroughly dealt with and disciplined by the cutting of the wife-knife.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No husband can escape it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am happy to see that in the local churches God has used the wife-knives to deal with the natural life of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way, we brothers learn the lesson of hating our natural life and all the good things we can produce out of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although we may hate our natural life and all that it produces, we do not hate it absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Deep within, we still appreciate it and say, "This Ishmael whom I have produced is quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was born of me."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a concept always delays Isaac's birth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was only after Abraham had undergone dealing after dealing and failure after failure that Isaac finally came forth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ has been born in our Christian life, but we still keep our Ishmael, hesitating to give up our good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many of us still boast in our natural goodness, saying, "I am not as proud as some of the brothers and sisters are.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I thank God that I was born humble."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The sisters might criticize others, saying, "I would never gossip the way Sister So-and-so does.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I was not born that way."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even some elders and so-called ministers of the Word cannot keep from boasting of their natural attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Perhaps they say to themselves, "Brother So-and-so is so quick to lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But I thank God that my natural birth is much better than his."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although you may not utter this, it is nevertheless hidden deep within you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the Christ who has been born in our Christian life has begun to grow up, our natural goodness will mock Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then the grace within us will say, "Cast out the law!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Cast out the bondwoman and what you have produced with her by your fleshly effort."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Will you do this?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You may do it apparently, but secretly you still hold on to Hagar and Ishmael, to the law and to your natural attributes and goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Not many Christians today have the boldness to say as Sarah did, "Cast out this bondwoman and her son."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Not many would say, "Cast out the law, the effort of the flesh, and all the success of my effort."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, we cling to our success and hold on to our natural goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But sooner or later God will force us to abandon the law, our self-effort, and all we have produced.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The brothers and sisters will then begin to rise up and say, "From now on there will be no more Hagar and Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They must go."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Like Abraham, they will send them away with only bread and water v. 14 . Sooner or later we all must do this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must rise up one morning, give the law a skin of water, and say, "Law, go your way, and take with you the one you helped me to produce.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Don't leave him with me, because I don't want him anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I loved Ishmael in the past, but now I give him up."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The law and the result of the effort of the flesh must be fully abandoned.</S>
