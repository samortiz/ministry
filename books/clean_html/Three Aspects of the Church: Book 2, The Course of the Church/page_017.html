<h1 class="title">THE PROPER ATTITUDE<br />
DURING THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>As those who live during the desolation of the church, we need to realize that the desolation manifests our condition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DESOLATION MANIFESTING EACH ONE&rsquo;S CONDITION</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 11:19 says, &ldquo;For there must even be parties among you, that those who are approved may become manifest among you.&rdquo; <em>Those who are approved</em> can also be translated &ldquo;those who are approved by testing.&rdquo; This means that when there are parties in the church, those whom God approves are manifested. During the desolation of the church, the different kinds of confusion, errors, and corruption function to manifest the ones approved by God. Whoever passes through the tests and is approved by God will be manifested through the desolation.</p>
<p>God does not desire the desolation, but in His hand it functions to manifest those who can pass the tests. Without desolation, confusion, errors, corruption, and darkness, we would not be able to see each individual&rsquo;s condition. In other words, during a time of peace and security, we cannot tell whom God approves and who passes the test. However, when situations of desolation arise, our condition is manifested. We are manifested with respect to what kind of person we are, including our situation before the Lord, the lessons we have learned, and our motives. These matters cannot remain hidden. Desolation tests us and manifests what we are before the Lord.</p>
<p>Thank the Lord that at present in Taiwan we do not have contentions among us; however, no one can guarantee that in six months or a year the church will still be without some desolation. When there is desolation, our real situation will be manifested. Desolation exposes people; corrupt things expose people. When the church is peaceful and secure, everyone is the same; we do not feel that we are any different from others. But when desolation comes in, our situation cannot be hidden, and all things are manifested.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER ATTITUDE<br />
DURING A PERIOD OF DESOLATION</h2>
<p>In facing the desolation of the church, we should ask ourselves, &ldquo;Where do I stand? Is my intention proper? Is my motive pure? Is there any area in which I am disobedient to God? Have I been dealt with by God to a sufficient extent?&rdquo; If our inward condition is improper, we will be unable to control ourselves when desolation comes.</p>
<p>In 1942 there was a storm in the church in Shanghai. I was not there and did not understand the real situation. Later, I went to Shanghai, and gradually I learned what had happened. Very few brothers and sisters stood firm during that storm; only a handful passed through the storm and were approved by God. The storm manifested the real condition of their hearts and fulfilled the word in 1 Corinthians 11:19. The storm was like a flood, sweeping away many and leaving only a small number who passed the test and were approved by God. Desolation has its usefulness, but we should be careful when desolation comes, because it will expose us. When desolation or corruption comes into the church, it is a test to all of us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Holding a Good Conscience</h2>
<p>First Timothy 1:19-20 says, &ldquo;Holding...a good conscience, concerning which some, thrusting these away, have become shipwrecked regarding the faith; of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander.&rdquo; The books of 1 and 2 Timothy contain the most practical speaking in all the Bible regarding the conscience. In both 1 and 2 Timothy Paul emphasizes the conscience because it is very much related to the desolation of the church. When the church is in desolation, those who follow the Lord and live before Him must hold a good conscience. Paul commands Timothy to &ldquo;war the good warfare&rdquo; of the faith (1 Tim. 1:18) and to &ldquo;guard the good deposit&rdquo; (2 Tim. 1:13-14). However, Paul&rsquo;s commands to Timothy concerning holding a good conscience are stronger than his words concerning holding the faith.</p>
<p>In a sense, the main reason the church became desolate was because of problems in people&rsquo;s conscience. Some deviated from the faith, and some spoke differently from the apostles, because they did not care for the feeling in their conscience. If we consider carefully we will realize that all the confusion in the church comes from people quenching and ignoring the feeling of the conscience. A person may hold the faith and yet have a problem in his conscience. However, he cannot hold a good conscience without holding the faith, because if he does not hold the faith, his conscience will condemn him. During the desolation of the church, the opinions, ideas, and assertions of others cannot be our guide; the speaking of our conscience within us is our guide. In order to hold a good conscience, we must avoid doing anything that causes the conscience to lose its peace. We do not need to argue about whether or not our conscience is good.</p>
<p>When I was in northern China, some people rebuked me, saying that I was causing trouble in Christianity, and they carelessly made false accusations against me. I did not argue with them. I only said, &ldquo;I have peace in my conscience. May you, too, have peace in your conscience.&rdquo; Many times when I spoke in this way, their expressions would change, and they would be unable to speak. What we say does not mean anything; the conscience is our standard. If we are at peace in our heart, everything is all right. During the desolation of the church, the function of the conscience is crucial, just as lights are crucial in a time of darkness. Once some people fiercely rebuked Brother Nee. He said softly, &ldquo;You have One within you who is speaking on my behalf.&rdquo; This influenced me greatly.</p>
<p>Excuses, debates, and arguments are useless; the conscience is our standard. Therefore, we should not reason with others or with ourselves. Rather, we should simply check whether our conscience is at peace. In all things we need to ask ourselves about our conscience; only the voice of our conscience can be our standard. When people rebuke us, we do not need to argue with them. In the midst of outward difficulties we should seek inward peace.</p>
<p>When God first touches us, He touches our conscience. This is both the beginning and the foundation. Regardless of how deep or high our experience of the Lord is, the conscience is still the primary part. One of the main factors in the desolation of the church is that the brothers and sisters have problems with their conscience. Because they did not care for the sense in their conscience, some veered off from the faith, and others opposed the apostles. To deal with desolation, we must deal with our conscience. Once our conscience has been dealt with, the desolation is almost behind us.</p>
<p>Consider the example of baptism. When the church is in a proper condition, there is only one teaching regarding baptism. However, when the church is in desolation, there are many questions. Someone may ask, &ldquo;Should I be baptized? How should I be baptized?&rdquo; These are typical questions. We do not need to argue; we can simply say, &ldquo;Whatever you have the peace in your heart to do is fine. Do whatever you have the peace to do.&rdquo; This will touch his conscience. Once a brother told me that he had the peace not to be baptized. I answered, &ldquo;Fine. Then do not be baptized.&rdquo; The next day he came to me again because he had no inward peace. He admitted that he was wrong and asked to be baptized. It is more effective to touch someone&rsquo;s conscience than to speak ten messages to him. As Christians, we must act in a way that takes care of the peace within. It is useless to argue about doctrines with people; rather, we should touch the feeling in their conscience.</p>
<p>If God has not touched our conscience, we will be unable to touch someone else&rsquo;s conscience. Because the Lord Jesus had a pure conscience, He could touch other people&rsquo;s conscience. If His conscience had condemned Him, He could not have said to the crowd in John 8:7, &ldquo;He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.&rdquo; Because His word touched their conscience, they walked away one by one, from the oldest to the youngest. The Lord touched their conscience, because His conscience was pure. My intention is not to show how to deal with others during the desolation; I am begging the Lord that we would see a principle that we can apply to ourselves. During the desolation of the church, there are many different interpretations and arguments. If we follow a certain interpretation, we will be shaken; if we follow a certain argument, we will be confused. The standard is our conscience.</p>
<p>First John 3:21 says, &ldquo;If our heart does not blame us, we have boldness toward God.&rdquo; This word was spoken during the desolation of the church. In some things God condemns us according to the feeling of our conscience. We may be wrong in certain matters, but if our conscience has no feeling, our responsibility toward God in these matters is not as great. However, God will not be loose concerning any matter that He has shined on and touched in our conscience. We must bear responsibility before God for these things. If we have received mercy from God, we can say, &ldquo;Other people may do this, but I cannot.&rdquo; Other people may have the peace to do something, but God prohibits us from doing it. It does not matter whether it is right or wrong; rather, it is a matter of whether or not our conscience allows us to do it.</p>
<p>Some have asked me if it is right to advertise our gospel meetings as some groups do, using newspaper advertisements to promote a professor or world-famous evangelist. The question should not be whether this is right, but whether our conscience is at peace. We do not criticize others, because they are responsible for their actions before the Lord, just as we are responsible for our actions before the Lord. They may not be condemned in this matter because their conscience has no feeling about it. However, if we have a feeling, then we are responsible. Thus, there is no outward regulation or standard. In the desolation of the church, everything depends on whether our conscience is pure before God. We must do our best to keep this principle.</p>
<p>The conscience is the key. While the church is in desolation, we must learn the lesson of the conscience. Then we will avoid many arguments and criticisms. We should never place doctrines and teachings before others, telling them what they should or should not do. When the church was in extreme desolation, Paul wrote to Timothy, but he did not tell Timothy what to do. He did not require Timothy to adhere to regulations and doctrines but asked him to hold a good conscience. If we practice this and lead others in this way, then we will learn not to criticize others or to override their conscience.</p>
<p>If a brother&rsquo;s way of bringing people to salvation causes us to lose peace, we should not criticize him. We should allow his conscience to bear the responsibility before God. If we speak something to him, it should not be in the way of criticism. We should only testify regarding the Lord&rsquo;s care for us. If the Lord touches and enlightens his conscience through our testimony, it is enough. In the midst of the desolation of the church we should hold a good conscience and should not override the conscience of others. We should not speak doctrines to others, nor should we make excuses for ourselves.</p>
