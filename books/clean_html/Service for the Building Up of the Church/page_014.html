<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">JOINED TOGETHER AND KNIT TOGETHER</h1>
<p>Ephesians 4:15-16 is the most important reference in the Bible concerning the building up of the church. The building of God is a major topic in the Bible, and the building up of the church is spoken of in many verses in the New Testament. However, it is not easy to find verses that speak in more detail about how the church is built up than Ephesians 4:15-16.</p>
<p>The first mention of the building of the church in the New Testament is in Matthew 16:18, when the Lord said, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; In His speaking the Lord spoke only of the church being built upon the foundation of Christ, the Son of God, and upon the revelation concerning Christ. He did not tell us how the church would be built. Romans 12:4-5 speaks of the coordination of the various members in the church, which is related to the building up of the church. Nevertheless, it does not speak of how such a coordinated building is produced.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:1-5 speaks of earnestly desiring spiritual gifts, especially that we may prophesy, in order to build up the church, but it does not say how these gifts build up the church. First Peter 2:4-5 speaks of the Lord being a living stone and of our coming to Him so that we, as living stones, may be built up as a spiritual house. However, these verses do not say how we are built up.</p>
<p>Ephesians is focused on the church. Of all the books in the Bible, only this book presents a thorough picture of how the church is built up. Although 2:11-22 shows that the church becomes the dwelling place of God by being built up, only chapter 4 provides the details of how this building up is carried out. Verses 11 and 12 speak of gifts&mdash;apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers&mdash;perfecting the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ. Verses 15 and 16 then speak in detail concerning how the church is built up. Although verses 15 and 16 are not very long, they contain every necessary detail concerning the building up of the church. We need to see ten items in these verses in general and one item in greater detail.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
INVOLVING TEN ITEMS</h2>
<p>The first item is love. Without love, the building up of the church is not possible. Verse 15 begins with <em>holding to truth in love,</em> and verse 16 ends with <em>the building up of itself in love.</em> Love is indispensable in the building up of the church.</p>
<p>The second item is truth. After love there is truth, or the holding to truth. When these two items&mdash;love and truth&mdash;are present, the church is balanced. Love balances truth, and truth balances love. The Bible is quite wonderful when it speaks of holding to truth in love. The building up of the church requires both love and truth.</p>
<p>The third item relates to the Head and how we practically experience the authority of the Head. The second half of verse 15 speaks of growing up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ. This shows that knowing the Lord as the Head is not a matter of knowledge or doctrine but of growing in life into the Head, Christ, in all the things in our daily life. Even though we are saved, there are many areas in our life in which we have not yet grown up into the Head. Many situations in our living expose the fact that we are still not joined to the Head. Hence, the fourth item speaks of our need to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things. Growth is very important.</p>
<p>The fifth item relates to the joints of the rich supply. In order for the church to be built up, there must be some brothers and sisters who are joints of supply to the whole Body. The sixth item is the measure of each one part. Every member has a measure, and the operation in each member is according to this measure. The seventh item speaks of the operation in this measure. This is a great item involving practice. The eighth item is the Body being joined together and knit together. The ninth item relates to the Body causing the growth of the Body. Finally, the tenth item speaks of the Body building itself up in love.</p>
<p>These ten items are indispensable for the building up of the church. The building up of the church requires love as well as truth, the Head as well as the growth of the saints, the joints of supply as well as the measure of each one part, and above all, the operation in the measure of each one part. The building up of the church requires the joining together and the knitting together of these parts through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part so that the church can cause itself to grow. This growth not only builds up the church but builds up the church in love.</p>
