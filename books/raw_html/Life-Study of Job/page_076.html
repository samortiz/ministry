<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Having Not Received the Divine Revelation<br>concerning God's Ultimate Goal to Be Gained,<br>Partaken Of, Possessed,<br>and Enjoyed by His Chosen People</H2><P>Job's speaking indicates that he had not received the divine revelation, as unveiled in the New Testament concerning God's eternal economy, that God's ultimate goal, as God desires for His good pleasure, is that He may be gained, partaken of, possessed, and enjoyed by His chosen people that they may be consumed by God's dealing, renewed in the divine nature (2 Cor. 4:16), and transformed in the divine life by the Spirit to the glorious image of Christ (2 Cor. 3:18) as the embodiment of God for God's expression. Job lived long before this revelation was given.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Darkened by the Success<br>and Attainments of His Natural Being</H2><P>Regarding ethical and moral things, Job had great success and high attainments. However, as exposed by his speaking, he was darkened by the success and attainments of his natural being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Blinded by the Concept<br>of His Natural Understanding</H2><P>Job was also blinded by the concept of his natural understanding.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Groping in Darkness and in Blindness<br>concerning His Relationship with God<br>according to What God Wants</H2><P>Furthermore, Job was a person groping in darkness and in blindness concerning his relationship with God according to what God wants. Job did not see that God's intention was to strip him of all his natural attainments, of his perfection and integrity, so that he could gain God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Contented with What He Had Become</H2><P>As indicated by his speaking, Job was a person who was contented with what he had become. He was proud of his robe of righteousness and of his crown, his turban, of integrity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. Being Unaware<br>of His Miserable Situation before God</H2><P>Job was unaware of his miserable situation before God. He acknowledged God in name but not in reality. He had not been saturated by God and filled with God. He had not been mingled with God and had not become one with God. Furthermore, Job did not possess any element that indicated some aspect and some feature of the New Jerusalem as God's organism to live God and to express God for eternity. Job did not know his situation, and he did not know the New Jerusalem.</P>
