   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How inconvenient is a state of passivity!</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>During this period of time, the believer must take many notes to remind himself of many things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He must speak aloud to help himself in his thoughts and use a hundred other "crutches" that he invents to support him through the day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eventually, he finds that his feelings are gradually becoming numb and that he has unconsciously acquired many strange desires and habits.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When he speaks to others, he does not dare look at them in the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He hunches his back when he walks.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is either extremely concerned with the needs of his body or inordinately suppresses the needs of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When he does anything, he tries to give up the partial or whole use of his mind, will, reasoning, and imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In his ignorance, the believer fails to realize that these symptoms of sickness come from passivity and demon- possession.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He thinks that they are caused by his own natural weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The believer comforts himself by thinking that these symptoms are present because he does not have as many "gifts" as others, because his "intelligence" is different from others, or because his "natural ability" is inferior to others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He has no feeling of alarm that he is the way he is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Little does he realize that these symptoms are the lies of evil spirits, the purpose of which is to deceive him more.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He dares not work and dares not take anything upon himself because he considers that he has a repulsion for work, being mentally weak, ineloquent, and slow of thought.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He thinks that he has probably overworked in the past and that he is physically unfit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He never asks why other believers are not this way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why are those who are behind him in gifts not this way?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why was he not this way in the past?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He thinks that these things are innate, natural, and dispositional, and does not realize that they are the work of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This foolishness enables evil spirits to gain more ground and causes the believers to endure more sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The authorities of darkness know the present condition of the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They fashion many difficulties in the believer's environment to persistently bother him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once the believer's will becomes passive and unable to work, evil spirits will put him in a position where he is forced to use his will, in order to discourage him and make him a laughingstock in front of others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At this time, the believer becomes a caged bird, and the evil spirits are like naughty children, teasing him as much as they desire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are always stirring up storms and troubling the believer with many things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The believer has no power to protest or resist them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His environment becomes worse, and life becomes more meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although the believer has the authority to deal with everything, he keeps silent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way the authorities of darkness gradually gain the upper hand and cause the believer to turn from a state of ignorance, deception, and passivity to that of demon-possession, thus suffering torment in the hand of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, God's children are surprisingly ignorant that these conditions cannot be from God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead, they passively accept them.</S>
