   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that by Your mercy and grace we can be here, gathered together into You.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lord, we believe that Your oracle will be here again.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Open us to You as You are open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, we need Your clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Take away all the veils.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to see something that is deep within You.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not want knowledge; we do not want doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We desire to touch Yourself as the life-giving Spirit, as the transforming Spirit, as the glorifying Spirit, as the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We do not want to touch anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You are such a Spirit, and You are now in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We thank You and worship You for these two spirits, the divine Spirit and the human spirit mingled together as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Tonight we believe that we are in this one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Speak to us in this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even, Lord, speak in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The burden for the messages in this book can be expressed in the following two sets of statements, the first set concerning the God-men plural and the second concerning a God-man singular : Set 1:</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The God-men, as the regenerated children of God, constitute the new man, as the new creation of God, with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The God-men, as the spiritual household of God, build up the Body of Christ, as the Triune God's organism, with the transforming life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The God-men, as the royal priesthood of God, struggle to be the overcomers, as God's Zion in Jerusalem, with the reigning life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The God-men, as the chosen race of God, consummate the New Jerusalem, as God's eternal expression, with the glorifying life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Set 2:</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A God-man who knows the excellent Christ should live a life conformed to the death of Christ by the power of His resurrection Phil 3:8, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A God-man who has Christ living in him should live Christ and magnify Christ by the bountiful supply of His Spirit Gal 2:20; Phil 1:19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A God-man who has been freed by Christ as the Lord Spirit should be transformed and conformed to the glorious image of Him as the firstborn Son of God 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To reign by grace in life in this age and to triumph in Christ unto glory in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The subject of the messages in this book can be expressed in just two words: the God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The six chapters of this book cover four major topics: the first, the God-men and the new man; the second, the God-men and the Body of Christ; the third, the God-men and the overcomers; and the last, the God-men and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The New Jerusalem is the conclusion of the entire sixty-six books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some may ask, "In what book, what chapter, and what verse can you find this wonderful term the God-men?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The answer is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although we cannot find the term the Triune God in the Bible, nearly all Bible students recognize that the entire Bible reveals the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the same principle, although we cannot find the term the God-men in the Bible, the fact, the reality, of the God-men is in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Initially, the Bible speaks of the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today this God-man has become the God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The God-man is Jesus Christ, who is God incarnated to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As such a One, He is the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, He is the model God-man, the prototype for the producing of many God-men Rom 1:3-4; 8:29 , including all the dear saints throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Regardless of our nationality, and regardless of whether we are male or female, young or old, we all must believe that we are God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are all God-men, and each one of us is a God-man.</S>
