   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FAITH OF THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to the third element of the structure of the gospel of God the faith of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I use the phrase the faith of the believers because the unbelieving sinners do not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In ourselves and by ourselves, we do not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. The Word Faith Bearing Two Denotations</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word faith bears two denotations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first denotation refers to the things the believers believe in; it is the objective faith Eph 4:13; 1 Tim 1:19b; 2 Tim 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The second denotation refers to the believing action of the believers; this is the subjective faith Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is the object of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here the faith is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This believing is a subjective action, our acting faith in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. The Faith of the Believers Being</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ Entering into Them to Be Their Faith</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The faith of the believers is actually not their own faith but Christ entering into them to be their faith Rom 3:22 and note 1; Gal 2:16 and note 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now we need to consider how and when Christ entered into us to be our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we repented unto God, the pneumatic Christ as the sanctifying Spirit of God 1 Pet 1:2a moved within us to be our faith by which we believed on the Lord Jesus Acts 16:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Romans 10:17 says, So faith comes out of hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As sinners we did not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Faith came into us by our hearing the word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This word is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we heard the gospel, the preacher described Christ to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we heard, the more we saw Christ and were attracted to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As an illustration of this, we can say that a male falls in love with a female by seeing her.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more he sees her, the more he loves her.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Her being so charming produces his love for her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, that is not his love but her attraction.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The preachers preach Christ to present Christ s beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After hearing such a word about Christ, that is, after seeing such a Christ, within you there is an appreciation of Christ, and your appreciation of Him is the reaction to His attraction.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can believe in the Lord Jesus because we hear about Him, that is, we see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We read the Bible, and in the Bible we see something about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you have the opportunity, it would be very good to preach the gospel according to this crystallization of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Tell people about Christ in His divinity and humanity, in His being the only begotten Son of God and the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many logical and thoughtful people would be attracted to such a wonderful person in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Try in your vital group to go out to touch people by presenting Christ in the way that you have heard in these messages.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After seeing, that is, after knowing, such a Christ, who would not believe in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Faith comes from hearing, hearing equals seeing, and seeing equals knowing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Faith comes from hearing, and hearing is from the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the proper preaching of the gospel is going on, the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, accompanies that preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That preaching speaks Christ outside of you, but the pneumatic Christ right away accompanies that preaching and works within you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then you repent and appreciate such a One.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Spontaneously something within you rises up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is your faith, your believing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Your believing comes from your knowing of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Your believing actually is your appreciation of Christ as a reaction to His attraction.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only the believers, not the sinners, have this kind of reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you see this point, you will say, Lord Jesus, even my believing in You is You Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are so attractive and beauteous!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Who can help but believe in You?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many young people have been attracted by the Savior s beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even if their parents persecute them and threaten them to death, they will not give up their faith in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This kind of faith is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By such a faith the believing ones believe that God raised Jesus Christ from the dead that they may be saved Rom 10:9b-10a; 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They have access through faith into the grace in which they now stand Rom 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The end of Romans 9 tells us that the lawkeepers are trying to build up their own righteousness by their work to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul said that this is wrong because they do not do this by faith in Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>30-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then the beginning of chapter ten says, For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to everyone who believes v. 4 . Not many people have ever heard a gospel telling them that Christ is the end of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ terminated the law.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is the end of the law that He may become your righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The first four chapters of Romans cover justification judicially.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then chapters five to eight are on Christ as life organically.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then chapter ten is on the faith of the believers practically.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This faith can be ours by Christ being the end of the law that we may be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This means that He is the end of the law unto, resulting in, righteousness.</S>
