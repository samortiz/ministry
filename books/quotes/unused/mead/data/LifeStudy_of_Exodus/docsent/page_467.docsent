   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRODUCING OLIVE OIL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How do we produce olive oil?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In other words, how can we grow Christ as an olive tree?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We grow Him as an olive tree and produce olive oil by always exercising our mingled spirit, our regenerated spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit, and by using this mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not say or do anything apart from this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Everything we do should be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is to grow Christ as the olive tree, and this is the way to produce oil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we put all these matters into practice, we shall have more understanding of them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We shall realize that the lamb, the wheat, and the olive tree are all growing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the one hand, we are a ranch; on the other hand, we are a farm.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the ranch bulls are being raised and lambs are eating tender grass.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the farm wheat and olive trees are growing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The result is that we have an abundance of oil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Anyone who lives in this way will be filled with oil in his words, attitudes, and activities.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From experience we know that if we do not live in this way, we shall be dry, very much lacking in oil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, when a brother is arguing with his wife, both of them are dry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They do not experience anything of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if a brother and his wife both offer Christ as their sin offering, their words and activities together will be full of oil.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Between them there will be a flow of olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order for a machine to run, it must have oil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The motor in your car needs oil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Often, a machine that is lacking in oil will make an unpleasant sound.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The same is true in principle with the arguing between husband and wife.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The exchanging of words between a brother and his wife gives forth a sound of dryness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if a brother has sufficient oil, even the exchanging of words with his wife will be replaced with something that is sweet and pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The oil makes everything smooth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may say, But if we are full of the Spirit, we would not argue.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That would be very good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then instead of arguing, there would be praise and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all need olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The way to gain the oil is to deal with the mingled spirit, to use our spirit, and to live, walk, speak, and do everything by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we shall have the oil to be mingled with the flour for a meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE DRINK OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let us now say a word concerning the wine of the drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we experience Christ as the One who produces life and supplies life, we have Him as wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we walk in spirit and do things in spirit, dealing with the Spirit, we are growing olives.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then if we are willing to sacrifice and pour out what we have experienced of Christ, we shall have Him as wine.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the way to produce wine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The quantity of wine is the same as that of the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both are a quarter of a hin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This indicates that we cannot pour our life out for God more than we have enjoyed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What we pour out cannot exceed the extent of our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The oil is for enjoyment, and the wine is to be poured out as a drink offering to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What we experience of the Spirit in our spirit should be poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not retain it for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To produce oil is to live by Christ, and to produce wine is to die for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To live Christ is to grow wheat and olive trees; to die for Him is to produce wine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is to turn the oil into wine.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, we need to live Christ and also die for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We live by Him, and we live for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is to experience Him as wheat and olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But we also must die for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is to experience Him as wine.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 1 Corinthians 15:31 Paul says, Daily I die.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In 2 Corinthians 4:10 he says that day by day he experiences the putting to death of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We also need to be put to death day by day, even in our married life and family life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is to pour out as wine what we have experienced and enjoyed of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This wine is a heavenly spiritual wine poured out to God for His pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>FOOD FOR GOD S SATISFACTION</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we have the lambs, the wheat, the oil, and the wine, we have all the courses for a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have these courses by daily offering Christ as our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we practice offering Him in this way, we shall have a clear conscience and a free spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then Christ will live in us as the lamb, the wheat, the olive tree, and the grape vine.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, we shall raise Christ as a lamb and grow Him as wheat, olive trees, and vines.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The result will be that we shall have the produce of the good land as our spiritual groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we come to the meetings of the church, we should bring these groceries with us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This does not mean that we should bring all that we have produced.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Rather, we should bring two lambs, a tenth of an ephah of flour, a quarter of a hin of oil, and the same amount of wine.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should then offer all this to God as food for His satisfaction.</S>
