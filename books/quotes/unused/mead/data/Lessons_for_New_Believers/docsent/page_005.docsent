   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PASSED OUT OF DEATH INTO LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once we are regenerated, we pass out of death into life; we are made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible shows that formerly we were not only sinners; we were also dead.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, it is not enough for our sins to be washed away by the blood of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We also need to be regenerated by His life so that we can pass out of death into life and be made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If God only cleanses us outwardly without regenerating us inwardly, His salvation would be like the work of a mortician.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A mortician may clean a dead person outwardly, but the person is still dead even though he is clean.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is not the ultimate goal of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In His salvation God not only wants to cleanse us, to take away our sins; He also wants to regenerate us, to make us alive.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because we were dead in our sins, we needed God s forgiveness and God s regeneration in order that we may be made alive Eph 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As soon as we are regenerated, we pass out of death into life; we are made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 5:24 says that he who believes has passed out of death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ephesians 2:5 says that God made us alive together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Originally, we were dead in our offenses and sins, but now God has made us alive together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Colossians 2:13 says that God made us alive, having forgiven us all our offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Being made alive is a crucial point in God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not have life and are not made alive, we can never walk, grow, or serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can walk, grow, act, and serve God on the basis of having the life of God and being regenerated and made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>RESURRECTED</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who have been made alive still need to be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be resurrected is to rise up, to transcend.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In John 11 Lazarus was not only made alive in the tomb, but he rose up and left the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ephesians 2:5 says that God made us alive together with Christ, and verse 6 says that God raised us up together with Him, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the original text, to be resurrected is to be raised.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A believer who does not walk or serve the Lord has merely been made alive; he has not been raised.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In John 5:8 the Lord Jesus said to the paralyzed man, Rise, take up your mat and walk.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are saved not only to the extent of being made alive but also to the extent of being resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is similar to the lame man at the door of the temple who was healed in Acts 3:8; he was walking and leaping and praising God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After receiving the Lord s healing, he did not sit in one place, saying, Hallelujah, praise God, I am made alive; I am made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He did not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He walked, leaped, and praised God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s salvation is to save us to the extent that we are not only made alive but are resurrected, raised up, and able to act and live.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>ASCENDED</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The moment we believe in the Lord and are saved, we ascend to the heavens and become heavenly people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are transcendent.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ephesians 2:6 says, Raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have not only been raised up; we have also ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is God s salvation, and we should say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may not have any feeling when we hear this, but we need to rejoice and say, We are all in the heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have not only been raised up; today we are all in the heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>SEATED IN THE HEAVENLIES</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ephesians 2:6 not only says that we have ascended but that we are sitting in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We were formerly lying in a tomb, but we have been made alive, raised up, ascended, and seated in another place in the heavenlies; this is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we do not know of our being seated in the heavenlies, we cannot walk properly on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to walk the path on earth, we need to be seated in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is to be saved; this is God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Someone may ask, How can we go to the heavenlies to be seated there?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not superstition, nor is it foolish talk.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Consider a lamp in a building that is unconnected to a power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, if the electricity in the power plant is connected to the lamp, the lamp becomes connected to the power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Likewise, we have ascended and are sitting in the heavenlies because the Lord who is sitting in the heavenlies has been connected to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not that we have ascended and are now sitting in the heavenlies; rather, we have ascended and are sitting in the heavenlies in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>RENEWED</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once we are in the heavenlies, we are renewed inside and out.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The old things have passed away; they have become new.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are altogether new from inside to outside.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the heavenlies everything is new.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These points can be seen in Titus 3:5 and 2 Corinthians 5:17.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>RECOVERED TO SIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we are saved, our eyes are opened to see.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Acts 26:18 says that God opens our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord s gospel and His life have illuminated our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the past we were blind, but now we are saved, and our eyes have been opened and illuminated so that we can see.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Seeing does not only require life within, but it also requires a position.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although I may be living, I can still be in darkness if I am in a basement.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But, praise God, today we have ascended, and we are in God s light.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We not only have life inwardly; we are also in the light outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are altogether an illuminated person in God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>SET FREE</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At this point we are completely free; nothing can bind us, and nothing can control us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Formerly, we had sin, death, Satan, the world, the old creation, and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We were blind; everything was controlling and binding us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Before we were saved, we were not free; we were slaves of sin and under the authority of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But now that we have been saved in the many aspects mentioned above, we have indeed been set free!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the freedom spoken of in Galatians 5:1 and 13 and in John 8:36.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>SAVED</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This does not mean that we are saved only when we reach this point; rather, it means that being saved includes so much and is so rich.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is what it means to be saved in 2 Timothy 1:9, Titus 3:5, and Romans 5:9-10.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In these verses salvation does not merely refer to being forgiven outwardly; it also refers to being regenerated inwardly, and includes the rich content of being in ascension, being seated in the heavens, being renewed, having our sight recovered, and being set free.</S>
