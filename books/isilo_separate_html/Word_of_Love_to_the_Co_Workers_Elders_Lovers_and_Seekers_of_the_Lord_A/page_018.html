Lord, without Your mercy, we could not have gone on up to this day. Lord, we need Your forgiveness, Your washing away of all our dirt and defects with Your blood. Lord, we can stand here before You not on our perfection but on the blood that overcomes the accuser. We trust in Your mercy, and we trust in Your blood. Lord, this morning give us another chance for fellowship that we would be open to one another. We are open to You. Lord, come and fellowship with us, and grant us Your fellowship that we may have the freedom to fellowship with one another. Lord, give us understanding and save us from any kind of misunderstanding. Lord, give us a clear word, a clear understanding, and a clear receiving. May nothing be stumbling. Lord, save us from making mistakes. It is so easy for us to make mistakes. Lord, in our being there is the capacity to always make mistakes. We trust in You to deliver us that we may learn how to reject, how to deny, ourselves. Amen.</p><p>I hope that you would keep the outline of this message in front of you, hanging it on your wall or standing it on your desk. You should read it once a day for a month.</p><p>In the previous message we covered the first part of my word of love. In that part we covered four matters: ambition, pride, self-justification and exposing others&rsquo; failures and defects, and not conforming to the death of Christ. To conform to the death of Christ relates to the self, the natural man, and the disposition. We must deny our self, condemn our natural life, and forget about our disposition by birth. Self, the natural life or the natural man, and disposition by birth are like three evil brothers. We all have our own disposition by birth. One person may have been born a quick person. His quickness is his disposition, and his quick disposition is by his birth. He did not learn it; he was simply born that way. Another person may be a slow person. He also did not learn his slowness from others; his slow disposition is by birth. This is the fourth &ldquo;gopher.&rdquo; These four &ldquo;gophers&rdquo;&mdash;ambition, pride, self-justification, and the self, that is, the natural man in our disposition by birth&mdash;are destroying us every day. I have realized this through many years of experiences. I have been with the saints, serving the Lord since He raised me up to speak for Him in 1932. At that time, a little church was raised up through me. I could not reject my responsibility to take care of that church. So from that year, sixty-four years ago, I began to be with the serving ones. In these sixty-four years I have seen many things, I have gone through many things, I have experienced many things, and I have suffered quite much. I have suffered from others&rsquo; ambition, pride, self-justification, self, natural man, and disposition by birth.</p><p>Our history spans not only sixty-four years but nearly two thousand years. I have experienced some things myself, and I have come to know the same things through my study of church history and the biographies and autobiographies of spiritual giants. Nearly all the biographies are helpful. I read George M&#252;ller&rsquo;s autobiography. Actually, that is his daily diary, the daily record of his living. It is a very helpful book, and I received much help from it. I also read the biography of Hudson Taylor, which was written by his daughter-in-law. That also was very helpful. However, all the biographies and autobiographies are small windows through which I can see these four gophers&mdash;ambition, pride, self-justification, and the biggest one, our natural man, our self involved with our natural disposition. The outcome of all these four gophers is division. These, not other things, are the real sources of all the denominations. Hudson Taylor was a young missionary sent to China. He was working in Ningpo in the Chekiang province along the coast. After returning to England, as he was sitting by the seashore looking toward the east, he could not forget China. While he was sitting and praying, the Lord burdened him to go back to China, but not to the coast. Nearly all the missions in China were only along the coast. The Lord burdened him to go inland, to the interior. That was wonderful, but Hudson Taylor still had his defects. He declared and proclaimed that the churches established by his missionaries were not denominational; therefore, they did not have a name. That was true, but they still called themselves the churches of the China Inland Mission.</p><p>We all have defects. Martin Luther was great, but his defect was also great. At first he was a hero, but eventually he was not a hero. He was afraid of persecution by the Catholic Church, so he relied upon the king of Germany. That defect initiated the beginning of the so-called national churches, the churches of a nation, especially in Northern Europe. There are the Church of Germany, the Church of Denmark, the Church of Sweden, the Church of Norway, the Church of England, and the Church of Holland. All those national churches take their king or queen as the head of the church. The head of the Church of England today is the queen. Strictly speaking, whether you are Chinese, American, or German, to be an Episcopalian is to be a British subject. Today in Germany every citizen has to pay a church tax to the government. Luther, a great hero, made a great mistake.</p><p>I saw all these things. Among us, Brother Nee took the lead to read all these books. He exhaustively collected all the church histories, autobiographies, and biographies of the spiritual giants. In this way, he collected all the views and could make a conclusion. I received much help from Brother Nee. I also have personally been in many situations, contacting the saints, both the saints in the denominations and the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I have seen a good number of Chinese preachers who gained a name, who became famous, and many of them came into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. On the one hand, they knew that the recovery had the truth, and they were right according to the truths that the recovery holds. On the other hand, these four &ldquo;gophers&rdquo; destroyed them, and not one has remained. Some remained for a period of time, but eventually they all left. The history among us proves that those who became somewhat capable, possessing a certain &ldquo;spiritual capacity,&rdquo; eventually became a problem.</p><p>Soon after I first came to this country, we held the first summer training on the matter of the kingdom. A certain brother who was a traveling Southern Baptist preacher came to every meeting to listen to the messages. He was convinced and, in a sense, was captivated. He left the Southern Baptist Church and came among us. It was he who first brought me to Texas in 1963. The doors in Texas were opened through him. The first meetings we held there were in the small town of Tyler. There were about five hundred people who came to listen to me, including some leading ones, and they accepted my teaching. They said, &ldquo;This is right. We must be this kind of local church.&rdquo; I stayed there for a short time, and while I was in New York, they called me and asked me to return. They said, &ldquo;We have many here who are ready to meet as the local church, and we do not know how to do it. Please come to help us.&rdquo; I went back to them, and I stayed in the home of a rich man, whose wife was very eloquent and active in loving the Lord, but eventually I realized that they were not the ones who could take this way. The first group of people the Lord Jesus called did not have doctoral degrees; they were not like Nicodemus. According to the record of the New Testament, Nicodemus is mentioned only three times. He was probably not among the one hundred twenty. The first three of the twelve apostles&mdash;Peter, John, and James&mdash;were Galilean fishermen. Eventually, the one who brought me to Texas only stayed with us for six years, from 1963 to 1969. In 1969 he wanted to start his own way, using my teachings, especially from <i>The Tree of Life.</i> Even though he started his own way, he still came occasionally to Elden Hall to pick up our outlines and to see what I was putting out. I gave him a small warning, but that was all. He is still active today. I have seen many such things. Now you have been brought into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We thank the Lord for this, but if you do not cooperate with the Lord to deal with ambition, pride, and self-justification, and if you are not conformed to the death of Christ, the outcome among us will be division.</p><p>In 1964 in Los Angeles we met several different groups of people. One was a Pentecostal group, and one was an inner-life group that followed the teaching of T. Austin-Sparks. After they heard my messages, the leaders of these groups implored me, saying, &ldquo;Brother Lee, now we realize the way we should take. Let us come together to practice the Body life according to Romans 12.&rdquo; I said that this was wonderful, but if they were to practice Romans 12, they should not forget Romans 14. That was the first time this word on this subject issued forth from my mouth. I told them that if anyone wants to practice Romans 12 concerning the Body of Christ, they have to be reminded of Romans 14. In Romans 14 Paul was very liberal. According to Paul, we must receive all believers, whether they keep the Sabbath, the seventh day, or the Lord&rsquo;s Day, and regardless of what kind of food they eat, whether they are vegetarian or eat meat. We must receive them because God has received them. This is to be very general. They said, &ldquo;We will do it. We will be general.&rdquo; Therefore, we started to meet together. Afterward, I had to go to New York to attend an interview with the immigration office for my permanent residence, and when I returned, some of them came to me. One said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, a certain young sister in our meeting plays the tambourine. I cannot take that.&rdquo; This brother said that he approved of playing the piano. I asked him, &ldquo;In the eyes of God what is the difference between a piano and a tambourine?&rdquo; He admitted that there is no difference. I said, &ldquo;If you can accept the piano, why can&rsquo;t you accept the tambourine?&rdquo; One by one others came to me in the same way.</p><p>Generally speaking, there have been only two or three occasions of rebellion among us, but in actuality, there have been many. One brother who was very close to me often traveled with me, and he opened his home to me as if it were my own. However, when I began to have the life-study trainings in which I released thirty messages, he became dissenting. He could not agree with this way. He started to have the Lord&rsquo;s table with young children, serving them the table in his home, and he claimed that his way was the right way to practice the church life. Eventually, he also gave up the recovery. I have seen many things like this. Now you can see why I want to give you this word of love. You must beware of four things: ambition, pride, self-justification, and the self, the natural man, the disposition. Every human being is a self-justifying person. We only know to justify ourselves; it is very hard to recognize others&rsquo; perfection. We were all born this way, but we must not let this &ldquo;gopher&rdquo; remain within us. We must reject our self-justification. This is the first group of problems in the church life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
