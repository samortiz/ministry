   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DISPENSING, GIFTS, AND FUNCTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the book of 1 Corinthians we also see that through the divine transmission, through the divine dispensing, we have the gifts with which to function.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to function in the church, we need the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But where do the gifts come from?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not think that spiritual gifts will suddenly come upon us in a miraculous way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the contrary, all spiritual gifts are transmitted into us from God as the source.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is the source of the gifts, and the transmitting agent of the gifts is the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through the Spirit, by the Spirit, and with the Spirit God is transmitting Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This transmission will go on until it reaches the point where we have a particular gift.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then we shall be able to function with this gift.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In chapter twelve of 1 Corinthians Paul lists the functions that come out of certain gifts, such as the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, prophecy, speaking in tongues, and the interpretation of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have pointed out that prophecy is a matter of speaking for Christ and even of speaking forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All these gifts are the outcome of the divine transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May we all see that this transmission is equal to what we call the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to function, we need the gifts that come from the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I was a young Christian, I did not have much experience of the divine transmission and therefore I felt that I could not function.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, on a certain occasion I was called upon to offer a prayer at the end of the so-called service.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I was greatly surprised when I heard my name, and I did not know what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At that time, I was not clear that the living Christ was in me and that the Spirit of the living God was transmitting the riches of Christ into my being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I had neither the knowledge nor the experience of this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this reason, I did not feel that I could offer a prayer, much less speak in a public meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But after many years and by the Lord s mercy, we have learned that, according to the Bible, we may function by the gifts that come from the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the New Testament, function depends on at least three basic matters: first, the fact that we have been regenerated; second, on Christ living in us; and third, on the anointing of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE OILING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are familiar with the fact that in the Bible anointing is related to oil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, to be anointed is to be oiled.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all have the oiling Spirit within us, anointing us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What we need to do is stay firmly attached to Christ as the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 2 Corinthians 1:21 Paul says, But He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has firmly attached us to Christ, and now we need to stay attached to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we stay attached to Him in our experience, the anointing, the oiling, will never cease.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Allow me to testify of my experience of the anointing as I was preparing to give this message.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I was with the Lord concerning the message, I was anointed by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I experienced a rich oiling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because of this anointing, I was eager to come to the meeting for the purpose of dispensing the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I wanted to spread this ointment to others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our daily righteousness, sanctification, redemption and also our practical function in the church meetings come from the divine transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because we experience such an inner transmission taking place day by day, we are anointed by the Spirit, oiled by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through this anointing we have the divine essence within us for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is clearly revealed in the books of 1 and 2 Corinthians.</S>
