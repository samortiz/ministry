   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A WORD CONCERNING THE LORD'S MOVE IN RUSSIA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now I would like to say something concerning the Lord's move in Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All of those who have some feeling to go there need to be sober in their consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To move from one country to another country in order to live there involves many things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the Bible, especially in the New Testament, we Christians should be movable people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Acts 1:8 the Lord said that the disciples would be His witnesses in Jerusalem and in Judea and Samaria and even unto the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The disciples migrated to other places, not for making a living but for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible tells us that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob lived in tents Heb 11:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A tent is a movable lodging place, with no foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were always picking up their tents and moving to another place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They lived in a tent with an altar, that is, with the cross of Christ, to serve and worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why they were sojourners, pilgrims.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the first principle of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For a Christian who loves the Lord to get himself settled in a place permanently is not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are pilgrims today on this earth, moving around all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To have a proper view of the Lord's present move in Russia, we also need to understand God's economy concerning the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Genesis 1 God made man in His image and after His likeness so that man could express Him in His image and represent Him with His dominion vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Genesis later tells us that when Noah came out of the flood he built an altar to serve God, and that pleased God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then Noah made a mistake by becoming drunk and naked.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After that God used him to prophesy concerning his three sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth 9:18-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to history, these three sons eventually became three big races.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Japheth became the Europeans, and according to Noah's prophecy, Japheth would be enlarged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that the descendants of Japheth would be the strong ones to conquer and spread.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Shem is the source of the races which are mostly from Asia, including the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Palestine is a part of Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Ham became the father of the race which is mostly in Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Europe, Asia, and Africa come together geographically around the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Jewish land of Palestine is in the center of these three inhabited sections: Europe to the north, Africa to the south, and Asia to the east.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>About five hundred years ago, Columbus ventured to sail across the Atlantic, and he reached a new land, America.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, Japheth was further enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The majority of the people in the United States are the descendants of the Europeans, who are the descendants of Japheth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to history, the strong people at first were with Assyria and with Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nimrod was the builder of these two great nations Assyria with Nineveh as the capital and Babylon with the city of Babel as the capital Gen 10:8-11; Micah 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Assyria came first to invade and defeat Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then Babylon followed Assyria to conquer Israel, to destroy Jerusalem, to burn the temple, and to exile all the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later, the Medo-Persian Empire followed Babylon to defeat Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Medo-Persia was the largest empire in history.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Esther 1:1 tells us that it had one hundred twenty-seven provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today in the Persian Gulf, we have these strong peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Iran is today's Persia, and Iraq is today's Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They are fighting with each other and are still making trouble in the region of the world around the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible in Daniel 7 tells us that four beasts come up out of the Mediterranean Sea, the Great Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first beast signifies the Babylonian Empire, the second beast signifies the Medo-Persian Empire, the third beast signifies the Grecian-Macedonian Empire, and the fourth beast signifies the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Roman Empire even reached Palestine, and the Lord Jesus was born under its rule.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we read history carefully, we can see that God in carrying out His economy always went through the strong people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ was born as a captive of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Roman Empire was a strong nation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They built highways and opened up the traffic from Palestine to Rome and even to Spain.</S>
