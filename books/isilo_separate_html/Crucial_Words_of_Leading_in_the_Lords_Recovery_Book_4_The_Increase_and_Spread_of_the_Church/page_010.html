<p>This is a family matter and a family discussion. In 1980 I began to notice that the condition of the church in Taipei was at a standstill. Whenever I saw the responsible brothers, I would raise this issue and say, &ldquo;The church in Taipei should not be like this, having no advancement at all. Just like a boat that is in a current, the church will either advance or be pushed back; the church must always advance.&rdquo; I have been concerned about this situation for four years, but due to many burdens I have not been able to do anything. Therefore, after finishing the work of the New Testament footnotes and the Life-study messages in October of last year, I decided to return to Taiwan immediately.</p>
<p>Before the Lord I decided to pay attention to the work in the way that I did in 1949 when I began the work in Taiwan with the brothers. Thus, as soon as I returned to Taiwan, I began to pay attention to the matter of statistics. In order to do anything in society today, we cannot neglect statistics. Furthermore, with over thirty years of history, we can more easily locate the source of our problem, based on our history.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, the condition of the church in Taipei, whether in terms of the number of people or the meetings, is second to none. For this we worship the Lord. However, we must study why we had an annual rate of increase of one hundred percent from 1949 to 1956, but less than three percent since then. Through our lack of attention to the matter of statistics, we missed an opportunity to see our lack. Therefore, we must rise up and once again pay attention to our statistics so that we can make a correction.</p>
<p>According to the information cards, over forty thousand people have been baptized in the past twenty-eight years, but the number of people meeting has increased by only two thousand five hundred. This indicates that most of the believers that we baptized do not meet with us. There is no need to blame anyone for this, but this is a fact that we cannot deny. Actually, we all are responsible for this situation, but those of us who take the lead in the work must bear more of the responsibility. Our way has been wrong because we have ignored our statistics.</p>
<p>Today, regardless of whether one is operating a business, a government agency, or a school, there is always a set of accounts for each year. From these accounts, statistics can be derived in order to evaluate and make improvements. However, we have neglected statistics for more than ten years. This allowed us to be content with our condition because the church in Taipei was larger than churches in other cities. However, once we began to look at the statistics, we discovered that our condition has not advanced much over the last twenty-eight years. There has not been much increase, because we did not utilize our family assets appropriately.</p>
<p>We preach the gospel quite well; otherwise, forty thousand people would not have been baptized. On average, we baptize one thousand five hundred people every year. According to statistics, many have been &ldquo;born,&rdquo; but almost as many have &ldquo;died.&rdquo; The average life expectancy of a person in Taiwan is over seventy years, but our spiritual life expectancy may be less than seven years. If we had statistics on the spiritual life expectancy of the saints, I am afraid that it would be quite short. Our negligence of statistics has kept us from formulating a way to deal with our situation. We need to find a way to correct our current situation.</p>
<p>There are mainly three categories of people who have neglected these statistics. The first category includes just myself, because even though I lived overseas, I still bear some responsibility. Further, I have fellowshipped with the brothers often and even returned to Taiwan often; therefore, it is difficult to avoid blame. The second and third categories are the co-workers and the elders. We neglected our statistics and did not formulate a way to properly respond to the facts revealed by these statistics. This is because we were satisfied with the number of saints who were in the meetings. Consequently, we simply muddled along day by day. But many years have passed with no change, and in looking back, we realize that we have gained very little increase.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASE FOR THE INCREASE AND SPREAD<br />
OF THE CHURCH&mdash;<br />
ESTABLISHING SMALL GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Small Groups Being Able to Retain People</h2>
<p>The first practice that we did not carry out in a proper way relates to the small groups. From 1949 to 1956, our average annual rate of increase was mainly attributable to the formation of small groups. We gained people through the preaching of the gospel, and we retained people by meeting with them in small groups. If a mother continuously gives birth to children but has no place where they can be safeguarded, nurtured, and educated, there will be many premature deaths in her family. This is the main factor in our negligence over the past twenty-eight years. We preached the gospel constantly. The co-workers and elders were busy every day for twenty-eight years, bringing in forty-five thousand people to be baptized. Yet we did not pay attention to how to keep them, and thus, most of them have been lost. If the elders had paid attention and done a thorough job evaluating the information cards, they would not have allowed this kind of situation to persist for so long.</p>
<p>We are like broken cisterns, which cannot hold water (Jer. 2:13). We are continually drawing water, but we are letting it leak away. After drawing water for twenty-eight years, we still do not have much water. We should repair the &ldquo;cistern&rdquo; so that we can retain at least half of those who are baptized. If we would have been able to retain twenty thousand out of forty thousand people who were baptized over the past twenty-eight years, we would be in a most wonderful and encouraging situation.</p>
<p>I have no intention of rebuking anyone. If I were to rebuke, I would rebuke myself the most. Rebuking is useless; our goal is to find a remedy. In our early years we benefited greatly from the small groups. Regrettably, after 1956 we suffered a great loss after inviting a &ldquo;spiritual giant&rdquo; to &ldquo;help&rdquo; us, and our way of small groups was torn down. After 1956 the small groups ceased to function even though we did not officially announce that we would put aside the small groups.</p>
<p>Without the small groups, there was no container to hold the water. Consequently, the water that was drawn was poured onto the ground, and it seeped back into the soil. When we discovered that we were low on water, we went to the &ldquo;gospel&rdquo; well again to draw water, but the water that we drew was also poured onto the ground. For over twenty-eight years we have repeated this pattern: preaching the gospel, baptizing those who are saved, and then pouring them back onto the ground. As a result, almost everyone who has been saved has seeped back into the ground. This is like having a back door that is wider than our front door; people can leave faster than they enter. We have been satisfied for the past twenty-eight years because we have looked only at those who are coming in through the front door, but we have failed to notice that almost all of them have left through the back door. This is the result of our neglect of the small groups.</p>
<p>The purpose of my continuous talk about statistics is to help us understand the means and base for the increase and spread of Christ. These statistics can point us in the proper direction to find the means and base. For the past twenty-eight years, we have not had a proper base. Whenever a person builds a house, the first thing is to build a foundation as a base. For twenty-eight years we have been building, but it has not been on a firm base. This base is the small groups. By 1980 all the small groups were gone. In place of the small groups, there were big joint meetings, mass gatherings, and meetings involving one man speaking. This was a return to the old condition of Christianity.</p>
<p>The main method for bringing people into the Catholic Church is not gospel gatherings. One rarely sees the Catholic Church advertise a gospel gathering; their main method is personal contact and personal support. Even though Catholicism is full of heresies, their methods are superior. The Protestant denominations have more truth, but their methods are very traditional. They rely only on large gatherings, and they hire well-educated and eloquent speakers who know how to contact others, using their social and psychological skills. The success or failure of such methods depends upon one person.</p>
<p>In the New Testament there are no &ldquo;chapels.&rdquo; In the early days the believers met frequently in the temple of Judaism, but this practice did not please the Lord, because it brought a mixture of Judaism into the New Testament church. This mixture reached its climax in Acts 21 when Paul was almost caught in a trap of offering sacrifices. Actually, he had been in the temple for six days, and he was waiting for the seventh day when the priest would complete the offering of sacrifices for him and for those on whose behalf he had paid the expenses. However, the Lord did not allow this to happen; He raised up a confrontation to deliver Paul out of this situation of confusion. The Lord delivered him not only from the rioting of the Jews but also from the mixture of Judaism with the New Testament church.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the meetings of the church in Acts occurred mainly &ldquo;from house to house.&rdquo; The saints went from one house to another, house after house. This is the correct meaning of <em>from house to house</em> in Greek. Even if a house was large, it would not have been able to accommodate a mass gathering. At the most, it would have been able to provide a place for immediate neighbors; the capacity of a house is always small. This is the reason that we refer to such meetings as small group meetings.</p>
<p>In 1922 we began establishing churches in mainland China, starting in Foochow in the south. In 1932 the church in Chefoo was established in the north. Altogether we had twenty-seven years of history. In that period of time we did not encounter any great needs related to size. The number of people in the church in a locality rarely reached one thousand. Chefoo reached close to one thousand, and Shanghai eventually reached about one thousand seven hundred. During this time, if there was a need, we met in separate meeting halls, calling them districts. This was our practice before coming to Taiwan.</p>
<p>After coming to Taiwan, the number of people increased so quickly in the first six years that even separate districts were inadequate for our needs. After some study, the districts were divided into groups that met in homes. Our initial plan was to have fifteen to twenty people in a group, but because of the unexpected rate of increase, a group often reached eighty to one hundred people. We could not divide the groups fast enough. Sadly, after 1956 the negative influence that we received caused us to neglect the practice of meeting in small groups in the homes. From then on we went further and further toward the way of having joint meetings of all the saints in a hall and of assigning speakers; this took us back to the old ways of Christianity, which relies on preachers rather than the saints. This was a mistake.</p>
<p>Now we must rise up in order to catch up, turning our attention away from joint meetings with individual speakers to the small groups. The co-workers and the elders have all agreed to divide the saints in the church in Taipei into about four hundred groups. There are currently about three hundred sixty groups exercising in this way, and even in a short period of time four to five hundred dormant saints have been recovered. This is only the beginning. From now on we must pay attention to recovering the practice of the small groups. We must practice the small groups and actively seek to bring the small groups into function even more.</p>
<p>Our initial hope is that each group would not be too large in number. Twelve is a good number, but if it reaches fifteen to sixteen, it should be split into two groups. The smaller the number of people, the more effective is the function of the small group. With this focus there is no need for a so-called responsible one or leader in a group; rather, every member of the small group can equally function. We must definitely raise the level of function in the small groups. For example, after preaching the gospel and leading people to be baptized, we do not need to focus on getting the new ones to a big meeting; instead, we can hand them over to a small group to be taken care of practically.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
