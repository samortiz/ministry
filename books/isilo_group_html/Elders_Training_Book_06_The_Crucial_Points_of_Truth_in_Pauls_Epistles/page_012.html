DIVINE OPERATIONS, MINISTRIES, AND GIFTS</h2>
<p>Chapter twelve is mainly on the divine Trinity in the divine operations, ministries, and gifts. These three are the Trinity in expression, not the Trinity in existence. Verses 4-6 say, &ldquo;But there are distributions of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are distributions of ministries, and the same Lord; and there are distributions of operations, but the same God, who is operating all things in all.&rdquo; The gifts are by the Spirit; the ministries, the services, are for the Lord; and the operations are of God. Here the Triune God is involved in these three things&mdash;gifts, ministries, and operations. The gifts by the Spirit are to carry out the ministries, the services, for the Lord, and the ministries for the Lord are to accomplish the operations, the works, of God. This is the Triune God moving in the believers for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose to build up the church, the Body of Christ, for the expression of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 12:7 says, &ldquo;But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit.&rdquo; The manifestation of the Spirit is unique but has a number of aspects. The apostle listed here only nine items of the Spirit&rsquo;s manifestation (vv. 8-10) as an illustration. Of these nine, speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues are listed as the last two, because they are not as profitable as the other items for the building up of the church (14:2-6, 18-19). Of these nine gifts and those listed in verses 28-30, prophecy as prediction, faith, gifts of healing, works of power, speaking in tongues, and interpretation of tongues are miraculous. All the rest, a word of wisdom, a word of knowledge, and speaking for God and speaking forth God in prophecy by the prophets, discerning of spirits, helps, and administrations, are gifts developed by the growth in life as those listed in Romans 12:6 through 8. The miraculous gifts, especially speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues, do not require any growth in life. The Corinthians did much speaking in tongues, yet they still remained in infancy (3:1-3). However, the gifts developed in life require growth in life, even maturity, for the building up of the church. It was for this purpose that this Epistle was written to the Corinthians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FORMATION AND<br />
CONSTITUTION OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>Verses 12 and 13 say, &ldquo;For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body being many are one body, so also is Christ; for also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; The Body has been formed by the baptism in the one Spirit. In one Spirit we have all been baptized into one Body. The baptism into the one Body has positioned us all to drink, and by drinking of the Spirit we are constituted to be the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MUTUALITY IN SPEAKING<br />
FOR THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The crucial point in chapter fourteen is mutuality in speaking for the church meetings. The church meeting is by mutuality in speaking, and speaking is mainly prophesying (14:4, 19, 26). The primary denotation of the word prophesy in chapter fourteen is not to predict but to speak a particular word concerning Christ. To prophesy is to speak Christ, to speak forth Christ, and to speak for Christ. This kind of speaking not only builds up the individual saints but also the church (14:3-4).</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BECOMING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT<br />
THROUGH RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The crucial point in chapter fifteen is Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit through resurrection (v. 45). Resurrection was not merely an objective act accomplished by Christ. It is very much related to us subjectively. Incarnation was much more than an objective fact; it was a process that brought God into humanity. The principle is the same with the process of resurrection. Resurrection was not merely an act in itself; it was a process to bring forth the life-giving Spirit. Through the process of resurrection, the Man, the last Adam, who ended the old creation became the life-giving Spirit, the germinating element of the new creation.</p>
<p>First Corinthians unveils to us that the very Christ, who is the portion of all the believers, and into whose fellowship we all have been called, is all-inclusive. He is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom, as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us (1:24, 30). He is our glory for our glorification (2:7), hence, the Lord of glory (2:8). He is the depths (deep things) of God (2:10). He is the unique foundation of God&rsquo;s building (3:11). He is our Passover (5:7), the unleavened bread (5:8), the spiritual food, and the spiritual rock flowing out the spiritual drink (10:3-4). He is the Head (11:3) and the Body (12:12). He is the firstfruit (15:20, 23), the second Man (15:47), and the last Adam (15:45); and as such He became the life-giving Spirit (15:45). The life-giving Spirit is the totality of all the other foregoing items, and we have to experience this life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;MY SPIRIT AND YOURS&rdquo;</h2>
<p>A number of things are covered in chapter sixteen but the crucial point is in verse 18: &ldquo;For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Acknowledge therefore those that are such.&rdquo; After the foregoing sixteen chapters Paul concluded his Epistle with this expression. Some of the saints who came to Paul refreshed his spirit and the Corinthians&rsquo; spirit. This indicates that all of the items in this first book to the Corinthians should be experiences in our spirit, because such an expression indicates that the writer is a person living, acting, and working in the spirit. He expects that his recipients, the Corinthians, would be such persons in the spirit also. This is the conclusion of this book. The verse is very short but the point in it is very crucial. In chapter fifteen is the life-giving Spirit and in chapter sixteen is our spirit that we may experience Christ in such a rich way as our portion. Then the fact that Christ is ours becomes our reality.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 06: The Crucial Points of Truth in Paul's Epistles &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
