This man, being universally full without limitation, is in the heavens and on the earth at the same time. The Head of this universal man is Christ, and the Body is the church composed of millions of believers as His members (v. 22). The entire New Testament record is a portrait of such a universal man.<h2 class=head2>The Bridegroom and the Bride</h2><p>The entire New Testament also reveals a couple composed of Christ as the Bridegroom and the church as the bride. A couple is two persons who have become one. In John 3:29, John the Baptist told us clearly that Christ came as the Bridegroom for the bride. God became a man to be the Bridegroom to marry a bride. This is why there is a wedding at the end of the New Testament. At the close of the New Testament there is a marriage (Rev. 19:7; 22:17), and before the wedding there is a period of time for the preparation of the bride. The Bridegroom has been waiting for the bride to be ready. When the bride makes herself ready, then the wedding day will come. At the end of the New Testament there is the New Jerusalem which is the bride of Christ (21:9-10). The New Jerusalem is the bride, and Christ as the Lamb of God is the Bridegroom. These two are the universal couple.<h2 class=head2>The New Jerusalem</h2><p>Lastly the New Testament shows us the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s work in the universe. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the church and of  all God&#8217;s work through all the generations. It is also the consummation of the whole universe. Without the New Jersalem as the ultimate sign of God&#8217;s consummated work, we could never understand the real purpose of His work through the generations. Because this ultimate consummation is recorded and revealed in the New Testament, we know the purpose of God&#8217;s work, and we have a full description and definition of the purpose and meaning of the entire universe.<h2 class=head1>THE PROPHECIES OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2><h2 class=head2>The Central Thought of All Prophecies Being Christ and the Church</h2><p>In order to understand the New Testament we must also examine the prophecies of the Old Testament. In my early years I studied many books on prophecy, including several by G. H. Pember: The Great Prophecies of the Centuries concerning Israel and the Gentiles, The Great Prophecies concerning the Gentiles, the Jews, and the Church of God, and The Great Prophecies of the Centuries concerning the Church. Mr. Pember gave people much help in understanding the prophecy of the Scriptures. All Bible students agree that Mr. Pember was a real scholar. However, Pember&#8217;s interpretations of prophecy reveal much about events but not much concerning the central thought of God. The central thought of prophecy is not the events mentioned in the prophecies; rather, it is Christ and the church. Mr. Pember&#8217;s interpretation of prophecy mainly tells us what will happen to the nation of Israel, to the church, and to the Gentile world. However, the two central matters of the prophecies of the Old Testament are Christ and the church. At this time we cannot go into the details of all the prophecies in the Old Testament. We will point out only a few of the main items.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>General Sketch of the New Testament in the Light of Christ and the Church, A - Part 1: The Gospels and the Acts &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
