   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The work on this day is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Incarnation is important, and crucifixion is also important.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But without resurrection, the gospel would be an incomplete gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The goal of incarnation is crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The result of crucifixion is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Resurrection means that God has accepted the salvation accomplished by the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Romans 4:25 says that Jesus was delivered for our offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that the Lord Jesus died to bear our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When He died, He bore the punishment of our sins, and we were forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, He "was raised for our justification."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Forgiveness is on the negative side: it shows that we have sinned and that God has forgiven us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Justification is on the positive side: it shows that we are sinless, that God has declared us sinless, and that we are justified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can become sinless because the work on the negative side has been thoroughly accomplished and all our sins have been forgiven and cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Based on the death of the Lord Jesus and our having been forgiven, God justifies us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Justification is given to us through the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His death has accomplished salvation through the forgiveness of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now through His resurrection, God has declared us sinless and justified us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Resurrection establishes a new relationship for us with God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, we are placed in a new position before God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Death and resurrection are linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same way forgiveness and justification are linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord's resurrection signifies that God has accepted and acknowledged His death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our justification proves that we are forgiven by God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because of the death of the Lord Jesus, a Christian should realize in his spirit that his sins have been borne by the Lord, that his sins have been forgiven, and that they have been judged and punished in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All this is on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the saints should realize in their spirit that they are not just forgiven sinners who should cringe nervously before God, but that they are beloved children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Resurrection means that every former thing has died.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everything sinful and of the self has been buried in the grave; they can never be found.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are forever gone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everything is completely new.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason, we should not just be forgiven saints, merely satisfied with our sins being forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, we should be justified Christians, daily acknowledging the fact that God has reckoned us righteous before Him, not through any righteousness of our own, but through our new position afforded through the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Daily we should believe that we are accepted in Christ and that God has accepted us in the same way that He has accepted Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just as God is satisfied and pleased with Christ, He has similarly accepted us through our relationship with Christ in His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>IV.The work on the fourth day signifies the ascension of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the fourth day God's work made the luminaries.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He made the sun, moon, and stars.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The work of the previous day was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The work on this day was in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The emphasis on this day is on heavenly things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The sun, the moon, and the stars are all heavenly things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God made the luminaries for several purposes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First, they "give light upon the earth" Gen 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Darkness is the ordinary condition of the world, and light is the special condition of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ordinarily the world is dark.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why light has to shine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Otherwise, the world would sink into a long night.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Second, the luminaries are to "rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are not only for shining, but for ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The work on this day is a type of the ascension of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the works on this day were in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This was unlike the first day, when the light was in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although the light on first day was shining on the earth, the luminaries on the fourth day were in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The light which comes to earth now has its source in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord Jesus, who came down from heaven, has now been taken away from the world again.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Malachi 4:2 tells us that Christ is the Sun of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Revelation 12:1 tells us that Christ is the Sun. Psalm 19:5-6 says the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In reading the Bible, we find the teaching that the sun is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not see it in the world, but in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He has ascended to heaven for us and has appeared before God as our Mediator and Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The work of this day signifies not only Christ, but His people as well, because the moon is a type of the church and the stars are a type of individual Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Based on the Lord's death and resurrection, the Lord has gained people to His own name.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is why we see the moon and the stars in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The moon does not have any light by itself; it merely reflects the light of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the same way the church does not have any light of its own; it merely reflects the light of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Presently the believers "shine as luminaries in the world" Phil 2:15 ; they are like the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have covered this point before and will not cover too much about it now.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The two things that we have to do now correspond to what we mentioned earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>First, we have to reflect the light of Christ in this morally dark night.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Second, we have to rule over the power of darkness with the light of our words and deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When the millennium comes, we will truly be kings and rule over all things.</S>
