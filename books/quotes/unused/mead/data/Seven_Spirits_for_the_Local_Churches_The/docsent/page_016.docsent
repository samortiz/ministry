   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE CHRIST IN REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we must see something of Christ in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ in this book is quite different from all the other books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us read Revelation 1:13-16.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And His head and hair were as white as white wool, as snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire; and His feet were like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace; and His voice was like the sound of many waters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And He had in His right hand seven stars; and out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword; and His face shone as the sun shines in its power.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>WALKING IN THE MIDST OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the verses above Christ is the man walking in the midst of the seven golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We know that these golden lampstands are the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This reveals that today Christ is the Son of Man walking in the midst of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may have been Christians for years but did not realize that Christ today is the glorious man walking in the midst of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is walking in the midst of the golden lampstands, and the golden lampstands are the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we want Him to walk in our midst, we must be in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are in the denominations, we are still in captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the midst of the local churches, Christ is walking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must not think that it is a small thing to be in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ as the glorified man is walking in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the greatest reward for us in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For more than thirty-six years I have enjoyed His precious walking in the midst.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first point in this book about Christ is that He is walking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is not walking in the denominations or in any organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is walking in the midst of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we would have Christ walking in the United States, we must have a good number of local churches in this country.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To have Christ walking in the Northwest, there must be a number of local churches there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To have Christ walking in California, there must be the local churches there.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Where the local churches are, there Christ is walking in the midst.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To have Christ walking in our midst is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Suppose tonight we were to have the president of the United States walking in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That would indeed be exciting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But he is just the president and nothing to compare with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To have Christ walking in our midst is inexpressibly glorious!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now we realize how precious is the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This book tells us that Christ today is walking in the midst of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE LOVING HIGH PRIEST</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Revelation continues to tell us what kind of a Christ He is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is a Christ who is so perfect: He is wearing a long garment down to His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nothing is short or lacking; nothing is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The garment in the Bible always signifies what a person is and what he does.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ wears a perfect garment, and we know that this is the perfect robe of the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is walking in the midst of the local churches as the High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He brings the local churches into the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is walking in our midst not as a general in the army, or as a king, but as the High Priest in a perfect robe.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is indeed interesting to notice that as the High Priest, Christ does not gird His loins, but His breast.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that His work has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His work is past, but His concern and His love still remain.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The girdle is not now upon His loins but upon His breast.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His work is over, but His loving concern still abides for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His concern is a concern of love this is why He girds His breast.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He has finished His work, but He is so concerned in love for all the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>THE ANCIENT, LIVING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This book also tells us that Christ is the ancient One, for His hair is exceedingly white.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>White hair, humanly speaking, always signifies oldness, but here it signifies that Christ is the ancient One.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No one is as ancient as He.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But this does not mean that He is old.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is ancient, yet He is so living.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I am...the living One 1:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The older we are, the more living we must be.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We, the older ones, must be more living.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christ is the most ancient One, yet He is the most living One.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is living forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He is ancient, and He is living.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I have known some local churches who were very living when they first began to meet, but after two or three years they became old.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The older a church is, the more living it must be.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The church must be as Christ, the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is the oldest, the most ancient, yet He is the most living.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I hope that as the church in Los Angeles grows older, it will also become more and more living.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The local churches should not be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is why the Lord Jesus spoke in the way He did to the church in Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He told them that He was the One who has the seven Spirits; therefore, they should not be so dead.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There was nothing wrong with the church in Sardis except that she was dead.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>She had a name that she was living, but in fact she was dead.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In Sardis was a dead local church, yet Christ is so living.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This means that she had lost her contact with the living Christ.</S>
