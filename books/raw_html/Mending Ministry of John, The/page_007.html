<h2 class=head2>The Impotent Man</h2><p>The fourth case was of the man who had been lying sick and impotent for thirty-eight years (John 5:2-9). When the Lord came on the scene and spoke the word, the sick man became instantly well. He picked up his bed and walked. Our Lord can meet every man’s need!<h2 class=head2>The Hungry Crowd</h2><p>The fifth case was of the great crowd who followed Jesus and whose hunger was satisfied by Him (John 6:2-13, 26-57). The Lord told them that He was the living bread which came down out of heaven. He wanted them to know that He could be eaten. “He who eats Me shall also live because of Me!” He is the heavenly food and can satisfy our hunger.<h2 class=head2>The Thirsty Ones</h2><p>The sixth case was of the thirsty ones (John 7:37-39). On the last day of the feast, Jesus cried out, “If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink!” He would quench the thirst and even cause rivers of living water to flow out from within. He was speaking of the Spirit, but at that time “the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.” After His crucifixion and resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Now whoever thirsts may come to Him and drink.<p>Drink of the Spirit! He will quench your thirst, fill you, and flow out of you as rivers of living water.<h2 class=head2>The Woman Taken in Adultery</h2><p>The seventh case was of the woman caught committing adultery (John 8:3-11), According to the law of Moses, she should have been stoned to death. The scribes and Pharisees brought the woman to the Lord Jesus, testing Him to see if He would say something different from the law. The Lord’s reply, “He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her,” caused every one of them to leave in a silent admission that they were sinful. Then the Lord turned to the woman who was left alone with Him. Instead of condemning her, the Lord set her free. In this case the Lord met the need of a sinner and freed her from sin’s bondage.<h2 class=head2>The Blind Man</h2><p>The eighth case was of a blind man whose sight the Lord restored (John 9:1-38). The Lord came to him, anointed His eyes, and imparted sight to him.<h2 class=head2>Lazarus</h2><p>The ninth and last case was that of Lazarus (John 11:1-44). Lazarus died and was buried in a tomb, but the Lord Jesus came and called him out. When He met a man in death, He raised him up. No case is too hard for Him.<p>The cases presented in this first section of John demonstrate that the Lord Jesus can meet every need.
