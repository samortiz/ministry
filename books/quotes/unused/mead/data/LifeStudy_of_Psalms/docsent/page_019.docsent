   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE THREE CHRIST IN GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>VERSUS THE LAW IN MAN'S APPRECIATION 2 Scripture Reading: Psa 2:1-12; John 1:41; Matt 3:16-17; Luke 4:18-19; Heb 1:9; Acts 10:38; Dan 9:26a; Acts 13:33; Heb 1:5-6; Acts 2:36; 5:31; Rev 1:5a; 2:26-27; Acts 4:25-29a; Rev 6:15-17; Acts 17:30; John 3:16; 21:15a</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous message, we saw the truth concerning the law in its position, its nature, its content, its function, and its weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psalm 1 is according to the human concept of uplifting and treasuring the law, whereas Psalm 2 is according to the divine concept of exalting Christ as God's central stress.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perhaps we can receive further help by considering stanza 3 of Hymns, #541:</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not philosophy nor</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Any element</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Can to Christ conform us</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As His complement;</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But 'tis Christ Himself who</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All our nature takes</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And in resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Us His members makes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No philosophy, element, or religion can conform us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The law of Moses cannot conform us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only Christ can conform us to Himself, and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some may be bothered that we are belittling religion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They may say, "We are Christians; shouldn't we love Christianity?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But we need to be those who love Christ, not any "anity."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nothing can or should replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ conforms us to Himself so that we can be His complement.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be Christ's complement means that we are a part of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is like Eve being a complement to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only Christ can make us a part of Him as His complement.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The law cannot make us members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only Christ can make us His members in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to see Psalm 1 in the light of the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This psalm says that those who meditate in the law will be like a tree absorbing the water from the streams, but according to the New Testament revelation this is not very high.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, the New Testament tells us that the river of living water gets into us John 7:38; 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do we want to be a tree by the side of a river or do we want to have the river flowing within us?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Which is better and which is higher?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The thought of a river flowing within us is the ultimate concept of the Bible Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be a tree planted by the river to absorb its supply of water is good, but it is not the best.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul said that he planted and Apollos watered 1 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The thought here is the same as that of a tree absorbing water, but this is not as high as the thought of the river of water of life flowing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is God's ultimate thought.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In my youth I was taught that when we study the Bible, we have to get the secret of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Later, Brother Nee told us that we have to know the spirit of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible, the written Word, has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus said, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life" John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This shows us that the Word is the Spirit Eph 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not only is the Spirit in the Word, but also the Word itself is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Word is God, and the Word is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, God, the Word, and the Spirit are one.</S>
