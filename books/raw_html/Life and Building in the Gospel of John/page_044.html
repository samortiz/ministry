<h1 class="title">THE FIRST SIGN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 2:1-11; 4:46-54; 11:1-45</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the first sign, the &ldquo;beginning of signs,&rdquo; that the Lord performed (John 2:11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOSPEL OF JOHN<br />
BEING NOT ACCORDING TO HISTORY<br />
BUT ACCORDING TO DOCTRINE</h2>
<p>The record of events in the Gospel of John is not according to the sequence of the history of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; life on the earth but according to the sequence of doctrine. The Lord Jesus did many things while He was on earth, but the apostle John chose to write only of cases that portrayed the Lord as life raising people out of death, and he presented these cases according to the sequence of doctrine. The last verse of the Gospel of John says, &ldquo;There are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself could contain the books written&rdquo; (21:25). John selected only some of the Lord&rsquo;s deeds to prove that the Lord Jesus is life to man to enable man to pass out of death into life, thereby accomplishing God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<p>Hence, the Gospel of John is not a record of history but a record of doctrine. This book shows how the Lord Jesus as the embodiment of God enters into man to be man&rsquo;s life for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to build Himself into man and to build man into Himself so that God and man can become a universal building, which is both God&rsquo;s dwelling place and man&rsquo;s habitation. The Gospel of John presents this truth and revelation, not merely with words of teaching but by presenting a specific sequence of events. Out of the many things that Jesus did, John selected a few and arranged them to prove that the Lord came to be man&rsquo;s life by changing death into life so that God and man can be joined together and built up as one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JOHN 1 BEING AN INTRODUCTION<br />
TO LIFE AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>John 1 is an outline and introduction to the Gospel of John. This introduction begins in eternity past and continues into eternity future. In eternity past the Lord was the Word of God; in time He created all things and generated life. Then He took a further step to become man&rsquo;s life; He came as the Lamb with the dove to produce Bethel, the house of God, for the eternal union of God and man and for the communication between heaven and earth. This is the general outline and introduction of the Gospel of John.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING LIFE AND RESURRECTION<br />
IN JOHN 2 THROUGH 11</h2>
<p>After the introduction in chapter 1, John presents various cases in chapters 2 through 11. These cases were selected from the many signs that the Lord Jesus performed. The purpose of each case is to show how the Lord is life to man.</p>
<p>The first sign in chapter 2 is of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; changing water into wine. Verse 11 says, &ldquo;This beginning of signs Jesus performed.&rdquo; In principle, this case is the same as the second sign performed by the Lord. In the second sign, a royal official asked the Lord Jesus to heal his sick son who was dying (4:46-54). The Holy Spirit included this simple story in this mysterious book as a further explanation of the first sign. The first record of any matter in the Bible sets forth the principle of that matter. A number of signs are recorded in John 2 through 11, and the first sign sets forth the principle of the following signs. Thus, the significance of the first sign is also the significance of the following signs.</p>
<p>Many Bible expositions say that the sign in John 2:1-11 of the Lord&rsquo;s changing water into wine proves that only He can call the things not being as being; that is, only He can produce something out of nothing. The Lord&rsquo;s meeting Nathanael in chapter 1 proves that He is omniscient and omnipresent. When Nathanael was under the fig tree, the Lord was not only with him but also knew Nathanael&rsquo;s heart and mind (vv. 46-48). Hence, some Bible expositors say that John 1 proves that the Lord Jesus is the omnipresent and omniscient God, and chapter 2 proves that the Lord Jesus is the Creator. Therefore, the Gospel of John proves that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God.</p>
<p>In the past I felt that such speaking was right. Later, I asked the Lord whether the Gospel of John merely proves that He is the Son of God. One day I saw 20:31, which says, &ldquo;These have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing, you may have life in His name.&rdquo; According to this verse, the Gospel of John does not prove merely that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God; it proves that as the Son of God the Lord Jesus wants man to have His life. The Son of God, the embodiment of God, wants to enter into man so that man may have Him as life.</p>
<p>According to the principle of John 20:31, the sign of changing water into wine does not prove that the Lord Jesus is the Creator who calls the things not being as being. Rather, it proves that the Lord Jesus is the Lord of life who changes death into life. Changing water into wine is not a matter of calling the things not being as being but of changing death into life. In this sign water signifies death, and wine signifies life. To change water into wine is to change death into life. This is the first sign in John.</p>
<p>The second sign is the healing of the son of a royal official (4:46-54), and it shows that the Lord can raise people from the dead. The last sign also concerns raising a person from the dead (ch. 11). John&rsquo;s record of the signs performed by the Lord ends in chapter 11. In chapter 12 the Lord Jesus went up to Jerusalem in preparation for His death. In chapter 13 He washed the disciples&rsquo; feet. Chapters 14 through 16 contain His departing word, and chapter 17 is His departing prayer. In chapter 18 the Lord was betrayed, in chapter 19 He was crucified, in chapter 20 He resurrected, and in chapter 21 He is in resurrection. There is no record of signs being performed by the Lord in these chapters.</p>
<p>The first sign that the Lord performed is in chapter 2, the second sign is in chapter 4, and the last sign is in chapter 11. It may not be easy to understand the significance of the first sign, but after reading the signs that follow, we can see that the second sign concerns raising a person from death, and the last sign also concerns raising a person from the dead.</p>
<p>The first mention of a matter in the Bible sets forth the principle for that matter. The first sign in the Gospel of John is a sign related to the changing of death into life. This is resurrection. Hence, the following signs also concern resurrection. Although chapter 3 does not speak of a sign, the case here still concerns resurrection. Here the Lord Jesus said to Nicodemus, &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life&rdquo; (vv. 14-15). This speaks of passing out of death into life. When the people of Israel offended God in the wilderness, they fell under the judgment of death (Num. 21:4-9). Then God told Moses to lift up a bronze serpent on their behalf for God&rsquo;s judgment so that those who looked at the bronze serpent would live. This type relates to passing out of death into life, and in John 3 the Lord Jesus applied this type to Himself. Hence, when a person under the bondage of sin and death looks at the crucified Christ, he will live. This is to pass out of death into life. Hence, the case recorded in chapter 3 involves the principle of resurrection.</p>
<p>In chapter 4 the Lord Jesus spoke with a thirsty woman concerning living water. The Lord said, &ldquo;Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life&rdquo; (vv. 13-14). In the Bible thirst is a precursor of death, and to not thirst forever means to not die forever. Hence, chapter 4 also speaks of the principle of resurrection. The second half of chapter 4 concerns the son of a royal official being healed by resurrection. This is also in the principle of resurrection.</p>
<p>In chapter 5 there is a person who had been sick for thirty-eight years. The Lord Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Rise, take up your mat and walk&rdquo; (v. 8). Immediately the man became well, and he took up his mat and walked. Later the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live&rdquo; (v. 25). According to this word, the man who had been paralyzed for thirty-eight years was dead in the eyes of God. As a person in death, he heard the voice of the Son of God and was immediately enlivened.</p>
<p>In chapter 6 the Lord is the bread of life to solve the problem of man&rsquo;s inner hunger. Just as thirst is a precursor of death, hunger is also a precursor of death. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst&rdquo; (v. 35). The Lord can satisfy man&rsquo;s hunger, which is an indication of death, and cause man to live forever, because He is the bread of life. This is also in the principle of resurrection.</p>
<p>In chapter 7 the Lord Jesus cried out, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&rdquo; (vv. 37-38). This word, which was spoken on the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles, is in the principle of resurrection.</p>
<p>In chapter 8 the Lord told the people, &ldquo;Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins&rdquo; (v. 24). He also said, &ldquo;If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means see death forever&rdquo; (v. 51). These words are in the principle of passing out of death into life.</p>
<p>In chapter 9 the Lord caused the blind man to receive his sight. Seemingly, this is not related to death and resurrection. However, in chapter 10 the Lord said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly. I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep&rdquo; (vv. 10-11). <em>Sheep</em> here refers to the blind man who received his sight in the previous chapter. Hence, the case of the blind man receiving his sight is still in the principle of passing out of death into life.</p>
<p>In chapter 11 the Lord raised Lazarus from the dead (vv. 41-44). This surely is in the principle of resurrection.</p>
<p>All the cases recorded in the Gospel of John in chapters 2 through 11 speak of the principle of resurrection, that is, of passing out of death into life. In every sign a person received the Lord as life and thereby came out of death and entered into resurrection.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
