   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WATCHING WITH THANKSGIVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In charging us to persevere in prayer, Paul tells us to watch in it with thanksgiving 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates that if we are not thankful to God for anything, we must be lacking in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All day long we need to thank God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to be those who continually offer thanks to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are constantly giving thanks to the Lord, do you think it will be possible for a brother to argue with his wife?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Surely not!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Arguments between husband and wife are a sign of prayerlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They argue because they are lacking in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The sign of a praying person is thankfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you are one who perseveres in prayer, you will always be thankful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This giving of thanks to Him will preserve you in your life of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 4:2 Paul does not say to persevere in prayer and to watch.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He says, Persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We watch in prayer by the giving of thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we continually offer thanks to the Lord, the adversary will not be able to carry us off from our prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Prayer is maintained by watching in it with thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>GRACE AND WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 4:6 Paul says, Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are praying people, we shall utter thanks to the Lord, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, our speech will be with grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Out of our mouth will flow thanks to God and grace to others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way we shall know that we are praying people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, if our speech is lacking in grace, we must be short of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we become aware of the lack of grace, we need to pray again and be charged with the divine electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then our mouth will be filled with grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 4:5 Paul says, Walk in wisdom toward those who are without, redeeming the time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a result of persevering in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we pray without ceasing, offer thanks to God, and have speech filled with grace, we shall spontaneously become very wise and know how to redeem the time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In our daily living no time will be wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are filled with thanks to God and with grace toward others, we shall have the wisdom to walk in a way which glorifies God and builds up others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then our time will be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Concerning persevering in prayer, I wish to say once again that we need to be willing to make a deal with the Lord, even to make a vow to Him, that we shall be a praying people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If all the saints in all the churches make such a deal with the Lord, the recovery will be greatly enriched and uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, the saints will enjoy the Lord, His presence, and His instant and constant anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All day long, they will enjoy the smile of the Lord s face.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we persevere in prayer, the living Person of Christ becomes our experience and enjoyment.</S>
