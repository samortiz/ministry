   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICING THE GENUINE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY LIVING AND WALKING BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s way is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is simple, living, powerful, refreshing, strengthening, and life-giving.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have no need for a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nevertheless, our human nature cares not for the Spirit in our spirit but for culture, the law, ordinances, religion, and traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From the day we were born, our spirit was dormant within us, but one day the Lord Jesus woke up our spirit by entering into it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the more Christians exercise their mind over lifeless doctrines, the more their spirit goes to sleep again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then as they pick up more religious teachings and practices, they become more divided.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By the last portion of Galatians 5, the emphasis is no longer on the negative things of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All that we have is the Spirit mingled with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit v. 25 . We must see that the law, ordinances, religion, traditions, forms, rituals, regulations, mere doctrinal teachings, and the flesh all need to go.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only Christ as the life-giving Spirit mingled with our spirit must remain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, we must care for nothing but walking by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then we will all be marvelous Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we come together, we will have genuine oneness, joy, and rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To live and walk in this way are to have the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the present situation in Christianity, it is often difficult to recognize Christians by their life and walk.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only after speaking with someone for a long time can we discover that he is a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At this point he may ask, What church do you go to, and what are your particular practices?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a poor situation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, if all the Christians on the earth were living and walking by the Spirit, wherever we go we would immediately recognize the brothers and sisters by their joyful praising and calling on the Lord, and we would spontaneously enjoy the church life with them in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all must be unloaded and unburdened of the things of religion to see that the genuine and real church life is simply Christ as the life-giving Spirit living in our spirit, and we must walk by this wonderful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we will come to the Bible in a living way, not in the way of dead letters, and we will preach the gospel, not in a traditional way but in a fresh, instant, and living way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A visitor to our meetings once asked if the church goes to the streets to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I replied to him, Our preaching of the gospel is according to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Body is not like a machine that moves in set ways.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To do the same things on certain set days is the old, traditional, religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, the Body does many different things in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today the Body is moving in one way, and tomorrow it may move in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the practice of the genuine church life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because we are living, we often praise the Lord exultingly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a result, everyone knows that we are crazy lovers of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, many Christians today do not praise the Lord or speak for Him in their daily lives.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even some who claim to have the baptism of the Holy Spirit do not sing or speak for the Lord until they are in a meeting, where they are able to exercise their gifts in the way of a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not the genuine baptism of the Spirit or the proper exercise of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to drop all the old traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not oppose the exercise of the gifts, but we do not care for the traditional, religious, and even fleshly way of displaying them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We neither oppose nor promote any particular practice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, some dear saints have become addicted to traditions, ordinances, and religion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, we need to be delivered from these things to care only for Christ, not the Christ of mere doctrines, stories, and history but the living, practical, and instant Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Him we have no problems, and in Him we are one with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit v. 25 . To live and walk in this way is true freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ has set us free, and we must never again be entangled by anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Anything other than Christ is just an entanglement, but Christ has released us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Him we have freedom, peace, and joy.</S>
