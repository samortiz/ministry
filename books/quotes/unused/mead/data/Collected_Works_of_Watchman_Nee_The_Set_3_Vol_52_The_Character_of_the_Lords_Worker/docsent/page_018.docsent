   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When the Lord was on earth, Nicodemus came to Him by night.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord could receive him without succumbing to tiredness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A few times He spent whole nights in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All these activities interfered with His sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are not advocating that God's children should make a habit of spending nights in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if a man wants to serve the Lord, it is a shame if he never spends a night in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is wrong to constantly spend the night hours in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you are doing this, you are heading the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But it is a strange thing to serve God for ten or twenty years without having once prayed all night long.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are not advocating the extreme way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are not telling people to pray throughout the night all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Making a habit of praying all night long is damaging to the body and even to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not agree with those who do not pray during the day but who give up their sleep at night for prayer; this is not normal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if a worker of the Lord never gives up his sleep for prayer, there is something wrong with him also.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Running in a race is not a daily thing, but exercise is a daily thing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to exercise to the point that our body will no longer rebel against us but will be subject to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we have never exercised in this way and our body is never put under control, sleep will become our first priority when we set out for our work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our sleep will become our master.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If others do not touch our sleep, we can do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But as soon as others touch our sleep, we cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is imperative that a servant of God exercise himself to make his body his slave.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To make our body our slave means that when the Lord has a need and a demand, and when circumstances call for it, we can put aside the demands of our body temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can direct our body to provide the extra supply, to ignore its need, and to be under our control and rule.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we cannot do this, we love ourselves too much and are useless in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The same principle applies to the matter of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many times our Lord went without food for the sake of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He did not make His eating a priority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But this does not mean that our Lord never ate.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He could eat well at ordinary times.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But when the need was before Him, He could forsake eating.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is to put the body under subjection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are not so dependent on food that our work has to stop if we have to go hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Unfortunately, in the Lord's work, many cannot function without food.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We undoubtedly need food, and we have to take care of our physical body, but the body must be trained to go without food when special circumstances call for it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Remember the occasion when the Lord sat down at noon beside Jacob's well to rest while the disciples went to get some food in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and the Lord asked her for a drink.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the same time He opened up the matter of the living water to her.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the end the woman did not give Him anything to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was high noon, the time for a meal and a drink, but the Lord patiently explained to this spiritually thirsty and suffering Samaritan woman the word of life and the meaning of the living water John 4:5-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This shows us how one can carry on God's work without the interruption of food.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we arrive at a certain place and cannot do anything until we have had a meal, our body is not serving us as it should.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not be extremists, and we should not skip our meals all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But when there are special demands, we should be able to forego our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Bread is not the most important thing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should be the master of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we need to go without a meal, our body should obey us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not be overcome by our body's insistent cries for food.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is what it means to make our body our slave.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Mark 3 the Lord was surrounded by such a multitude that He had no time to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His relatives reacted by seeking to drag Him away from the crowd, for they said He was beside Himself vv.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yet the Lord continued with His work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was not beside Himself, but the multitude had their pressing needs.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was able to forego His food and drink for the sake of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we can never forego our own needs when the work demands our immediate attention, we will have little effective work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At critical times we have to push ourselves a little to the extreme; we have to be somewhat beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the need calls for it, we should be able to bridle our body and ignore the demands for food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not consider these demands to be mandatory.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible plainly states that Christians should fast when occasion requires.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The meaning of fasting is to temporarily put aside the legitimate demand of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sometimes a special need calls for serious prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At these times we should fast before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We do not advocate fasting three or five times a week.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But if a man has been a Christian for eight or ten years and has never fasted once, something is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord spoke of fasting in His teaching on the mount.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we have never fasted, we lack something in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The purpose of fasting is to make our body our slave.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Another demand of the body is comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We dare not find fault with a worker for enjoying a measure of ease in his living.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But when his work calls for his sacrifice, his body should not ignore the call of the work if the comforts he was accustomed to are not provided.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If our body will not respond to our call, we cannot work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some brothers and sisters move around often, not because of the Lord's command, but because they are unhappy and uncomfortable with where they live.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We can say that comfort has become their way of life; comfort is leading them by the nose.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Such ones cannot be of much use in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God's servants should learn to thank Him for easy conditions when the discipline of the Spirit so orders them and when the Lord makes provisions for them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But when the Lord's provisions turn the other way, and they are stripped of ease and comfort, they should be the master of their body and continue with their work.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We are not for a life of extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Under ordinary circumstances, we may enjoy better conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But when the Lord's need calls for it, we should be able to bear what others normally cannot bear.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Some brothers and sisters can only live a comfortable life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>As soon as their standard of living is slightly lowered, they are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Such ones are of little use to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In running the race, we have to make our body our slave.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must be able to live under any circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Making our body our slave means that we will not be affected by our circumstances when the work calls for our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It means that we can carry on our work even when we have to live at a substandard level.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we are unable to do this, we will retreat as soon as our conditions fall below our accustomed standard.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This does not mean that those whose lot is inferior will better withstand harsher environments.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Many poorer brothers collapse physically as soon as they are given a lot that is inferior to what they are used to.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>They love themselves too much, and they have never made their body their slave.</S>
