   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT ASCETICISM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some, realizing that their body needed to be dealt with, have practiced asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Asceticism is mainly to deal with this body of sin, of death, of bad practices in a severe way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But in Romans Paul is not speaking concerning asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s salvation does not need asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually, Paul did not say that our body needs to be put to death, but that the practices of our body need to be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He makes a distinction between the body and the practices of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our body needs to be redeemed, but the practices of our body need to be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To try to put your body to death is asceticism, a kind of suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to human history, asceticism has been taught in many places.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was taught not only among the Greeks, but also by the Chinese, the Japanese, and by the Hindus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In many places asceticism has been taught.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means to deal severely with your sinful body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the Bible never tells us to deal with our body; it says to put to death the practices of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the way to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even some Christians have tried to deal with their body in a way of asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, a gambler who became a Christian eventually cut off one of his hands, trying to stop his gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But even after cutting off his hand, he could still use his arm to gamble.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So, to cut off the hand is a kind of asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible does not encourage us to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible says to put to death the practices of your body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not deal with your body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You have to wait for your body to be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But you have to deal with the practices of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But how can you deal with the practices of your body?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE INDWELLING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible says by the Spirit deal with the practices of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The confirmation is in the next verse which speaks of being led by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We shouldn t commit a kind of spiritual suicide to practice asceticism over our body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But we have to realize that a kind of salvation has been infused and transfused into our being, that is, the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The indwelling Spirit is our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever your body wants to practice something, you have to turn to your spirit and let the indwelling Spirit do something.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The work of the indwelling Spirit will surely put that practice of your body to death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is to be led by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>LED BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the last message we mentioned that there is a difference between walking according to the Spirit and being led by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The difference is this: to walk according to the Spirit is somewhat general, but to be led by the Spirit is very specific.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have two things dwelling within us: one is sin, and one is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our body energized by the indwelling sin is very diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is altogether not lazy, or idle, or dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our body is always active.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the Bible doesn t ask you to deal with your body, but rather with every activity of the body, every practice of the body, by the Spirit s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When you deal with every practice of the body, every activity of the body, that is actually to be led by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Spirit leads you all the time to deal with your body s practices.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From morning to evening the indwelling Spirit always leads you to put to death the practices of your body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>KILLING THE PRACTICES OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You may say that you are walking according to the Spirit, but then a time comes when you are desirous to exchange an unpleasant word with your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That is the time for you to be led by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means to let the Spirit kill your exchanging tongue, your word-exchanging activity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes even if you try to be quiet, the wife would somewhat be used to stir up the practices of your body to speak something.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yet you have to be led by the Spirit to put to death the practices of your body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Regardless of how much you walk according to the Spirit, you have to kill every practice of the body by being led by the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every time you kill a practice of the body by the Spirit, that is actually being led by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This would mean that you are no more simply a child of God, but a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you don t kill the practice of exchanging unpleasant words with your wife, this means you remain in your childhood.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if, by the Spirit, you kill one practice of the body after another, it is a sign that you are no more a child but a growing son.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the way to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To grow is to kill every practice of our body by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To grow is to be led by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This corresponds with Romans 6:6.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you kill every practice of the body by the Spirit, your body is eventually unemployed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is spontaneously fired.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It has nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is only a fired body that is good for you to present to God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You must present an unemployed body to God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If your body is still so much employed by many things, you cannot present that body to God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you present to God a body which is fully occupied by many items, there is no room for God to come in to use you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Your body is already fully employed by your daily practices.</S>
