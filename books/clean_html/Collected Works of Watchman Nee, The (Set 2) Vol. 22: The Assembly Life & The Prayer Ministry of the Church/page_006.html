<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AUTHORITY IN THE CHURCH</H1><P>In order to understand authority in the church, we must first understand what authority is. Otherwise, we will not understand authority in the church.</P><P>What is authority? In the whole universe, nothing is harder to understand than authority. Two things are very difficult to explain in the Bible: glory and authority. Many people can understand holiness, righteousness, and patience; they may comprehend these matters a little. But what is God's glory, and what is God's authority? Man cannot understand them and explain them. God's glory is related to God Himself, while God's authority is related to His government. God Himself is glorious, while His government is executed through His authority. God's authority was the principle by which He organized the universe. He rules the universe through authority. (Today, we will only mention the matter of authority in brief. We will wait for another day to discuss the subject in detail.) How did God create the heavens and the earth? He created by His authority. How did God restore this world? He restored by His authority also. On the first day when God created light, He did not gather all of the electricity together and make light; He only gave a command and said, "Let there be light," and there was light. The second day God said, "Let there be the firmament," and there was the firmament. God commanded with His word, and He acted according to His authority. He did not act according to His power or His ways. His word signifies His command, which represents His authority. Can you see that God only exercised His authority? God created the universe with His authority, and He rules the universe with His authority. Both the beginning of the universe and the maintenance of the universe are the result of God's authority.</P><P>In the beginning, after the universe was created, God appointed a cherubim as the archangel to rule over everything. God was over everything, and He ruled over the spirit-endowed animals and over all things through the archangel, the cherubim. Sin is lawlessness, and lawlessness is just the overthrowing of God's authority. Lawlessness was the reason the archangel fell and became Satan and also the reason sin entered the universe. The archangel attempted to overturn God's authority because he desired to uplift himself to become equal with God. Sin entered the world because Eve would not submit to Adam. She acted without Adam's command and ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</P><P>Although the world is filled with sin today, authority is still the principle of God's government. In many things, we can see God's appointed authority. For example, wives should submit to their husbands, servants to their masters, students to their teachers, citizens to the officers, and subordinates to their superiors. All of this is ordained by God. God desires that man submit to authority because the authorities are not only appointed by God, but they also represent God. This is why Romans clearly says that there is no authority except God. Therefore, no Christian student should boycott classes, no Christian worker should strike, no Christian children should dishonor their parents, and no Christian citizen should engage in a revolution. If anyone does these things, he is not just overturning those he directly opposes, he is overturning God's authority. God created the universe with His authority, and He maintains the universe with His authority. What is sin? It is lawlessness&mdash;refusing to submit to authority. "Sin is lawlessness" (1 John 3:4). Both Satan and Adam overturned God's authority; by this both sinned. Whoever does not recognize authority and submit to authority is a lawless one, and he has sinned.</P><P>Many believers have never realized such a wonderful thing as authority. Yet if a man wants to be a good believer, he has to know what authority is. Authority represents God. If one traces authority to its ultimate source, he will see that authority is just God. Therefore, a Christian must not only submit to the head of a nation or to all its ministers, but he must submit even to a policeman on the street because the latter has authority. He represents not only the government, but God as well. You cannot despise him just because he earns a few dollars a month. Authority is something that issues from God. The Bible is very strict about this matter. Paul, Peter, and Jude all said that we should not revile those in high position. Therefore, in our conversation, we cannot accuse or criticize the head of our government. It is difficult for a Christian to be an editor of a newspaper because one can hardly avoid criticizing the superiors in political commentary.</P><P>The book of Jude records the incident of Michael arguing with the devil over the body of Moses. Michael dared not revile Satan. He would only say, "The Lord rebuke you," because he was once the subordinate of Satan. There was a time when Michael was under his authority. Therefore, Michael only said, "The Lord rebuke you." He would not speak on his own; he only invoked an authority higher than Satan's&mdash;God's authority. He knew what authority was. Therefore, he dared not revile Satan himself.</P><P>When our Lord was on earth, He was also fully under authority. During His youth, He was under the authority of His parents, and He kept all the ordinances. He was the Creator. Yet He was limited by every one of man's limitations. He told His mother, "Did you not know that I must be in the things of My Father?" (Luke 2:49). If we were there, we would not have gone home with our parents. But the Lord was different; He went back with them. When He began to work, He was under the authority of the government. During His trial, He was still under the authority of the government. He did not revile the government; rather, He allowed it to do whatever it wanted to do to Him. We can see that no one has ever been as submissive to authority as our Lord.</P><P>Once when Paul was judged and stood before the court, he willingly submitted to the authority there. When the high priest's accusations became too much, Paul said, "God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall" (Acts 23:3). When the others rebuked him for reviling God's high priest, Paul became quiet and allowed them to accuse him. According to the Bible, nothing is greater and more important than the matter of authority.</P>
