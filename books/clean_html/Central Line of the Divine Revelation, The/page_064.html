This Spirit is the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is the compound Spirit, and the compound Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit, because He has been compounded with the elements of divinity, humanity, Christ's death with its effectiveness, and Christ's resurrection with its effectiveness. The Bible tells us that, after passing through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, Christ became a life-giving Spirit. His becoming a life-giving Spirit is the consummation of all the processes He has passed through.</P><P>At least four thousand years after He created man, the complete God entered into a "tunnel," a process. This "tunnel," this process, was quite long and had at least four sections. The first section of the "tunnel" was incarnation. Incarnation, as Isaiah shows us in chapter fifty-three, included His human living and lasted thirty-three and a half years in addition to the nine months He was in the womb. The second section was His all-inclusive death, which, strictly speaking, lasted only six hours, from nine o'clock in the morning until three o'clock in the afternoon. However, the preparation for His death lasted at least one week. Before His crucifixion, He went to Jerusalem voluntarily. According to the types and prophecies in the Old Testament, He had to be cut off on the day of the Passover (Exo. 12:3-6) and in that particular year (Dan. 9:25-26). Otherwise, the type concerning the Passover and Daniel's prophecy concerning the seventy weeks (vv. 24-27) could not have been properly fulfilled. He knew the year, He knew the month, and He knew the day. Thus, He went to Jerusalem according to the foreordained date. He entered into Jerusalem and stayed there for one week, including the day of His death (John 12:1; see note 1 in Mark 12:37). Therefore, it took Him at least one week to pass through His death. In those six days prior to His death, He was dying there; He was being slaughtered. To kill Him was not a simple matter. Before being arrested, He was tested by several groups of people, including the chief priests, the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Herodians, the scribes, and the elders.</P>
