   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. Being Condemned in the Same Way</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>as Fornication and Idolatry</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When you ask certain ones, May a Christian commit fornication?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They will answer with a definitive no. If you ask them, May a Christian worship idols? They will give you a definitive no as well.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But if you ask them, May Christians be divided?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They may say, Though they are divided outwardly, they are not divided in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is like idol worshippers saying, We are only worshipping idols outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not worshipping them in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is no excuse for this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both idolatry and division are condemned in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not Having Our Own Choices</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>according to the Works of the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is strange for some who consider themselves servants of God to write books encouraging others to remain in the sects.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a servant of God wrote a book encouraging Christians to worship idols, what would be your response?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a servant of God wrote a book encouraging Christians to commit fornication, to be lascivious, to lose their temper, and to be jealous, what would you think of this?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You would feel that this person is surely not a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But there are people who say that Christians can remain in sects, and many people print their books.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The only thing I can say is that men today are blind to what is abominable in the eyes of the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please bear in mind that we cannot have our own choice according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sectarianism, like idolatry, fornication, anger, and sorcery, is a work of the flesh; these are all on the same condemned list.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must act in a responsible way before God and not be tempted to go back to sectarianism.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How the Word Sect</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Came to Be Translated as Heresy</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The meaning of the word sect is very clear in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is translated as divisions in 1 Corinthians 11:18 and as sects in Galatians 5:20.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, they are the same word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why was this word translated as heresy in the King James Version?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Greek the word is hairesis.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The translators of the Bible probably chose not to translate the meaning of the word but instead used the word heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The King James Version was produced by the Anglican Church, and it had trouble with this verse because it was a state church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This reservation resulted in the use of an ambiguous word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The translators probably knew that this was not the right word, but they used it nevertheless.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This same practice can be seen in the Chinese Bibles that use both Shangdi and Shen for the word God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Publishers know quite well that Shangdi is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But because many denominations are familiar with this term, they continue to use it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They publish versions that use both words to cater to the needs of both sides.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Another example can be found in the translation of the word baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This word should be translated immersed, but since sprinkling was a prevalent practice, the publishers were not definite in its translation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If immersed had been used, it would have aroused controversy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who know Greek know that the word baptism means to immerse something into water.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yet the translators dared not translate it this way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead, they invented a new English word, baptism, which does not mean anything in itself; it keeps a person in the dark as to its true meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a transliteration of a foreign word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The same principle applies to the translation of the word hairesis.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Translating it as sect or division and calling sectarianism or division a work of the flesh would have aroused controversy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This was the reason the word heresy was used instead.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It diverted the reader from understanding its true meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Actually, the word heresy is not an English word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No English-speaking person knows what it really means.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I know of two brothers who worked at the Gospel Bookstore who were involved with the translation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They simply made a transliteration of the word baptizo and put the characters ba-di-zo in its place.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I am afraid that not a single soul in China knows what ba-di-zo means, whether it means immersion or sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No one knows what the word ba-di-zo means, and so both the immersion group and the sprinkling group are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This only goes to show man s unfaithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A casual reading of a few other translations will tell you that the word hairesis is actually sect in English.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But because of reservations, the word heresy was used instead, and everyone has been kept in the dark as to the true meaning of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Greek word hairesis was anglicized to become heresy in 1611, and the word heresy has been with us for the last three hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By the time the Chinese translated this word, it became i-duan heresy, a rather ambiguous word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I can give you other examples of such transliteration of English words.</S>
