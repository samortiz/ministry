Nonetheless, without it Christ cannot fulfill God's eternal purpose, which is to have the church as Christ's Body
He is the embodiment and mystery of God, the reality of every positive thing, our life, and the constituent of the new man
Heresies came in, claiming that Christ was not God, was not the Son of God, and even that He did not come in the flesh
They sometimes refer to Christ's earthly ministry, but primarily they are concerned with the carrying out of His heavenly ministry
Verse 14 further says regarding the Word, 'And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us full of grace and reality'
He subsisted in the form of God, 'but emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men'
Verse 17 goes on to tell us, 'For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ'
In 314 the Lord referring to Himself tells us that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up
In the eyes of God when Christ was lifted up on the cross He was in the form of a brass serpent that is in the likeness of the flesh of sin
Christians appreciate Christ's dying for us as the Lamb of God, but few have ever heard that He died also in the form of a brass serpent
The first kind was the fiery serpents that bit and poisoned the children of Israel as a punishment for their complaining
We have boldness through the blood of Christ to enter the Holy of Holies to receive mercy and grace for timely help
Sins and Satan are on the negative side; on the positive side, the divine life has been imparted into you, making you a child of God
In that day He would be in them , meaning that when the Spirit of reality indwelt them, the Lord Jesus Himself was in them
He became a man that He might accomplish redemption for us and might thus open the way for us to receive the divine life
By believing in this dear Christ, we are regenerated; this second birth, in our spirit, makes us children of God
After five futile attempts to satisfy her longing, she was now trying for the sixth time to get the satisfaction she craved
His father, a royal official, went to see the Lord and asked Him to come and heal his son, who was at the point of death
The seventh case was of the woman caught committing adultery , According to the law of Moses, she should have been stoned to death
The scribes and Pharisees brought the woman to the Lord Jesus, testing Him to see if He would say something different from the law
On a later occasion Peter, probably hungry and short of food, said to the others with him, 'I am going fishing'
At first they did not recognize Him when He spoke to them, but when they followed what He said, they caught fish in abundance
When we are happy with Him, attending the meetings, praying, and pray-reading, we may not have a strong sense that He is within
John 15 is a most mysterious chapter, yet because the illustration is so simple, we may not really catch its significance
To liken the relationship between the Lord and us to a vine and its branches is to imply a living, organic relationship
When we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus, we had a sense of something entering into us and of our having been put into something
To attach a branch to another tree and have them grow together and become one is possible because they are both living
In the latter case we feel condemned, but in the former case we have no realization that we need forgiveness for acting in ourselves
Brother Lee,' he said, 'I know how much you respect the Bible, but do you realize that you do not practice baptism by immersion rightly'?
Oh, no,' he protested, 'you must not say you baptize into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost!
Christians have been distracted from this, but John comes to remind us that the Lord is in us and we are in Him
In this one organism, that is, Christ mingling with our spirit, we grow, we live, we walk, and we have our being
As the bright light bulb indicates the presence of electricity, so the cloud of glory showed the presence of God
From outside this glory was not visible, but when the high priest entered the Holy of Holies, he saw the Shekinah glory there
For the Son to be glorified meant that the Father too was glorified, because the Father was concealed in the man Jesus
The proper church life, in other words, is the glorification of the Son and of the Father, the glorification of the Father in the Son
Once the genuine oneness was destroyed, there could be no glorification of the Son nor of the Father through the Son
The answer began on the day of Pentecost, when all one hundred twenty were made one, and the Son and the Father were thus glorified
In the nineteen centuries since then, the answer to this prayer has been continuing here and there on the earth
How great a measure depends on how much we drop the differences and take Christ as our center, even as our constituent
In John 14:7-11 the Lord spoke of the Father, and Philip foolishly asked, 'Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us'
When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; He will disclose to you what is to come
He is real to you, comforting you in sadness, enlightening you in darkness, and bothering you when you would turn aside
Now He prays, 'Holy Father, keep them in Your name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are
When the Jews asked for a sign of His authority, He told them if they destroyed this temple, in three days He would raise it up
The Old Testament type was firstly the tabernacle and then the temple, two stages of one thing, both typifying Christ
Peter 1:3 says that we were begotten again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead
Since John 3 is the chapter on regeneration, we know that the bride is the sum total of those who have been regenerated
In John's mending ministry, however, the church, alluded to in John 3 as the bride, will ultimately consummate in the New Jerusalem
At night, or during storms, or in wintertime when the shepherd was not with them, the sheep would remain in the fold
Until Christ came as the Shepherd, the Jews were kept in the fold of religion, preserved during the cold, dark time of His absence
Besides those kept under the guardianship of the law, this unique Shepherd had other sheep, the Gentiles who believed
John 10, besides telling us of the one flock, also says that Christ came that we may have life 'and may have it abundantly'
Even today God's children are scattered and divided, but through the death and resurrection of Christ we can be gathered together
The church is implied, then, in John 11 by the gathering together of God's scattered children through the death and resurrection of Christ
If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him'
Most Bible teachers interpret the Lord's words in verse 3, 'I am coming again and will receive you to Myself,' to refer to His second coming
When the Lord went to prepare a place for the believers by death and resurrection, He came again in resurrection to them
John 14 through 17 reveals that we the redeemed ones, through the death and resurrection of Christ, have been brought into the Triune God
When the Lord said that we should love one another, He was implying that fruit-bearing is not an individual matter
Apart from these four thingsidol worship immorality division and the denial of Christs Person and redemptive workthe church must be tolerant
As those who believe in the Lord Jesus and are the regenerated children of God, we are all members of the Body of Christ
Regardless of the differences we may have in practice or in doctrine, we have no way but to remain here in the genuine oneness
We can give no place to idol worship, immorality, division, or the denial of Christ's divinity and redemptive work
We may study these twenty-three books in a detailed, analytical way without ever realizing the point behind them
Paul's ministry did complete God's economy, yet within a quarter century after his departure, the church fell into heresy
During the next twenty-five years or so heresies sprang up, claiming that Christ was not God or that Christ had not come in the flesh
He describes life as 'that which was from the beginning,' which they have heard, seen, and touched of the Word of life
Not too long ago someone asked them What does the Bible mean when it says that we should abide in Christ and that He should abide in us
Is the way they answered: 'This does not mean that we really dwell in Christ, nor that Christ actually dwells in us
They reject what they regard as our teaching that Christ is in us; such a teaching to them is too experiential
You may doctrinally answer that you live by Christ, but in your daily living how many hours is this really your experience?
When the Apostle John wrote this Epistle, the believers were being confronted with arguments about who Christ was
You can see that John's mending ministry, because it was somewhat mysterious, was not quickly and properly recognized
Even today some Christian teachers avoid Revelation, and many so-called fundamentalists use John's Gospel and Epistles superficially
In the fourth chapter we are told that 'God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him'
For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith'
If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death'
From these verses we can see that the life John is referring to is something substantial, not vague or up in the air
It is a strong declaration that Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God and who has come, is the true God and eternal life
There is a strong emphasis in the New Testament that God's intention is to give Christ, His Son, to us as life
They are told that since they are saved and are children of God, they need to behave in a way that will glorify God
It is like being in the kitchen reading and appreciating a recipe but not getting out the ingredients and preparing it
Gradually, due to our influence in the Far East, the word fraternity has largely been dropped, and now the word used is fellowship
As soon as you meet someone you know, you begin to talk about who is about to get married or who is having what kind of trouble
His Gospel, for example, begins: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
The Bible in John's writings nonetheless tells us repeatedly and emphatically that we are to abide in Christ and have Him abide in us
Philippians 2 says that He was in the form of God yet did not 'regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself'
Not only did He lower Himself to become a man; He lowered Himself even to the lowest standard of humanity, growing up in a carpenter's home
The objection has been raised that such a statement implies that God loses His divinity and we lose our humanity
When we make tea by adding tea leaves to water, there is no change in the substance and nature of the water nor of the tea
It is to say that we have God's life and nature, but not His deity, not that we have become part of the Godhead
The Lord Jesus said If anyone loves Me he will keep My word and My Father will love him and We will come to him and make an abode with him
When someone was anointed as king to rule over God's people or as prophet to speak forth for God, he was anointed with oil
Upon awaking, he 'took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it
In Exodus 30, when the tabernacle was almost ready to be built, God told Moses how to prepare the anointing ointment
Cinnamon, a flavorful spice still used in cooking, speaks of the sweetness and strength of the death of Christ
Cassia, which was used in ancient times as a repellent especially for snakes, signifies the power of resurrection
The antibiotic of the death of Christ kills the germs, and the nourishing food of the resurrection of Christ supplies us
We found out that the best way to get spiritual nourishment from the Word of God is not only to read it but also to pray it
To pray-read the Word of God is to exercise our spirit to digest the Word rather than our mind to understand it
Romans 10 says further, 'For there is no difference between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him
In this compound Spirit are the death of Christ with its effectiveness, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection
The Spirit is compounded with all the excellent, divine elements as well as the humanity of Christ and His death and resurrection
There will be the effectiveness of His death, by which all the negative things of our natural being will be killed
We shall also have the power of His resurrection to nourish, strengthen, and sustain us with its heavenly supply
It is by this compound all-inclusive Spirit that we enjoy Him, that we live Christ, and that we have the church life
John in his Revelation, the last book of the Bible, used 'the Spirit' more than other terms or titles for the Spirit of God
In the last message we dealt with the anointing, the moving within us of the Triune God as the all-inclusive compound Spirit
Besides divinity, there is humanity, Christ's death and its effectiveness, and His resurrection and the power of that resurrection
As we receive not only the divine elements but also the death and resurrection of Christ, we get the proper killing and the rich nourishment
If we do not distinguish between the spirit and the soul, we put ourselves in the same category as cats and dogs
Suppose a medical doctor considered that the stomach, the heart, the liver, and the kidneys were all synonyms for the same organ
The high point of his teachings is his statement that the highest learning is to develop the bright virtue of man
In belief you have God in you even the Spirit of God and the life of God but in experience you do not have the adequate realization of them
He did not say that the Lord be with Timothy's mind, that he might have a sober mind, nor that the Lord be with his good heart
We have been discussing the matter of the spirit, yet if you check 1 John you will find that the word spirit does not occur even once!
Whenever you still felt drawn to the world, however, you can testify that something within you was opposed to that attraction
Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God'
The Triune God, the almighty, infinite, eternal God has been sown into our spirit to grow Himself and to blossom Himself!
We live Christ by the spirit born of God and by the seed of God which grows God from within us and blossoms Him out
Within John also must have been the fact of the mutual abiding, then the anointing, and then the spirit which has been reborn of God
If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death
We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not
It is not sufficient for a carpenter to have good pieces of wood; he also needs skill if he is to shape them into fine furniture
In Genesis 3 we have the account of the subtle serpent who came and beguiled the woman into partaking of the forbidden tree
The only husband who can be subdued is the clever one; he will merely be tricking you into thinking he is subdued
If your car is almost out of gasoline, you can turn into the gas station and stay there to have the tank refilled
We need to learn that when any brother or sister sins, this is a strong indication that he or she is short of life
That sin, however, caused both her and Aaron to die in the wilderness before the children of Israel entered the good land
In the concluding verses of 1 John there is a cluster of negative things: sin, death, the world, the evil one, and idols
We may think of them simply as purchases from the department store, but those worldly things are from within Satan
It may be an essential for transportation in our society, but if we go beyond fulfilling that need and love its style, it becomes an idol
It is one thing to dress carefully and another to care for fashions and select our clothing on the basis of what is in style
In our prayers we must put our trust in these two things: the life which is God Himself and the part within us which has been born of Him
We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not'
Our spirit and the life which is the Lord Jesus Himself ministered to us as a life supply will overcome sin death the world and the evil one
When you live in the world, you are under sin, under death, under Satan, and you have many things which are idols
From what Paul tells us in Colossians 1:25 we know that Paul's stewardship which he received from God was to complete the Word of God
History records that before the end of the first century, after Paul's martyrdom, the church was carried away by serious heresies
The subtle one on the other hand also was behind the heresy that claimed Christ had not come in the flesh; this means that He was not a man
After stressing in the first verse of his Gospel that Christ was God, he tells us in verse 14 that this Word which was God became flesh
The scroll must be the new covenant, recording God's thought concerning the church, Israel, the world, and the universe
One of the elders comforted him saying the Lion of the tribe of Judah the Root of David has overcome to open the scroll and its seven seals
In John's Gospel John the Baptist had recommended this same Lamb: 'Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world'!
John, then, opens the view to us of the redeeming Lamb now become God's universal Administrator that His purpose might be fulfilled
When did this scene occur, that the Lamb came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him Who sits upon the throne ?
His heavenly ministry is eternal; it has already been going on for close to two thousand years and there will be no end
They use John 19:30, where Christ said 'It is finished,' to prove that Christ has completed the work He came to do
We need to do some heavenly window shopping to enjoy what all these windows show us of Christ's ministry in the heavens!
The second is the presentation of a clear view of God's administration of the whole universe, found in Revelation 4 to 20
From John's mending ministry we know that the Lord is the Ruler of kings; all earthly affairs are under His administration
You might mention God, the creation, the fall of man, the children of Israel, Christ, and the spread of the church
To say what after all is the message of these books is difficult, because the Bible is not completed with them
If you were to ask Peter the meaning of what he was doing in the Acts, he probably could not explain why he did what he did
Even from reading his two Epistles you can see that his part in the concluding revelation in the Bible was minor
He was honest and faithful to direct us to Paul, though he found in Paul's Epistles 'some things hard to be understood'
Catholicism has exalted Peter, but Peter rather commended Paul to us, saying that Paul had written according to the wisdom given to him
He thought Jesus was dead and buried, but suddenly this One appeared to him, not from the tomb but from the heavens'
Saul was surely persecuting the followers of the Nazarene even unto death, but this One was now claiming that Saul was persecuting Him
While he was in Damascus, he saw in a vision that a man named Ananias would come and heal him of his blindness
He was directed not to Peter, the leading apostle, but to Ananias, a little member whom he had probably never heard of
If you look into the messages we have put out in this country, you will find that most of them center on these very books
We can see Christ's ministry in the heavens, this ministry which is now being carried out on earth by John's mending ministry
To be homesick is to be away from home and to keep thinking about home and to long to be there instead of somewhere else
John places the churches before the heavens because in his speaking, as in God's, the most treasured thing is the churches
Some day you will realize that there is nothing in the whole earth, even in the whole universe, more precious to God than the churches
If the Lord Jesus were not walking through the church, watching you with His seven eyes, you would not feel you were too poor
As you sense under His gaze how poor is the church, you begin also to realize how poor and unworthy you yourself are
Such experiences which happen to us again and again are an indication that our High Priest is walking through loving us and also judging us
Paul's highest revelation of the church is as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, and the new man
In this one entity, the lampstand, there is the Father as the nature, the Son as the form, and the Spirit as the expression
If the emblems have no meaning, why are they revealed in the Bible, not only in the Old Testament but also in the New?
If this emblem of the lampstand in the last book of the New Testament has no spiritual significance, why is it revealed there?
Not only is the Triune God embodied and symbolized by the simple symbol of the lampstand; the church in Revelation is the lampstand
In New York, Los Angeles, Stuttgart, Taipei, and Hong Kong-wherever there is a church-there is the corporate Christ
You may think that in chapters two and three the Lord is dealing with the seven churches, and not associate this with His priestly service
In other words, His intercession takes place first; then by His speaking to us He continues to accomplish what He has interceded
He is not only walking in the midst of the churches; He is also carrying on His twofold speaking, a Godward speaking and an usward speaking
Our High Priest in His heavenly ministry is now walking among the churches to look into the condition of each one
Many Bible teachers use these epistles to expound doctrines, but what Christ is speaking here is not doctrinal
To trim is to cut off the charred ends which would no longer burn brightly; to add oil is to supply what is needed
That the Lord speaks of Judaism in such a way indicates that by the time of the church age, Judaism had become satanic
She 'calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices'
Also by it the heavenly, divine element of the tree of life, the hidden manna, and the heavenly feast is ministered to you
Even while you listen, this transformation is going on because this ministry is under the heavenly priesthood of Christ
It has been because your High Priest in the heavens is doing His priestly service walking among you speaking to you and interceding for you
The heavenly element will have been supplied to you as the tree of life, the hidden manna, and the heavenly feast
Now we shall see that His priesthood requires His rulership in order for this ministry to the churches to be carried out
Perhaps an economic situation forced you to move from one part of town to another, which happened to be near the meeting hall
Your intention might have been to make money in real estate, but all your moves were arranged by Him for His purpose
With nothing much to do there, we put on gospel robes, picked up drums, and paraded by the hundreds down the street
Many of them would tell you that if circumstances had not forced them to Taiwan, they would never have been open to the gospel
His having one foot on the sea and the other on the land signifies that He is coming to take possession of the whole globe
In chapter eighteen there was 'another Angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was illumined with His glory
She has become a dwelling place of demons and a hold of every unclean spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird'
In God's government Christ is both the Commander of the army to subdue the rebellious ones and the Judge to execute the heavenly judgment
The book of Revelation begins with Christ walking in the midst of the churches and concludes with the New Jerusalem
The first three chapters, dealing with the churches in this age, consummates in the last two chapters, the New Jerusalem in eternity
For this to be accomplished, He needs to exercise His rulership to arrange the situations on earth which will lead to this
These chapters cover a long period of time, at least two thousand years, from His ascension to His second advent
All during this long period He is the Ruler of the kings of the earth, administrating God's government for the carrying out of God's purpose
They overcome sin, the world, Satan, the self, the flesh, their lusts, even everything of the old creation, especially including religion
There is Protestantism, which brings people only a little farther on the way to God and then hinders them from going on
When someone comes to preach the gospel to them, they will have nothing to do with him; they refuse to budge from their religion
When the two boys later check with their professor-priest, he tells them not to be influenced by such old-fashioned views
As he watches the change in the two who were converted through him, he is upset that he is losing his influence
A conflict develops in the students between their desire to go on and their loyalty to the preacher who first gave them the gospel
In the ancient time, when Abraham was weary from fighting with the kings, Melchisedec came to refresh him with bread and wine
While the Lord Jesus as the Lamb is opening the seals, that is, administering God's universal government, two instances are inserted
The first is the sealing of the one hundred forty-four thousand of Israel ; the second is the innumerable multitude before the throne
In the first instance, Christ as 'another Angel' restrains the damaging angels so that those of the twelve tribes of Israel may be sealed
To the world and to the Jews He is the Ruler of the kings, but to this great multitude the Lamb is the Shepherd
These dear ones who love God and seek Christ at any cost gain the supply of living water, which is God Himself
A good number have been sustained by the Lord to overcome all obstacles and to come to the springs of the waters of life
It is when we are full of this thirst-quenching water that we can easily overcome whatever comes across our path
Another sign was seen in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems
The dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, so that when she brings forth he might devour her child
In Iran He is the Ruler of kings; here He is the heavenly Minister, providing all of us with the rich, divine element
He ministers the heavenly supply to us not only during a conference like this, but also in all the church meetings
These were purchased from among men as firstfruit to God and to the Lamb; and in their mouth no lie was found, for they are without blemish'
There are some who are continually with the Lord, following Him all day every day, and these receive a greater supply
For You alone are holy; for all the nations will come and worship before You, for Your righteous acts have been made manifest'
They will be singing in praise of God as the eternal, righteous Judge and in praise of the Lamb as the Redeemer
How were they able to overcome the persecution they suffered at the hands of the Antichrist and to stand on the glassy sea?
In themselves they could not bear it, but His heavenly ministry sustains them so that they can overcome any difficulty
Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready
It was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints'
In later years Abraham's grandson, Jacob, was on his way to his uncle's, fleeing from his brother and feeling sorrowful and desolate
In Exodus God sent Moses to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt to a place where they would build Him a tabernacle
The Bible tells us that the New Jerusalem is, on the one hand, God's tabernacle and, on the other hand, Christ's wife
In eternity God the Father has a home, which is called the tabernacle, and God the Son has a wife, which is that very tabernacle
As we dig through all that is implied here, we must conclude that this city is the enlargement of God Himself, so it is the wife of the Lamb
With our limited understanding, we can only say that the New Jerusalem is a composition of the Triune God and His redeemed people
The New Jerusalem, then, is composed of the Father's sons enjoying His life; it is also the wife of the Lamb, enjoying the Son's love
The New Testament tells us clearly that God does not dwell in a physical building , that we are the house of God and God's temple
By then His ministry is no longer in the heavens because the New Jerusalem, where He will minister, has come down out of heaven
From the description in these two chapters we can see that this one city has one street with one river flowing in the midst of the street
We enjoy the tabernacle, the temple, the Father's life, the Son's love, the water of life, and the tree of life
And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it for the glory of God illumined it and its lamp is the Lamb
And night shall be no more; and they have no need of the light of a lamp and the light of the sun, for the Lord God shall illumine them'
Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city'
As we are enjoying the church life, we have the sense that we are truly enjoying the Triune God according to the view of the New Jerusalem
