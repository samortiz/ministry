<h2 class="head1">THE DEFINITION OF FAITH</h2><p>Let us now find out what faith is. The most important matter in the Bible is faith. Perhaps the faith that we know of is not the faith that the Bible speaks about. The Bible mentions faith several hundred times. But the only place that gives a definition to faith is Hebrews 11:1. This verse says, "Now faith is the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen." The word "substantiation" is not a noun in Greek, but a verb that is turned into a noun. It can be translated as "substantiating." Most English translations render this word as "substance." Only J. N. Darby's translation renders it as "substantiating." In Chinese there is no comparable word for it.</p><p>Human beings are made with a physical body. How can we relate to the material world around us? We relate to it through our five senses. If a man is deprived of the five senses, he will not know anything about the physical universe. The world is full of physical objects of all sizes and forms, each having its own shade, color, and shape. These objects are realized through our eyes. When sight is transmitted into us, we know that all these objects exist in the world. Colors are outside of us, but they are transmitted into us through the eyes. These colors are the substance that the Bible speaks of. The eyes substantiate the colors of objects. In the same way, faith substantiates the substances that are in the spiritual world. We may talk to a blind man about colors, and there may be all kinds of colors in this world, but to him there is no color. This does not mean that there is no color in the world. It only means that a blind man does not have the faculty to substantiate the colors that objects possess.</p><p>Today God wants the things that He has accomplished in Christ to be substantiated in us. This is a function of faith. Faith is a kind of substantiating; it reveals the substance that is in the spiritual world. Discussing spiritual things with a person who does not have any faith is like a painter discussing color with a blind man. The blind man may deny the existence of any color. This does not mean, however, that there are no pictures or colors in the world. It merely means that the blind man lacks the proper faculty to substantiate the colors. What are the spiritual things in Christ to you? Is my speaking to you like the painter speaking to the blind man about his painting? I hope not.</p><p>The question is not whether there is a spiritual world. The question is whether or not there is an organ to realize the things in the spiritual world. Although a blind man cannot see with his eyes, he can hear with his ears. If I speak to a blind man about color, and he tries to listen with his eyes, he will not hear anything. You may laugh at this thought. It is ridiculous because the man has used the wrong organ to substantiate colors. Every organ and faculty in the human body has its special functions. The only organ that will substantiate spiritual things is faith. It is wrong to try to substantiate spiritual things with one's feelings.</p><p>Why does faith substantiate or make spiritual things real? It is because Christ has accomplished everything. God has put everything into Christ. In the spiritual world, God does not need you to create "colors" and "shapes"; He has finished everything. All you have to do is exercise your spiritual eyes, that is, your faith, to substantiate them. The faith that the Bible speaks of is a faculty that substantiates spiritual things.</p><p>A question may arise in our actual experience. You may say, "You have said that I have died, but I do not feel as if I have died. I feel as if I have not died. I still have many sins, and I am still very much alive!" Please remember that our physical eyes can only substantiate physical things. Only faith can substantiate spiritual things. Faith is acknowledging that whatever God says is true. If we look at ourselves and try to feel something in ourselves, we will only substantiate the things in Adam. Why are we not able to substantiate the things that are in Christ? It is because we have used the wrong organ. We are seeing with our physical eyes, and we are feeling with our feelings. We are not exercising faith.</p>
