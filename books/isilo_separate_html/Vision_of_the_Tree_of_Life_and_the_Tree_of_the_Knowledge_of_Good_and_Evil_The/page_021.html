<h1 class="title">CRUCIAL POINTS<br />
CONCERNING HOW TO ENJOY GOD</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider twenty crucial points concerning how to enjoy God. These points will give us an accurate understanding of enjoying God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S RELATIONSHIP WITH MAN<br />
NOT DEPENDING ON THINGS</h2>
<p>The first point is that God has no intention that man would do something for Him, nor is His intention related to doing things for man. In other words, God&rsquo;s relationship with man does not depend on doing or receiving things. God&rsquo;s relationship with man is not a matter of things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING FOOD<br />
TO BE MAN&rsquo;S LIFE AND LIFE SUPPLY</h2>
<p>God comes to man as food in order to be man&rsquo;s life and life supply. God wants to be man&rsquo;s food so that He may be man&rsquo;s life. God&rsquo;s purpose is for man to receive Him and to enjoy Him so that He may be mingled with man and become man&rsquo;s content. Thus God becomes man&rsquo;s content and man becomes God&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S LIVING, MOVE, AND WORK<br />
BEING THE ISSUE OF MINGLING WITH GOD</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s living, move, and work should be the issue of the mingling of God and man. Everything related to man should be a matter of two natures. Even prayer and worship should be the issue of man being mingled with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT FINDING OR ENJOYING GOD<br />
APART FROM CHRIST</h2>
<p>Man can neither find nor enjoy God apart from Christ, because all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ, the Son of God, bodily (Col. 2:9).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNION AND MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN<br />
BEING THROUGH THE INCARNATION, DEATH,<br />
AND RESURRECTION OF THE LORD JESUS</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus was incarnated to bring God into man, and He died and was resurrected to bring man into God. Hence, the union of God and man and the mingling of God with man are through the incarnation, death, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S DEATH ON THE CROSS<br />
DEALING WITH THE RECORD OF SIN,<br />
SIN, THE FLESH, THE OLD CREATION, SATAN,<br />
THE WORLD, AND DEATH</h2>
<p>The death of the Lord Jesus on the cross erased the record of man&rsquo;s sin before God, dealt with sin in man, and solved the problems of the flesh, the old creation, Satan, the world, and death. Since every negative thing has been dealt with through the death of the Lord Jesus on the cross, we are delivered from every negative thing when we are joined to His death and live in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD RESURRECTING FROM THE DEAD<br />
TO BECOME THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>After resurrecting from the dead, the Lord Jesus became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) and entered into heaven (Heb. 9:24). Hence, everything that God is and everything that the Lord Jesus has experienced are in the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE SEVEN SPIRITS<br />
SENT FORTH INTO ALL THE EARTH</h2>
<p>The Spirit possesses all that God is and has done, and now the Spirit is the seven Spirits sent forth into all the earth (Rev. 5:6).</p>
<h2 class="head1">TOUCHING THE SPIRIT BEING TO TOUCH<br />
THE LORD CHRIST AND ALSO TO TOUCH GOD</h2>
<p>Any person who seeks God in spirit and truthfulness (John 4:24) will touch the Spirit. When a person touches the Spirit, he touches the Lord Christ and also God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT REACHING MAN INITIALLY<br />
AS THE JUDGING SPIRIT, THE CONVICTING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Spirit initially reaches man as the judging Spirit, the convicting Spirit. Hence, when man touches the Spirit, he sees that he is condemned in God&rsquo;s light and therefore is convicted (16:8).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONVICTING SPIRIT CAUSING MAN<br />
TO BREATHE OUT SINS AND SELF<br />
AND TO BREATHE IN THE ELEMENTS IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When man is convicted by the Spirit, he breathes out his sins and the self. At the same time he spontaneously breathes in the elements in the Spirit. Thus man is filled with the Spirit, with the Lord Jesus, and with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BREATHING IN THE SPIRIT BEING<br />
TO EAT, DRINK, AND ENJOY GOD</h2>
<p>To breathe in the Spirit is to eat, drink, and enjoy God. The God whom we breathe becomes everything that we need.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE BEING TO BE JOINED WITH MAN,<br />
MINGLED WITH MAN, AND ONE WITH MAN</h2>
<p>When we breathe in God, He not only becomes everything that we need; He also operates within us to carry out His will (Phil. 2:13). God desires to operate in man by being joined with man, mingled with man, and one with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYER BEING TO BREATHE OUT<br />
THE HUMAN ELEMENT AND TO BREATHE IN GOD</h2>
<p>Prayer is a matter of breathing. Prayer is not mainly asking God to do things. Rather, prayer is to breathe out the human element and to breathe in God. This is genuine prayer.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
