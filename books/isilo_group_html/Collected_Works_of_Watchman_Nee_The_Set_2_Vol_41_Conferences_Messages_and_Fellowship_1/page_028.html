I am not saying that we do not have this life. I am saying that in addition to having this life we can experience Christ as our life. If we have Christ living within us, we will have the same holy life as Christ. He will live a holy life from within us. Only Christ's life is holy, and only He can live the holy life. We are sinners. Our life is the human life; it can only sin and never do good. If our life is not exchanged, it can never be changed. This afternoon we will see how we can experience Christ's life and how we can allow Him to live within us.</p><p>Paul said in Galatians 2:20, "It is no longer I...but...Christ." We cannot fool anyone with this word. We cannot just claim this with our mouth, while our conscience condemns us. Paul was able to honestly say, "It is no longer I...but...Christ." This is the overcoming life. The overcoming life is not one which boasts of its own ability or victory. The overcoming life is one which says, "It is no longer I...but...Christ." This afternoon we will concentrate on this subject. Simply put, if a man wants to experience Christ as his life, there are two necessary conditions. The first is letting go, and the second is believing.</p><h2 class="head1">LETTING GO</h2><h2 class="head2">Seeing That We Cannot Make It</h2><p>What does it mean to let go? In order for a Christian to let go, he must go through certain experiences. There are three steps that he must take. There is no way to skip a step or change them. They are indispensable; one cannot have the overcoming life by any other means. Luke 18:27 says, "The things that are impossible with men are possible with God." This verse is part of a story about a young man who came to Jesus to ask how he could inherit and enjoy eternal life. The Lord said that in order for him to inherit eternal life, he must not commit fornication or murder and must not steal or bear false witness, but must honor his father and mother. Since he had kept all these commandments, the man was happy when he heard the Lord's word. He thought that these commandments were easy to keep. He thought that they were not a problem to him because he had kept all of them from his youth. He was not short in any of them. But then the Lord said that he still lacked one thing. What was the one thing that he lacked? The Lord said, "All that you have, sell and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me" (v. 22). After the Lord said this, the man felt helpless. He thought that the price was too great, and he walked away in sorrow.</p><p>The Lord turned then to the disciples and said, "How difficult it is for those who have riches to go into the kingdom of God. For it is easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God" (vv. 24-25). When the disciples heard this, they asked the Lord, "Then who can be saved?" (v. 26). (Most people today think that they are rich. How many realize that they are poor?) The Lord said, "The things that are impossible with men are possible with God" (v. 27). Why did the Lord say this? The problem with the young man was not that he was rich, nor was it that he was unwilling to sell all. His problem lay in the fact that he only had a view of himself. When he first came to the Lord, he saw himself and thought that he could make it. In effect, he told the Lord that he could make it. The Lord then gave him a new commandment, and he looked at himself again and said that he could not make it. He was only looking at himself. He first looked at what he could do and then at what he could not do. He never saw God's work and power. This is why the Lord said that the things that are impossible with men are possible with God. He meant that even though the young man could not make it, God could make it. The young man could not give his wealth to the poor. Yet God could make him give it to the poor. It was not a matter of being able in himself, but a matter of God being the able One. The young man did not see this and, therefore, went away in sorrow.</p><p>The Lord told the young man to sell and distribute all that he had to the poor. A rich man may be alarmed when he hears such a word and may say, "I cannot be a Christian anymore. What should I do if I sell all that I have?" The Lord's intention is not to have our money or all that we have. His intention is to prove to us that we cannot make it. Ananias and Sapphira had money and property. Peter said that while the property remained in their hand, it was their own. Even after it was sold, it was still under their disposal (Acts 5:4). If one does not have the leading of the Spirit, he does not have to sell anything or offer it up. Philemon was also a rich man. Paul did not tell him to sell and distribute all that he had to the poor. The Lord asked the young man to sell all that he had because the young man claimed that he had kept all the commandments. When the Lord gave him the commandment to sell all that he had and follow Him, he had to concede that he could not make it.</p><p>The same is true with us. We may not be proud, jealous, or stubborn. We may not have committed fornication and may be loving and patient, having practiced these things for many years. We may feel that we are almost there. Once we feel this way, the Lord will say to us, "Still you lack one thing." Eventually, we find that we cannot make it. We may overcome many sins, but there will be one sin we cannot overcome. Every Christian has one or two particular sins. Everyone has one or two sins which he or she is very familiar with. These sins have a special attachment to certain ones; they come and visit them all the time, following them wherever they go. The Lord said, "Still you lack one thing." This one thing does not refer to the selling of all that we have, but to the one thing that we cannot do. If we think that we are able, God will find one thing to prove to us that we cannot make it.</p><p>There was a Western missionary who was a very seeking Christian. Once she came to me and said, "With me there is one sin. Please pray for me." I prayed for her every day. For about two weeks, she kept begging in tears, saying, "God, deliver me from this sin." I thought that she was suffering so much because her sin was very serious. I asked her to tell me about this serious sin. She said, "From my youth I have had a habit of eating snacks. I eat snacks all day long. I can overcome many sins, but I cannot overcome this one sin. Previously, I did not think that this was a sin, but now I know that this is a sin. However, I cannot overcome it." I am always happy to see someone who sins so much that he finds himself unable to stop sinning. It is a joy to see someone unable to overcome his sin. The worst thing for a man is to sin and be able to overcome it. If we sin so much that we cannot stop and find no way to overcome, then God is ready to save us. This sister lacked one thing. She did not know that she had this one sin and did not realize that this was a sin. Once she realized that it was a sin, she found that she could not overcome it. She was willing to see her husband give up a job earning $800 per month and instead take up work for $100. She was willing to suffer many painful things for the Lord. She loved the Lord very much and loved the Chinese, but she was not able to overcome one thing. The thing that the young man lacked was victory over money, and the thing that she lacked was victory over snacks.</p><p>Every person has one particular sin which he cannot overcome. Why does the Lord put such a thing before us? It is to prove to us that we cannot make it, that we are helpless, and that we have esteemed ourselves too highly. It is true that we have not committed fornication or murder and that we may not be proud or jealous, but we always fail when we try to get rid of that one thing! We may boast that we are not like this or that person. But the Lord will say to us that we still lack one thing; there is one thing which we cannot overcome. We still lack one thing. The Lord proved to the young man that he could not make it. Eternal life is the life of Christ. In order to have this life, we must realize that we are fully incapable of doing anything. Once we realize this, God's life will manifest His power in us. If we have not been brought to the point where we fully realize our own inability, we will not allow God's life to live out of us.</p><p>The worst fear that I have is for a man to sin too little. Such a person is neither good nor bad, and neither Christ nor Satan is particularly fond of him. I love to see a person who finds himself unable to overcome a particular sin no matter how hard he tries. Some may have committed some filthy, base, and deplorable sins. Others may have committed some refined sins. No matter what kind of sin it may be, it is a sin which binds a person. It may only be one or two sins, but one cannot overcome them no matter how hard he tries. When this happens, there is hope for the person. The most difficult thing for a person to realize is that he cannot make it on his own. If a man sees that he cannot make it, he is close to salvation. If anyone this afternoon realizes that he cannot make it, he is close to experiencing the overcoming life. If we still do not realize that we cannot make it or if we only have an overcoming doctrine without an overcoming life, we have to ask God to give us the light and show us that we cannot make it at all.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 41: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (1) &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
