<h2 class="head1">THE LIVING GOD MAKING ALL THINGS MANIFEST</h2>
<p>God is a living God. He does not overlook wickedness or unrighteousness. He not only judges man&rsquo;s condition but also makes man&rsquo;s situation manifest. His judging is for manifesting, and He will make all things manifest (1 Cor. 3:13; Eph. 5:13; 1 Tim. 5:24). Every time He judges something, He makes it manifest. His intention in judging is not to punish and not for man to suffer; His intention is to manifest all things. His manifesting of all things proves that He is a living God. He does not overlook anything. Hence, we must not remain in any condition that is incompatible with His nature. This is one aspect of God&rsquo;s manifesting all things.</p>
<p>There is another aspect to God&rsquo;s manifesting all things. If a man is God-fearing, sooner or later he will be manifested by God. It is not vain to fear God. He knows those who fear Him. In the Old Testament Joseph is an example. He feared God and dared not sin against God. Others falsely accused him and put him in prison (Gen. 39). Eventually, God came to make all things manifest. Joseph was manifested as a God-fearing man and was enthroned (41:38-44). God will manifest our faith and love toward Him. A brother who wants to make a show of his love for God will one day be exposed, that is, made manifest. If his intention is to make a show of his faith before men, God will make that manifest. Therefore, no one can pretend, for God will manifest whether he is wrong or right. Our God is the living God; He is not careless. If we know Him in this way, we will fear Him and trust Him. He is the Sovereign of the universe, and He has authority over all things in the universe. He is not loose and does not overlook anything. He is great as well as fine. There is not a matter that is so trivial as to escape His notice.</p>
<p>God makes things manifest according to His nature. He wants to be manifested as holiness, righteousness, light, and love. The Old Testament law portrays the nature of God. God judged His people in the Old Testament according to His law, that is, according to His nature. In order to manifest His nature, He must work on His people. He must be involved with our intentions, our thoughts, and our living and work lest we misrepresent Him. He will manifest whether we love Him, hate Him, fear Him, or mock Him. Our God is a great God, and yet He is broad. He is also very fine and not careless. He is bright, He is light, He is holy, and He is holiness. He wants us to be children of light, and He wants to be our God (Eph. 5:8; John 20:17). Every child of God must fear Him and be comforted by Him because He is the living God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIVING GOD AND<br />
THE GOD WHO HIDES HIMSELF</h2>
<p>Even though our God is a living God, His disposition is to hide Himself. Throughout the Old Testament, from Genesis to Malachi, God was hidden from man. In the New Testament, God came down from the heavens to the earth in order to manifest Himself so that man would know Him, but He concealed Himself in human flesh. He was manifested yet concealed, such that man could not recognize Him. God is a living God, but we cannot see Him, because He is a God who hides Himself (Isa. 45:15). He desires to express His glory, but unlike many who like to make a show of the things they have done, He will not make a show. Concerning the Lord, the prophet Isaiah says, &ldquo;He will not cry out, nor lift up His voice, / Nor make His voice heard in the street. / A bruised reed He will not break; / And a dimly burning flax He will not extinguish&rdquo; (42:2-3). This prophecy shows that He is a God who hides Himself.</p>
<p>Many people often ask why the living God does not discipline people who act recklessly and lawlessly and do works of unrighteousness. Even believers question why the living God does not seem to hear their prayers. The answer is simple: He is a God who hides Himself. When the Lord Jesus was crucified, God hid Himself. He did not judge the ones who crucified the Lord by striking them with lightening. God did not say a word; it was as if God did not exist. Hence, some of those present shook their heads and mocked the Lord. They said, &ldquo;He trusts in God; let Him rescue Him now if He wants Him&rdquo; (Matt. 27:43). The Lord Jesus trusted in God, but while He was hanging on the cross, it was as if there were no God in the universe. God was hidden when the Lord passed through this great trial.</p>
<p>God is a God who hides Himself. He often hides Himself in space and in time. It seems that we pray to Him but do not receive results and that we trust in Him but He ignores us. We must understand that it takes time as well as endurance to experience the living God. The day that the Lord was crucified, God hid Himself. But after three days, He raised Jesus from the dead (Luke 24:6-7). After another forty days, Jesus was lifted up into heaven (Acts 1:3, 9-10). After yet another ten days, on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit descended (2:1-4). We must say that God is real; He is a living God (1 Thes. 1:9), and He is also a God who hides Himself.</p>
<p>It seems as if God did not see the Roman Empire persecuting the church in the second century. The Roman Empire used every conceivable means to afflict and slaughter Christians, but God did not stretch forth His hand to stop it; rather, He hid Himself. However, a century later the Roman Empire was divided and eventually disappeared. In contrast, the believers of Christ have remained and have spread to various places because of the true and living God.</p>
<p>Sometimes it seems as if God is not in our situation, and it seems as if we love and fear Him in vain. But time proves that He is the living God. When it is time, He will make all things manifest. It is not vain to believe in Him, trust in Him, fear Him, or love Him.</p>
<p>Even though Joseph feared and trusted in God, he was hated by his brothers, sold in Egypt, and became a servant in the house of Potiphar, the captain of the guard (Gen. 37:2-36). Because Joseph kept himself pure before God and would not sin against God, he was resented by his master&rsquo;s wife and unjustly put into prison (39:7-20; 40:15). Eventually, God manifested Joseph&rsquo;s purity, obedience to God, fear of God, and unwillingness to sin against God. King Nebuchadnezzar is a different example. His heart was lifted up, and he conducted himself in pride and conceit. Then one day God came to make all things manifest. Nebuchadnezzar was deposed from his royal throne, and his glory was taken away from him; he was driven from among mankind, and his dwelling place was with the beasts of the field; he was made to eat grass like a bull, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven. This was his condition until he came to know that God the Most High is the Ruler over the kingdom of men and sets whomever He wills over the earthly kingdoms (Dan. 4:19-37; 5:20-21).</p>
<p>God is a God who hides Himself, and He is also the living God. There may be occasions when it seems like He does not exist, but time will prove that He is the living God. Temporary trials are but a process, not the final goal. God will make all things manifest in His time. Whether our situations are difficult or easy, we must always fear God, because He will make all things manifest one day. God is not mocked; hence, we must fear Him.</p>
<p>It is a blessing to believe in the living God. He is our life and our all; hence, we have set our hope in Him. He is a God who hides Himself, but He is also a God who makes all things manifest. No wonder the psalmist says, &ldquo;My soul thirsts for God, / For the living God... / The salvation of my countenance&rdquo; (Psa. 42:2, 11). The living God is awesome to those who mock Him. There is nothing that He does not search. There are no hidden thoughts, secret intentions, or dark deeds that He will not make manifest. Let me repeat, God is not mocked. Our God is a consuming fire, and it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God (Heb. 12:29; 10:31). May we live in Him and let Him live in us. May we also daily learn to trust in Him, wait on Him, love Him, obey His shining, accept His dealing, and walk before Him.</p>
