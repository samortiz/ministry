   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a In Tribulation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today the kingdom in Jesus is a kingdom of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Matthew 5:10-12 the Lord Jesus said that His believers suffer persecution for the sake of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we suffer for the sake of righteousness, we are in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Suffering persecution for the kingdom proves that we are in the kingdom today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more we are in the kingdom, the more we shall suffer and be persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, for us to be in the kingdom today is not a matter of glory but a matter of bearing shame and suffering persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although we are joint partakers in the kingdom in Jesus, we are not yet co-kings with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, we shall be His co-kings in the kingdom in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That will be the time for glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today, however, is not a reigning day but a suffering day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we are not in the reigning kingdom but in the suffering kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because the kingdom today is a matter of suffering, of tribulation, in Acts 14:22 Paul and Barnabas told the disciples that "through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The tribulation mentioned here was mainly the persecution at the hands of the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All believers in Christ undergo persecution from religion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there were no religion in the world today, we would not suffer as much persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Much of the trouble, persecution, and opposition can be traced to one source religion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While we are suffering today, we are in the kingdom where we are being exercised, trained, prepared, and qualified to reign in Christ's kingdom as His co-kings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The kingdom of God was a main subject of the apostles' preaching in Acts 8:12; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not a material kingdom visible to human sight but a kingdom of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is the spreading of Christ as life to His believers to form a realm in which God rules in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The kingdom of God is actually Christ Himself Luke 17:21 as the seed of life sown into His believers Mark 4:3,26 and developing into a realm in which God may rule as His kingdom in His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To enter into the kingdom of God is to enter into the full enjoyment of Christ as the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the whole world opposes the entering of God's people into the full enjoyment of Christ as the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Throughout the centuries, religion in particular has been used by God's enemy to keep God's people from entering into the full enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ as the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this reason, it is through many tribulations that we enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should expect opposition and be prepared for it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through tribulation we must endeavor to enter into the realm of the full enjoyment of the resurrected and ascended Christ as the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we have the enjoyment of such a Christ, we shall be under the divine rule.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we shall become the kingdom of God today, and this kingdom is the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The kingdom of God is the church life, and the church life is a realm of the enjoyment of the resurrected and ascended Christ. b In Endurance</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We partake in the kingdom not only in tribulation but also in endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Revelation 1:9 John says that he was a joint partaker in endurance in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For both tribulation and the kingdom we need endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not have endurance, we shall be able to withstand persecution only for a limited time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we live in Christ, we partake not only of His life and holiness but also of His endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we abide in Christ, we partake of His endurance and have the endurance to bear suffering and opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord's word is even called the word of endurance Rev 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The world is opposing and rejecting the Lord Jesus, but He does not fight back.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He simply endures it all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now as we have fellowship with Him and abide in Him, we partake of His endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As His followers, we should follow Him with endurance Heb 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this way we can endure persecution and opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This endurance is a strong indication that we are those waiting for the Lord's coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We wait for His coming back by being joint partakers in His kingdom, tribulation, and endurance.</S>
