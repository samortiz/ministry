   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, God had to preserve his body.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I want to be there to see this take place, to execute the word, and to see Michael act upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I hope that many of us will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>III.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>out of Heaven to Earth</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 9 says, And the great dragon was cast out, the ancient serpent, he who is called the Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole inhabited earth; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We see here that the dragon and his angels will be cast down to the earth.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At that time, the shaft of the abyss will be opened and demon-possessed locusts will emerge from it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have already pointed out that these locusts will torment men for five months.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Recall that the fifth trumpet will mark the beginning of the last three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After Satan, the heavenly star, has been cast down to earth, his time will be very short, only three and a half years.</S>
