[1]  You could say that everyone in the world can live according to at least three principles: they can live by sin, or they can live by right and wrong, or they can live by life.
[2]  If we would consider a little, we would see that some people live according to the principle of right and wrong or good and evil.
[3]  If our conduct is controlled by the principle of right and wrong, then we ask if something is right or wrong whenever we have to make a decision.
[4]  When we feel right inwardly, when we feel the life inside of us moving, when we are strong within and sense the anointing, we know that we have life.
[5]  People may say that many things are right to do, and I may feel that to do them is right, but what does the sense of the inner life tell us?
[6]  THE STANDARD OF LIFE IS HIGHER THAN THE STANDARD OF GOOD
[7]  Once this matter is resolved, we can see that we must not only avoid all that is evil but also all that is merely good.
[8]  We can see that there are evil things, good things, and things of life.
[9]  We are not saying that Christians should only do things that are good and things that are of life.
[10]  Since I was pursuing right and wrong, I wanted to be clear about what was right and what was wrong in each matter before I did anything.
[11]  His only excuse was that he was two years older than I. I could argue with any other reason, but I could not argue with the fact that he was two years older than I. I could not get around this argument, but inwardly I did not agree with him.
[12]  From then on I began to ask myself if the life I lived before God was according to the principle of life or the principle of what I considered right and wrong.
[13]  The greatest error among God's children is that many people determine right and wrong by what they see.
[14]  I recall a story of two brothers, both Christians, who had a rice paddy.
[15]  If we read God's Word clearly, we will see that it is wrong to decide matters by the principle of right and wrong or to live, act, and have our being according to our self-life.
[16]  Even though we have convinced ourselves that we are right, this is not a matter of right or wrong.
[17]  When the life does not rise up and we cannot sense the anointing in our being, we should not care whether we are acting according to right or wrong.
