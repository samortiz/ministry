   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY-NINE THE GOLDEN INCENSE ALTAR 3 Scripture Reading: Exo 30:6-10; 40:5, 26-27; Psa 84:3; 141:2; Rev 8:3-6; Exo 30:26-28</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am quite burdened concerning the incense altar because some of the points related to it are rather new to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus, it will take time for us to enter into the depths of the truth with respect to the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to pay attention to the fact that the incense altar was in the center of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was not outside the tabernacle, and it was not in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you consult the diagram of the tabernacle with the outer court printed in message one hundred forty-seven, you will see that the incense altar was in the center of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE INCARNATED GOD</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Regarding the tabernacle, John 1:14 says, And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to John 1:1, the Word that became flesh is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, we have God, the Word, and the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This tabernacle was Jesus, and Jesus is the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Word became flesh, and this flesh is the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By this we see that the tabernacle is actually the incarnated God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In other words, Jesus is the incarnated God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The incarnated God is available to be contacted by us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not only can we contact Him; we can also enter into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that we can have a tour of the tabernacle and enjoy its contents.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we consider the tabernacle in Exodus, we need to be impressed that it signifies the incarnated God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is invisible, abstract, mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, as the tabernacle, the incarnated God, this invisible, abstract, and mysterious One, becomes real, practical, and concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He becomes touchable and, in a very real sense, visible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this reason, 1 John 1:1 says, That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld, and our hands handled concerning the Word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here we see that the Apostle John touched the incarnated God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may even go on to say that the incarnated God is enterable.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, now He is not only visible and touchable He is also enterable.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>CHRIST AS THE OFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord came as the tabernacle, He also came as all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 1:29 says, Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Where did the Lamb of God take away the sin of the world?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He did this on the cross, which is signified by the altar of burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As the Lamb of God, Christ is the offerings offered on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, He is both the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is both the incarnated God into whom we may enter, and He is also the offerings that are good for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The eating of the offerings is quite unusual because the goal of this eating is that we enter the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we had only the tabernacle without the offerings, in particular without the sin offering and the trespass offering, we would not have the means by which to come into God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The means by which we are qualified to enter into the tabernacle, into the incarnated God, is Christ as the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the reason He says, I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Apart from Christ, we have no way to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we did not have Christ as the offerings, the tabernacle might still be present, but we would not have a way to enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you think you are qualified to enter into the tabernacle, to come into the incarnated God?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all are sinful, unclean, and full of trespasses.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because this is our condition, we are under God s condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we tried to come into the tabernacle, we would die.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What, then, is the entrance to the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is the way by which we may enter?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The entrance, the way, is Christ as the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Without the burnt offering altar and the offerings, we would not have a way to enter into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the reason the book of Hebrews speaks of a new way consecrated for us: Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh 10:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The blood of the offerings shed on the altar opens the way for us to enter into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This was the blood shed by Christ on the cross when He was crucified as our sin offering and trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because His blood opens the way, it becomes the means by which we are qualified to enter into God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, when we enter into the tabernacle, we should not be empty within.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rather, we have something to fill us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We not only offer the sacrifices to God, but after offering them, we may have a portion of them to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, we have the blood outwardly and the food, the meat of the offerings, inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The blood of the sacrifice without opens the way for us to enter into God, and the meat fills us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are not hungry when we come into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No, we are those who have been fully satisfied.</S>
