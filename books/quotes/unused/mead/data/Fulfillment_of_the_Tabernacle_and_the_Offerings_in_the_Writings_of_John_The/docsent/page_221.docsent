   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SIGN OF THE LORD'S SENDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The last sign in this chapter is that of the Lord's sending of His disciples v. 21 . As we have already indicated, this signifies that His commission to the disciples is like the Father's commission to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we consider this matter carefully, we shall realize that it is a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God came to man in the way of being in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, when the Son came, God the Father came in the Son and with the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now, through death and resurrection, the Son has been multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Son sends the disciples as the Father sent Him by being in them to be one with them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the disciples are one with the Son and also one with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do you know what the church is?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church is the sent ones meeting with the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever we meet, we have the Son and the Father within us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Wherever we go, the Son and the Father go with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we see this, we shall have assurance and confidence, and this assurance and confidence will become our power and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Son is the embodiment of the Father, and we are the multiplication of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is what it means to be a Christian, one who believes in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christians are actually the multiplication of the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This sounds like a heavenly language.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever we come together in the church meetings, we need to have the realization that we, the believers, are the multiplication of the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such a realization will surely change our church life and cause our spirits to soar.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have seen that the first seventeen chapters of the Gospel of John present God living as a man among men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Chapters eighteen and nineteen present life passing through the process of death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now in chapters twenty and twenty-one we see resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This resurrection is the Spirit, the pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, in chapters one through seventeen, we have God; in chapters eighteen and nineteen, we have life; and in chapters twenty and twenty-one, we have the Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that in the Gospel of John we have God, life, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Chapters one through seventeen show us God living among men; chapters eighteen and nineteen, life passing through death; and chapters twenty and twenty-one, the Spirit, the pneuma, moving in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The moving of the Spirit in resurrection has not ceased; rather, it continues today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Concerning this, there is no end to the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This Gospel does not give us a record of the Lord's public ascension, as we have in Mark and Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the Gospel of John, the resurrected Christ breathed Himself into His disciples as the holy breath and now dwells in them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, this breath, this pneuma, is still moving in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Gospel of John reveals that God lived among men, that life passed through death, and that now the Spirit is moving in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do you know where we are today?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are in resurrection enjoying this pneuma as the multiplication of the embodiment of God, and this multiplication is the Lord's glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Praise the Lord for the marvelous revelation in chapter twenty of John!</S>
