<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRAYING TO BE STRENGTHENED IN SPIRIT</h1>
<p>I have a strong sense within that we have reached a new stage, and we need to have a turn.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING MORE INDIVIDUAL PRAYER</h2>
<p>During the past twelve years, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we have laid a foundation in the truth and received some training concerning coordination in the service. We have also advanced in the matters of the administration of the church and the shepherding of the saints. These are all necessary matters. However, we must admit that we do not exercise our spirit enough. Our situation can be compared to a person who is physically strong yet anemic. This does not mean that we were wrong or improper in the past and therefore need to be adjusted. We are saying that we must focus on strengthening our spirit.</p>
<p>We have spent a great deal of time to study the truth, we have developed the work, and the churches are spreading. These situations are proper. Nevertheless, we must admit that we lack the exercise of our spirit. As a result, our spirit is not strong, living, rich, or fresh. We seem to be proper and right, but we are very poor. If our spirit were strong and matched our knowledge of the truth, our coordination in service, our administration of the church, and our shepherding of the saints would have been greatly blessed. Hence, we must focus our attention on being strengthened in our spirit. We must spend more time to pray, not only individually but also corporately. We must exercise our spirit so that it will be strong, living, rich, and fresh.</p>
<p>Our only way is to pray more. This is the way to exercise our spirit. The more we pray, the more we enter into the divine light and are enlightened by the Lord to see our need to be purified and broken in a deeper way. Although we have consecrated ourselves to the Lord, when we enter into deeper fellowship with Him, we will sense that His requirements are deeper and stricter. Then we need a deeper consecration. Thus, our spirit will be strengthened and refreshed.</p>
<p>In the present stage of the work, the co-workers must focus on and aggressively pursue the exercise of the spirit. This is not merely to seek the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, although there will be the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. When we pray more in the Lord&rsquo;s presence and have more fellowship with Him, we will spontaneously experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and be empowered. However, the pursuit we are speaking of is much deeper than seeking the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Those who are working for the Lord must focus on the spirit; otherwise, the work will not have much spiritual worth, and the building will be merely a theory. At the most, we will have outward practices that will not cause the church to be built up. If we want the church to be built up practically, the co-workers must take the lead to exercise their spirit. May we spend more time in prayer to exercise our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE SAINTS TO PRAY MORE<br />
AND SUPPLYING THEM</h2>
<p>Besides focusing on exercising the spirit, we should also change the way that we work. In the past we stressed giving messages. We taught and helped the saints through the messages, but we rarely brought the saints back to their spirit through prayer. We cannot say that our practice was wrong, but it lacked the element of the spirit; hence, it was not easy for the saints to be strengthened. This can be compared to instructing a person to grow but not caring for the circulation of his blood. We need to focus on increasing the circulation of blood.</p>
<p>There must be a change in the way that we work. We need to lead the saints to their spirit through prayer rather than focusing on giving messages. In the meetings and in our personal contact with the saints, we must lead them to pray with us so that they can touch the Lord in their spirit and thereby receive the supply that will solve their problems. This will be more effective than trying to render help solely through messages.</p>
<p>If we want to lead the saints to pray, we must exercise to pray regularly. When our spirit is strong, living, and released, we will be able to enliven others&rsquo; spirit, fanning it into flame. Suppose our gospel preaching has little effect, and very few people are saved. This probably means that we only preach to people; we do not lead them to pray with their spirit in order to contact God. Regardless of how much we speak, if we do not lead a person to pray, he will not be saved. If we can lead him to pray so that he opens his heart and spirit to the Lord and calls on the name of the Lord from deep within, he will touch God, his spirit will be released, and he will be saved.</p>
<p>We should apply this principle to shepherding the saints. Besides ministering the word to them, we must pray with them. To spend twenty minutes to pray with a brother is more effective than merely speaking with him. However, if our spirit is dry, it will be useless to compel others to pray with us. Our spirit must be uplifted and released so that it comes forth once we open our mouth to pray. Then we can touch and enliven the saints through praying with them. At the same time, the Holy Spirit will flow through us as living channels into the saints, and they will receive the riches of the Spirit.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that we do not pray enough and that we rarely lead others to pray. As a result, although our work has been blessed by the Lord, few of the saints who have been gained spend sufficient time in prayer. The Lord has saved many, but few of them spend time in prayer. Many saints love the Lord, but they lack prayer. Many saints have been brought into the service, but they lack prayer. These examples are the result of the co-workers being short of prayer in the work. We do not spend sufficient time to pray, and the way that we work lacks prayer.</p>
<p>The co-workers must have a turn. They must learn to pray by exercising their spirit until their spirit is strong, uplifted, fresh, and released. Then we will be able to supply the saints so that their spirit can be released, and they can pray with an exercised spirit. When we lead the saints in this way, their problems will spontaneously be solved, they will be supplied, and they will also touch the source of grace. If we will always lead the saints to exercise their spirit in fellowship with God, their spirit will be living and fresh. Furthermore, they will release their spirit in the meetings.</p>
<p>We should not focus merely on giving messages. During the course of our speaking, we should pause and let the saints pray, and then we can continue the message. We must give the saints the opportunity to express what they have received in their spirit. After the message, we should give them an opportunity to express their inner feeling. In this way the message will penetrate their spirit, and they will receive spiritual help.</p>
