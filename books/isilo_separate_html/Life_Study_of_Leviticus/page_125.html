A PERSON DEFILED BY THE CARCASS OF ANY ANIMAL SHALL WASH HIS CLOTHES</h2><p>A person defiled by the carcass of an animal shall wash his clothes (Lev. 11:25, 28a, 40). This signifies that the defilement of death should be cleansed from our conduct in our daily life. Clothes signify our daily walk, our daily life. Our daily life should be washed from the defilement of death.<h2 class=head1>III. ANYTHING UPON WHICH THE CARCASS OF ANY ANIMAL FALLS IS UNCLEAN, AND ANYTHING THUS DEFILED SHALL BE WASHED IN WATER</h2><p>Anything upon which the carcass of any animal falls is unclean, and anything thus defiled shall be washed in water (v. 32). This signifies that the defilement of death should be cleansed away by the cleansing of the Spirit of life. The water in 11:32 signifies the Spirit of life. When we are defiled by touching death, we need to confess our sins and then pray ourselves into the Spirit. It is in the Spirit that our daily life, our daily walk, which has been defiled by death, will be cleansed.<h2 class=head1>IV. THE CARCASS OF ANY ANIMAL FALLING INTO AN EARTHEN VESSEL OR UPON AN OVEN OR A STOVE MAKES IT UNCLEAN, AND IT SHALL BE BROKEN</h2><p>The carcass of any animal falling into an earthen vessel or upon an oven or stove makes it unclean, and that vessel or oven or stove shall be broken (vv. 33, 35). This signifies that, like the vessel, our natural man, being defiled by death in our daily life, should be broken. The vessel in verse 33 signifies our natural man, our being, our self. Our natural man is a vessel. Once the vessel of our natural man has been defiled by death in our daily life, this vessel should be broken. Our natural man, our being, our self, which has been defiled by death, needs to be broken by the cross of Christ.<h2 class=head1>V. ANY FOOD IN THE EARTHEN VESSEL UPON WHICH WATER COMES AND ANY DRINK IN THE VESSEL SHALL BE MADE UNCLEAN BY THE FALLEN CARCASS</h2><p>Any food in the earthen vessel upon which water comes and any drink in the vessel shall be made unclean by the fallen carcass (v. 34). This signifies that a person who is touched by the earthly flow or mixed with it in his daily life is easily affected by the defilement of death. If we are worldly, it is easy for us to be defiled by anything of death.<h2 class=head1>VI. A SPRING OR A CISTERN HOLDING WATER SHALL REMAIN CLEAN</h2><p>A spring or a cistern holding water shall remain clean (v. 36a). This signifies that anything that has the flow of the living water, which washes away the defilement of death at any time, remains clean. The spring of living water signifies the Spirit, and the cistern of the living water signifies Christ, who holds the living water. As long as we have the spring and the cistern, the Spirit and Christ, in our daily life, we shall remain clean.<h2 class=head1>VII. IF ANY PART OF THE CARCASS OF AN ANIMAL FALLS ON ANY SEED FOR SOWING, THE SEED IS CLEAN</h2><p>If any part of the carcass of an animal falls on any seed for sowing, the seed is clean (v. 37). This signifies that anything that is living and possesses life that has the strength to resist defilement remains clean. The seed that has the life with the strength to resist defilement is a type of Christ.<h2 class=head1>VIII. THE CONCLUSION</h2><p>I would now like to add a conclusion to what we have covered in these two messages on chapter eleven of Leviticus.<h2 class=head2>A. Christ Is the Reality of Cleanness</h2><p>The matter of eating involves cleanness. This cleanness typifies the very Christ who is our content, life supply, and spiritual food. Christ is the real cleanness. He is the reality of cleanness.<h2 class=head2>B. Only Christ and All That Is out of Christ Are Clean for Our Food Supply</h2><p>Only Christ and that which is out of Christ are clean for our food supply. This only is what we should contact, eat, and receive.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_124.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_126.html">Next</a> </body></html>
