<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens. He therefore who will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 18:3-4).</p>
<p>Humbling oneself and being lowly are also conditions for entering the kingdom of the heavens. There are no proud or self-important people in the kingdom of the heavens; everyone in the kingdom willingly humbles himself like a little child. We must turn and become like little children: being humble, being simple, not being self-conscious, not looking at or thinking of ourselves, forgetting ourselves, not comparing ourselves with others or comparing others with ourselves, not regarding ourselves highly or desiring to be regarded highly, and not considering ourselves to be great or fighting to be great.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Leaving All to Follow the Lord</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You who have followed Me, in the restoration... shall sit on...thrones...And everyone who has left...for My name&rsquo;s sake...shall inherit eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 19:28-29).</p>
<p>These verses show that those who would enter into the kingdom of the heavens to sit on thrones and enjoy the blessing of eternal life therein must leave everything for the Lord&rsquo;s name&rsquo;s sake today and follow Him. We must leave all the enjoyment of the world in order to ascend to a throne in the kingdom of the heavens. We must leave behind all worldly riches in order to obtain the glory in the kingdom. If we would enter into the kingdom of the heavens, we must pay a price.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Enduring Sufferings and Tribulations</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;In Your kingdom...My cup you shall indeed drink&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 20:21, 23).</p>
<p>If we want to enter the kingdom of the heavens, we must be willing to drink the cup of His suffering today.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 14:22).</p>
<p>If we want to enter the kingdom, we must pass through many tribulations. Passing through tribulations is the pathway into the kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;That you may be accounted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which also you suffer&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 1:5).</p>
<p>If we want to obtain the kingdom, we must be willing to suffer. We must do so to be worthy of the kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 1:9).</p>
<p>If we want to partake of the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom, we must also partake of His tribulation. The world today rejects the Lord. Just as the worldly people persecuted the Lord, they also persecute His followers. We must partake of the Lord&rsquo;s tribulation today in order to obtain the kingdom with Him in the future.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Ready and Watchful</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast...Watch therefore&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 25:10, 13).</p>
<p>Only those who are ready when the Lord comes will be able to enter with Him into the kingdom to attend the wedding feast. In order to be ready, we must be watchful. Thus, being ready and watchful are conditions for entering the kingdom of the heavens. To be ready means that in order to meet the Lord, we must gain oil in our vessels by being filled with the Holy Spirit so that we may mature in life. To be watchful means that we are vigilant because we do not know when the Lord will come or when we will meet Him. Those who are not mature will not be worthy to enter into the kingdom to feast with the Lord. If we want to be ready by being mature, we must be watchful.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Faithful and Prudent</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Faithful and prudent&rdquo;; &ldquo;Good and faithful slave... I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:45; 25:21, 23; see also Luke 19:17).</p>
<p>If we want to enter the kingdom of the heavens to reign and enter into the Lord&rsquo;s joy in the future, we must be faithful and prudent to work for the Lord in this age. If we want to enter into the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom to rule and reign over the world in the future, we must pass the test of being faithful and prudent in the Lord&rsquo;s house today. Today is the time for preparation through testing, and the time for fulfillment is in the future. If we cannot be faithful and prudent today, we will not be so in the future. If we cannot do well and make the Lord happy today, neither will we in the future. Therefore, those who are not faithful and prudent today will not be qualified to enter the kingdom of the heavens to rule over the world in the future.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> </body></html>
