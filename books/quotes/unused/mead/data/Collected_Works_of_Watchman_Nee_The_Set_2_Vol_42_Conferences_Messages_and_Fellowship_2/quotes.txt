[2]  Volume 42 of The Collected Works contains two sections that include various messages given by Watchman Nee in 1936.
[3]  Having Loved His Own Who Were in the World,
[4]  If you do not love anyone in this world, you can allow many things to go unattended.
[5]  If I were close to death and I had many loved ones, the final thing that I would do would be to give them my will.
[6]  THE MEANING OF FOOT-WASHING The Feet Touching the Earth,
[7]  Now let us look at the meaning of foot-washing.
[8]  But as a businessman who spends three to six hours in your office doing many seemingly "proper" things you may not have lied or sinned at all , are you still as close to God in the evening as you were in the morning?
[9]  Now that you are clear about the significance of the feet, we have to go on to consider the meaning of defiled feet.
[10]  It is not wrong for the feet to be defiled; this is something that is inevitable.
[11]  We are not talking about sin, we are talking about the things that separate us from God, the things that tire us out spiritually.
[12]  Or we may be reading the Bible and know what we are reading, yet we may have no feeling about what we have read.
[13]  I still believe in the Lord, I still pray to the Lord, I still love Him, and I am still consecrated to Him.
[14]  Tonight I have a word specifically for the co-workers.
[15]  We have to know why God has put us in the world.
[16]  He has put us in the world so that our presence would create a hunger and thirst for righteousness in sinners, believers, and the world.
[17]  There must be an enigmatic freshness, power, nourishment, and supply within us that will drive others to seek after God by our presence.
[18]  Others should have a desire to seek after God as a result of meeting us and speaking to us.
[19]  If we always see others and communicate with them without creating a desire within them for God, it means that we have failed.
[20]  "If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them" v. 17 . I love what Brother Yu has said many times: "The Bible today is more precious than the Bible yesterday." May we have fresh spiritual experiences every day.
[21]  CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO THE NEW TESTAMENT PROPHET Date: October 14, 1936, morning
[22]  There are some minimum qualifications of a worker: 1 He must be a person living in the New Testament, and 2 he must be able to know God's will directly.
[23]  Without these two qualifications, a man is not qualified to work for God.
[24]  If you find yourself unable to give guidance to the brothers without the help of a prophet, and if you find yourself unable to know God's will or render help to the churches without the help of a prophet, you are not living in the New Testament.
[25]  If something happens and you have to write letters, send cables, or make long distance calls to consult others, then in reality, you are consulting the prophets and damaging the New Testament.
[26]  Before we were saved, we did not seek after God.
[27]  God gave us Christ in order that we might have eternal life; this is a work that was completed once for all.
[28]  If a man comes to the meeting today and he is the same way that he was before, he will not be of much use to the Lord.
[29]  If you ask questions such as who were the sons of God in Genesis 6, who was Cain's wife, or where will man go after he dies, you are treating spiritual matters as objects of curiosity.
[30]  They are not interested in how Christ becomes our life or how one can overcome sin.
[31]  If we are as indifferent toward God as we are today, we will be useless in His eyes.
[32]  Many people often say that they are not hungry.
[33]  If you are an experienced person and have received answers to prayers, God will use you to attract others to Himself.
[34]  Every time I have gained some spiritual experience, I have gained it because others have gained it already and I longed after it, not because I suddenly discovered something in my reading of the Word or in prayer.
[35]  If we, as workers of the Lord, do not have the power to attract others and if we can only give others teachings, we will not be of much use to the Lord.
[36]  Men may admire us and like us, but we have to ask if they have the desire for the life that we have before the Lord.
[37]  When the Lord draws men to Himself, He draws some through their mind, others through their emotion, and still others through their will.
[38]  In order for a saved and regenerated believer to live out the Lord's life, there are two steps that he has to take.
[39]  The first is believing, which is receiving the new life.
[40]  The second is consecrating himself, which means committing his outer man to the Lord to allow the new life within to be expressed.
[41]  Consecration is committing one's outer man to the Lord so that it will belong to the Lord in the same way that the inner man belongs to the Lord.
[42]  On the subject of knowing God's will, Paul said that we should not be foolish, but should understand what the will of the Lord is Eph 5:17 .
[43]  But even if one has a proper start, he still cannot know God's will if he does not have a proper continuation.
[44]  I do not mean consecrating yourself to Him to be a preacher, but consecrating yourself to Him to do His will.
[45]  You do not have to be concerned for what God's will is; you only have to consecrate yourself honestly to Him to do His will.
[46]  CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE ON ASSUMING HEADSHIP IN THE FAMILY Date: October 15, 1936, afternoon
[47]  Place: Amoy SALVATION BEING A MATTER OF THE HOUSEHOLD
[48]  God's selection has to do with a nation, and eternal life has to do with individuals, but salvation has to do with the household.
[49]  If we do not understand this, we cannot understand the meaning of Acts 16:31, which says, "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household."
[50]  Suppose you are the head of your house and you have believed in the Lord.
[51]  You may say that the head has believed in the Lord.
[52]  But in reality, more than just yourself have believed in the Lord; you have believed in the Lord on behalf of your whole household.
[53]  You can declare that your household is a household of believers and that God is the God of your house.
[54]  Some may ask, "Does this mean that after the head of a household has believed in the Lord, his whole household will be saved regardless of what each member does?"
[55]  The reason I am speaking on this subject this afternoon is to show the brothers that they are the head of their household, and that God wants them to bear the responsibility of their house.
[56]  We must not only be a good Christian, but must also be a good head.
[57]  Those who do not have a family should first have the qualifications for being the head.
[58]  Third, a person must pray much and ask God to give him strength.
[59]  Paul told the Corinthians that women should not speak in the meetings, and that they should ask their husbands at home if they wanted to learn anything 1 Cor 14:34-35 .
[60]  If you are not proper before the Lord, you will not be able to act as a head in a proper way.
[61]  DEALING WITH CHILDREN Choosing God for the Children, and
[62]  In a family, in addition to the wife, there is another group of people who are hard to deal with the children.
[63]  In the Bible, foot-washing does not just refer to humility or to the washing away of our ordinary sins.
[64]  His great love also constrains Him to wash our feet so that there will be no barrier between us and Him, and we can continually draw nigh to such a holy God and enjoy His fellowship.
[65]  "WHAT I AM DOING YOU DO NOT KNOW NOW,
[66]  The Lord was determined to wash the disciples' feet because He wanted the disciples to be in His presence all the time.
[67]  The Lord answered, "What I am doing you do not know now, but you will know after these things" vv.
[68]  If we are willing to obey and to allow the Lord to work on us even when we do not fully understand, we will eventually understand what He is doing.
[69]  In verse 14 the Lord said, "If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet."
[70]  God has not charged us to wash the whole body; He only charges us to wash the feet.
[71]  In southern Fukien, a few young brothers wanted to give up their jobs to work for the Lord.
[72]  I asked them what they would say to others when they went out, what kind of Christ they would present to others, and what and how much Christ had done for them.
[73]  I asked them to tell me how much knowledge they had of Christ and what kind of knowledge it was.
[74]  However, a real worker of the Lord does not rest his qualifications on eloquence or knowledge of Bible exposition but on his history and experience before the Lord and his knowledge of the Lord.
[75]  We claim that we know Christ, but when the Christ we know is preached, how much of Him do we still have within us?
[76]  Those who know Christ surely have a history of the knowledge of Christ.
[77]  If you do not have a history of the knowledge of Christ, you cannot say that you know Christ.
[78]  If you have to teach others about bearing the cross, can you relate to others the reality of bearing the cross?
[79]  If you have to speak to others about the power of resurrection, do you have the experience of the power of resurrection?
[80]  You can tell others about humility, but do you have the humility that is different from your natural disposition and that comes from the power of resurrection?
[81]  You may be able to speak about the doctrine of resurrection and ascension, but do you have a testimony that you are transcendent and untouched by the things of the earth?
[82]  If you do not know Christ, you are not qualified to be a witness of Christ.
[83]  If your experience of Christ is not deep enough, you are not qualified to be a worker of the Lord.
[84]  If we do not find sin in ourselves, and if all that we know is the doctrine of sin in the book of Romans, and then tell others to hate sin, deal with sin, and not live by the flesh, what good will this do?
[85]  Answer: God is Spirit, but this does not mean that all spirits are God.
[86]  This is like saying that Brother Luk is a man, but this does not mean that all men are Brother Luk.
[87]  CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE THE FLESH AND THE WORK OF GOD Date: October 17, 1936, morning
[88]  The Triune God has a triune enemy who frustrates His people from following Him.
[89]  Egypt typifies the world that binds us; it signifies the worldly living and everything that occupies us and causes us not to serve God.
[90]  THE GOOD PART OF THE FLESH The Wisdom of the Flesh
[91]  There are two aspects to the good part of the flesh.
[92]  Another passage that is in Romans 8 says, "Those who are in the flesh cannot please God" v. 8 . This verse does not say that the evil of the flesh does not please God.
[93]  Some have asked: "Why is it that some advance so quickly while others advance so slowly?
[94]  Apart from Him, we can only do things that we want to do, not the things that God wants us to do.
[95]  I am ashamed to admit that after I work, even though there are often good results and men receive help, I have to confess to the Lord because it is I, rather than God, who has been doing it.
[96]  God is leading us day by day to stop our work so that we will realize that we cannot accomplish God's work and that only God Himself can accomplish His work.
[97]  Place: In the dormitory, Kulangsu, Amoy A LIFE IN THE EMOTION VERSUS A LIFE IN THE SPIRIT
[98]  The Christian life should not have any period of spiritual coldness.
[99]  However, in order to teach us the function of faith and the will, in the practical experience of our spiritual life, God often allows spiritual depression to come to us.
[100]  When our faith is put to the test, the outward, burning sensations may be gone, but we should not be discouraged.
[101]  Question: What should we do when we are depressed in the meeting?
[102]  If your spirit is oppressed by some kind of burden, you will not be able to release others from a bound spirit.
[103]  If you are conducting a meeting, and you are pressed down by some burden, it will be impossible for you to set the spirit of the congregation free.
[104]  After we have passed through the gate of victory, we must continually abide in Christ.
[105]  Abiding is remaining, and abiding in Christ means that we remain in Christ.
[106]  To abide in Christ is to consider ourselves in Christ and not in ourselves.
[107]  We can only have the overcoming life when we are in Christ, and we can only continue to live an overcoming life when we are in Christ.
[108]  I hope that in the next few days, I can impress you deeply with the matter of being in Christ.
[109]  If there is not such a thing as being in Christ, there is not even Christianity, and there is certainly no redemption and salvation.
[110]  Everything that God has done is done in Christ and not in man.
[111]  Once you are born, you are born into this big Adam, and when you believe in the Lord and are regenerated, you are transferred into Christ.
[112]  How could the Lord die on our behalf and save us?
[113]  Individually speaking, we were saved when we believed in the Lord.
[114]  In Christ, God sees us as Christ, having the same experiences that Christ had.
[115]  Someone asked how we can be in Christ, and I answered, "If Watchman Nee, weighing only one hundred and fifty pounds, has the strength to put the chalk into the chalk box, is it too hard for God, who is the creator of the universe and millions of times stronger than me, to put us into Christ?"
[116]  But we do not know how we got into Christ, in the same way that the pieces of chalk are in the chalk box, but do not know how they got in. However, as long as the chalk is in the box, whatever happens to the box will happen to the chalk.
[117]  God can choose not to put us into Christ, but as soon as He puts us into Christ, He cannot withhold any spiritual blessings from us.
[118]  I do not have time to go into detail concerning the matter of being in Christ.
[119]  There are countless spiritual blessings in Christ such as holiness, victory, power, spirituality, faith, spiritual progress, humility, endurance, and love.
[120]  Every spiritual blessing that you can imagine is in Christ.
[121]  If you search within yourself to see whether or not there is holiness, I can tell you the answer right now you will find no goodness within.
[122]  But we often forget that God has saved us in Christ.
[123]  You wish you could overcome, and you begin to consider yourself to see whether you have endurance, humility, holiness, etc. Please remember that as soon as you look within, you will not find any endurance, humility, or holiness.
[124]  Man thinks that he has to do something before he can be saved, but God does not want us to do anything in order to be redeemed.
[125]  God does not do anything in man; He does everything in Christ.
[126]  SALVATION IN CHRIST The Principle Being the Same in Christ as in Adam
[127]  God's salvation works the same way as the free gift that Adam gave to us in making us sinners.
[128]  When we are in Christ, there is no need for us to make up our mind, do anything, or come up with anything to receive salvation.
[129]  As long as we are in Christ, everything of Christ becomes ours.
[130]  In the same way, I am good, righteous, and holy because I am in Christ and the life of Christ is in me.
[131]  Romans 8:1-2 says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.
[132]  For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death."
[133]  CHAPTER FORTY-THREE ABSOLUTE OBEDIENCE Date: October 19, 1936, morning
[134]  In Deuteronomy 25, God ordered the Israelites to blot out the memory of Amalek v. 19 . But in 1 Samuel 15, when the Israelites killed the Amalekites, they spared Agag the king of the Amalekites.
[135]  During the past two days, I have been considering one thing: God has to give us revelation.
[136]  If we do not have revelation from God to see His will, we will justify things according to our concepts.
[137]  As a consequence, we often do not hate what God hates and cannot sympathize with God.
[138]  If we have not dealt with this matter in a serious way before the Lord, we cannot engage ourselves in His work, because we are not qualified to do so.
[139]  If we have not seen the evil of the goodness of the flesh, we have not yet seen God's revelation, and we are still not clear concerning what is spiritual.
[140]  No. Not only were you without this realization, but you even boasted with a bold conscience that you were better than your neighbors and that there were few in this world who were as good as you.
[141]  If someone tells you now that you are without any sin, you will not dare agree with this because you have seen a little of what God sees.
[142]  Two things are outwardly similar but inwardly different: one is a thorough and inward realization of the corruption of the flesh, and the other is an outward and political performance.
[143]  One is of life, and the other is a matter of politics.
[144]  However, He did not do anything in us to accomplish His salvation; everything was done in Christ.
[145]  As long as we are in Christ, everything that Christ has accomplished will be realized in us.
[146]  It is God's work that we died in Christ.
[147]  Then she asked, "Mr. Nee, how can I really die? If I can be assured that I am really dead, I will be delivered from sin." I told her, "We died in Christ.
[148]  If you abide in Christ, you will be dead all the time, but as soon as you live in yourself, you will not be dead.
[149]  CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE THE INIQUITY OF THE SANCTUARY Date: October 20, 1936, morning
[150]  God's Word shows us that some sins are committed before man, while others are committed before God.
[151]  The result and worth of a work, whether or not it is spiritual and pleasing to God, depend not on the amount of work that has been done, but on how much of the work is initiated by ourselves and how much is initiated by God.
[152]  But I can testify that every time I read the New Testament, I feel as if I have never read it before, and every time I speak, I feel as if it is the first time I have ever spoken.
[153]  The advance of God's work can only be carried out by His power.
[154]  In order to accomplish God's will, not only must the beginning be of God, the process of carrying it out must also be according to His will.
[155]  During the past three evenings, we have seen the matter of being in Christ.
[156]  Last night we saw one thing that is accomplished in Christ death.
[157]  Christ has died on the cross, and those who are in Christ have also died.
[158]  Following this the Lord said, "But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!" v. 50 . The word "pressed" in Greek means "bound" and "confined." The Lord was saying that He came to release the life of God.
[159]  Paul mentioned Jews and Greeks in Galatians 3 because the Jews were a proud people.
[160]  If you were to give money to the poor among the Jews, they would not take it.
[161]  Since this is the case, what should our attitude be today?
[162]  This verse says that we should reckon ourselves dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus.
[163]  If the words "in Christ Jesus" were taken away from this verse, there would not be any Christian faith.
[164]  I have read Romans 6:11 many times and have spoken on it many times, but often I forget the words "in Christ."
[165]  If we are not in Christ, we can never reckon ourselves dead, and we cannot die.
[166]  When temptations come and Satan tells us that we are still living in ourselves and that we have not died, we should say to him that we are no longer in ourselves, that we are in Christ, and that we are alive unto God in Christ.
[167]  First, we spoke on the life and nature of two great communities the community of Adam and the community of Christ.
[168]  Next, we saw that we need to move out of the community of Adam and into the community of Christ.
[169]  A Christian is one who is joined to Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit and who partakes of all that Christ has.
[170]  If an ordinary person like me, who is five feet eleven inches and one hundred forty pounds, has the power to do this, how much more power does God, the Creator of the universe, have in putting us into Christ?
[171]  The most important matter in the Bible is faith.
[172]  Perhaps the faith that we know of is not the faith that the Bible speaks about.
[173]  You may ask, "What should I believe now that you have told me to believe?"
[174]  Believing in God's Word means that when God says in His Word that certain things have been accomplished, we believe that they have been accomplished.
[175]  Dr. Wu asked: How can we love our enemies? Sometimes I treat a certain person well, but he is evil to me in return.
[176]  Question: What is the difference between submission and obedience?
[177]  Answer: Submission is a question of attitude, whereas obedience is a question of conduct.
[178]  If an unbelieving husband asks a believing wife to go to a dance with him, the wife can say, "I wish I could go with you, but I am really sorry that I cannot."
[179]  CHAPTER FIFTY GOD'S WAY OF ACCOMPLISHING HIS PURPOSE IN CREATING MAN 1 Date: December 13, 1936, evening
[180]  Beginning from tonight we will study God's purpose in man in a systematic way and show how He accomplishes such a purpose.
[181]  God's Word shows us that His purpose is to have many sons, that is, a group of men who will have the life of His Son Heb 2:10 .
[182]  God's purpose in preparing the garden of Eden and putting man in it was not that man would merely be a gardener, but that he would eat the tree of life and receive His life.
[183]  God created man's body from the dust of the earth so that man would be able to contact the physical world.
[184]  After His creation He breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life, which gave man his spirit.
[185]  After man was created, God placed the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the midst of the garden of Eden, and He charged Adam not to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[186]  But God did not force Adam to eat of the tree of life because He created man with a free will with a right to choose for himself.
[187]  God's purpose was not fulfilled after the creation of Adam, because Adam did not have the life of God.
[188]  We have seen that God's purpose in creating man is that man would receive His life and become His sons.
[189]  As far as his outward appearance is concerned, man is like God already.
[190]  Man is like God in both image and likeness, yet he does not have God's life within him.
[191]  Originally, God only had to do one thing cause Adam to receive the life of God.
[192]  If man would have received God's life, His goal in creating man would have been fulfilled.
[193]  God wants man to live out His life in order for man to speak what he could not otherwise speak, to do what he could not otherwise do, and to live in a way that he could not otherwise live.
[194]  Until we reach this point, we are at best like Adam in the garden of Eden; we are not yet men according to His will and not yet sons of God.
[195]  Thank God that through the redemption of Christ, our sins have been dealt with.
[196]  However, settling the problem of sin was only the first step in God's work.
[197]  If we see what God accomplished in eternity, we will realize that the removal of sin is only a remedial action; there is still a long way to go.
[198]  This means that after we eat the flesh of Christ, God lives in us.
[199]  We must not only receive the redemption of the blood of Christ for our forgiveness, but must eat the flesh of Christ in order to have His life.
[200]  In John 6:51 through 58, the Lord did not emphasize His blood, but instead, His flesh, because His flesh accomplished what the tree of life did not accomplish.
[201]  From the time man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and was driven out of the garden of Eden by God, he lost his chance to receive God's life.
[202]  Therefore, God had to deal with him not only as a man, but also as a sinner.
[203]  THE BIBLICAL TEACHING CONCERNING THE BLOOD In the Old Testament
[204]  Let us now spend some time to study the Bible and see what it says about the blood.
[205]  Leviticus 17:11 says, "For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make propitiation for your souls; for it is the blood which, by the life, makes propitiation."
[206]  In Romans 3:25 the apostle Paul said, "Whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred."
[207]  It was perfectly all right for God not to send His Son to die for us; this would merely have meant that God was not being gracious to us.
[208]  After man fell, a twofold problem emerged: the sins of man and the man of sin.
[209]  In God's way of salvation, the sins of man are dealt with by the blood, but the man of sin is too wicked.
[210]  God's salvation must 1 remove our sins, 2 deal with our old man, and 3 give us a new man, which means that His Son, Christ, has to live within us.
[211]  In fact, once God's Son lives within man, it will be as easy for man to live His life as it was for Him to live His own life on the earth.
[212]  Some may ask, "Christ was crucified two thousand years ago.
[213]  First, we must realize that God never asks us to consider ourselves crucified.
[214]  Not a single verse in all of these chapters says that we have to view our crucifixion with Christ through the eyes of our old man.
[215]  Christ is the second man; we live in Christ, we are saved in Christ, we are forgiven in Christ, and we are crucified together in Christ.
[216]  CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR THE LIFE-RELEASING DEATH OF CHRIST Date: December 17, 1936, evening
[217]  There are three aspects of the death of Christ.
[218]  There is the aspect of His substitution for us, the aspect of His identification with us, and the aspect of His releasing His life for us.
[219]  We do not have any part in the shedding of His blood, but we can have a part in His cross, because when the Lord went to the cross, He brought us along with Him.
[220]  The Bible says that we have been crucified with Christ, but it does not say that we have participated in the shedding of His blood.
[221]  We cannot say that we have a part in the shedding of Christ's blood, but we can definitely say that we have been crucified with Him on the cross.
[222]  We have to read John 14:16-20: "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.
[223]  I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.
[224]  Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.
[225]  In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."
[226]  In Acts 2 the apostle Peter quoted the last verse of Joel 2, saying, "And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved" v. 21 . Paul even said that the Lord is near us, in our mouth and in our heart Rom 10:8 . Please remember that the Lord can be such because He is in the Spirit.
[227]  They think that it would be wonderful if they had been born two thousand years ago because they could have seen Jesus.
[228]  But I tell such ones that I would not exchange places with Peter even if I could.
[229]  Although I am quite insignificant, I can say humbly that I know much more than Peter.
[230]  Romans 8 tells us clearly that those who do not have the Spirit of Christ have nothing to do with Christ v. 9 . Who are the sons of God? They are those who have become God's many sons through His unique begotten Son.
[231]  CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE MAN-MADE VICTORY Date: December 18, 1936, evening
[232]  God sent Christ to accomplish the work of redemption on the one hand, and to dispense to us His own life on the other hand.
[233]  Many Christians realize that they are not living the life that God has ordained for them.
[234]  The fourth way to deal with sin is by making resolutions and bridling oneself.
[235]  One makes up his mind and vows to do such and such a thing.
[236]  Paul showed us clearly in Romans 7 that to will is present with us, but to work out the good is not v. 18 . God allows us to make resolutions again and again and to fail again and again in order to show us that we cannot overcome.
[237]  His shout of victory, "Thanks be to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord!" v. 25 , follows his declaration, "Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?" v. 24 . If we sin to the extent that we can do nothing but groan about it, we are close to deliverance.
[238]  OF THE OVERCOMING LIFE Date: December 19, 1936, evening
[239]  Even God cannot do anything with us when we try to overcome by ourselves.
[240]  Paul did not say that he wanted to be like Christ, that he had to trust in Christ, or that he had to trust in His power, that he had to imitate Christ, or that he had to take Christ as his pattern.
[241]  I answered, "No. I cannot ask God to make you overcome; God will not make you overcome, He will only make you fail.
[242]  Because the Lord lives in us, He overcomes for us.
[243]  He has given us Christ to be our life.
[244]  Last year in Shanghai a Western missionary working for a mission came to me and told me of a person sent by the mission board to work at a school.
[245]  The man had been in Shanghai for six years already, and no teacher or student in the school could get along with him.
[246]  Another characteristic of the overcoming life is that it is obtained and not attained.
[247]  You can only obtain the overcoming life; you cannot attain the overcoming life.
[248]  Let us look at 1 Corinthians 15:57: "But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
[249]  The Lord does not want you to be an ordinary person; He wants you to live a life that God lives, to speak what no man can speak, to do what no man can do, to experience what no man can experience, and to face what no man can face.
[250]  THE SECTIONS OF EPHESIANS Date: December 20, 1936, morning
[251]  If you still say that you cannot make it, it is not because you cannot make it, but because you choose not make it.
[252]  Ephesians 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ."
[253]  Ephesians 4:1 says that since we are called, we should "walk" worthily of this calling.
[254]  The overcoming life is just Christ; it is Christ living in us.
[255]  Victory is not receiving some kind of power to be humble or to be free from anxiety; it is having the Lord within us becoming our humility and freeing us from anxiety.
[256]  The young man said, "All these things I have kept from my youth" v. 21 . When the Lord heard this, He said, "Still you lack one thing: all that you have, sell and distribute to the poor" v. 22 . When the young ruler heard this, he left in sorrow.
[257]  The Lord Jesus told the young man to sell everything and distribute the money to the poor.
[258]  The Lord did not ask the aged Zaccheus to give away any of his money, yet he gave away a great sum all at once.
[259]  The young man was the best illustration of the first part of that verse "impossible with men," and Zaccheus was the best illustration of the second part of the verse "possible with God."
[260]  We know that Christ is our victory, but in order to experience Christ as our victory, we have to fulfill one condition we must first see that we cannot make it.
[261]  If we constantly say in our hearts that we can make it, Christ will not be able to live for us; He will not be able to overcome for us, and He will not make it for us.
[262]  Overcoming means to stop acting, to stop managing, to ignore, and to cease our own activities.
[263]  It is forgetting about ourselves and committing everything to God.
[264]  We have to say to the Lord, "I commit everything to You.
[265]  From now on, I do not care if I am good or bad."
[266]  But if I serve you a cup of tea, but do not let go of the cup, you cannot pick it up.
[267]  We have seen that there are simple conditions for a person to have the Lord live in him, that is, to experience the overcoming life.
[268]  All he has to do is resign, quit, yield, let go, and let Christ take over.
[269]  Putting it more accurately, we have to believe that the Lord is living in us, that we have uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord, that we have a sustained prayer life, that we are obedient to God, and that we have the power to overcome sin.
[270]  A brother once asked, "If I let go today, but cannot let go tomorrow, what will happen to me?"
[271]  I said, "You can go to the Lord and say, Lord, I cannot let go, and I will not try to let go.
[272]  If you find that you cannot believe, you can say to the Lord, I cannot believe, and I will not try to believe.
[273]  There is not a single weakness in us that is so severe that it can frustrate God.
[274]  After we pass the gate of victory, day by day we will find the Lord overcoming the sins that we could not otherwise overcome.
[275]  We have to believe that just as we sinned without effort or resolutions when we were in Adam and joined to him, we can live out the patience of Christ and express His holiness without effort or resolutions now that we are in Christ and are joined to Him.
[276]  Every morning when we wake up, we have to believe that God will deliver us from temptations that we do not even have a chance to think about.
[277]  He prayed that the Father would not bring us into temptation v. 13 . We also have to pray like the Lord, saying, "Lord, do not bring me into the sudden temptations." If we do this, we will see the Lord's deliverance.
[278]  Sometimes you encounter not only temptations, but also trials.
[279]  Suppose a sister's husband persecutes her and does not allow her to come to the meetings.
[280]  If every day we acknowledge before the Lord that we cannot make it, that we will not try to make it, and that only God can make it, and if every day we believe that God lives in us to be our victory, we will advance continually.
[281]  CHAPTER SIXTY TAKING UP OUR CROSS Date: December 22, 1936, evening
[282]  God's intention in creating man was not only for man to multiply and replenish the earth, but for God to have sons, that is, for Him to have a group of men who would have His life.
[283]  On the positive side, he lacks something God's life.
[284]  As long as you do not have the life of Christ, you have nothing to do with God.
[285]  I have over ten friends who invited me once to a feast at the ancestral hall of a Chen clan, but because my last name is not Chen, I could not participate in the fellowship of that ancestral hall.
[286]  As long as you are a man, you are alienated from the life of God.
[287]  When God crucified you on the cross with Christ, He crucified the old man; He did not crucify you as a man on the cross.
[288]  The Lord wants us to take up our cross daily because He wants to cut off our soul-life with the cross.
[289]  If we ignore ourselves and allow others to misunderstand us, and if we do not justify ourselves even when we have the chance, our capacity will be increased and God's life will become manifest.
[290]  If we do not have any opinion of our own, if others find it easy to take advantage of us, and if we do not fret while we are being taken advantage of, thanking and praising the Lord instead, we are bearing the cross.
[291]  We want to concentrate our fellowship this time on the following things: 1 the nature of our testimony, 2 God's will in the Bible concerning the ground of the church, the responsibility of the workers, the local assemblies, the responsibility of the local brothers, and the responsibility of the elders, and 3 the work in Foochow and the question of the co-workers.
[292]  Place: Foochow, Brother Nee's mother's home A NARRATION OF HISTORY
[293]  In 1921 Brother Leland Wang and I were being raised up by the Lord together.
[294]  First, we have to receive all those who are redeemed by the blood, even the weak ones.
[295]  As long as a person has not committed any sin worthy of excommunication, we have to receive him.
[296]  But if we catch a Chinese, we cannot put him out; we have to receive him.
