   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Considering That We Are Not So Useful</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some saints have a real desire to serve the Lord, but they have a sense within that they are not so useful.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They may be burdened to learn how to take care of people and bear remaining fruit, but they consider themselves not to be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not believe that we are not so useful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must learn to stand against our feeling and tell ourselves that we are useful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must say it every day and whenever we go out.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must declare it even when we are contacting the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must learn to say with our strong will that we are so useful!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must tell Satan, the angels, and all the universe that we are useful.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not Indecisive</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are other saints who have an indecisive character.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is difficult for them to make any decision.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may be a person born with this kind of character and built up this way for years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As I have mentioned before in other messages, our character is derived thirty percent by birth, and seventy percent is built up by our habits and environment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>LIFE, TRUTH, GOSPEL, AND CHARACTER</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This full-time training will first of all help us to know the divine truths according to the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second, it will enable us to grow in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It will help us to seek after Christ, obtain more of Him, experience Him more, and enjoy Him more.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The training will also afford us the help to behave, act, and live as New Testament priests.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>New Testament priests are priests of the gospel Rom 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They minister Christ into sinners in order to make them living sacrifices to God to be offered to God Rom 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fourth matter that we will stress in this training is the perfecting and building up of a proper character.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our character must be dealt with thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must pay our full attention to these four things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A PROPER PRAYER LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this message I want to stress one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must have a proper prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first thing that everyone who wants to serve the Lord must learn is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This does not mean to pray a little bit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I, with the help from some of the brothers in Taipei, have recently put out a publication to enable the saints to benefit much by staying ten minutes with the Lord in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That is what we call the morning revival.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually, ten minutes is not so adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ten minutes is not sufficient to take a proper breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It takes at least twenty minutes to eat a proper breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Otherwise, we could only have enough time to drink a cup of coffee and eat a donut.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Most saints cannot afford twenty minutes in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, ten minutes is still better than nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we are learning to serve the Lord full-time and have dedicated ourselves to this, we now have at least four and a half months.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We cannot say that we do not have time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have a lot of time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the present schedule, every day there are at least five occasions for us to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although there are three occasions before noon and two in the afternoon, we may not pray during these five times.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Spiritually speaking, we must pray according to our spiritual burden.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is right, but it may be just a kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In practice, however, if we pray merely according to our burden, we will not have that much burden.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The burden for prayer comes to us through our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more we pray, the more burden we have.</S>
