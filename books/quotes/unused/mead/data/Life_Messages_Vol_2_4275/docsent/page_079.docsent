   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S LONGING TO BE JOINED TO MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do not think that God wants you to bow before Him, as though He were an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He does not want you to think of Him as being on a lofty throne.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He wants to get off His throne and be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even if you live in a most humble abode, He wants to be there too, because you are there.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He wants to be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is tired of being in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not think I am going too far.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Isaiah 66:1-2 says, "Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the Lord: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In these verses the Lord indicates that He has been sitting on His throne and seems to be tired of it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He has been putting His feet on the footstool and has had enough of that.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Where, He asks, is the place for Him to rest?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He answers His own question by saying that He finds His home in those who are of a poor and contrite spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He desires to rest in man rather than remain in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His rest comes when He is in those with a poor and contrite spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>TRADITIONAL WORSHIP VERSUS WORSHIP IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who worship idols do so by bowing down before them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But idols are false gods, made of clay or wood, or at best gold.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are not spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our God, in contrast to them, is Spirit; He can come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not treat God like an idol, by bowing down before Him; that is not the way He wants to be worshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose there is a delicious drink on the table, containing all the ingredients it needs to taste just right.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead of drinking it, you bow before it and pay homage to it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The glass would say, "Foolish one!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why are you kneeling there?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you leave me on the table, we both suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Stand up!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Pick me up and drink me!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Drink me!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the relationship God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I know you find this hard to believe because of the way you have been brought up.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I was raised in a Christian family and taught to worship in a traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I might run around and be noisy outside a church building, but once I stepped inside I would be reverent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I would walk in slowly and quietly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I would sit down, bow my head, and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such is the so-called worship.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I practiced that from my boyhood until I was almost twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But I never touched God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One day, however, I heard a gospel message.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While I was walking home that afternoon, that message was working in me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I was not bowing before God, but right then I took that glass and drank it!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do you think I am talking wildly to say that I drank God?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Consider the conversation the Lord Jesus had with the Samaritan woman in John 4.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He sat by that well, waiting for that thirsty woman to come.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She was the one whose thirst needed to be quenched; the Lord asked her to give Him a drink just to make her aware of this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everyone who wants to drink of the Lord Jesus has to deal with the matter of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Samaritan woman asked Him for the water, He raised this issue by telling her to come back with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The mention of a husband touched the sinful life she was leading; if she wanted to drink the living water, she had to confess her sins.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Her reply was to switch the subject to the matter of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then the Lord told her that the real worship to God was to worship Him as the Spirit in our spirit 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do you see that the Lord Jesus was there at that well for her to drink of Him?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He told her, "Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever" 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This water was simply Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He was there before her as a drink.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why would she talk to Him about worship?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He was no longer on the throne in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now He was on earth, offering Himself to her, not to be worshipped but to be taken into her as a drink.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>John 4:14 and 24 strongly show us that to drink of Christ as the living water is the real worship to God as the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
