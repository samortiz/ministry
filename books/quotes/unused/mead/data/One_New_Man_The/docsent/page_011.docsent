   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE CHRIST AND THE ONENESS OF THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Eph 2:14-15; 4:22-24; Col 3:10-11; John 19:19-22 A FURTHER WORD CONCERNING THE FOUR MAJOR EVENTS OF HISTORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Throughout all the centuries, God has been sovereign over human culture on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The history of the human race is divided by the birth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before Christ there were four thousand years, and after Christ until now there have been almost two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The incarnation of God in humanity became the very dividing line of human history.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although we can see God's sovereignty over human culture in the first four thousand years, it is even more apparent in these last two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's Sovereignty for the Formation and Spread of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The rise of the Roman Empire was not an accident; it was sovereignly arranged by God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only about thirty years before Christ was born, the Roman Empire was founded.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Roman Empire not only prepared the way for the spreading of the gospel, but it also helped in the formation of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The gospel was formed and accomplished by Christ's death, and Christ's death was through the crucifixion carried out by the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way the Roman Empire was used by God, not only for the spreading of the gospel, but also for the formation of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The professors in the universities know the historical facts, but they may not have this heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to have the heavenly sight with which to see human history, not from the human point of view but from the divine point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Western culture is composed and constituted with three elements: the Hebrew religion, the Greek culture and philosophy, and the Roman politics and law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Pilate was executing the Lord Jesus by crucifying Him, he wrote a title above the cross in three languages in Hebrew, representing the Hebrew religion; in Greek, representing the Greek philosophy, the Greek culture; and in Latin, representing Roman government, Roman politics, and Roman law John 19:19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This signifies that the combined western culture helped in the formation of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That these three languages were used together shows that the Roman Empire had been unified.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It had unified the Jewish world, the Greek world, and the Roman world altogether into one empire.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The known world first included Mesopotamia, the river culture, before the time of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Abraham was called and moved to Canaan on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea, culture went on from the two rivers to the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This may be called the sea culture.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then the Greeks came and under Alexander the Great invaded Palestine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later, Julius Caesar conquered all the nations around the great sea and prepared the way for the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jesus was born under the reign of the grandnephew and adopted son of Caesar Augustus Luke 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was through God's sovereignty that the Roman Empire was prepared for the purpose of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Firstly, God used the Roman Empire in the formation of the gospel, and afterwards, God used the Roman Empire for the spreading of the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Within less than a half century the gospel was spread to "every nation under heaven" Acts 2:5 , the countries around the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By the formation and propagation of the gospel the church was brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even after the decline of the church, it still had its center in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rome was the center of the "gospel world."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although the Roman Empire was actually against God, it was unknowingly used by God for the formation and spreading of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to thank God for the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need the heavenly view to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Reformation and the Discovery of the New Land</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Following the formation and spread of the gospel, the church declined until it fell into the Dark Ages.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, God was sovereign over two great events the reformation of the church and the discovery of the new land.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These should be considered as the second major step in the history of the last two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These events first served to liberate the human mentality which had been imprisoned under Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Second, it was through these two accomplishments that the European culture was carried to other continents, including America and Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, this culture was too much related to Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The spreading of the European culture was very much under the influence of Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the reason why the Central and South American countries are primarily Catholic.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Wherever Catholicism went, there was darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even today so many Central American and South American countries are still under the darkness of Catholicism.</S>
