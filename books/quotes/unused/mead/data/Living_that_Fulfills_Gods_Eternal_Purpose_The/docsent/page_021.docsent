   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN BEING IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we will consider the matter of being in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to see this matter, first we need to realize that the Bible reveals that there are two spirits: the divine Spirit, that is, God Himself, and the human spirit, that is, our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 4:24 says, God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must realize that the God whom we serve, the God in whom we believe and whom we worship, is a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever we intend to contact something, we must know its nature in order to know the right way to contact it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may worship and serve God, but many of us simply do not realize that the God whom we worship and serve is a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must realize that the nature, substance, and character of God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we realize that God is Spirit, we will know the right way to contact and worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John 4:24 also speaks of the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A spirit can be contacted only by a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since God is Spirit, if we desire to contact God, the divine Spirit, we must contact Him in and with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is certainly not possible to contact God by means of our mind or our body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is Spirit, and therefore we need to worship God by means of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The matter of worship includes all the kinds of contact we can have with God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To worship God does not mean simply to bow down to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, it means to contact God in different ways, including to pray to God, to praise God, to trust in God, to have fellowship with God, and to speak for God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Worship is an all-inclusive matter that covers every phase of our contact with God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whatever we do to contact God must be in our spirit and with our spirit, because God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot contact God by any other means.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a fixed principle, something spoken by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord clearly tells us in John 4:24 that God is Spirit and that to worship God, to contact God, we must be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This principle can never be broken; there are no exceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the matter of worshipping God there are two spirits: the divine Spirit and the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE REGENERATED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Another verse that refers to the two spirits is John 3:6, which says, That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is a comparison here between the flesh and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Flesh is born of the flesh, and spirit is born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this verse the first spirit mentioned is the Spirit of God, and the second spirit is our spirit, which is born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This second spirit is not simply our original spirit created by God; rather, it is our original spirit that has been regenerated, that is, reborn, born again, of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rebirth, regeneration, takes place when our human spirit is born of and by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through such a rebirth the Lord Jesus as life is imparted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Holy Spirit of God enters into our spirit to enliven our dead spirit and also to bring the Lord Jesus as life into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, our spirit is not only enlivened but also born with Christ as life by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Soon after I was saved, I endeavored to find a book that would give me a proper definition of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I also asked certain pastors and Bible teachers to define this matter for me, but their answers failed to satisfy me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One day, however, the Lord revealed to me what rebirth, or regeneration, is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Regeneration involves the Spirit of God coming into our dead spirit to enliven it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the word enliven does not adequately express the meaning of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Regeneration means that the Holy Spirit comes into us to impart life to us, to give us life, and to make us alive.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He does this by bringing Christ as life into us and imparting Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result, our dead spirit is not only made alive; it is also born.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is a difference between being made alive and being born.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For example, the Lord s raising up Lazarus was merely an enlivening, not a birth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But when the Holy Spirit comes into us and enlivens our spirit, He makes our spirit alive and also imparts the Lord Jesus as life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not merely an enlivening but a birth as well, an enlivening with a birth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To be enlivened means to be made alive; this does not necessarily involve the adding of another element.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In contrast, regeneration involves the adding into us of something that we did not have originally.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the Holy Spirit comes into us to enliven our spirit, He adds Christ Himself into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now in our regenerated spirit there is the divine life, which is Christ Himself John 11:25; 14:6; Rom 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This makes our spirit not merely an enlivened spirit but a regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today many Christians realize only that their dead spirit has been made alive by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They have no idea that in their spirit something has been added, which is Christ Himself as life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now our spirit is not only an enlivened spirit but also a spirit that is regenerated with Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have such a reborn spirit, a regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the significance of our rebirth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have pointed out that regeneration is the enlivening of our spirit by the Holy Spirit with the imparting of Christ as life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Through regeneration we receive a second life, a life in addition to our original human life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Originally we had only the human life from our parents, but now we have the divine life from God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This second life is God Himself in Christ, and this life is in our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, God is Spirit, and we have a spirit that has been regenerated with Christ as life by the Holy Spirit.</S>
