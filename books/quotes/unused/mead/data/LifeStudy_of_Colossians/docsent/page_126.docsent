   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CULTURE AS A HINDRANCE TO THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message I am especially burdened to point out the fact that we all have a self-made and self-imposed culture.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This culture is a substitute for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Probably you do not realize how strong your self-made culture is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This culture separates us from others and keeps us from being built up with them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our culture may be like a steel cell, in which we are confined.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all have such a strong self-made and self-imposed culture.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Certain saints may be excellent and very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nevertheless, they are full of self-made culture.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, a certain brother may be frank and not at all political.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This frankness, however, may be a matter of culture, not of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Others may be very kind and gentle; they never offend anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This also may be an aspect of their culture.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all have our own culture.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If others live according to our culture, we are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if they do not live according to our culture, we may be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A brother and his wife may have difficulty living in oneness because they have different cultures.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The brother expects his wife to live according to his culture, and the wife hopes that her husband will live according to her culture.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This difference of cultures becomes a source of trouble in their married life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As one with more than fifty years experience in married life, I can testify that the happiest married life comes about when neither one expects the other to live according to his culture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when each party makes demands on the other, there will be difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, the problem is that we all have our own culture and expect others to live by it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This self-made culture is a great frustration to the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The most hidden and subtle substitute for Christ is our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>CULTURE AND OPINIONS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the past I have often spoken of the problems caused in the church life by opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Recently I heard that in a certain place some sisters were strongly opposed to the piano, but equally strong in favor of guitars.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such opinions come from our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Culture is the source of opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If our culture has been dealt with, we shall not have opinions about pianos or guitars.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We shall care only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be without opinion means to be without culture.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you hold on to your culture, it will be very difficult not to be opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Your culture causes you to be opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am one very strong in my opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But throughout the years I have been dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now it does not matter to me whether we have a piano, guitars, neither, or both.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, it does not matter to me what kind of food the saints eat.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, if we have culture instead of Christ, surely we shall care much about this kind of thing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How we need the Lord s salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The most hidden and subtle frustration to living Christ is our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This stronghold of culture within us must be torn down by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we shall have no culture, only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In various situations and circumstances we shall no longer have opinions according to our culture; we shall care only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If others want to play the piano or guitar, we shall not have any feeling about it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If they do not use any instruments, we shall have no feeling about that either.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because we have been rescued from our culture, we shall care only for Christ and for living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>LIVING CHRIST IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The way to be free from our self-made and self-imposed culture is not to deliberately try to drop our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we do this, our efforts to drop our culture will become another kind of culture, an anti-culture culture.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to see that the way to be free from culture is simply to continually live Christ in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We all have been constituted with culture according to our race and nationality and even according to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church life now plays an important role in our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must condemn any culture that replaces Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our need is to live Christ, to live by this all-inclusive Person in our spirit.</S>
