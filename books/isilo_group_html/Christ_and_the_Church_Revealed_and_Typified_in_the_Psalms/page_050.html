Book III indicates how the saints, in their experiences, realize that the house and the city of God with all the enjoyments thereof can only be preserved and maintained through Christ properly appreciated and exalted by God&#8217;s people. This means that if we would have a consistent experience of the house and the city of God with all their enjoyment, we must appreciate Christ and know Christ in a proper way. Only when we exalt Christ adequately and properly will the enjoyment of God&#8217;s house and God&#8217;s city be preserved and maintained. Otherwise, we will lose the enjoyment of the house, and the city of God will vanish. By keeping this in mind, we may realize how Book III is a further improvement in the progression of the Psalms.<h2 class=head1>DESOLATION THREATENS</h2><p>By the end of Book II we have reached the climax, the highest peak. But such a glorious situation, such victory, such ascension, and such wealth of blessing does not often last long. Because we are lacking in our appreciation of the exaltation of Christ, there is a real problem associated with our enjoyment of the house and city of God. God would even allow the enemy to intrude and destroy the enjoyment of His house and city. This is exactly why we have Book III.<p>Some may think that all 150 Psalms are just individual, unrelated pieces. That is not true. Not only are all the Psalms related one to another, but there is a marvelous sequence in the progression of the books into which the Psalms are divided. Why is Book III not in the position of Book I? And why is Book I in the first position, followed by Book II and then Book III? In Books I and II the house is built gradually, step by step, to the highest level. Book I is the beginning; then Book II brings what was begun in Book I to a conclusion, even to the highest level. Now, in Book III, we find mainly the desolation and even the destruction of the house of God. Something which has been built up, something which has already existed and become so wonderful, has been brought to desolation and destruction. This is a strong proof that this Book must be in the third position. Book III could never take the place of Book I, for without the building already established, there could be no desolation.<p>There is always the problem of maintaining and preserving any good situation. It is not so easy to perpetuate such a condition for any length of time. When we reach the highest peak in the local churches, we usually do not stay on the mountaintop very long. Too often some kind of desolation intervenes and brings us down. Bear this in mind.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Church Revealed and Typified in the Psalms &nbsp; pg 50</div><br></body></html>
