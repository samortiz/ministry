   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Through Signs and Wonders</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To further the spread of His propagation and because of the faithfulness of the apostles, God caused signs and wonders to accompany them 2:43; 5:12, 15-16; 13:12; 19:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should be able to experience this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who go out from among us should have this same spirit of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is not a matter of seeking for signs and wonders; rather, we should believe that signs and wonders from God will accompany us when necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today signs and wonders do occur, but such signs and wonders are not the focus of our work; neither should we feel compelled to pretend or promote the false manifestation of such things, which is common in the Pentecostal movement.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not have to pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, we need to believe that our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth; He has died on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today in resurrection He is able not only to cure sinners but also to cure those who are sick.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should have this kind of faith, and we should go out to work with the same faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through the Preaching of the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The spread of the Lord s propagation is also accomplished through the preaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The apostles preached mainly three points.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, they preached the resurrected Christ in ascension 1:22; 2:24, 32-33; 3:15; 4:10-11; 5:30-32; 13:30; 17:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Acts, the apostles said repeatedly that they preached Jesus, the One who was killed by men but was raised from the dead by God, and that they were witnesses of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The One they preached was the resurrected Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Their working and preaching was a proof of Jesus resurrection; they were able to boldly preach that Jesus was resurrected because He was living inside them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second, the apostles preached the kingdom of God the church 8:12; 14:22; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The kingdom of God is not a visible material kingdom but a kingdom of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is Christ as life being spread to the believers, forming a realm in which God reigns in life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The apostles, especially Paul, repeatedly preached this item as the gospel, and at the same time they used this to exhort, encourage, and comfort the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Third, the apostles preached the word concerning repentance, forgiveness of sins, and life 5:31; 13:38-39; 11:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They spoke of man s sins and of the need to repent and believe in the Lord Jesus so that these sins would be forgiven and so that man might receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE BELIEVERS KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>AND GROWTH IN LIFE BEING FOR</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE INCREASE AND SPREAD OF THE CHURCH,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must learn from the teaching of the Bible to pay attention not only to the knowledge of the truth and growth in life but also to the increase and spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The increase and spread of the church are the goal of our knowing the truth and growing in life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Keeping the Apostles Teachings</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To keep the apostles teachings is to know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Depending on the Word of God s Grace</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Believers should not only know the truth but also pursue the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To depend on the word of God s grace is to have the real growth in life through knowing the truth and by the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Being Taught and Nurtured</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>by the Apostles Epistles</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The apostles gave us a very good pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On one hand, they went out to work to establish churches, and on the other hand, they wrote letters, or Epistles, to the churches that they had raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since they could not continually work in any one place, the Epistles were a means of teaching and nurturing the believers in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To teach is a matter of truth; to nurture is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are several categories of Epistles written by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At the time of Paul s second ministry journey, in Acts 18:5 when Silas and Timothy came from Thessalonica to Corinth to see him, he wrote 1 Thessalonians.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not long after, he wrote 2 Thessalonians.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>During Paul s second ministry journey, he also wrote the book of Galatians while he was in Corinth cf.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Acts 18:1-11; 16:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This book is important because the believers in the churches in Galatia were unclear concerning the truth and misunderstood matters concerning life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, Paul wrote the book of Galatians to render the proper teaching to the Galatian believers and to nurture them in the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the time of Paul s third ministry journey, he wrote 1 Corinthians while he was in Ephesus Acts 19:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today 1 Corinthians is a tremendous help to us in the matters concerning truth and life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Later in this ministry journey Paul reached Macedonia, where he wrote 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When Paul stayed in Corinth during his third ministry journey Acts 20:3 , he also wrote the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to the record in Acts, Paul was very busy, and there were many burdens upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Amidst his busy work, however, he was able to take care of the churches that he could not visit by writing Epistles to teach and nurture them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>During his first imprisonment in Rome, Paul wrote four Epistles Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Philemon.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After being released, he wrote 1 Timothy, Titus, and Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These are all Epistles of considerable importance.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>During his second imprisonment, he wrote 2 Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After writing 2 Timothy, he was ready to be martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>THE CHURCH TODAY NEEDING TO BE ADJUSTED</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Acts shows that there was much spreading in the early church, but in this spreading, the apostles did not forget the teaching of the truth and the nurturing in life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Regrettably, it seems that today we take care of only truth and life; we have not paid much attention to the increase and spread.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, we need to be adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Emphasizing the Church s Increase and Spread</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>While Disregarding the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Knowledge of the Truth and Growth in Life</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Resulting in a Great Shortage</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we emphasize the increase and spread of the church but disregard the believers knowledge of the truth and growth in life, the result will be a great shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The general practice of Christianity is to care only for spreading and evangelizing but not for truth, much less for life; this results in a great shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Emphasizing the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Knowledge of the Truth and Growth in Life,</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>While Neglecting the Church s Increase and Spread,</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Causing the Lord to Be Greatly Restricted</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Nevertheless, if we emphasize only the believers knowledge of the truth and growth in life but neglect the increase and spread of the church, we will greatly restrict the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This word of balance should be applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have had a peaceful time here in Taiwan for over twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the first seven years of the Lord s recovery here, there were only four hundred saints, and there was insufficient coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Yet we all were in one accord, and there was a great deal of increase and spread.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In contrast, we have reached tens of thousands of people and our coordination is getting better, but we do not have much increase, not to mention much spread.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is really inexcusable.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must admit that we have greatly restricted the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Needing to Be Balanced</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We must be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Surely, we have to pay attention to the knowledge of the truth and growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>At the same time, we need to realize that truth and life are for the increase and spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I hope that through this fellowship we will all turn.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We need to know the truth more and to grow in life more.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>At the same time, we should also not neglect the increase and spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the past we promised and vowed that we would lead a person to the Lord each year.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If we are faithful to the Lord, our number will certainly double in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we spend time to recover the dormant ones, I believe that the number will double yet again.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In this matter we need to be adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I hope that during this period of time the Spirit of the Lord can operate among us in many ways so that there will be people who can receive the burden to go abroad to be the Lord s witnesses for the Lord s propagation to spread to the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
