<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>In a conference held in the church in Taipei in January 1961, Brother Witness Lee released ten messages focusing on the vision revealed in the holy Scriptures concerning the building of the church. The messages were full of light and power and were blessed by the Lord in an unprecedented way. Nearly the whole congregation offered themselves to God to be built up in the church. This book contains notes that were taken during those messages and that were slightly polished. Although the book has not been reviewed by the speaker, it is being published at this time to meet the present need. May the Lord grant us His blessing by revealing these timely messages to the spirit of every reader.</p>
