   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Exercising Our Spirit and Pray-reading</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When We Come to the Word to Be</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Spiritually Nourished</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some may be discouraged from reading the Bible because they do not understand everything or remember what they read.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not be disappointed that we cannot remember what we have eaten of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whether or not we remember, the word gets into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may think that we receive only knowledge when we come to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, when we read the Bible, we should not try to understand everything with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Striving to understand everything will frustrate our receiving of the nourishment from the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, we need to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not care for how much we understand or remember but for how much we are nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we come to the Bible, we should not only read but also pray.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead of composing a prayer, we can simply use the verses we read as the words of our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For instance, if we are reading John 1:1, we can pray, Lord, in the beginning was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>O Lord, was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Oh, the Word, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Pray-reading in this way is spiritual eating.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Repeating the words of the Bible can be likened to chewing one s food to receive nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should practice this every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When our morning time is finished, we will go into our day with the nourishment we have received from God s breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This nourishment will remain in us the whole day, sustaining, enlightening, and watering us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes this nourishment will comfort us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to my experience, this nourishment will sometimes speak to me throughout the day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My morning nourishment brings me into God s presence for the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have a desperate need to practice this constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to regard our contact with the Lord in the morning through the word as more important than our breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our spiritual breakfast is more important than our physical breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Reading the Bible and having a morning time with the Lord are life necessities, just as eating, drinking, breathing, and sleeping are life necessities for our physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Early in the morning before doing anything else, we need to come to contact the dear Lord through the word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should consider that this is a life necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE HEALTHY WORD The Healthy Word Containing</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>a Killing Element and a Nourishing Element</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The burden in this chapter concerns the healthy word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the two Epistles to Timothy and the Epistle to Titus the word healthy is used six times to describe God s divine word 1 Tim 1:10; 6:3; 2 Tim 1:13; 4:3; Titus 1:9; 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These Epistles were written at a time when the church was in degradation, and at such a time some teachings and doctrines are not healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because the church is in degradation today, many teachings in Christianity are not healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The word healthy implies two elements.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Negatively, there is an element that kills germs.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every day our body is fighting against germs.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The physical life is a struggle between the human life and germs.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Similarly, there are spiritual germs from which we must be constantly protected.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, healthy teaching is full of antibiotics the germ-killing element.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Positively, there is the nourishing element.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By these two elements we are made healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The healthy word is not a doctrinal shell but rather is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The healthy word and the healthy teaching are the truth, containing the killing element and the nourishing element.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>First Corinthians 1:18 mentions the word of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The word of the cross is the killing word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every chapter of 1 Corinthians contains the word of the cross, because the believers in Corinth had been deceived and brought into contact with spiritual germs.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Each chapter of 1 Corinthians concerns a different problem in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every problem was a disease.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because the Corinthians were full of germs, they needed the spiritual antibiotics in the word of the cross, the killing word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Philippians 2:16 mentions the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Philippians is full of the word of life, the nourishing word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For example, in 1:20 and 21 Paul says, Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For to me, to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Another example is 4:13, which says, I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, in the Bible there are two kinds of words: the word of the cross and the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The word of the cross is the killing word, and the word of life is the nourishing word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the one hand, the healthy word kills the germs in us; on the other hand, the healthy word nourishes us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Word of God Being Composed</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>of Christ, His Death, and His Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The word of God is actually composed of three elements Christ, His death, and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The basic ingredients of the Bible are not stories or doctrines but Christ, His death, and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we read the Bible, if we pick up only stories or doctrines rather than Christ, His death, and His resurrection, our Bible reading is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Regardless of what chapter or verse we read, we should always take in and enjoy the three basic ingredients Christ, His all-inclusive death, and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The first few verses of the Gospel of John do not mention the death or resurrection of Christ, but if we eat the healthy word by pray-reading these verses, the result will be that the germs within us will be killed, and the weaknesses within us will be swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is a killing produced by the killing element of Christ s death in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As we continue pray-reading, we will be supplied with life by the same word, which also contains the nourishing element of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the Christian life a life of receiving killing and nourishing from our God through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The proper reading of the Bible always transmits a killing element into us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we do not receive any killing when we read the Bible, our reading is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Our physical eating similarly enables our body to kill the germs in us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we do not eat properly every day, we will quickly become sick from many germs.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As long as we eat well and regularly, we do not need to take antibiotics.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Through our eating we will naturally have the killing element.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the same principle, every time we read the Word, we receive a killing element.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Actually, it is not we ourselves but the negative things within us, such as our natural life and our flesh, that are killed.</S>
