<h1 class="title">THE CONSTITUENT<br />
OF THE CHURCH AND THE KINGDOM</h1>
<p>Concerning God, there are two aspects: what God is and what God does. Firstly, God is; secondly, He works and does certain things. Jesus of Nazareth came with these two aspects of God. However, He came firstly not to express what God is, but to accomplish what God wanted Him to do for the fulfillment of His purpose. This means that Jesus came firstly not as the Son of God, but as the Christ. For this reason, in Matthew 16:16 Peter said that Jesus was the Christ, and then went on to say that He was also the Son of the living God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPARTATION OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Before we consider the function of the anointed One, we need to see that the Son of the living God is the embodiment of what God is. All that God is has been embodied in the Son. Therefore, the Son is the essence, the substance, of what God is. This is for life. The Father is the source of life, and the Son is the impartation of life. This means that the Father is the hidden One and that the Son is the expressed One. The Son is the expression of the Father to be the impartation of life. Therefore, if we have the Son, we have life. As 1 John 5:12 says, &ldquo;He that hath the Son hath life.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTION OF THE CHRIST</h2>
<p>Now we need to see how the Son can be imparted into us as life. This is accomplished by the Christ. Perhaps you have never before realized that when the anointed One was crucified on the cross, He was carrying out His function. Daniel 9:26 says that the Messiah was to be cut off. His being cut off was His function. As the anointed One was being cut off, He was functioning. Not only His death but also His resurrection and ascension were part of His function. Thus, the anointed One functioned by being crucified, resurrecting, and ascending, all that the Son might be imparted into us as life. He is the Christ, the anointed One of God, to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose. God&rsquo;s purpose is to impart what He is into us as life. This can only be accomplished by the function of the Christ, the anointed One of God. Through the function of the anointed One, the Son of the living God has been imparted into us, and we have life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF PETER</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16 Peter received the revelation of the Christ and the Son of the living God. However, it was not until the day of resurrection that Peter received the Son of the living God into him as life. On that day, the anointed One of God functioned through His crucifixion and resurrection to impart Himself as the Son of God into Peter. On the day of Pentecost the anointed One became Peter&rsquo;s experience. On the day of resurrection, Peter received the Son of God as life; on the day of Pentecost, he gained Christ for function. In other words, on the day of resurrection, Peter became a son of God by receiving the Son of God. Then on the day of Pentecost, Peter was anointed and became part of the anointed One, part of the corporate Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The church is so many Bar-jonas, so many sons of natural fathers, who have received Christ as the Son of God and who have been attached to the anointed One. On the one hand, these Bar-jonas have the Son of God within them as life; on the other hand, they are attached to the anointed One to be part of the corporate Christ. This is the church.</p>
<p>In the past we have seen four aspects of the church: first, that it is the gathering of God&rsquo;s called ones; second, that it is the household, the family, of God; third, that it is the Body of Christ; and fourth, that it is the new man. However, no matter how clear we may be concerning these aspects of the church, we still need to know what the constituent of the church is and how the church is constituted. The church is constituted firstly with the Son of the living God and then with the Christ. Have you been constituted in this way, or are you still a Simon, a son of Jonah? Remember, on the day of resurrection, Simon Bar-jona, the son of a natural man, was constituted with the Son of the living God. Thus, the Son of the living God was wrought into a man of blood and flesh. As the son of Jonah, Peter did not have the element of the Son of God. The Son of God was not a part of his constituent until the day of resurrection, when He was wrought into him through the death and resurrection of Christ. Therefore, in 1 Peter 1:3 Peter says that we were regenerated through the resurrection of Christ. Through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection Peter was constituted with the Son of the living God. A new element, a heavenly, divine element, was added to him. This was the first step.</p>
<p>The second step took place fifty days later. On the day of Pentecost, Peter was constituted further with the ascended Christ who came down upon him. On the day of resurrection, the Son of God was wrought into him, and on the day of Pentecost the Christ was poured out upon him. Thus, by the day of Pentecost Peter was fully constituted with Christ within and without. From that time onward, he was no longer Simon or Bar-jona. He had become Peter, a stone.</p>
<p>The church is a group of sons of flesh and blood who have been constituted with the Son of God within and with the Christ without. Within we have life, and without we have function. Within we are full of living water, and without we are covered with oil. Thus the church is a new constitution.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise of the Kingdom for the Building of the Church &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
