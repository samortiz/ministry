In this message we shall consider leprosy in a detailed way.<h2 class=head1>V. A DISEASE ON THE HEAD AND ON THE BEARD</h2><p>Leviticus 13:29 speaks of a disease on the head and on the beard. In the Bible the head, especially the hair of the head, signifies our glory. First Corinthians 11 indicates that hair is related to glory.<p>A beard is related not to glory but to dignity. It is not easy to explain what dignity is. It would not be adequate to say that dignity is a kind of honor. Dignity is actually self-assumed honor. A person of high social standing may be honored by others. However, if a person assumes honor, that is a matter of dignity. Spiritually speaking, a beard is related to dignity, to one’s self-assumed honor. To have a beard is to display one’s dignity.<p>The fact that there can be a disease on the head, which signifies glory, and on the beard, which signifies dignity, indicates that it is easy for leprosy to be hidden within human glory and dignity. It is not leprous for a person to be honored, but it is leprous for one to assume honor to himself.<p>Leviticus 13, in which we see God’s wisdom, gives us a divine diagnosis of our sin. Leprosy is a synonym of sin, and sin is a synonym of rebellion. Sin is rebellion. In the universe there is actually only one sin, and this sin is rebellion.<p>According to the principles set up by God in His creation, everything is in order and is related to a certain kind of authority. There is authority everywhere in the universe. There is authority in the family and in the schools. If there were no authority in this country, there could not be any peace or order. Rebellion is versus authority. Those who rebel oppose authority.<p>In the divine sense, authority is a synonym of God Himself. God is the authority in the universe. Satan tried to break this divine authority, but he failed and was judged for his rebellion. Today as God’s created, chosen, redeemed, and saved people, and especially as His regenerated children, we should be the most submissive, obedient ones.<p>Romans 5 indicates that to sin is to be disobedient. Sin came into the human race through the disobedience of Adam (v. 19). Do you know what disobedience is? It is rebellion. Disobedience is a synonym of rebellion. Disobedience is rebellion, and rebellion is a synonym of Satan. Just as rebellion is a synonym of Satan, so authority is a synonym of God.<p>Anything that is related to rebellion is of Satan. The expression of rebellion in us today has many aspects. Every aspect is a sin or a trespass or a transgression or an overstepping or an offense. These things may be small in appearance, but they all are expressions of the unique sin—rebellion.<p>We need to remember that the source of sin is rebellion and that rebellion is Satan’s invention. Sin, therefore, comes from Satan. Furthermore, every kind of sin has the nature of rebellion and bears the appearance of rebellion. Even the smallest sin contains the element of rebellion. Hence, to sin is to be in rebellion against God. Whenever we sin we rebel against God.
