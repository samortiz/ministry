   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Bethel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the House of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we come to Jacob, without the divine light we can see only a naughty boy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But this naughty boy, while escaping from his brother Esau, slept in the open air and had a dream Gen 28:11-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jacob dreamed of a ladder set up from earth to heaven, with angels ascending and descending on it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The angels were not descending and ascending, but ascending and descending.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that the ladder was from earth to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We usually say that our dreams come from what we think.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we have something on our mind, it will come to us as a dream while we are asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Jacob's case, however, I don't believe he dreamed what had been in his thoughts during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In those days he must have been thinking about how he was running away from Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In his dream, though, there was no Esau and no Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He saw a ladder reaching from earth to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When he awoke, he had an inspiration from God and said, "This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven" Gen 28:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He set up the stone he had used for his pillow and poured oil on it, calling the name of that place Bethel, which means the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Noah was commissioned by God to build an ark, and Abraham received a promise from God that the entire earth, all humankind, would be blessed in his seed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But this naughty boy, the grandson of Abraham, had a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Waking up from that dream, he said something wonderful, something which composes and directs the entire Bible the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a directing point, running throughout the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Out of this naughty boy who had such a dream came a people, the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's House</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the second book of the Bible, Exodus, all the children of Israel were gained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He not only rescued them, but gathered them together at Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There God gave them a vision Exo 19 , not just a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is a connection between the vision Moses received from God on Mount Sinai and Jacob's dream.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jacob in his dream saw something related to God's house, and now his descendants, a people who came out of Jacob, were there at Mount Sinai with the heavens opened to them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One of their representatives, Moses, went up the mountain to stay with God, and God showed him the pattern of His house, a pattern of how to build the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The tabernacle is God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Samuel 3:3 calls the tabernacle the temple of the Lord; that is to say, it was God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The tabernacle as the dwelling place of God is also called the temple, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On Mount Sinai Moses saw all the designs, and the children of Israel built a tabernacle according to this pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the last chapter of Exodus the tabernacle was erected, and immediately God's glory descended from the heavens and filled this tabernacle Exo 40:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It was even greater than God's creative acts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To create the universe is something general, but for God to have a definite spot on this earth that He could descend upon and enter in the way of glory was truly marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The physical tabernacle was a type of all the children of Israel as God's dwelling place.</S>
