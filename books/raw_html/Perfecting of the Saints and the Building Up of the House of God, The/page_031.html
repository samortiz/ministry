	 <h2 class="head1">THE SITUATION IN ENGLAND AND DENMARK</h2>
<p>After our time in America we went to England. I will skip the details and relate only one incident. The day before we left England, we had our last time of fellowship with the saints at Honor Oak. During this meeting everyone could ask questions, and I answered them. The first two questions were general, but the third question was concerning the local churches. In response I spoke concerning the establishing and the ground of the local churches. Then a brother asked whether it is necessary to pay a price in order to establish a local church. I said that there is the need to pay a price and to fight.</p>
<p>I was standing in front of several hundred believers, and I said that God&rsquo;s children want to rise up to serve God and take the way of the Lord, but where is a place in the West that is practicing this pattern according to God&rsquo;s heart? Brother T. Austin-Sparks and all the elders were sitting beside me.</p>
<p>I continued to say that the entire West is covered with fog and does not have a way out. If a child of God wants to rise up to take the way of the Lord, who can show him the right way? I asked the brothers and sisters whether they see this matter and added that we need to pay a price and to rise up to be the fighting pioneers who open up the way.</p>
<p>I then gave an illustration, using a trip to Scotland that I made with Brother Sparks, in which he drove. It took us only a few hours to drive five hundred miles, because someone had opened the way and paved it with tar. This highway made it easy for us to reach our destination. Where is such a highway in the West? God&rsquo;s children rise up and want to take this way, but there is no way; there is only fog. Where is this highway? Is there a meeting in the West that can serve as a standard, a model, or a pattern? Where is the highway that God&rsquo;s children can walk on? In this situation we need to pay a price, and we also need to fight and open up a way for God&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>I am giving the details of this fellowship so that we can know the situation in the West. My time at Honor Oak can be compared to a doctor&rsquo;s office hours. Everyone who came to me asked what he should do and where he should go after Honor Oak. Their questions strengthened my impression that there is no home for the believers in the West. Both God and man do not have a home. If the believers had a home, they would not ask what they should do and where they should go.</p>
<p>After England we went to Denmark. Of all the places we visited, Denmark had the most positive situation. Many believers in Denmark also asked questions, but their questions were positive. Their questions were not in a negative context. Since the believers had a positive attitude, the situation in Denmark was straightforward. As long as my suggestions were good and proper, they accepted them. What I said was short and simple, and they put everything to practice. We did not expect them to meet in their homes, but in a letter I received from them recently, they said they are now meeting in more than twenty homes.</p>
<p>My overall impression is that there is a need in every place to build up God&rsquo;s house so that the wandering believers can have a home. If there is another opportunity for me to speak with the children of God, I will say that the greatest need on earth today is to build up God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>There is still a great need for the gospel, but if we study the situation, we will see that the gospel is not the primary need. The primary need today is a home for the believers. In other words, the gospel is to beget children, and a home is to raise children. The need today is not to give birth to children but to raise them up. Since there are many children who do not have a home, why should we focus on giving birth to more children? The ones who give birth to children are also homeless. The pitiful situation today is that it is difficult to find a home on the earth today.</p>
<p>This description is not too much. The Lord, whom we serve and who indwells us, will confirm this word. If you ask me what Japan needs the most, I would say that the need is God&rsquo;s house. If you ask me what America needs the most, I would say even more strongly that the need is to establish God&rsquo;s house in every place. If you ask me what England needs the most, without a doubt I would say that England needs God&rsquo;s house. Every place needs God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>At the end of the conference in Denmark, as everyone was leaving, a sister from Sweden came to me in tears and said that she will never forget the help she received from the conference. She also said that she looked to the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to live what was presented. Most of the saints asked what they should do when they went back and where they should meet, but this sister said that she would never forget the help she received and that she desired to live in God&rsquo;s life so that God&rsquo;s house can be built up.</p>
<p>It is not that there are shepherds with no sheep but that there are many sheep with no shepherds; there are many homeless believers. Hence, there was a feeling at the end of the conference that the saints were reluctant to leave. They wanted to know where they should go after the conference. Therefore, what every place needs the most is the satisfaction of having a home.</p>
