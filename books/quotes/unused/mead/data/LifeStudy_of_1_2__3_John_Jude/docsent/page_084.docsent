   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Realizing That the Children of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Have a Great Future</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 3:2 John goes on to say, Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not yet been manifested what we shall be.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We know that if He is manifested, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him even as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since we are the children of God, we shall be like Him in the maturity of life when He is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be like Him is what we shall be.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This has not yet been manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicates that the children of God have a great future with a more splendid blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We shall not only have the divine nature, but shall also bear the divine likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To partake of the divine nature is already a great blessing and enjoyment; yet to be like God, bearing His likeness, will be a greater blessing and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The pronoun He in 3:2 refers to God and denotes Christ, who is to be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This not only indicates that Christ is God, but also implies the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Christ is manifested, the Triune God will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we see Him, we shall see the Triune God; and when we are like Him, we shall be like the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 2 John says, We shall be like Him, because we shall see Him even as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that by seeing Him we shall reflect His likeness 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This will cause us to be as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 2 indicates that the children of God have a great future.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, I have heard some saints say that they do not have a future.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These saints need to realize that they have a great future with splendid blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our future is indicated by the word it has not yet been manifested what we shall be.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What we shall be is a divine mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because it is such a mystery, it must be something great.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are not able to imagine what our future will be.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fact that our future has not yet been manifested indicates that it will be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although it has not been manifested what we shall be, we know that when the Son is manifested, we shall be like the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Purifying Ourselves</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 3:3 John continues, And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, even as that One is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The hope spoken of here is the hope of being like the Lord, the hope of bearing the likeness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our expectation is that we shall be like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 3 says that because we have this hope, we purify ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the context of this section, from 2:28 through 3:24, to purify ourselves is to practice righteousness 3:7; 2:29 , to live a righteous life that is the expression of the righteous God 1:9 , the righteous One 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is to be pure without any stain of unrighteousness, even as that One is perfectly pure.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This also describes the life that abides in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not Practicing Lawlessness</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 3:4 John says, Everyone who practices sin practices also lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To practice sin is not merely to commit sin as occasional acts, but to live in sin Rom 6:2 , to live a life which is not under the ruling principle of God over man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No one who is a child of God practices sin habitually.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may sin occasionally, but we do not practice sin habitually.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For instance, if someone has the practice of lying continually, this is a sign that he probably has not been born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Someone who has the divine life in him as a seed cannot lie habitually.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, due to weakness a child of God may lie in a particular circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But because he is a child of God, he will not lie habitually.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead of practicing sin, those who are children of God practice righteousness habitually.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 3:4 John says that sin is lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Lawlessness is to have no law, to be without law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This does not mean to be without the Mosaic law see Rom 5:13 , because sin was already in the world before the Mosaic law was given.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Without law here denotes without, or not under, the ruling principle of God over man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To practice lawlessness is to live a life outside of and not under God s ruling principle over man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, lawlessness is sin, or reciprocally, sin is lawlessness.</S>
