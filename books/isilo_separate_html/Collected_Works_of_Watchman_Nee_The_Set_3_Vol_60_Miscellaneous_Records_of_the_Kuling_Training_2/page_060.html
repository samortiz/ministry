First, we have to know the importance of distributing tracts. During the past two or three hundred years, God has used tracts very much to save men. Whether they have been distributed by mail or by hand, tracts have played a very crucial role. In China the practice of tract distribution still is not being carried out properly. In other countries many people have been saved through tracts. But in China many people are still not too clear about the matter of tract distribution. Some realize the importance of this work, but the tracts they use are short of "hooks"; they are not effective. We hope that tract distribution would become a common practice in the church. We have to prepare some effective tracts. We have to charge the new ones with this work so that tract distribution will become a lesson and a training for everyone in the next generation in the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BENEFITS OF DISTRIBUTING TRACTS</h2><p>God has used tracts very much to save men. There is something special about tract distribution. We can enumerate the following benefits:</p><h2 class="head2">Tracts Not Being Limited by Man's Speaking</h2><p>The first advantage of distributing tracts is that they are not limited by man's ability to speak. Many people cannot speak well. They do not have the eloquence or the gift. Others are naturally shy. However, even if a person is slow or shy, he has to open his mouth to testify for the Lord as soon as he is saved. He cannot remain silent just because he says he is not eloquent. The church should encourage the believers and should provide them many opportunities to speak. They have to learn to speak for the Lord. Even those who do not have the gift of speaking should speak for the Lord. Having said this, the truth is that speaking is still a hard task for some people. Either they are short of truth or they are short in experience. Some sinners need to be told the vanity of the world. Some need to be told of how the evil and power of sin robs a person of all peace. Some people need to be told about repentance. Many people do not know what to say when faced with such needs. At these times they can pass out tracts. When a person finds it hard to open his mouth to preach the gospel, tracts become an important tool. A tract distributor must first know about the persons to whom he is giving the tracts. If the receivers are his relatives or friends, he will understand their needs and be able to find the right tract to give to them. If, in addition to the tract, he presents his own testimony, he will have a very good presentation of the gospel. In preaching, it is easy to be affected and restricted by one's own condition. But tract distribution is independent of a man's own personal condition. In fact, many times the tracts speak more clearly and accurately than a man can speak. This is the first advantage of tract distribution. It makes up for a person's lack.</p><h2 class="head2">Tracts Not Being Limited by Age and Status</h2><p>The second advantage of tracts is that they are not limited by the age or status of the receiver. One basic principle in leading men to Christ is for workers to work on the same kind of person as they are. It is unsuitable for a child to work on an old man or for a manual laborer to work on a doctor. One should send an old man to work on an old man, a young man to work on a young man, and a nurse to work on a nurse. Under normal circumstances, one should work within the sphere of his own social rank, sex, and age. For example, it is better, and indeed more appropriate, for sisters to work on ladies. Of course, there are exceptions to this. I am a man, and it would be harder for me to preach to a young lady one-on-one. It is equally embarrassing for a young sister to testify to an old man. Of course, with enough power one can sometimes overcome such barriers. But under normal circumstances, it is difficult to preach to people of different social standing, status, or background. At such times, tracts come in very handy. When you visit a person, you must first pray earnestly. After that you can present a tract to him politely and testify to him. Perhaps you are a new believer. You do not know how or what to say. You only need to give him a tract. This does not mean that you let the tract do all the work. The tract only makes up for your lack; you still have to open your mouth to testify. When there is a gap between the preacher and his listener in rank, age, or sex, and there is some hesitation because of this gap, tracts fill the gap nicely.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> </body></html>
