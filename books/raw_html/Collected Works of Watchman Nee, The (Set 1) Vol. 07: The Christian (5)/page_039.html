<H1 CLASS=TITLE>QUESTION AND ANSWER BOX</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(4)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 7</H2><P>All who have biblical and spiritual questions may write to the editor. We, of course, will try our best to answer. Forgive us for not answering unprofitable questions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW EARTH</H2><P>Question: "At the time of the new heaven and the new earth, the people of the nations outside the city will be transferred from the millennium. At that time, they will still have the flesh and will not be free from weaknesses. This is why the leaves of the tree of life are for the healing of the nations." What is the scriptural basis for such an interpretation? (Wang, Peking)</P><P>Answer: There are two ways to interpret the Bible. The first is by clear proofs in the Bible; the second is by the clues in the Bible. In this case, we have to consider the clues in the Bible. Revelation 21:3-7 divides the people in the new heaven and the new earth into two kinds: peoples and sons. According to verse 3, peoples means ordinary people of the world, who are the nations in verse 24. Sons are the people in the church, because only those in the church receive the spring of the water of life and overcome. (Compare this with the overcoming in chapters two and three.) From reading Matthew 25:31-46, we know that the sheep in the nations will be in the millennium. After reading the prophecies of the Old Testament prophets, we know that in the millennium both the Jews and the nations will still be in the flesh (because they will still have birth and death and so forth). After the millennium, the Bible records that there will be no death in the new heaven and the new earth (Rev. 21:4). However, the Bible does not say that the bodies of the people of the nations will be changed. The Bible only says that when the Lord receives the saints, the saints will have their bodies changed (Phil. 3:20-21; 1 Thes. 4:16-17; 1 Cor. 15:52). The people of the nations do not have this promise. Therefore, when they enter the new earth, they must still have the flesh. Since they still have the flesh, they also have weaknesses. This is why the Word of God says, "And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations" (Rev. 22:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A BURDEN IN THE HEART</H2><P>Question: Please answer this one question for me. The year before last, in a revival meeting I received the Holy Spirit who operates in my heart for His work. The day before that day, He led me to cry out loudly for forgiveness. I confessed many sins before many people. The next day, after listening to a speaker talking on the joy of receiving the forgiveness of sins, I prayed and thanked the heavenly Father for His great mercy. Suddenly, I became uncontrollably happy and could not stop laughing. In the evening, after a bath, during the evening prayer, I suddenly had a special sensation: I felt a soothing feeling as if I had received the ointment of joy, and I was full of happiness. This happiness did not leave me no matter where I went and what I saw. (Though I do not feel this happiness now, peace is still always with me.) Since then, there has been a great change in my heart. There often is a "gust of air" in my heart seeking release. Sometimes I feel that it is hard to release this air. At other times I feel at ease to release it. When I feel at ease to release it, the feeling of ease is like saying "Amen." This, I believe, is the fulfillment of Romans 8:23 or 24. (When I pray, I am more released.) But some say that this is a sign of the dissatisfaction of the heart and spirit. Others say this is the grieving of the Holy Spirit. But I still believe that I am right. In spite of this, I would like to ask you about it.</P><P>Answer: My dear Mr. Fu-Ho in the Lord, peace to you! I received your letter. May God Himself lead you in His grace! What you call "a gust of air" is just a kind of heavy feeling that a believer often experiences. This heavy feeling can come from one of two sources. One is from the Holy Spirit, and it is called a "burden"; the other is from Satan and is called a "weight." When the Holy Spirit gives us this heavy feeling, He is giving us a burden in our heart. This is with two purposes: (1) that we would preach the gospel, and (2) that we would pray for others. After you have preached what He wants you to preach, He will remove this heavy feeling from you. After you have prayed what He wants you to pray, He will also remove this heavy feeling from you, and you will feel as if the air has been released from you. But if He wants you to continue to pray for a certain person or a certain matter, He will cause this heavy feeling to remain in you. Saints who have this kind of experience are beginning to experience co-working with the Lord. Heavy feelings may also come from Satan. A weight from Satan is not like a burden given by the Holy Spirit. What Satan gives is a kind of pressure, putting the saints under an indescribable oppression, making them sad for no reason at all. When Satan oppresses the saints, they feel uneasy either sitting up or lying down. They do not feel right either to walk or to stop, to speak or to be quiet. They do not feel right either to pray or to read the Bible. It seems as if they are lost as to what to do; the heart is depressed and impatient, as if there is an unspeakable, indescribable oppression. It seems as if the heart is being tied down by some mysterious forceâ€”what you perhaps would call "the gust of air." Because your letter was short, I cannot say for certain whether your heavy feeling is from Satan or from the Holy Spirit. However, you should try to differentiate between the two. The heavy feeling from the Holy Spirit is with a purpose; it causes us to be concerned for certain persons or certain matters, to pray for them, or to preach the Lord's gospel to them. Satan's heavy feeling is not like this. It comes when you are unaware. It makes you feel grievous suddenly and for no reason at all. Satan takes you as his target; he has no other aim except to disturb you. The heavy feeling from the Holy Spirit is with a purpose; He lets you know what it is that you are burdened for. The heavy feeling from Satan is purposeless. It leaves you feeling lost, and wondering why you feel this way. Therefore, if your heavy feeling is from the Holy Spirit, you should cooperate with the Lord faithfully and should not mind the flesh. If it is from Satan, you should (1) recognize that it comes from Satan, (2) be resolved not to be oppressed by it, and (3) resist him by prayer or by calling. The best way of resistance is first to invoke the victory of the cross and then to speak audibly, "The precious blood of the Lord covers me." "I will not be oppressed by the enemy." "Satan, get away from me quickly." "Hallelujah, the Lord has won the victory," and so forth. Sunshine will break through the darkened, cloudy sky. Please write again and let me know how you are doing.</P>
