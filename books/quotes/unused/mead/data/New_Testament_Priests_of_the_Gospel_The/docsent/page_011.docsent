   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John was born a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But this was only a type and a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was not the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In him, the Old Testament priesthood had a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It turned from the type to the reality, from the shadow to the body, and from the offering of physical bulls and goats to the offering of sinners as sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the sacrifice that God has been seeking for before the foundation of the world in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These sacrifices are the individual sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ephesians 1:4 says, According as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We the saved ones were chosen by God before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In eternity past God chose us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It does not matter in which country or corner of the world we are; He has chosen us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We did not know when we would be born or where we would be born.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God predestinated us before the foundation of the world that we would be chosen, in time be saved, and become offerings to God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although we were chosen before the foundation of the world, the time of our salvation was not yet fulfilled Gal 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the God-created man fell, God came in to knock at the door of Adam s heart in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He called and said, Where are you? v. 9 and preached the gospel to him by saying that the seed of the woman would bruise the serpent s head v. 15 . This word was the gospel and also a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Two thousand years later, at the time of Abraham, God came in to promise Abraham again, saying, In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed Gen 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The seed of Abraham is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After that, two thousand more years passed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Four thousand years after man was created, Jesus Christ was born of a woman and became the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Mary, the one who begot Jesus, was a descendant of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Consequently, Jesus, the One begotten of her, was also a seed of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first page of the New Testament records, The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham Matt 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Following this it says, Abraham begot Isaac; and Isaac begot Jacob..., until the end of the genealogy where Matthan begot Jacob; and Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>15b-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the genealogy of Matthew we see the fulfillment of the promise made to Adam and Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moreover, God s promise to Abraham was fulfilled as well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus bruised the serpent s head, and He is the One in whom all the families of the earth are blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Christ came, He fulfilled the promises in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But before Christ came, God had set up the priesthood in the Old Testament already.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What was there was only a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God required that the Old Testament priests offer up bulls and goats.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These bulls and goats were types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the New Testament, the priests no longer offer bulls and goats.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead, they offer the sinners chosen by God and saved in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we understand why John, born a priest, would not offer bulls and goats when he came out to fulfill his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, he would now offer sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He preached in the wilderness saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near Matt 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If men would repent and confess their sins he would baptize them, offering them up one by one to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John was the first priest of the New Testament and the last priest of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From God s point of view, after John the Baptist, there were no more priests in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The system of service in the Old Testament ceased completely.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, the age had changed.</S>
