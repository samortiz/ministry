JEHOVAH LIFTING UP HIS HAND<br>TO THE NATIONS FOR THE GATHERING<br>OF THE DISPERSED CAPTIVES OF ZION</H2><P>Jehovah will lift up His hand to the nations, and unto the peoples He will lift up His banner for the gathering of the dispersed captives of Zion (vv. 22-26a). Then all flesh will know that Jehovah is the Savior of Zion and her Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob (v. 26b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE REASON FOR ZION'S BEING FORSAKEN</H2><P>In 50:1-3 we have the reason for Zion's being forsaken.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE INSTRUCTION THE SERVANT<br>OF JEHOVAH RECEIVED AND THE LIFE HE LIVED</H2><P>Isaiah 50:4-9 describes the instruction the servant of Jehovah (Isaiah typifying Christ) received and the life he lived.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Instruction the Servant of Jehovah Received</H2><P>Referring to Isaiah as a type of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah, verses 4 and 5 say, "The Lord Jehovah has given me /The tongue of the instructed,/That I should know how to sustain the weary with a word./He awakens me morning by morning;/He awakens my ear/To hear as an instructed one./The Lord Jehovah has opened my ear;/And I was not rebellious,/Nor did I turn back." Christ as the Servant of Jehovah was instructed not by man but by God. Christ did not speak His own word but spoke according to God's instructions. He thus learned how to sustain the weary ones, the weak ones, with a word. Jehovah awakened Him every morning. This indicates that every day the Lord Jesus had a morning revival. Furthermore, the Lord was never rebellious; rather, He was always obedient, listening to the word of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Life the Servant of Jehovah Lived</H2><P>The servant of Jehovah gave his back to those who struck him and his cheeks to those who plucked out the hair. He did not hide his face from humiliation and spitting. The Lord Jehovah helped him; therefore, he was not dishonored. He set his face like a flint, and he knew that he would not be put to shame (vv. 6-7). According to verses 8 and 9, he said, "The One who justifies me is near; who will contend with me?/Let us stand up together! Who is my adversary in judgment [Rom. 8:33a]?/Let him come near to me./Behold, the Lord Jehovah helps me [Rom. 8:31],/Who is the one who condemns me [Rom. 8:34a]?/Behold, they will all wear out like a garment;/The moth will consume them." This is the life Christ as the Servant of Jehovah lived on earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. HOW HE WHO FEARS JEHOVAH<br>AND HEARS THE VOICE OF HIS SERVANT<br>HAS LIGHT WHILE WALKING IN DARKNESS</H2><P>Finally, in verses 10 and 11 we are told how he who fears Jehovah and hears the voice of His servant has light while walking in darkness. Concerning such a one, verse 10b says, "Let him trust in the name of Jehovah,/And rely on his God." Verse 11 goes on to give a warning about self-made light. "Behold, all of you who kindle a fire,/Who surround yourselves with firebrands,/Walk into the light of your fire/And into the firebrands which you have lit./You will have this from My hand:/You will lie down in torment." Those who make light for themselves and walk in their self-made light instead of God's light will suffer torment. This should be a warning to us that we may walk in the light given by God, not in the light we make for ourselves.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_122.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_124.html">Next</a> </body></html>
