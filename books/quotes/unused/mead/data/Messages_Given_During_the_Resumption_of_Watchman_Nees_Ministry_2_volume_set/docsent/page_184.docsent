   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At Home in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once a person touches the Body, he feels happy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One day I was on a ship, and I did not see any brother.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It made my spirit depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here, you have too many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This may cause you to take things for granted.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Kutien, one brother had to travel seven days to visit another brother and had to spend eight days for the return journey.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The traveling alone took him fifteen days.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In our heart, we fellowship with the Christ in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But while we remain in our bodies, we still have to seek for the fellowship of the brothers who are visible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I was invited by someone to visit Hsien-yu, and I thought that I could be back home in one or two months.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But once I was there, I was kept from coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was a foolish thing for me to do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was not until Brother Witness Lee came to me that I returned home.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today, it is not a question of doctrine, but a question of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A man can listen to Charles Spurgeon speak for twelve years and still not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet when he touches life, he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the same way, we only have to touch the Body once.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are coming forward to the heavenly Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There we have Paul and Peter; this heavenly worship also includes us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here is no limitation of time and space; what is theirs is ours also.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By this, the individuals receive the riches of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Scripture Reading: John 12:24; 1 Cor 10:17 THE LIFE OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>AND THE LIVING IN THE BODY Every Life Having Its Own Characteristics,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Demands, and Tastes</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brother Witness Lee:With the Lord's salvation, there is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is different from all teachings, doctrines, religions, or philosophies.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord's salvation does not cause us to do something in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This life has its own demands and characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The fish has the characteristics of a fish, and the bird has the characteristics of a bird.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every living thing has its own characteristics, and each kind of life has its own taste.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fish needs to live in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We do not have to tell the fish, "You should live in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is proper and right."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we eat, the food meets the need within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This need within us causes us to realize that the food is good, sweet, and pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There are things that we do not like.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yet, if you put these things in front of a pig, it may think that they are very good.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the other hand, the food that you like, such as chocolate, oranges, or peaches, may not be appealing to the pig when they are placed before it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why is this so?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is because there is a difference in life that results in a difference in taste.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Living in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>by the Demand of the Body Life</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A person is not a Christian according to teaching, but according to taste.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a matter of the demand of the life within.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only those Christians who live according to this demand and this taste are "standard" Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Why would you not sin after you are saved?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Is it because the Bible teaches you so?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Is it because you are afraid that the church would excommunicate you?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We do not sin because we do not feel comfortable within if we sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We act righteously, live a holy life, and walk in the light because we feel uncomfortable within if we do not do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A Christian loves others because the life within him is a loving life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The life that we have received at salvation is a Body life; it is a corporate life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It demands that you serve God together with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Is it possible for a person to be saved and yet not meet with others?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Will he be happy?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Surely he will not be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some have said that, after a person has been a Christian for a long time, meetings will become tasteless to him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you have lost your taste for the meetings in Shanghai, try to go to Soochow to study the Bible and to pray alone.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Immediately, you will see that this will not meet the inward demand.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The life within demands that we mingle together with all the saints in fellowship and coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By yourself, you can ride in the clouds all alone.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But let me ask you: When Brother Chen Keh-san was in Hsien-yu, was he comfortable?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Did he not feel like a hanging corpse, being neither in heaven nor on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When I arrived at Kulongsu, he was still trying to stay at Hsien-yu.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Of course, in the end he still came.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The first day we spoke, he began to cry.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He said, "For so many years, I did not know where I was."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If your hands remain in your Body, they look fine.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But if the hands are cut off from the Body and are hung on a tree, will they look fine?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If you see such hands, you will surely be startled.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>That would surely be like a hanging corpse.</S>
