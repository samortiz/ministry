   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In 1935 in Chefoo, Brother Nee experienced anew the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After this, he held a conference in Chuanchow, Fukien, and asked me to attend.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There many were helped to experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, with the result that they had power and boldness to witness for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He also preached on the secret of the overcoming life, which is to let Christ live in our stead, according to Paul's testimony in Galatians 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This conference brought in a great revival.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In October 1936, Watchman Nee conducted a co-workers' conference in Kulangsu, Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He cabled me and invited me to attend.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By that time I had become clear concerning the Lord's call and was prepared to resign my teaching job to live by faith and serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While I was seeking the Lord for His guidance, I received Brother Nee's invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I immediately realized that it was the Lord's will for me to attend the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I thank the Lord that at this conference I was given the rare opportunity of listening to Watchman Nee's testimony, which I was later able to publish as three articles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the end of the conference, Brother Nee and the other co-workers assigned me to begin the work in Canton and later in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1937 Watchman Nee began the Lord's work in the southwest part of China in the city of Kunming in Yunnan province.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After establishing the church there, he invited me to come and work in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I picked up the burden and moved my family there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I worked there for three years, until my return to Hong Kong in 1940.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Following World War II, whenever Watchman Nee visited Canton or Hong Kong, I took the opportunity to seek his fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I usually planned to ask him a number of questions, but after having some fellowship with him, it was unnecessary to ask the questions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In our fellowship I always received an abundant supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 1948 I again had opportunity to attend a conference in the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother Nee ministered on the matter of handing over ourselves with all we possess to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His words were full of impact and the power of the Holy Spirit, and the meetings were full of the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many were revived and handed over themselves and their possessions, to be built together in serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the last meeting of the conference, because I was leaving for Foochow, Brother Nee, in the presence of all the assembled brothers and sisters, addressed me in the following words of farewell:</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is only one Christ, but due to different viewpoints and emphases of the workers, it seems that Christ has been divided into many Christs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a worker cannot express to others the one Christ whom God desires to present, his work is a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many today have had very intimate contact with the Lord, while others are merely pressing against Him Mark 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Perhaps some have indeed touched His back, held His hand, or torn His garments; yet they have no relationship whatever with Him in life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Among the many who thronged Jesus, the woman with an issue of blood was not the only one who was ill, but she was the only one healed in life Matt 9:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some today indeed know the Christ of Bethsaida Mark 8:22-26 or the Christ of Gadara Mark 5:1-20 or the Christ of Emmaus Luke 24:13-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In their experience they have really seen the miracles and the wonders.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They may even be able to perform the miracles themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet if there is no true inward revelation, none of these works will amount to anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some may be able to tell others with moving power of a Christ of Emmaus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They may be able to expound the Scriptures and may cause others to become truly fervent in their hearts; yet it is all to no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The real work is to impart a Christ of revelation to others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I speak these words not only to Brother Weigh, but to all the co-workers and to all the brothers and sisters alike.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you and I cannot impart a Christ of revelation to others, our work is a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here we see that there are two basically different stands that a worker of the Lord can take: one emphasizes work, the expounding of the Scriptures, miracles, works of wonders, and answers to prayers, etc. The other presents before men a Christ of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the same year, 1948, from the beginning of June to the end of September, Watchman Nee held a period of training on Mount Kuling, Fukien, for the purpose of training co-workers from all over China.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I attended that training.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every day we spent approximately seven hours listening to Brother Nee and receiving his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I was greatly helped in my spiritual understanding and also in the principles of working for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What he spoke at the training sessions may be summarized as follows:</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>1 How to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>2 How to be a minister of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>3 How to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>4 How to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>5 How to guide new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>6 How to manage church affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There were also meetings for testimonies, in which the participants gave brief testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then Brother Nee made a spiritual diagnosis of each person's testimony, pointing out each one's spiritual difficulties and the way to be delivered from them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>With a keen feeling, he diagnosed accurately so that what he pointed out exactly met the needs of each person.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the co-workers went back to their respective local churches after coming down from the mountain, the Lord abundantly blessed the churches, bringing about enormous revival so that the churches were built up and there was progress in the work, with the result that the gospel was being preached with power, enabling many people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the early part of 1950, Watchman Nee came to Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Soon Witness Lee also joined him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the past it had been a rare occurrence for these two brothers to visit the same church at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Their ministry issued in a great revival in the church in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Previously there had been about three hundred in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As a result of the revival the number increased to between two and three thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There was a special blessing upon the church in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Soon Brother Nee contemplated going back to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The political situation there being then extremely tense, the brothers tried to persuade him not to return to mainland China, but he insisted on doing so, as he was concerned about the churches and co-workers there.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was like the apostle Paul who, on the eve of going to Jerusalem, knew that imprisonment and hardships awaited him there and was ready even to die for the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On account of his love for the Lord, for the church, and for the brothers and sisters, he was in the same frame of mind as Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>During the first year or two after returning to Shanghai, he availed himself of every opportunity to put his heart and soul into the work diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There were then over six hundred local churches throughout the country with over ninety thousand saints, most of whom had received assistance from him in some way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In 1952, on account of his loyalty to the Lord and for the sake of the truth, Brother Nee was unexpectedly arrested and put in jail, being sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In those twenty years it was impossible to get direct news about him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As far as I know, the government made use of him by making him translate scientific books from English into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>His wife, who died before him in November 1971, used to visit him once every two or three weeks and bring him some daily necessities.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Brother Nee's heart was only half as big as a normal person's, and he had been suffering from heart disease for many years, causing him acute pain during fits of illness.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, the Lord preserved his life until May 30, 1972, when he was taken up by the Lord into His bosom for rest.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brother Nee thus rested from his labors, and his works do follow him Rev 14:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although his physical body was confined in prison, the messages which the Lord had imparted to him are being widely spread without any restriction throughout the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>By virtue of the ministry of his words, many saints have had spiritual insight through revelation, the churches have been built up, and many items of truths hitherto hidden in the Bible have been uncovered.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Such books as Brother Nee's Normal Christian Life and Normal Christian Church Life are in great demand in America and Europe and have enabled many people to be enlightened and greatly changed in their spiritual life, thus returning to the ground of unity in local churches and bearing good testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The messages spoken and the work done by God through him in the past half century have been extremely numerous and abundant.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>These three testimonies are but a small part of the happenings before 1936.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>What I have narrated in respect to things which happened between 1928 and 1952 is also very brief.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>From his many books we may notice how clear was our brother's understanding of God and how he dedicated himself; in loyalty and obedience he was willing even to accept death.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He was indeed a vessel much used by God, and, "having served his own generation by the counsel of God, did indeed fall asleep" Acts 13:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He has, indeed, also left "you a model so that you may follow in His steps" 1 Pet 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>May the Lord bless these three testimonies so that each reader will "remember the ones leading you, who have spoken to you the word of God; and considering the issue of their manner of life, imitate their faith" Heb 13:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>To our God and the Lord Jesus be glory for evermore!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Amen.</S>
