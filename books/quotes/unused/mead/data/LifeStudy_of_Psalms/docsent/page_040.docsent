   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. David Seeing the Heavens,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Works of the Lord's Fingers,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Moon and the Stars,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Which the Lord Has Ordained</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>David saw the heavens, the works of the Lord's fingers, the moon and the stars, which the Lord has ordained Psa 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that David had a view turned from looking at the earth to contemplating the heavens, in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the night, if you look at the earth, you will see nothing because of the darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But if you look up to contemplate the heavens, you will see the moon and the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this view David had a pure vision to see the pure work in God's creation and ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the universe there is not only God's creation but also God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>David saw the divine order in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the aim in the Lord's redemption to turn us from the messy earth to the bright heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before we were saved, we were in a messy situation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But after we were saved, our messy earth became a bright heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our view was turned from looking at this messy earth to looking at the bright heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When bad news comes to me, I have to exercise to turn my view to look at the bright heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I turn my view from the bad news and look up to the heavens, I can praise.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must learn to turn our view.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The aim in the Lord's redemption is to turn our view from the earth to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The earth is messy, but the heavens are bright.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>D. What is Man, That the Lord Remembers Him,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>and the Son of Man, That He Visits Him?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Psalm 8:4 David asked, "What is man, that You remember him,/And the son of man, that You visit him?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In his view in the heavens, David turned his consideration to man on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The ordination of the moon and the stars is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then how about man on this earth?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not forget that the psalmist in this psalm is trying the best to bring the heavens down and to bring the earth up to join with the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He looked at the heavens with the moon and the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That is wonderful, but what about man?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may think that man is pitiful, but according to the divine view in this psalm, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Man was pitiful in Adam and in the fallen situation, but today man in Christ is not pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The man in Christ is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Three portions of the Word speak of the same thing concerning man Genesis 1, Psalm 8, and Hebrews 2.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is revealed in Psalm 8 was first spoken of in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Genesis 1 says that man was commissioned with the authority to rule over all the created things vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>26, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Psalm 8 repeats this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then in Hebrews 2:6-8 Paul quotes Psalm 8.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These three portions of the Word show us that man has been in three stages: created in Genesis 1, fallen in Psalm 8, and redeemed in Hebrews 2.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This redeemed man is no longer in a pitiful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is joined to Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, Jesus, the incarnated God, first joined Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now in His redemption we are joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is an organic union between Him and us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ has passed through human living, and He died to solve our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then He resurrected and ascended to be crowned and enthroned with glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was breathed into us and poured out upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today He is both in the heavens and also within us and outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What kind of men are we?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are men who have been mingled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Man is the central object of God in His creation for the accomplishment of His economy to fulfill His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The first "man" in Psalm 8:4 is enosh in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Enosh means a fragile, weak man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The second "man" in 8:4 is adam in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Both enosh and adam in this verse refer to the God-created man in God's creation in Genesis 1:26; the Satan-captured man in man's fall in Psalm 8:4; and Christ as a man in His incarnation for the accomplishment of God's redemption in Hebrews 2:6.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should not forget Genesis 1, Psalm 8, and Hebrews 2.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These three portions cover the three stages of man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Such a man God remembers in His economy and visits in His incarnation John 1:14; Phil 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thank God for His remembrance, and thank God for His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He remembered us in His economy, and He visited us in His incarnation.</S>
