   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF ITS STRUCTURE 5 Scripture Reading: Rev 21:11, 18-21; John 19:34; Matt 13:45-46; John 3:5; Gen 2:12b; 1 Cor 3:12a THE GREATEST ALLEGORY IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible is not a book of religion, philosophy, or something invented by the human mentality, but it is God s revelation of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible, of course, covers many things but its focus and very central thought is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our human life is a mystery and the divine life is even more abstract and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No human words in human language can fully utter the mystery of this divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, God exercised His wisdom to reveal such a mystery concerning His divine life by many allegories.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many Bible students and teachers are insistent upon not using too many allegories.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul, however, in Galatians 4 said that Sarah and Hagar and each of their sons were an allegory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sarah and Hagar represented two covenants vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without Paul s writing in Galatians 4 none of us would dream that these two women were an allegory of the two covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul, though, received this revelation probably with the realization that it would be hard for us to understand the two covenants in such a marvelous way without the allegory of these two women.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Also, the Lord Jesus and the other apostles pointed out items in the Old Testament which were allegories to reveal the unutterable revelations of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The greatest allegory in the Bible is in its last two chapters, and this allegory is the ultimate consummation of the divine revelation the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Throughout the centuries, the New Jerusalem has been a puzzle to all the students and teachers of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, in the last thirty years by the Lord s mercy, this puzzle has been brought into a fuller light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order for us to receive a vision of the holy city we need to be uplifted to a high mountain that we may see God s dwelling place for the fulfilling of His eternal purpose Rev 21:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE DIVINE TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this one allegory it is possible for one to see nearly every single divine point revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we know the Bible, we can see that the most central and most mysterious point in it is the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The main and basic structure of this allegory of the New Jerusalem is the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not possible to understand the structure of this allegory unless you enter into the entire Bible to see all the points revealed concerning the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The divine Trinity is the most basic and chief attribute of God s divine Person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Love, light, and life are a few of the many attributes of God s divine Person, but the most basic attribute of God is the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is easier to explain what love, light, and grace are as attributes of God, but it is really hard for anyone to define what the divine Trinity is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The divine Trinity is the greatest and the basic attribute of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first divine title revealed in the Bible implies God in His Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word for God in Genesis 1:1 is Elohim which is plural in number.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then in Genesis 1:26, God refers to Himself as Us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Bible there is one God, but this one God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By studying the sixty-six books of the Bible, we can conclude that the divine Trinity is for His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, He dispenses Himself into His chosen people, and this dispensing is the main operation, the main goal, of God s being triune.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The divine Trinity is for the divine dispensing, and this dispensing consummates in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the New Jerusalem there are three gates on four sides and the New Jerusalem is constructed with three basic elements gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The reason why the number three is so prevalent in the New Jerusalem is that this number represents the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this chapter and in the remaining chapters we will see that every aspect of the New Jerusalem is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without such an allegory, it would be impossible to understand such a divine mystery of God dispensing Himself to consummate in a wonderful, divine building the New Jerusalem.</S>
