It is as if the former were 'wearing Western attire' and the latter 'Chinese gowns,' so that no one can see the relationship between them
The book of Exodus is called Exodus because the passover lamb enabled the children of Israel to go out of Egypt
After the children of Israel kept the passover, left Egypt, and reached the wilderness, God wanted them to build a tabernacle for Him
When we come to the end of Exodus in chapter forty, we see a tabernacle erected and filled with the glory of God
Calamus, which grows in a marsh or muddy place, signifies resurrection, and the fragrance of cassia has the power to repel poisonous insects
From the foregoing points, we can see that it is not enough for us to have only the New Testament; we also need the Old Testament
In the New Testament we can see the holy anointing oil, the anointing, but we cannot find its ingredients and its functions
In Exodus we can see how the tabernacle was built, what kind of materials were used, and what kind of a situation was there
Most would say that it is because the lampstands give forth light, and the churches also give forth light and shine in today's dark age
The lamb, the tabernacle, and the holy anointing oil can be found in the classics; so also the golden lampstand is found in the classics
In Exodus we find not only the lamb and the tabernacle but also the holy anointing oil and the golden lampstand
In John's writings we find not only the Lamb and the tabernacle but also the holy anointing oil and the golden lampstand
Exodus is the seedbed, the nursery, with the seeds sown and the sprouts growing; John's writings are a big farmland, no longer a nursery
In Exodus the golden lampstand, which is Christ, is uniquely one; in Revelation the golden lampstands being seven are many
Just as Christ is the golden lampstand, so every local church is also a golden lampstand, exactly the same, without any difference
It has a shaft with six branches going out from its sides, three branches on the right side and three branches on the left side
Just as the substance of a table is wood and the substance of a book is paper, so the substance of the golden lampstand is gold
The lampstand in its substance signifies God the Father; in the golden lampstand we see the substance, the nature, of God the Father
The one talent of gold in the golden lampstand, however, is not a pile of gold; it has a solid form, which signifies the incarnated Christ
We cannot find the full explanation in the Old Testament; there is a partial answer in the book of Zechariah, but it is not clear enough
When we come to Revelation, we see that the seven lamps are not only the seven eyes but also the seven Spirits of God
The seven lamps are the seven eyes, the seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God, and the seven Spirits of God are the Holy Spirit
Formerly, as a 'churchgoer,' a brother could strike his wife after coming home from a Sunday worship service and have no problem
Sometimes a husband may speak a harsh word, but as the wife is about to talk back, the light shines strongly on her
It is for this reason that many of us can testify that since we came into the church, there is not much quarreling in our homes
The substance of the golden lampstand is God the Father, its form is God the Son, and its expression is God the Spirit
Matthew 4 tells us that when He went to Galilee in particular, a great light shined over those sitting in the region and shadow of death
Revelation says that the Spirit of God as the seven Spirits is not only the seven eyes of God but also the seven eyes of the Lamb
According to its substance, the lampstand is one; according to its development, function, and administration, the lampstand is seven
Our God is the Triune God; He is the Father as the substance, the Son as the form, and the Spirit as the expression
We praise the Lord that this Christ as the one grain of wheat was buried in the ground and died, and He resurrected to become many grains!
The revelation concerning the golden lampstand, which is first mentioned in Exodus 25, is the same in principle
In Revelation 11, these two olive trees, the two anointed ones, the two sons of oil, are the two witnesses who are coming
After many believers are raptured to the heavens, the testimony of God on this earth will fall upon these two witnesses
The main point however is that in Exodus there is the golden lampstand but not the olive oil it is in Zechariah 4 that the oil is mentioned
Concerning the lampstand with the two olive trees by its sides, the prophet Zechariah asks, 'What are these, sir'?
There is even a group of so-called seekers of spirituality who say, 'We only care for Christ; we don't care for the church'
In April 1957, several brothers who came from England and Denmark greatly appraised the audience attending a big conference held in Taipei
One day, we sat down to have some tea in the workers' house, and while we were enjoying the tea, we seized the opportunity to speak
They thought that we were good in everything but regrettably had a 'fly in the ointment,' that is, the matter of the church
After that time a small number of younger coworkers were affected by them and began to shout the slogan We want Christ but not the church
Twenty years of history proves to us that those who want Christ but not the church are finished; they are through and have nothing
Zechariah 3:9 says that these seven eyes are also the seven eyes of the stone; therefore, this stone is equal to the Lamb
The seven lamps are the seven eyes, the seven eyes are the seven Spirits, and the seven Spirits are the seven lamps
Some portions in the Bible are very difficult to understand, and we should only take care of what we can understand'
If we ask the theologians and study all their expository books, we cannot find anything that tells us that the lampstand is the Triune God
He saw that the box was very attractive, and he appreciated the box; that was the extent of his 'vision' and 'revelation'
All these precious truths are in the Bible, but because we are too shallow, we have not seen them or entered into them
In Acts 3:15 Peter preached the gospel, saying, 'The Author of life you killed, whom God has raised from the dead'
In 4:11 he said, 'This is the stone which was considered as nothing by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner'
God opened the grave and brought that small stone out of the tomb and made it the first, the head, of the corner
We all know that the lampstand is for giving light and for shining and that the stone is for the building of God's eternal dwelling place
The first building of God was the tabernacle, within which was the lampstand, and later in the temple there was also the golden lampstand
Still later, the temple was destroyed, and in the restoration and rebuilding of the temple in Zechariah 4, the lampstand reappeared
The resurrected Christ is Jehovah, but now Jehovah is a stone, and this stone is for the building of God's dwelling place
In Zechariah 4 He is for the restoration, the rebuilding, of the temple, whereas in Revelation 1 He is for the building of the church
Revelation deals with God's building, which begins with the church and reaches the New Jerusalem as its eternal goal
Dear brothers and sisters, when we put all these things together, we can see a picture that is better than a thousand words
Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
Today the Lord needs the testimony of the lampstand; He needs the churches as the lampstands in every locality
It does not matter whether our number is big or small; what matters are the brightness of the lamps and the shining of the gold
The church being the reprint of the Spirit with Christ cannot be clearly explained even with thousands of words
The seven lamps of the lampstand are the seven eyes of Jehovah ; naturally, this shows that the lampstand is Jehovah
We can say that the lampstand equals Jehovah, Jehovah equals the Lamb, the Lamb equals the stone, and the stone equals God
Even though the Lord Jesus did say this, today's theologians do not speak much about it because they do not understand it clearly
The Bible says that this lampstand is Jehovah, Jehovah is the Lamb, the Lamb is the stone, and the stone is God
It is true that the golden lampstand is the Triune God, but this Triune God is not without a relationship with man
Joshua was the priest, and Zerubbabel as a descendant of David represents the royal family, the royal authority
There was the foundation stone, then there was the cornerstone to join the walls together, and then there was the topstone above
The Bible tells us that the Lord Jesus is the foundation stone, the cornerstone, and the topstone of God's building
The Lord Jesus as the material for Gods building has seven eyes upon Him not as the foundation stone or the cornerstone but as the topstone
In Matthew 21:42 the Lord Jesus told the Jews that the stone which they rejected was made by God to be the cornerstone
The Jews despised this stone; they showed no respect to this stone, considering it merely a small stone from Nazareth of Galilee
The Bible says that He has no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him
Let us repeat, using the stone as a figure: When He was in the flesh, He was a small stone from Nazareth, having no splendor or brilliance
The divine nature is unchanged, just as pure gold cannot change, but the humanity which He had put on was changed
John 1:12 says, 'But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name'
The record in John 1:42 tells us that when Peter was brought before the Lord, the Lord immediately changed his name
That was to remind him once again that he was a stone, and upon the rock of that revelation the Lord would build His church
Later, in his first Epistle, Peter said that the Lord is a living stone and we come to Him also as living stones
The church is a group of muddy people, people of clay, into whom a new nature has entered, by a new birth, to make them people of stone
You were really clay, but one day you were saved and the pure gold came into you, but others could not see much stone in you
In 1 Corinthians 3:12 Paul said that we should build upon Christ as the foundation with gold, silver, and precious stones
Whether we are clay, just a stone, or a precious stone is not a matter of addition but a matter of transformation
The ultimate aggregate of the golden lampstand is the church, and the church is the reprint of the golden lampstand
Unless we contact him for a longer time, we are not even sure whether he has been saved, regenerated, or has God's life
The pure gold needs to increase, the clay needs to be transformed, and even the stones need to be transformed into precious stones
If we build with wood, grass, and stubble, the more work we do, the more fuel for fire we have; we would be better off doing less
If we have mud, we must empty it and dry it up; if we have clay, we must transform it into stones and precious stones
Today in the Lord's recovery the light has been intensified, so it is not possible for anyone to drift along blindly
To do something just to get by is completely worthless, and to go through the motions without sincerity is valueless
We have seen the Triune God, God's relationship with man, the Lamb's redemption, Christ as God's building material, and God Himself
The children of God throughout the ages have only had a one-sided and fragmented understanding concerning the church
They do not have the thorough light from God to see that the church is entirely a matter of the golden lampstand
Revelation 1:4 says, 'From Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne'
The throne of God is the center of His administration, and upon His throne He executes His eternal policy and eternal purpose
There was no opening above or below, on the left or on the right, or at the front or at the back of the tabernacle
In the Holy Place there was a golden lampstand, which had not only one lamp but seven lamps shining and illumining
Whenever science, literature, or philosophy are mentioned, his 'moon' grows bigger and his 'sun' radiates the light of his knowledge
In contrast, some of the young people have only been in the church for two or three years, yet they know God's eternal economy
Do not forget that in the realm of God's presence, the light is neither sunlight nor moonlight, but the light of the golden lampstand
When a priest entered into the tabernacle, his actions were dependent upon the shining of these seven bright lamps
Outside of the church is the natural view, but not the light of revelation which shines out of God's lampstand
For this reason, not only non-Christians but even many Christians do not know what God's economy, God's administration, is
What they meant by this was that children must try their best to seek God's will so that they may know how to obey their parents
It is not a matter of fabric shoes versus leather shoes; it is a matter of God's administration, God's economy
The light of the golden lampstand is the light of the Holy Place not the light of the sky nor that of the sun the moon or anything natural
Today in certain places, especially in America, some people feel very unhappy when they hear us say that we are the church
Even if they hang a signboard outside which reads, 'We are the church,' once people come in, it is pitch dark and there is no light
As to whether or not a meeting is the church, the key factor is whether or not the lampstand is there and people see light when they meet
It is not that anyone who claims to be the church is the church; the question is whether or not people touch light when they come in
A certain place may have a preacher who is born with sophisticated eloquence, a sonorous voice, and clear enunciation
People may be very touched after listening to him, but there still may be no light, and their vision is pitch dark
When we come to the church meetings, even before the reading of the Bible, even as soon as we are seated, we are enlightened!
Not only are we clear about wearing leather shoes versus fabric shoes; we are also clear concerning the course of our whole life
We know God's eternal purpose, His heart's intention, and His economy, and we also know which path we should take for the journey before us
In 1 Samuel 3, when Samuel ministered to Jehovah as a child before Eli, 'the lamp of God had not yet gone out'
The priests had to burn the incense when they dressed the lamps in the morning and when they lit them in the evening
Whether or not the lamps of a local church are bright is absolutely related to the priests' burning of incense before God
The reason that the lamps are not bright is that the service, the priesthood, and the burning of incense are absent
When we light the lamps at night, we have to burn the incense, and when we dress the lamps in the morning, we also have to burn the incense
If our conference were merely a gathering of people in Christianity, this would be an exceedingly great failure
Many can testify that when we turned to the church we immediately saw that Gods light is here and we came to know Gods economy and His way
When we read Revelation 1, we should not waste much thought to study whether the seven golden lampstands are on earth or in heaven
The seven lamps are the lamps of fire burning before the throne; they are not feeble lights but burning lamps of fire
We may say that the seven lamps of fire illuminate us so that whatever our inward condition is, it cannot be concealed
According to Revelation 4, the emphasis of the seven burning lamps of fire is neither on shining nor on burning
A brother once wrote and asked me, 'In the Life-study of Romans, you said that the law as the complete testimony of God testifies Him fully
The morality of the law has not been abolished; on the contrary, it was raised higher by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 5
On the one hand, the morality of the law has been uplifted; on the other hand, the ceremonies of the law have been abolished
There is another aspect we should know: The seven burning lamps of fire are for the move of God's administration
After this conference, the young brothers and sisters in Taipei may go back and say, 'We were exhausted in the last ten days
The brothers from the other countries in Southeast Asia may say, 'Oh, in Taipei we were scolded by Brother Lee!
You should also work on the children until each week there are at least ten thousand children being taught by us
If we had worked from that time until now, 1977, ten thousand children would have become high schoolers of sixteen to seventeen years of age
In this way, the number of children and young people added together would be at least twenty to thirty thousand
Lightnings, voices, and thunders come forth out of the throne, and before the throne are seven burning lamps of fire for impelling us
When the seven lamps of fire are burning in the local churches, will all the churches in the different localities start moving?
Today we are not only in the Holy Place; we are before the throne, which is the center of God's administration
The land for the meeting halls of several principal churches on this island were purchased with the money from my ministry here
Praise the Lord, He has given us what we have not asked for, even superabundantly above all that we ask or think
In the previous message, we saw that the seven lamps of the golden lampstand ultimately become the seven lamps of fire
After a period of time, we can see a sprout coming forth, but it is so small that it is difficult to distinguish what the plant is
Most of the biblical revelations are sown as seeds in Genesis, but a small number are sown in the second book, Exodus
If anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble, the work of each will become manifest'
If our work in the church is gold, silver, and precious stones, that is excellent, for it can stand the test of fire
With the seven lamps, there are not only the enlightening and the burning, but also there is judgment in the burning
Do not forget that the golden lampstand in Exodus has the shining lamps, whereas in Revelation it has the burning lamps
In Revelation, however, the golden lampstand not only shines, but it has advanced from shining to become burning lamps of fire
We all like to testify that we saw the light when we came into the church, but what did the light do shortly afterwards?
When some first came into the church they saw the light but within a few days this light began to burn and it burned one thing after another
Let them go ahead and fight, but if they want to be the church, they have to take the bitter medicine and experience the burning
If we speak them to people, they will think that we are crazy because they do not understand what we are talking about
We know that the golden lampstand is Jehovah, and Jehovah, the God who has a relationship with us, is our Lamb
The church is the golden lampstand, the golden lampstand is Jehovah, Jehovah is the Lamb, the Lamb is the stone, and the stone is God
It is too mysterious, but we can state it in this way: The church is the reproduction of the Spirit with Christ
The golden lampstand is first a matter of the enlightening of the seven lamps and then of the burning of the lamps of fire
Judges 7 tells us that when God wanted Gideon to smite the Midianites, Gideon had over thirty thousand men with him
One may say that they are sometimes fearful and sometimes lovely, but whether the eyes are fearful or lovely depends not on Him but on us
When we come to the church meetings, we feel that we are sitting before the Lord and that His eyes are looking at us
Transformation is not a change caused by a shining light; rather, it is the transfusing of the Lord's lovable person into us
After such a prayer at the beginning of the week, we may start 'crawling on the ground' the same night and continue for the whole week
They will not be able to describe it, but they will sense that there is something wonderful in us and that we have had a great change
If we are not in the Holy Place, we do not have the lampstand, and without the lampstand, we cannot have the seven eyes
Some elderly sisters can testify that many times after coming to the meetings, they cannot remember anything that was said
They do remember that when they go to the meetings, something touches them and enters into them, although they cannot explain it clearly
That is why after going to a meeting on the Lords Day they still go on the following Tuesday and they make it a rule to go again on Thursday
After coming to meet with us and listening to two messages, they say, people are 'glued,' and they go to the meeting hall every day
Whether or not we are the church does not depend on outward organization; it depends on whether there are the seven eyes among us
Even if one is a highly educated and intelligent university professor, this does not mean that he has the proper understanding
They could not speak Mandarin properly or read the Bible smoothly, but when they listened to my messages, they understood every single one
If we use our mind to speak mere knowledge, although we can make a professor understand us, there is no transfusion of God
Some people are very eloquent, and when they give a sermon, it is like music, but in the end there is no transfusion of God
When two very intimate people speak with one other, they may not necessarily use their mouth; instead, they may use their eyes
In the same way, after we have been in the church for a long period of time, what God is, what the Lord is, is gradually infused into us
When a battery is fully charged it can run for two days but when its electricity is almost used up it has to be brought back for recharging
The church is the golden lampstand and the seven lamps on the golden lampstand are the lamps of fire which after burning us become the eyes
If we enter into a meeting and do not have the sense of transfusion, we have to question whether it is really the church
Perhaps it is the church, but it is not proper; it has problems because it does not give light or transfuse God
The seven lamps are the seven Spirits, the seven eyes are also the seven Spirits, and the seven Spirits are the Holy Spirit
After sitting down for two minutes, a certain power or condition that is unexplainable begins to touch us from within
Originally we did not have a proper heart and were indifferent, but just by sitting in the meeting, we are touched within
Perhaps in the meeting no one speaks either of the Holy Spirit or of the transfusion of God, but we are touched simply by sitting there
Eventually, our function is manifested in the church, and we grow in life and are built up together with others
We are not only enlightened, burned, and infused, but we also receive the supply of life and are equipped in life
In Exodus when the children of Israel were thirsty in their wandering in the wilderness, God told Moses to take his rod and smite the rock
At the end of Exodus there is the tabernacle and at the conclusion of his writings John also says Behold the tabernacle of God is with men
John speaks about this in a marvelous way, saying that if anyone thirsts, he may come to the Lord Jesus and drink
When we drink the water supplied by the Lord Jesus, we become 'small rocks,' each one flowing out rivers of living water, river after river
In Exodus the water that flowed out of the rock was a figure, a sign, a symbol, a picture, portraying a spiritual condition
Before the Lord was smitten, before He as the smitten rock was cleft, the Holy Spirit was already there, but 'the Spirit' was not yet
Perhaps they would ask Paul, 'The rock smitten by Moses was on the mountain, and it remained there after it had been smitten
Orthodox traditional theologians believe in the Nicene Creed, which was established in the council held in Nicaea in A
Prior to that time in the second and third centuries the debates among the early Bible scholars the socalled church fathers reached a peak
He accepted Christianity as the state religion of Rome and encouraged the Roman people to be baptized and join the church
325 he issued a decree to gather all the Bible scholars, including the bishops in different places, to Nicaea for a council
The chairman of that council was Constantine himself, and the bishops, the Bible scholars, debated in front of him
Despite the addition of this further word, regardless of how we study the creeds, we still cannot find the seven Spirits
Thank the Lord, at that time we became clear that we should not take any creed as our basis because the creeds are incomplete
Before Columbus's time, people thought that the earth was flat or square; they did not know that the earth is round
325, those Bible scholars, those bishops, who came together knew the Bible, but the measure of their knowledge was small
At that time, the ordinary people's knowledge of the Bible was at most 'size five,' so they were able to wear that small pair of shoes
Today the 'feet' of Christians' knowledge of the Bible are 'size eight,' yet they try to put them into 'size-five shoes'
They say that we should take the creeds as our basis, but the creeds do not say anything about the seven Spirits
We thank and praise the Lord that we have not only Matthew John Acts Romans 1 and 2 Corinthians and the other Epistles but also Revelation
Recently, a number of us went to the Holy Land to see Jerusalem, but before that we also went to see Rome and the Vatican
In the Vatican there is a cathedral, inside which, on the walls of every room, are the best ancient oil paintings
The Father is that white-bearded old father, the Son is that middle-aged son, and the Holy Spirit is the dove flying above
Since the eyes are a part of the body, the seven eyes of the Lamb are a part of the Lamb; the two cannot be divided
Once we separate the living water from the rock, the living water is without a source, and the rock is without a flow
Exodus refers to the flowing of the living water and Johns writings also speak of the flowing of the living water but there is a difference
When we first came into the church, we sensed that there was light here, and we sensed the shining of the light
During times of shining we discover that we are not all right we feel that we are not as good as others and we feel that we are too pitiful
We abhor ourselves; sometimes we beat our breast and hate ourselves, thinking that we are the most wicked persons on earth
We confess and weep, and the fire continues to burn for twenty more minutes until there is nothing more to burn
The living water flows within us; first it washes us, then it waters us, quenches our thirst, and supplies life to us
After passing through this experience for half an hour, we neither say that we are the best or that we are the worst
Due to this, the water no longer flows within him, and there is no more shining or burning; everything is dark again
After another two days, he attends morning watch again-thank the Lord for the blessed morning watch, a place of blessing
Rather, he was offended because he was wrong, peculiar, unwilling to get into the flow, and reluctant to submit to others
Because of this, he cannot receive anything in the meeting, and after he goes home, he is so angry that he cannot sleep the whole night
After a few days, however, his wife observes that he is not doing anything except rejoicing, and she begins to rebuke him
Whether there is more burning after the flowing depends on whether there is anything more in us that needs burning
There is a river of water of life flowing in us for us to be watered, saturated, and supplied and for us to supply others
Some are still in Revelation 4 with lightnings, voices, thunders, and seven lamps of fire burning before the throne
When fire is needed, there is fire, and when water is needed, there is water, but fire is not the goal; it is the procedure
We will only need the light to shine for our move and the water to supply us; we will not need fire to judge or burn us
In the presence of God, He is the light and Christ is the lamp, and out from Him flows the Spirit as our living water
