   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE INITIAL SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BECOMING THE UNITING SPIRIT 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that genuine oneness is possible only in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus has brought us into the Father, where He is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before we were saved, we were outside the Father, and we had nothing to do with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But now that we have been saved, we have been transferred into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, we still need to be with Christ in the glory of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be in the Father s glory is to be in the Father s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In a very real sense, all genuine Christians are in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, very few can truly say that they are in the Father s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In John 17 the genuine oneness of the believers is related to the two occurrences of the word in : in the Father and in the glory of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first in indicates that we have been saved, whereas the second indicates that we are one in the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By the Lord s mercy and grace, we are one with Him where He is, in the Father and in the Father s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to understand the oneness in John 17, we need the type, the picture, of the tabernacle in Exodus 26.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The oneness in the Triune God is very profound; it is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, it is difficult for us to explain or define.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because this is the case with many spiritual realities in the Bible, there are types depicting the details of them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because the oneness revealed in John 17 is abstract and mysterious, we cannot understand it adequately without the type in the book of Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The tabernacle is a picture of the building up of the New Testament believers into God s dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the Old Testament tabernacle was erected, it was filled with the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From that time onward, the tabernacle became God s dwelling place on earth, the place where His glory rested.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BUILDED ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Old Testament tabernacle there were forty-eight boards.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The number forty-eight is composed of six times eight.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The number six signifies the natural man, and the number eight signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the number forty-eight signifies people who were formerly in the natural man but who have now become believers and have come into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When these believers are put together, or, to use a New Testament term, are built up together, they become the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The oneness for which the Lord Jesus prayed in John 17 is this building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In John 14 through 17 we find the concept of building.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In John 14 the Lord Jesus says that He and the Father will come to the one who loves Him and will make Their abode with him v. 23 . Then in chapter fifteen the Lord says, Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, in John 17 He prays concerning this abode, which is simply the oneness of His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If there is no oneness among the believers in Christ, how can there be any abode, any dwelling place, for God on earth today?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The oneness, which is the building, in actuality is the church built up in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many Christians talk about the church, but to them the word church is an empty term.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For God s dwelling place to be a reality in a practical way, there must be the builded oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The oneness among the believers is the building up of the believers into one abode.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we consider the picture of the tabernacle, we see both the details of this oneness and the steps by which we reach it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the foregoing message, we pointed out that, in themselves, the forty-eight standing boards are separate from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No matter how close to one another they may be, they still are separate.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The oneness among the standing boards is not in the boards themselves, but in the gold that overlays them, links them, and unites them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Each of the boards was overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, it was the gold that made the tabernacle one unit as God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, God s dwelling place was constituted of the practical oneness of the boards.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without such a oneness, it is impossible for God to have a dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THREE FUNCTIONS OF THE GOLD</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Concerning the standing boards in the tabernacle, the gold has three functions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One of these functions is that of overlaying the boards.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, as we shall see, this is not the first function.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Another function of the gold, seen in the golden rings, is that of linking the boards together.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eventually, the uniting function of the gold is seen in the golden bars.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, the three functions of the gold are overlaying, linking, and uniting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to our natural concept, we may think that the boards were first overlaid with gold and that the rings were then welded to the gold that overlaid the boards.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, if the rings had been welded to the overlaying gold, they would not have been strong enough to bear the weight of the boards.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I believe that the golden rings were placed on the boards directly, although I do not know by what means.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before the boards were overlaid with gold, the golden rings were attached to them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After that, the boards were overlaid with gold and then united by the golden bars.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, the initial function of the gold was the attaching of the golden rings to the boards.</S>
