   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Three</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Kwang-hsi:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>May you be greatly strengthened and graced!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From The Open Door I have realized that you are constantly engaged in outdoor evangelistic work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My heart is greatly comforted by this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We preach the gospel here once, twice, or three times a week.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But I would say that what you are doing is the real gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I only ask that the Lord would give us more time to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we need one or two hours to prepare in prayer for a message to believers, we need at least three or four hours to prepare ourselves in prayer for a message to unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you agree with this, please pray for me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Leland Wang has returned to Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sister Ding is in Sitiawan, and Brother Wilson is here.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He meets often at the Gospel Hall and preaches here five or six times.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord has used him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Peace be to you!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Greetings to all the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brother Faithful Luk, August 12</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Cebu, Malaysia</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sister Lee in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The work here has been much blessed, and many people are seeking after the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord has moved the heart of Mr. X in the parish, who is now quite sympathetic towards our work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is reading many of the books from the Gospel Book Room.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have only read half of Rethinking Our Work, but he has read it all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Except for the Lord's work through this person, I would not have been able to stay here.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have practically traveled through this whole place.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I still look to the Lord for His leading in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Please do not forget to pray for the work, for Mr. X, and for me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I feel very weak and in need of perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord willing, I will go to Singapore to receive help from the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Bible Studies for Beginners is very suitable for our use here.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every time I buy some copies, they are distributed quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A month ago a few elderly brothers asked me to help them study the Bible at my sister's home.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>May the Lord bless this book.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sister Hwang Bi-gwe</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A Letter from Hsu Jung-jieh,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yunnan Province</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Dear Sister Ruth in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>...I went with Brother Hu to Li-Suh with no other intention than to observe the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thank the Lord that He has shown me some light concerning the future of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Both Brother Hu and I have the same leading and have decided to advance to Sikang through the upper tributary of Nu River.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The natives around Nu River a branch of the eastern tribe are more zealous for the Lord's gospel than the natives of Li-Suh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These natives from the Nu River have invited Brother Hu to work there.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are also part of the fruit of Brother Hu's former work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, we have decided that we will not do anything more than testify among them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We want to go to Gung-Shan County at the upper course of the Nu River and preach the gospel, because the gospel has not reached that part yet.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the Lord grants us the grace, a few local churches will be set up to shine for the Lord, and all the Nu natives in search of the truth will come and turn to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, the journey is full of danger, and we need your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In traveling to Li-Suh, we had to cut through wild mountains, shrubs, and forests.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The paths are narrow, winding, and difficult to access.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sometimes we have to cross water, and sometimes we have to climb up cliffs with the help of creeping tendrils.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sometimes the rain washes away the roads, and we have to crawl along precipitous cliffs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The danger is great.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We heard that the Nu River is more dangerous than the terrain.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever I travel along the mountain paths, I think of our Lord seeking for lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then my strength is renewed, and I thank the Lord for His great grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In two or three weeks I will begin the journey with Brother Hu.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Part of Sikang province, east of the Jin-Sha River, is under the jurisdiction of Szechuan province.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There are altogether eight or nine counties here.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The area west of the Jin-Sha River is under the jurisdiction of the Tibetan government.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Han Chinese who enter Tibetan land must pass through checkpoints, just as Westerners do.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The procedure is quite troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, Tibetan merchants traveling to Yunnan do not need to pass through checkpoints; there is a great difference.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I heard that Han merchants doing business in Tibet do not encounter much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The only kind of people who encounter troubles are those who do not have a job and who carry propaganda materials.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, it is not easy for us to enter Tibet and the Tibetan-ruled Sikang region to preach the gospel there.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lama religion exercises great influence over this area, and there are obstacles everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We ask that the brothers and sisters pray much for us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Peace to you in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>My greetings to Sisters Wang and Chang.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, July 9</S>
