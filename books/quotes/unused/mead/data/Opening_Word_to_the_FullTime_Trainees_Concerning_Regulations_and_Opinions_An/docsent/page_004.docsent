   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The full-time training is the top and strictest teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is a regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We Christians who want to serve the Lord need this kind of teaching, this kind of training, this kind of regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the training, you are restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is as if you are put into a box.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of course, this box is not a coffin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I once went to visit a certain locality, and the brothers there put me into an apartment with a small shower.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was taking a shower, it was very difficult for me to move around freely.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I had been used to taking a shower in a larger area, without hitting any of the four walls.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But that small shower regulated me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was a small box that restricted me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I could not be so free or loose with my actions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is an example of being restricted and regulated from being too free, too loose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such restriction and regulation helps you to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now you have dedicated yourself to being full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You are not going to do a business or a job; you are going to carry out a heavenly commission, a divine commission, the commission of the King.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The royal family in Great Britain has to train a king or a queen from the time of his or her youth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without such training, one could never be a king.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He would not be qualified to be a king.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You do not need any training to be a hippie or a loose person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But to be a king, you need the top training, and the top training is the strictest regulation to help you grow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We Christians must be regulated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I was teaching the thirty items of human character, some so-called spiritual people told me that I was teaching something which contradicted my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They said that I always ministered life to people but that now I was teaching people about human character, which was building up human effort.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But they did not understand the proper experience of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The growth in life, our human being s growth in the divine life, needs regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every regulation results in a certain character trait.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first trait of a proper character according to my learning is genuineness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You must be genuine, real, true.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our human life is neither real nor true.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is false and vain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By our natural life we are vain, empty, and untrue.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How can we be genuine?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How can we be true?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How can we be real?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By the growth of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more we grow in the divine life, the more we become genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only the growth of the divine life in you will swallow up all of your falsehood and vanity to make you so real, genuine, and true.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Another trait of a proper character is to be exact.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How can we be exact?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to grow in the divine life, and this growth needs the regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let me illustrate in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If four brothers would always be with you, you would be regulated on four sides every day.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the full-time training, you are surrounded by people and you have assigned roommates.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Deep within your being, however, you would like to stay in a room by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You do not like anyone to stay and sleep in one room with you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You might say, "I even don't like a room just for two.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I want a room for me alone."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All that you care about is "me" me the first; me the second; me the third; me the last; me forever.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You like to be free.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be free means not to be regulated.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may not like to be regulated by anybody.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But when you are not regulated, you are through with the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To put you in the training is to put you in an environment for your growth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The training is the best environment for you to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I encourage all of you to remain here for a full term of four months.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not quit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not ask for a leave.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Stay to the end. To the end means to the termination.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You have to be here to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then you will go back with a lot of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Sisters, you will greatly surprise your mother when you go back.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She will be shocked at your growth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is not according to some philosophical thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is fully revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Life grows by regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Everybody likes marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But to some extent, eventually everybody hates marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whether you like marriage or you hate marriage, it is God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Marriage is merely, purely, and thoroughly a matter of regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To get married is to get into regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>No one can regulate a brother as much as his wife can, and no one can regulate a sister as much as her husband can.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Many people in the world cannot suffer this kind of regulation, so they quit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They either separate from each other or they get a divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They would not take the yoke ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Each dear wife and husband is a lovely yoke.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Every day the husband is a yoke to his wife, and the wife is a yoke to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>A family is also a great factor of troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All these troubles come to regulate you.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If you submit yourself to this regulation, this will help you to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The regulation of the family helps you to grow in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The divine life does not grow in an easy environment.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It grows only in a hard, troublesome, difficult environment.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The full-time training is a troublesome factor.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>All the lessons assigned to you and all the teachers will be troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In the first few days you may love the lessons and the teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But after a while you may begin to hate the training with all the classes, regulations, lessons, and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is a clear word to let you know that the full-time training is not a utopia.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The training will be like the small shower to which I referred.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The whole training will be a narrow shower to narrow you down.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This will help you to grow.</S>
