   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAMB</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What was the purpose of Christ becoming flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first reason was that He could be our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was God in the beginning, and then He became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 1:29 then tells us that He is the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He became flesh that He might be the redeeming Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In God s redemption, the most important element is the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If there is no blood, there is no remission of sins Heb 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without the flesh, Christ would not have any blood for cleansing our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Praise the Lord that He became flesh with the blood!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then He could shed His blood upon the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ became flesh for the purpose of accomplishing redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second reason Christ became flesh is deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He became flesh to bring God into man, that divinity might be mingled with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is God s eternal purpose, to work Himself into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This work began with the incarnation of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Jesus became man, that brought God into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There was on the earth a man by the name of Jesus who was the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jesus was a wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was nothing less than the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is altogether wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE LIFE-GIVER</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After becoming flesh, Jesus lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then He took the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first step was incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The second was a step of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By this, He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First Corinthians 15:45 says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We know that the last Adam was Christ, the One who was God in the beginning and became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the first step He became flesh to be the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the second step, through death and resurrection, as the last Adam He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Most Christians today only see that God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Matthew 28:19 clearly mentions the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no argument about this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But not many have seen the last part of 1 Corinthians 15:45.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This verse tells us plainly that Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He became flesh for redemption; He became the life-giving Spirit for giving life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We not only need redemption; we also need life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Redemption is on the negative side; life is on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do need redemption; but even more, we need life!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ is not only the Redeemer, but also the Life-giver.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To be the Redeemer He became flesh; to be the Life-giver He became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By becoming flesh, He accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By becoming the life-giving Spirit, He is now imparting life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord is not only our Redeemer, He is our life-giver!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In eternity past He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then in time He became flesh and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE BODY-CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But we must realize that this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After these two steps, He is now taking a third.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is becoming the Body-Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I realize that this is a new term.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some will say that this term is not in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But they need to read 1 Corinthians 12:12, For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body; so also is the Christ Greek .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am afraid that when we read this verse, we would read so also is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We know that Christ is the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But this verse says that Christ is the Body!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are clear that the Head is Christ and the Body is the church, but this verse does not say that the Body is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It says, For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body; so also is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>So we do have the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our Christ today is the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then He became flesh, the life-giving Spirit, and the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The first step was by incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The second step was by death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>And the third step is by indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After the Lord became the life-giving Spirit, He came to indwell us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>By this indwelling, He is day by day working Himself into all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We may use petrified wood as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A wooden log falls into a flowing river, and water flows through the log bringing in all the minerals, and carrying away all the wooden essence.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Eventually the log still appears as a log, but the interior element has been discharged and replaced with something new.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It has become a precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is what the indwelling of the Lord Jesus is accomplishing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In a sense, He is petrifying us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Today He is the living water flowing through us to bring in the divine minerals and replace all our old element.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We are not under a kind of correction or adjustment: we are under transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Something new is coming in to replace the old.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is by this that we are made the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God in the beginning was merely God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He was alone.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But it is not good for God to be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He wants a counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When Jesus came, He was recommended by John the Baptist not only as the Lamb of God, but also as the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He who has the bride is the bridegroom John 3:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Jesus came not simply to be the Redeemer, but to be the Bridegroom, and as such He needs a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Paul said that he had espoused the Corinthian believers as a chaste virgin to Christ 2 Cor 11:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Ephesians 5 tells us that the church is just like the wife, and Christ is the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Then in the book of Revelation we are told that the wife has made herself ready, and the marriage of the Lamb has come Rev 19:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>That will be a universal marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Who is going to be married there?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Christ our God!</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>From that time God will never be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Our God will be a married God!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>He will marry the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>At the beginning of the Bible, God is looking for a counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>At the end of the Bible, He is no more alone; He is with a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is a picture showing us God being mingled with corporate humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Look at the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>God is there as the center, and man is the corporate vessel containing God.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The Spirit is flowing as living water, and the supplying Christ is there as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This is the Triune God fully mingled with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We must realize that today the genuine church life is just a miniature of that Body-Christ.</S>
