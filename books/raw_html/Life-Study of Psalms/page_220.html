<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SUFFERING CHRIST AND THE REIGNING CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Psa. 69&#151;72</H1><P>In this message we will consider Psalms 69 through 72. Whereas Psalms 69 and 72 are on Christ, Psalms 70 and 71 are typical examples of psalms that are the pious expressions uttered out of the complex sentiments of the psalmists.</P><P>Psalm 69 is on the suffering Christ typified by the suffering David, and Psalm 72 is on the reigning Christ typified by the reigning Solomon. David was a warrior who won victories and gained territories for God's kingdom, yet his life was a life of suffering, and in his suffering he was a type of the suffering Christ. Psalm 72 is actually a psalm on King Solomon, a type of Christ as the reigning One. Thus, David, the father, typified one aspect of Christ, and Solomon, the son, typified another aspect of Christ. After His life of suffering on earth, typified by the sufferings of David, Christ ascended to the heavens where He is now reigning as the King, typified by Solomon. From this we see that the suffering Christ has become the reigning Christ. The subject of this message, therefore, is "The Suffering Christ and the Reigning Christ."</P><P>Let us now go on to consider Psalms 69&#151;72 one by one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE SUFFERING CHRIST</H2><P>Unlike Isaiah 53, which speaks of Christ's sufferings in a general way, calling Him the Man of sorrows, Psalm 69 speaks of Christ's sufferings in a detailed way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Typified by the Suffering David</H2><P>In Psalm 69 Christ is typified by the suffering David (vv. 1-3, 19-20, 26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Sufferings of Christ</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Hated by Many without Cause</H2><P>"More numerous than the hairs of my head/Are those who hate me without cause" (v. 4a). This verse, which indicates that Christ was hated by many without cause, was quoted by the Lord Jesus Himself in John 15:25.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Bearing Reproaches for God's Sake</H2><P>Psalm 69:7 says, "Because for Your sake I have borne reproach;/Humiliation has covered my face." Verse 9b, quoted by Paul in Romans 15:3, says, "The reproaches of those who reproach You have fallen on me." Christ suffered in bearing reproaches for the sake of God.</P>
