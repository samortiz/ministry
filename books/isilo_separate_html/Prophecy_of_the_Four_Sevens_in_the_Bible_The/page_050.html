Revelation 19:13 says that the returning Christ is "clothed with a garment dipped in blood." The garment of Christ is dipped in blood and becomes red by His treading of the winepress of the fury of God at Bozrah, where the blood will rise "up to bridles of the horses for a thousand six hundred stadia" (Rev. 14:20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Appearing of Christ</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) Christ Coming with the Clouds</H2><P>Christ will come with the clouds, and every eye shall see Him, those also who pierced Him, and all the tribes of the land shall wail over Him (Rev. 1:7). The tribes of the land are the twelve tribes of the Holy Land. Christ will come at the end of His parousia (presence). His parousia first was secret in the heavens and then in the air. At that time He is clothed with a cloud (Rev. 10:1). When His parousia appears on earth, He will be on the cloud (Rev. 14:14; Matt. 24:30; 26:64), and every eye will see Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) The Coming of the Son of Man Being as the Lightning</H2><P>Matthew 24:26-28 says, "If therefore they say to you, Behold, He is in the wilderness, do not go forth;..for as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be. Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures shall be gathered together." Lightning is concealed in a cloud, waiting for an opportunity to flash forth. Christ also will be clothed with a cloud in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear like a flash to the earth. Hence, the lightning will be a sign of the end of the Lord's parousia.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) The Lawless One to Be Revealed</H2><P>Antichrist as the lawless one shall be revealed, and the Lord Jesus will slay him by the breath of His mouth and bring him to nothing by the appearing of His coming (2 Thes. 2:8; Rev. 19:19-20). "Appearing" implies the thought of shining or brightness. The shining of the Lord's coming will bring Antichrist to nothing, destroying him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>4) At the End of the Great Tribulation</H2><P>The appearing of the Lord's coming, His parousia, will be at the end of the three and a half years of the great tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Shining of the Prophetic Word</H2><P>Peter likens the word of prophecy in the Scripture to a lamp shining in a dark place (2 Pet. 1:19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. In the Dark Age of Today</H2><P>This age is a dark place in the dark night (Rom. 13:12), and all the people of the world are moving and acting in darkness. The shining of the prophetic word is in the dark age of today.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> </body></html>
