   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE EXPERIENCE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM SANCTIFICATION TO GLORIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The wonderful, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit is the sanctifying Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall firstly cover the sanctifying aspect of the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we shall proceed to see that the sanctifying takes place by the imparting of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The all-inclusive Spirit who indwells us today is the sanctifying One, and His work of sanctifying takes place by His life-imparting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This imparting of life transforms us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, there is also the transforming aspect of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By reading the book of Romans we can see that transformation implies conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Transformation issues in conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Conformation means to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through conformation, we become in a practical way the many sons of God to fulfill God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we have sanctifying, life-imparting, transforming, and conforming.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 8:29 and 30 indicate that conformation issues in glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Glorification will be the ultimate consummation of the work of the wonderful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, in this message we need to cover five matters: sanctifying, life-imparting, transforming, conforming, and glorifying.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE SANCTIFYING WORK OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We begin with the sanctifying work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we saw in the foregoing message, the all-inclusive Spirit is in us with a condition, a state, of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit Himself is the essence, the very substance, of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When this all-inclusive Spirit enters into our spirit and remains there as the essence of holiness, there is in our spirit a condition of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Consider again the illustration of making tea.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a tea bag is placed in a cup of hot water, there is immediately in the water a condition of tea.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more the water is stirred up, the more the tea spreads into the water and permeates it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, the water will be saturated, permeated, with the essence of tea.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To coin a word, we may call this the process of "teafication."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Teafication is an illustration of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit of holiness is like the tea that is put into our spirit, which is like the hot water.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, within our spirit there is a condition of the divine tea.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As this divine tea moves within us, His holy essence spreads into our inward being and saturates every part, proceeding from the center of our being to the circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, our entire being will be permeated with this holy essence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christians have been writing books on sanctification for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have read a number of these writings, but none of them ever fully satisfied us, because they did not correspond to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we progressed in the experience of sanctification, we began to realize that it resembles what we have called teafication.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By considering the way a tea bag teafies hot water, we can understand the process of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In sanctification we are permeated with the holy divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Check with your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Has the Spirit not been spreading the divine element within your inner being?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the sanctifying work of the Spirit of holiness.</S>
