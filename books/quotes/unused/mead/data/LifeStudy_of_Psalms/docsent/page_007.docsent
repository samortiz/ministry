   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CONTENTS OF THIS BOOK A. The Book of Psalms,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Composed of One Hundred Fifty Psalms,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Being Divided into Five Books</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The book of Psalms, composed of one hundred fifty psalms, is divided into five books.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Psalms 1 41 are the first book; Psalms 42 72 are the second book; Psalms 73 89 are the third book; Psalms 90 106 are the fourth book; and Psalms 107 150 are the fifth book.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These five books can be likened to the five floors of a building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first book is the ground floor, whereas the fifth book is the highest floor.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Book 5 is a book of praises with thanksgivings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>B. The Contents of the Psalms</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>according to the Human Concept</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Apparently, according to the human concept, all the Psalms are the expressions of the sentiments, feelings, and impressions of godly men who were intimately close to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>C. The Contents of the Psalms</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>according to the Divine Concept</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, according to the divine concept, the central thought of the book of Psalms is Christ, as revealed in plain words Luke 24:44 , and the church as the house of God and the city of God for His kingdom, as typified by the temple and the city of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, the book of Psalms is one book, but in two kinds of tones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One tone is uttered according to the human concept, and the other tone is uttered according to the divine concept.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How could this be?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No doubt, these holy writers were wrong in their understanding according to their human concept, but they were still godly men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They were very close to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, while they were speaking wrongly, God came to speak through them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because they were so intimate, so close, and even so one with God, while they were speaking, God came in to speak in their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not separate Psalm 1 from Psalm 2.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These two psalms were one speaking by David.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first psalm was uttered according to the human concept spoken by David directly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second psalm was also David's speaking, but it was actually uttered by God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then in Psalms 3 through 7, there is David's tone again, but in Psalm 8 God's tone came.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Psalms 3 through 7 show us how poor and full of trouble the situation on earth is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But Psalm 8 begins by saying, "O Jehovah our Lord, / How excellent is Your name / In all the earth" v. 1 . When His name is absent, the earth is a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When His name is here on the earth, the earth is excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the name of the One who became a human being, a little lower than the angels, and the name of the One who passed through human life and died, resurrected, and ascended to the heavens to be glorified and honored vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When this One's name is on this earth, the earth becomes excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today in the newspapers murders are reported all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to warn the sisters that they should not walk home alone after the meetings in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Can we say that it is excellent on the earth today?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we want to make the earth excellent, we need to preach the gospel and turn sinners into Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The day will come when the entire earth will be excellent because the Lord's name will eventually be excellent in all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the divine concept.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to God's divine concept, the central thought in the five books of the Psalms is Christ and the church.</S>
