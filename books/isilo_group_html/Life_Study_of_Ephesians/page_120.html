The way to be perfected is to grow in life and to become skillful in function. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;perfecting&rdquo; here also means completing, equipping, furnishing. To perfect a saint is to complete him, to equip him, and to furnish him. Only by growing in life can we be completed. Not until we become mature will we be completed. For example, a child of five is not a full-grown person. As long as, spiritually speaking, we remain underage, we shall not be complete. Mothers perfect their children by feeding them. Furthermore, parents equip their children and furnish them by training them to behave and to speak in a certain way. Thus, children are perfected by feeding and by training. The same is true with respect to perfecting the saints according to God&rsquo;s economy. The saints need to be fed and they need to be trained so that they may function with the proper skill.</p><p>Once when I was visiting a certain place which was regarded as being rather spiritual, I was asked why we conduct trainings in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I replied that as human beings we need to grow and we need also to learn. If we do not grow, we shall not have the stature required to do certain things. If we do not learn, we shall be &ldquo;barbarians.&rdquo; For example, if a child is not taught to eat properly with the necessary utensils, he will be &ldquo;wild&rdquo; and unruly at the table. Do not think that as long as a person is spiritual in life, he requires no training. No, in spiritual things, as in physical things, there is the need of training. In spiritual things we need the maturity, the growth in life, and we also need the skill. The maturity comes from growth, and the skill comes from training. Therefore, in order to perfect the saints, we need to feed them with spiritual food that they may grow, and we also need to train them to develop certain skills.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THOROUGH TRAINING</h2><p>To the present moment, I have not yet discharged my burden in the matter of training. We need to be trained for the practice of the church life. This means that the training should enrich and uplift our practice of the church life. Although the help given to the saints thus far is far from adequate, we cannot deny the fact that since coming into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery many saints have undergone some training. This is evident as we listen to them testify or pray in the meetings. However, the need remains for more thorough and complete training. My burden is that after a period of time, perhaps after three or four years, virtually all the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in this country will have been adequately trained.</p><p>To be trained is to have the rich supply of Christ ministered to us that we may grow, and it is to be equipped that we may be skillful in speaking, in contacting new ones, in shepherding, and in preaching and teaching. Do not say that you cannot speak because you are not a talented speaker. We all are able to speak for the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S WAY</h2><p>Once the saints have been perfected, then wherever they go, they will be apostles, the ones sent to that place. They will also be prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. To perfect the saints to be such gifts to the Body is the Lord&rsquo;s way. If we do not follow this way, the Lord will not be able to get what He desires. How we thank Him that, in His mercy, He has shown us His way!</p><p>We have seen that in 4:13-15 Paul did not exclude himself. Rather, he said, &ldquo;Until we all arrive...that we may be no longer babes...but holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things....&rdquo; None of us should think that we have already been perfected. On the contrary, we all need more life supply and more training. If we are willing to grow and to be trained, then we shall not repeat the history of Christianity. If we are faithful to practice what the Lord shows us, the Lord will have a way among us. The Lord&rsquo;s way has never changed. His way is to perfect the saints to do the work of ministry for the building up of the Body of Christ. This is the way for the Lord to gain what He desires as the necessary preparation for His coming back.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_119.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_121.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Ephesians &nbsp; pg 120</div><br></body></html>
