In the Bible, faith has its own laws. In the whole New Testament, there is only one place that tells us the function of faith&mdash;Hebrews 11:1. At the same time, in the whole New Testament, there is only one place that tells us how to believe&mdash;Mark 11:24: "For this reason I say to you, All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them." Here it tells us what it is to believe. What is faith? Faith is to believe in the Word of God. "Believe that you have received them." We have to pay attention to the word "received." It is in the past tense. If you meet a man today who says that he will receive, immediately you know that he does not have faith. If you ask someone if he has believed in the Lord Jesus and if he has been saved, and if he tells you that he hopes to be saved, then he surely is not saved. All those who say that they want to receive or that they hope to receive do not have faith. Mark 11:24 shows us clearly that faith is to believe that we have received. Faith is not to believe that we will receive. It is not to believe that we shall receive, are about to receive, or can receive. All these "wills," "cans," and "shalls" are not faith. Only the faith that believes that one has received is the faith that the Bible talks about.</p><p>Many times when I preached the gospel to someone, he would hear about the work of God and realize that all has been done. I would show him his corruption, his weakness, his sins, and his degradation. As a result, he would confess his sins and come to see the work of the Lord Jesus. After this we would kneel down to pray. First I would pray for him. Then he would pray himself. He would confess that he is a sinner and that he has committed many sins. He would ask for forgiveness and ask for the Lord to give him life. After he prayed in this way, I would ask, "Are your sins now forgiven?" If he said, "I believe that God will forgive my sins," I would say to myself, "Forget it. Here is another dead case." If he said, "I believe fully that God will forgive my sins," I would know immediately that he did not have faith.</p><p>When will a preacher rejoice over a listener? It is when such a one prays and says, perhaps in tears, that he is clear about everything now. You know that such a one has passed the gate and has obtained eternal life. He may say, "Thank the Lord, the problem of my sins has been solved," or he may say, "Thank the Lord, He has accepted me," or "Thank the Lord, God has forgiven all my sins on account of His Son." When you hear this, you know that such a one has believed and is saved. There is only one kind of faith in the Bible&mdash;the faith that believes that one has received. Everyone who says that he will receive, can receive, shall receive, and must receive, has not received.</p><p>My friends, this is the way to believe in all the facts in the Bible. With some people, after you pray with them, you know if they have passed from death to life and if they are saved. Many hope to be saved. This is not the real faith. Once I talked with a man who said that he fully believed that he would be saved. I said, "You had better change your wording a little. You should say, ``I fully hope'' instead of "I fully believe." If you fully believe, then you have received it already. Hence, anyone who has not put the word "have" or "already" into the word of God has not believed. If you say that your sins have been forgiven, this shows that you have believed. If you say that you have overcome your sins, this also shows that you have believed. Or if you say that you have received, this again shows that you have believed. Whenever you can say that you have received, at that time you have truly received. My friends, the matter today is very simple. I will not lower the standard of the Bible. All of God's works are accomplished. The Word of God has been preached to us. The Son of God has died. The Lord Jesus has resurrected. What should we say now? We should say, "Thank the Lord, I have received." This is good enough. Sometimes, when I attend revival meetings, I can almost cry. When the people there cry, I also cry. They cry for themselves, but I cry for God's salvation. They plead to God saying, "Oh God, save me," as if by this begging, God would be touched to love them or to turn and save them.</p><p>Thank the Lord. Those who have faith do not need to pray. Those who have faith are full of praises. Never say that prayer is a sign of faith. Please remember that, on the contrary, prayer is a sign of lack of faith. All experienced Christians know that where there is faith, there is praise. One hymn [Hymns, #690] says:</p><p class="hbody">Hear the message from the throne,<br />Claim the promise, doubting one;<br />God hath spoken, "It is done."<br />Faith has answered, "It is done."<br />Prayer is over, praise begun.<br />Hallelujah, "It is done."</p><p>You cannot say, "It will be done." All those who say it will be done do not have faith. God said that everything is done. You also must say that everything is done. God said that He has accomplished everything, and I believe in this. This is all that matters.</p><p>The greatest problem today is that when you go to many denominations, you meet hundreds of church members who say that they believe that Jesus will save them. They believe that Jesus will and can save them, but this is not faith. This is hope. To do this is to annul the Word of God. For example, if I give this book to Brother Hu and he says, "I believe that you will give it to me tomorrow," this is not politeness but an insult to me. Today God has sent His Son to accomplish redemption. If we still say, "Please save me," what is this? What we ought to say is, "God, I thank You because You have taken care of all my sins on the cross." My friends, a sinner cannot be saved by prayer. A sinner can only believe that Jesus has saved him.</p><p>Faith is not a merit. Never consider faith a work. Some say that they do not know if their faith is strong enough. God has made faith so simple for you, but man has made a simple thing very complicated. Suppose I have a brother who is short of money and has become very poor. Now I want to give him some money. I tell him, "You do not have to do anything. You cannot afford even to work. Here, take this money and go." By doing this, I am making the matter most simple. However, suppose his mind is very complicated. Suppose he would ask, "If my brother is going to give me money, should I take it with my left hand, or should I take it with my right hand? Should I take it at noon, or should I take it in the afternoon? Should I take it standing up, or should I take it sitting down?" He wants to study how he can take it. This would be the greatest mistake in the whole world.</p><p>While I was in Cheefoo, I met a sister. I told her that if she would believe, she would receive. She said, "I have been doing this for a week. I still do not know how I can believe. I do not know if this is the right way or that is the right way to believe. I do not know if my faith is strong enough." I told her that God has accomplished all the work. She only needs to believe in a simple way. But she was too analytical. She made faith a work.</p><p>Thank the Lord that it is the simplest thing on earth to receive salvation. We do not have to do anything. It does not mean that nothing has to be done. It only means that the Lord Jesus has done everything. God says that He has died. I say that I believe He has died. God says that the Lord Jesus has resurrected and become a proof. I say, "Yes" and agree that His resurrection has become a proof of my justification. He says that my sins are forgiven, that He has saved me. I will not wait. I believe, and the matter is settled. When I believe, I have received. Thank the Lord. This is all. We have passed from death to life. There is no need to feel anything or to wait for any peace or joy to come.</p><p>A few years ago, I preached the gospel to one person. He told me that he believed in the Lord Jesus, that he believed that he was a sinner, and that he believed the Lord Jesus had forgiven his sins. But he had a problem. He did not feel that the Holy Spirit was working mightily in him like he thought He was working in other Christians. I asked if his sins were forgiven. He answered, "No." I asked him why. He said that he did not feel the Holy Spirit working in him yet. I said, "My friend, you are absolutely wrong. The Bible does not say that whoever feels that he has believed in the Son of God has eternal life. We do not believe by our feelings. Rather, we believe by the Word of God." When a person gives this book to me, I do not have to feel anything. I only have to believe in his word. Salvation is without any condition. There is, however, the proper procedure. The procedure of salvation is not work; it is simply to believe and to receive. Whatever God says, I say the same. This is to receive. Thank the Lord that His grace is sufficient for us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_072.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 28: The Gospel of God (1) &nbsp; pg 73</div><br></body></html>
