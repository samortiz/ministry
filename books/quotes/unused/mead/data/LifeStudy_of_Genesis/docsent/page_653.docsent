   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>16 Recognized by the Children of Israel a The Whole Earth Being under Famine</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 41:56 says, "And the famine was over all the face of the earth," and verse 57 says that "the famine was severe in all lands" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the time of chapter forty-two the whole earth was under famine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is exactly the situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A famine is a severe shortage of food, the means by which human beings maintain their existence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Food, however, not only maintains our existence, but also gives us satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we eat and drink, we do not merely have the sense that we are maintaining our existence, but that we are being satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I am filled with good food, I am happy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, a famine actually denotes dissatisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The whole world today is dissatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The nation of Israel in particular is experiencing such dissatisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This nation is aggressively striving and struggling to maintain its existence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you visit Israel, you will certainly sympathize with them, for they definitely need protection and safety to secure their existence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Israel seems to need the Golan Heights and the settlements along the Sinai wilderness to secure its existence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The reason the nation of Israel is striving and struggling is that it is under famine, under dissatisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The United States, the leading country on earth, is in the same situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It also is experiencing dissatisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to apply Genesis 42 to today's world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do, we shall see that the entire world is in a famine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>b Food Being Only Where Christ Is</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to Genesis 42, food was to be found only where Joseph was vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates in type that food is only where Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, satisfaction can only be found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Where Christ is, there is satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today, Christ is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you are in the church yet are not enjoying satisfaction, it indicates that you are in a famine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I can declare to all that I am not in a famine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Day by day I am nourished, filled, and satisfied with good food.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Oh, the church is the land of satisfaction, the region of satisfaction, because Christ is here!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Food, nourishment, and satisfaction are only where Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I truly sympathize with the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no need for them to struggle and strive or to negotiate with Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They need to turn to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The prime minister of Israel does not need to go to Washington or to Cairo; instead, he should carry out negotiations with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the Jews would call on Him, everything would be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Neither Cairo nor Washington can solve Israel's problem of dissatisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The famine will end only when they turn to Christ and go where He is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Perhaps some saints of Jewish origin should write a letter to the Israeli prime minister telling him that the only person who can solve Israel's problems and give satisfaction is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some day the Jews will turn to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When they realize that all their struggles are in vain, they will be forced in their desperation to turn to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Praise the Lord that we have taken the lead to turn to Him!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are pioneers in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>More than fifty years ago I turned to Christ, having come to the realization that I was in a land of famine and that I was very dissatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We who have turned to Christ have found food, nourishment, and satisfaction, for the food is found only where Christ is.</S>
