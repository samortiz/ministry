There is a hymn concerning the empty tomb which indicates that when we see the empty tomb, we should be at rest, for the empty tomb is the sign that God has accepted our Redeemer, our Substitute. According to this hymn, the empty tomb implies that our sins have been forgiven and that our case has been solved before God. Therefore, we may be at peace.<p>However, this understanding of the significance of the empty tomb is too shallow. When we think of the empty tomb, we should not simply realize that our problems have been solved. On the positive side, we should realize that Christ is in resurrection and we also are in resurrection. In resurrection He became the Firstborn, and we became His brothers. Our sins have been forgiven, our problems have been solved, and we have been germinated. Now in resurrection we are part of the new creation. We are in Christ&#8217;s multiplication, and this multiplication is the church life. Do you know what the church life is? The church life is the glorification of Christ, a glorification which is actually Christ&#8217;s multiplication. Probably you have not realized before that in the church we are in the multiplication of Christ. The situation in the church is far from pitiful; the situation is one of glorification. Praise the Lord that the church life, as Christ&#8217;s glorification, is His multiplication!<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE LINEN CLOTHS  AND THE HANDKERCHIEF</h2><p>The next sign is the sign of the linen cloths and the handkerchief (vv. 5-7). After the Lord Jesus was resurrected from the dead, something was left in the tomb. The linen cloths left in the tomb signify the old creation. These cloths and a handkerchief were used to wrap the Lord Jesus when He was buried. But in resurrection these things remained in the tomb. This gives us a clear picture that the old creation has been terminated, and the new creation is in resurrection.<p>Where are you today-in the tomb or in resurrection? Too often many Christians are in a tomb as far as their experience is concerned. The church life, however, is in resurrection. In the church life we should not have anything in the old creation. Whenever we come to a church meeting, we should be sure to leave everything of the old creation in the tomb. Because the church is altogether in resurrection, we should not bring anything of the old creation into the church life.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE LORD&#8217;S BROTHERS</h2><p>In verse 17 we have the sign of the Lord&#8217;s brothers: &#8220;Jesus said to her, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.&#8221; The sign of the Lord&#8217;s brothers signifies His multiplication as His glorification in resurrection. This is the crucial point in this chapter.<p>Recently in a meeting we sang the hymn, the first line of which is, &#8220;Christ the Lord is ris&#8217;n indeed.&#8221; Although this is a good hymn on the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, and everything in it is true, it is very objective. In this hymn we do not have anything concerning the multiplication and glorification of the Lord Jesus. This hymn says that Christ &#8220;has met His people&#8217;s need.&#8221; But what exactly is our need? In what matters do we need the Lord&#8217;s resurrection? We need to answer such questions according to our actual experience. One line of this hymn goes on to ask the question, &#8220;Where, O Death, is now thy sting?&#8221; Can we say that in our daily living we do not suffer from the sting of death? We must admit that in our practical experience death is still powerful. In our family life, for example, we may be stung by the power of death. Another line of this hymn asks, &#8220;Where thy victory, O grave?&#8221; Many Christians cannot sing this with any sense of reality. The last lines of this hymn say that now we soar where Christ has led, following our exalted Head, and that like Him we rise, &#8220;free from all the earthly ties.&#8221; However, in our experience are we rising and soaring? Are we truly free from all the earthly ties? Not many of us can answer these questions in a positive way.<p>Although this is a good hymn on certain objective aspects of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, it does not express what the Gospel of John reveals to us regarding the resurrection of Christ. In John&#8217;s Gospel the resurrection is divine and mysterious, for it is related to Christ&#8217;s multiplication and glorification. According to this book, we have become the many brothers of the resurrected Christ. This means that we are His multiplication, His glorification, in resurrection.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_217.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_219.html">Next</a> </body></html>
