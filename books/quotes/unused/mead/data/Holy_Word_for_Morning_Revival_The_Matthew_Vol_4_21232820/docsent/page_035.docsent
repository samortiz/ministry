   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 28:16-20</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>16 And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus directed them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>17 And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him, though some doubted.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>18 And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>19 Go therefore and disciple all the nations, 1 baptizing them 2 into the 3 name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>20 Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And behold, I am 1 with you all the days until the consummation of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 16 says, "And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus directed them."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The constitution of the kingdom was decreed on a mountain see note 11 in ch.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>5 , the heavenly King's transfiguration took place on a high mountain see note 12 in ch.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>17 , and the prophecy concerning this age was given on a mountain see note 31 in ch.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>24 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now, for God's economy of the New Testament the disciples needed to go to the mountain again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only on the high level of a mountain can we see clearly the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because all authority was given to Him v. 18 , the heavenly King sent His disciples to disciple all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They go with His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To disciple the nations is to make the heathen the kingdom people for the establishing of His kingdom, which is the church, even today, on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Notice in verse 19 that the Lord did not charge the disciples to preach the gospel, but to disciple the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To disciple the nations is to cause the Gentiles to become the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have been sent by the Lord not only to bring people to salvation, but also to disciple the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a matter of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>826-828</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>19 1 Baptism brings the repentant people out of their old state into a new one by terminating their old life and germinating them with the new life of Christ that they may become the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John the Baptist's recommending ministry began with a preliminary baptism, a baptism by water only.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now, after the heavenly King had accomplished His ministry on earth, had passed through the process of death and resurrection, and had become the life-giving Spirit, He charged His disciples to baptize the discipled people into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This baptism has two aspects: the visible aspect by water and the invisible aspect by the Holy Spirit Acts 2:38, 41; 10:44-48 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The disciples baptized the new converts Acts 2:38 not only into water but also into the death of Christ Rom 6:3-4 , into Christ Himself Gal 3:27 , into the Triune God v. 19 , and into the Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:13 . Hence, the baptism ordained by the Lord here baptizes people out of their life into the Body life for the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>19 2 Into indicates union, as in Rom 6:3 and Gal 3:27.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The same Greek word is used in Acts 8:16; 19:5; and 1 Cor 1:13, 15.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to bring them into spiritual and mystical union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>19 3 There is one name for the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The name is the sum total of the Divine Being, equivalent to His person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To baptize someone into the name of the Triune God is to immerse him into all that the Triune God is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>20 1 Among the four Gospels the Lord's ascension is recorded only in Mark Mark 16:19 and Luke Luke 24:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John testifies that the Lord, as the Son of God, even God Himself, is life to His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As such, He can never and would never leave them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Matthew proves that He, as Emmanuel, is the heavenly King who is with His people continuously until He comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, in John and Matthew the Lord's ascension is not mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>826-831; Hymns: #608, #7</S>
