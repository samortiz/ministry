Now we want to go on to see the positive side. In this lesson there are fifteen main points.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. SATAN HAVING THE MIGHT OF DEATH</H2><P>First, we have to point out that Satan has the might of death. Hebrews 2:14b says that the devil has the might of death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. DEATH BEING THE ULTIMATE ISSUE<br>OF SATAN'S PLOT CONCERNING MAN</H2><P>Death is the ultimate issue of Satan's plot concerning man. Satan's plot is to bring man into death. In Genesis 2:17 God warned man that partaking of the tree of knowledge would cause him to die. Actually, this was a warning that man should not have any contact with Satan. If man would have some contact with Satan, the result, the issue, would be death.</P>
