   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FIGHTING AGAINST THE ENEMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A believer who lives by his feeling is even less useful in spiritual warfare because spiritual warfare involves attacking the devil through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is certainly a work of self- denial.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How great a suffering this is!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is nothing in this work that makes the self happy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, it is a pouring out of one's self-life for the Body of Christ and for the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To resist and wrestle in the spirit is hard to bear!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the spirit bears an unspeakably heavy burden for God's sake, what is there to be happy about?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If all our strength is directed against the evil spirits, how can that be enjoyable?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a warfare of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet for whom do we pray?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not for ourselves but for God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This kind of prayer is for warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not as enjoyable as our usual emotional prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is comfortable about travailing by prayer in our soul for the saints, destroying and establishing by prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Spiritual warfare does not cause the flesh to be happy unless we are fighting in our imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When an emotional believer fights against Satan, he is easily defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he attacks Satan by prayer, Satan uses his evil spirit to attack the believer's feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He makes the believer feel that warfare is hard and prayer is dry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the believer feels sorrowful, tasteless, dark, and dry, he ceases to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, an emotional believer cannot fight Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Satan only has to attack his feeling, and he will not be able to withstand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the feeling has not gone through death, it gives Satan ground every time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Each time he opposes Satan, Satan only has to attack his feeling to defeat him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we have not overcome our feeling, how do we expect to overcome Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, spiritual warfare requires a person to have an attitude of death to his feeling and to live by faith alone.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This kind of person is able to endure the pain of being alone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is able to fight the enemy without seeking man's acceptance and companionship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is able to go on in spite of any feeling of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He does not care if he is dead or alive; he only cares for how God leads.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This kind of person bears no self-interest, aspiration, or preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He has already committed his self to death and fully lives for God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This kind of person does not blame or misunderstand God but loves all of God's ways.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He can fill the breach.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although it seems that God has deserted him and that there is no one to help him, he can still face the opposition alone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This kind of person can be a prayer warrior to defeat Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>REST</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When a believer has gone through all of the Lord's dealings, he will enter into a life of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This life of faith is none other than a true spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When a believer arrives at this stage, he will have a life of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The fire of the cross has already eliminated his greedy heart.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He has learned his lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now he knows that only God's will is of any value; whatever else he may naturally desire is not the highest, nor do they match the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now he is happy to lose everything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whatever the Lord thinks should be withdrawn, he gladly allows the Lord's hand to take away.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The sighing, bitterness, and sorrow produced from his hoping, seeking, pursuing, and struggling are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He knows that the highest life is to live for God and obey His will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although he has lost everything, he is satisfied because God's will is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although there is nothing for him to enjoy, he yields to the arranging hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It matters not what he encounters as long as God is pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is perfect rest; nothing outward can stir him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now the believer is living by the will the will that is in union with God ; his will is full of the strength of the spirit which rules over his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His life is peaceful, steady, and at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The former life of ups and downs is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, we should not take this to mean that he will never again be regulated by his emotion, because this kind of sinless perfection is not possible unless one enters heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, if we compare his present condition to the past, we can say that he is at rest and steady.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even though the former confusion is definitely gone, he will occasionally be affected by his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, he needs to watch and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Neither should we think that it is no longer possible for him to feel happy or sad.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is not such a thing; unless our organ for emotion is destroyed, our feeling still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our emotion will still feel sorrow, darkness, and dryness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, all these only affect the outward man; it does not affect the inward man because there is a clear separation between our spirit and soul.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, no matter how much the soul suffers outwardly or is confused, our spirit remains peaceful and secure as though nothing has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the believer's life reaches this stage of rest, he realizes that all the loss he suffered for the Lord before has been replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At this time, he has gained God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, everything of God is also his.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now in God, he can properly enjoy the things which He withdrew before.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At that time, God caused him to experience sorrow and hardship because his soul-life was the mastermind in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He had many loves and pursuits in himself; he even sought what was outside of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This independent action had to be dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Since he has lost the self and lost his soul-life, he can enjoy God's happiness in a proper position and within a proper boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Only now has he learned to have a proper relationship with God's happiness in God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The heart which fervently sought things for the self is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He accepts everything which he receives with thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whatever is not given to him, he does not demand just for the sake of happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When believers have reached this stage, they are counted as having reached a pure stage.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Pureness means that there is no mixture involved.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Whatever is mixed is not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>According to the Bible, impureness is filthy.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When a believer has not yet reached this stage, he does not have a pure life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Because there is mixture in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He lives for God, but he also lives for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He loves God, but he also loves himself.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>His intention is for God, but he also has selfish motives for his own glory, happiness, and comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is a defiled life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He lives by faith, but he also lives by feeling; he walks according to the spirit, but he also walks according to the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Although the place which he reserves for himself is not big, it is enough to make his life impure.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Only that which is pure is clean; anything mixed with a foreign object is defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When a believer has gone through the thorough work of the cross, he arrives at a life of pureness.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Everything is for God, everything is in God, and God is in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There is nothing for the self.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Even the desire to make the self happy is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The self-love of the emotion has been put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>His only objective in life is to do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>As long as God is pleased, nothing else matters.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>His unique objective is to obey God; how he feels is not important.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is a pure life.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Although God grants him peace, comfort, and joy, he no longer enjoys these things for the sake of satisfying his desire.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He views all things in God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>His soulish life has been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>God has given him a spiritual life that is pure, restful, real, and trusting.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>God destroyed him, but God also has established him.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Everything soulish has been destroyed; everything spiritual has been established.</S>
