We shall deal with this subject in a rather simple manner, because many of the related aspects have already been discussed in the previous chapters, leaving very little to be said at this point. Furthermore, we have only experienced this lesson very little; therefore, we do not have much to say.<p>When we speak about being full of the stature of Christ, we mean that our life in Christ has attained to the realm of full maturity. If we have really experienced all the lessons of life mentioned previously, then the life of Christ can be fully wrought into us. At this time, we will be full of the stature of the fullness of Christ.<p>The growth of the stature of Christ within us can be divided into five steps. Firstly, Christ enters into us to become our life. Secondly, Christ living within us through the Holy Spirit gradually grows in us. Thirdly, Christ is formed in us. Fourthly, Christ is manifested through us. As Christ grows and is formed in us and manifested more and more, one day every part of our being will be filled with His elements; then we will attain to the fifth step-Christ becoming matured in us, or we being full of the stature of the fullness of Christ. At this time our experience of life in Christ has reached its climax.<p>Every saved Christian has the experience of the first step- Christ entering into us to become our life. If anyone has not experienced this first step, he is not saved, neither can he speak of the experiences of life which follow. Concerning the second step-Christ living and growing within us-every seeking Christian is in the process of the experience. As to the third step-Christ being formed in us-many have not attained to this stage. When we come to the fourth step of Christ being manifested through us, even fewer have experienced it. Finally, as to the fifth step-Christ being matured in us and we being matured in His life and full of His stature-people with this experience can rarely be found in all the churches on earth today. Therefore, in this lesson of being full of the stature of Christ, there is not much that we can say. We simply list a few main points and discuss them briefly.<h2 class=head1>I. IN THE BODY</h2><p>Concerning being full of the stature of Christ, we must first realize that none can attain to this stage individually. This experience is attainable only in the Body. It is entirely an experience which is gained in the Body.<p>A Christian who has experienced the brokenness of the flesh and the natural constitution will automatically see the Body of Christ. From this time forth, he deeply realizes from his experience that apart from the Body of Christ he cannot live-he can neither live in the Lord nor touch His presence. If he is detached from the Body of Christ, he cannot even be a Christian. Therefore, from the time he sees the Body of Christ until he becomes mature in the life of the Lord, his spiritual life is in the Body and so also is his whole spiritual experience. Hence, his being full of the stature of the fullness of Christ is also an experience in the Body.<p>Not only is it impossible for anyone to experience being full of the stature of the fullness of Christ outside of the Body, but, practically speaking, even in the Body, none can be full of the stature of Christ individually either. To be full of the stature of Christ is a Body matter. Therefore, only the Body can be full of the stature of Christ.<p>Being full of the stature of the fullness of Christ is mentioned only once in the Bible-in Ephesians 4:13. In this passage, the writer is not referring to individual saints, but rather pointing out the fact that one day the Body of Christ, which is the church, shall attain to such a stage. In Ephesians 3:18, we read that to apprehend the breadth, the length, the depth, and the height of Christ, we need a togetherness with all saints. From these two scripture references we see that the stature of the fullness of Christ and the unsearchable dimensions of Christ cannot be experienced by ourselves individually, but by being in the Body and joined together with all the saints.<p>Therefore, simply speaking, the maturity of a Christian life takes place in the Body. We should never expect that we can attain to the maturity of life individually. In fact, when one sees the Body, he can no more be individual.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_149.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_151.html">Next</a> </body></html>
