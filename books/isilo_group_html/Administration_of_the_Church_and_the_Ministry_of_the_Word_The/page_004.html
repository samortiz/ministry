<p>The central work of God is the building. The building is not a matter of understanding doctrines, saving sinners, or even edifying the saints. Even though the New Testament refers to the edification of individual saints, its focus is on the building of God&rsquo;s house. We often have strong feelings concerning saving sinners and edifying the saints, but we lack feeling concerning building God&rsquo;s house. This does not mean that we should not pay attention to saving sinners and edifying the saints, but we need to see the ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s work in this age.</p>
<p>Since Paul had a clear vision concerning the building, he said, &ldquo;As a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it. But let each man take heed how he builds upon it&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:10). We need to be careful concerning the way we build, the materials we build with, and the outcome of our building. May the brothers and sisters see that saving sinners and edifying the saints are related to the central goal of building God&rsquo;s house. If we pay attention to this central work, our preaching the gospel to save sinners will be more effective, and our edification of the saints will not cause problems. For example, our shortage in building God&rsquo;s house is the basic reason the brothers and sisters in Taipei do not seem to have the strength to preach the gospel. The key is the building of God&rsquo;s house. If God&rsquo;s house, the Body of Christ, can be built up, saving sinners and edifying the saints will be very easy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KEY TO THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH&mdash;<br />
THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CHURCH AND<br />
THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD</h2>
<p>The two most important matters in the building up of the church, God&rsquo;s house, are the administration of the church and the ministry of the word. If the administration of a local church is poor, there will not be much building in that church. Similarly, if the ministry of the word is poor in a local church, there will not be much building there. We have used the word <em>edification</em> for so many years, but we now need to use the word <em>building.</em> The individual saints need to be edified, but the church as a corporate entity, as the Body of Christ and the house of God, needs to be built up. The building up of the church depends on the administration of the church and the ministry of the word.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, all our speaking should be for the building up of the church. In 1 Corinthians 14:12 Paul says, &ldquo;Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.&rdquo; Verse 1 says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.&rdquo; The gift that excels in building up the church is prophesying, because prophesying is a matter of the ministry of the word. In 1 and 2 Timothy, when the church was in a desolate situation, there was the need for the administration of the church in addition to the ministry of the word. The responsibility for the administration of the church is with the elders. After the church became desolate, the apostle spoke of the administration of the church in the books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus. The administration of the church becomes crucial when the church is in desolation and confusion.</p>
<p>The administration of the church and other matters related to the elders are not spoken of in the book of Romans. However, the books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus clearly speak of the administration by the elders, because the church had become desolate at that time. If we know the principle of the Bible, we will understand the meaning of the Holy Spirit. In the initial stage of the church God led and built up the church by the ministry of the word. However, at a certain time the ministry of the word was not sufficient; there was the need for the administration of the church. Hence, in the books of 1 and 2 Timothy we see both the administration of the church and the ministry of the word. Paul says, &ldquo;The things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also&rdquo; (2 Tim. 2:2). Here we see the ministry of the word and the administration of the church.</p>
<p>After the church had been established for a period of time, there was the need for the administration of the church as well as the ministry of the word. Both are necessary for the building up of the church. If the administration of a local church and the ministry of the word are poor, the church will not be built up. When the administration of the church and the ministry of the word are strong, the church can be built up. May the Lord open our eyes to see that the central work of God in this age is His building; He wants to build His house, the Body of Christ, the church. Since we have a part in this building, we must see the administration of the church and the ministry of the word. The ministry of the word is related to gift, and the administration of the church is related to office. Both of these aspects are for the building up of the church. Our speaking as prophets is for the ministry of the word and is related to the aspect of gift. The serving of the elders is for the administration of the church and is related to the aspect of office.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Administration of the Church and the Ministry of the Word &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
