   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Vindicating</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Moses was reviled, he did not vindicate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All vindication, justification, and reaction should come from God, not from man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who seek to vindicate themselves do not know God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No one who has walked on this earth has had more authority than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when the Lord was on earth, He never vindicated Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is the only person who never vindicated Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Authority and vindication are incompatible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever we try to vindicate ourselves before someone, it means that the person is our judge.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever we vindicate ourselves before those who criticize us, we are telling them that they are higher than us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A vindicating person is a person who is under the judgment of others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who vindicate themselves have no authority whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever a person vindicates himself, he loses his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God may have committed His authority to us, but if we vindicate ourselves before men, we have lost our authority because we are begging them to be our judge.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul was a deputy authority to the Corinthians, yet he said, "It is a very small thing that I should be examined by you or by man's day; rather I do not even examine myself" 1 Cor 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Vindication can only come from God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should pass on all reviling and critical words to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When man's revilings become too much, God will take action.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if we vindicate ourselves to anyone, we are in effect making him our judge.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we seek understanding from anyone, we are falling under that person's feet.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, we must never vindicate ourselves and must never seek understanding from anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Full of Meekness</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Numbers 12:2 God heard the reviling words, and He took action in verse 4.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But there is a parenthetical word in verse 3: "Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all the men who were on the face of the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is what we find in a God-appointed deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why did Moses not hear their reviling words?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps Moses thought that he was indeed wrong and did not want to argue with them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God cannot make a stubborn person His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He cannot appoint a belligerent man to be His deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The authorities God establishes in the church are meek and inconspicuous.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God does not appoint persons of great charisma to be His authority; He appoints those who are not only meek in a general way, but meek to the extent that their meekness exceeds that of all the men who are on the face of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, they are as meek as God is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A deputy authority can never build up his own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more a person tries to build up his own authority, the less he is qualified to be the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Authority is from God; hence, vindication must also be from God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We pray that we do not meet too many hardened persons.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not get the wrong idea that a hard and capable person would make a good deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should be very clear that only a person like Paul, whose bodily presence was weak, can be the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord said that His kingdom was not of this world, and therefore His attendants did not need to struggle John 18:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God's kingdom is not established through struggling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All authority earned through struggling is not authority from God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Please remember that Moses was meek above all the men who were on the face of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why he could be a deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If I ask you to list the traits of a deputy authority, I believe that nine out of ten of you would list such things as good and proper appearance, strong charisma, great power, or an imposing image.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The human thought is that an authority should be capable, imposing, powerful, assertive, and eloquent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But such traits do not represent authority; rather, they represent the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No other God-appointed authority in the Old Testament was as great as Moses, yet He was a most meek person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When he was in Egypt, he was quite fierce.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He killed an Egyptian and rebuked two Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He dealt with others with his fleshly hands, but God did not use him as His authority then.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only after he had passed through God's testing and dealing, becoming so meek that his meekness was above all the men who were on the face of the earth, did he become an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The less a person truly resembles an authority, the more he feels that he is an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more a person thinks that he is an authority, the less it is likely that he is an authority.</S>
