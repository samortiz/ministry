   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Eaten Raw or Boiled</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Related to the eating of the meat of the lamb, there are a few things that need to be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord told the children of Israel that they should not eat the meat when it was raw or boiled.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The lamb had to be roasted by fire Exo 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be raw indicates no passing through of sufferings, and to be boiled means to suffer something merely under the human hand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The modernists say that Christ's death was only a martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To them Christ merely suffered the persecution from man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is what it means for the lamb to be boiled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But to be roasted with fire means to suffer under God's burning judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Fire represents God's holy anger.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For the lamb to be roasted means that Christ had to be judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ suffered not just under the hand of man as a kind of persecution, but under the hand of God as divine punishment, divine judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the roasting under the divine fire.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is not a raw lamb or a lamb boiled with water.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our Lamb, our Christ, is a lamb roasted under the divine fire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We take this Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One with the Lamb by Eating the Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I was young, I was always taught that we had to take Christ as our example.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because Christ loves people, we have to imitate Him to love people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because Christ was nice and humble while He was on this earth, we were taught that we had to be the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To imitate Christ in this way is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The best way to follow the Lord is to get Him into us by eating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to be one with the Lamb by eating the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we will be constituted with the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God did not tell the children of Israel to slay one lamb for the blood and then to have another lamb that they needed to learn to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God told them to slay one lamb, put the blood on the house, and under the covering of this blood eat this slain, roasted lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this way the lamb would be one with the children of Israel, would be in them, and would be their constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The thought here is very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Christian life is not a matter of imitating Christ, of following Christ in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But it is a matter of our eating Christ, receiving Christ into us, and assimilating all that He is into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eaten with Unleavened Bread and Bitter Herbs</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The children of Israel also had to eat the lamb with unleavened bread and with bitter herbs Exo 12:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The bread and the herbs signify that the Passover is composed not only of the animal life but also of the vegetable life, the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The tree of life was the plant life, but the lamb is the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The lamb is first for redemption, but after redemption is accomplished and experienced, the lamb becomes the tree of life to give us life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In John 6 the Lord Jesus told us that He is the bread of life v. 35 . He also told us that His blood is drinkable and that His flesh is eatable v. 55 . In John 6:51 the Lord said that the bread which He will give is His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In John 6 the bread of wheat is also the bread of blood and meat.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ was the Lamb slain for us, and with the Lamb there is the blood and the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ also is life to us, so He is the bread of life, the tree of life, the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In John 1 is the Lamb, and in John 15 is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Between these two chapters is the bread of life in chapter six with blood and meat.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the one hand, Christ is the redeeming life, the animal life, but on the other hand, Christ is the generating life, the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is the lamb, the animal life, for redeeming and the tree, the plant life, for generating.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, there are the matters of redemption and life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The bread is of the vegetable life and is only for feeding; the flesh is of the animal life and is not only for feeding but also for redeeming.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before the fall of man, the Lord was the tree of life Gen 2:9 , only for feeding man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After man fell into sin, the Lord became the Lamb John 1:29 , not only for feeding man but also for redeeming man Exo 12:4, 7-8, 12-13 .</S>
