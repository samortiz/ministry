   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE PROPER ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4-6; Matt 18:19; Acts 1:14; Phil 1:27; 1 Cor 1:10; Rev 1:4a, 11-12, 20; 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14; 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 1 Cor 4:17; 7:17; Col 4:16; 1 Cor 11:16; 14:33-34; Acts 15:1-31; 1 Thes 2:14; 1 Cor 1:11-13; Phil 1:15, 17 THE ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BEING THE PRACTICE OF THE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this series of messages I have put the genuine oneness first and the proper one accord second.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Strictly speaking, the genuine oneness is not of the church but of the Body; it is the Body s own organic oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Ephesians 4:4, after telling us to keep the oneness of the Spirit, Paul did not say, One church and one Spirit...</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>; rather, he said, One Body and one Spirit....</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church may be plural as the churches in different localities, but the Body could never be plural.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether it is viewed locally or universally, the Body is one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In contrast, the church is universally one but locally many.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Body we need oneness; in the churches and among the churches, we need the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The one accord is for our practice; the oneness is primarily for the actuality, for the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed for such a fact, and on the day of Pentecost, by pouring out Himself as the consummated Spirit, He accomplished His prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That was the actuality of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the accomplishment of the actuality of the oneness, there is the need for the practice of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the oneness is practiced, it becomes the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The one accord is the practice of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we have only the oneness as an actuality, and do not have the present, practical one accord, the oneness that we have will be objective and abstract; it will not be real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we would apply the oneness accomplished by the outpouring of the Spirit, we must practice the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If among us there is no one accord, how could we say that there is oneness?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If in a prayer meeting we each pray in our own way, without any accord among us, how could we say that we are practicing the oneness?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as we have differences existing among us, the oneness is not applied.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must have the one accord to swallow up all the differences; then oneness will be present.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The practice of the proper one accord in the church is the application of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although oneness and one accord seem to be synonymous, there is a difference between them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord did not teach us concerning oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In John 17 He prayed for oneness, but in Matthew 18 He led us to practice the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Matthew 18:19 the Lord spoke of two praying together on earth in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That was His leading, His training, and His directing us to pray in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a test of whether we are practicing the oneness or not, we may check to see whether there is one accord in our prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When certain ones pray, we may shake our head as an indication of our displeasure, and when others pray, we may nod our head as an expression of our agreement.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a shaking and nodding of our head is strong evidence that we do not practice oneness, because we do not have the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To say Amen in response to others prayer is a practice taught by Paul in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 14:16 Paul said that we need to pray in such a way that others can say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If there are no Amens to indicate our one accord, we should not expect that our prayer will be heard.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If only two on earth pray in one accord, their prayer will be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The one accord is the practice, the application, of the oneness, and the oneness is the basis on which we practice the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In a church meeting there may be people of different races and colors.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our one accord could never be based on the different races and colors.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We practice one accord based on the fact that we all have a common life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may be different in race and in the color of our skin, but when we come together to pray, we must forget about the different races and colors.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We do have a base for our oneness; thus, we can practice the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not only so, if we do not have the same understanding, the same intention, the same purpose, the same goal, it will be impossible to pray together in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There will be no base for such prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we each have our own opinion, our own intention, and our own goal, there will be no base on which we can pray in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when we who are saved and who love the Lord and mean business for the Lord s purpose come together, we surely have the base to pray in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed for the oneness of His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That oneness was only in His aspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A little more than fifty days later, on the day of Pentecost, the oneness in the Lord s aspiration was accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The oneness in the Lord s aspiration became the oneness in actuality.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This oneness is called the oneness of the Spirit Eph 4:3 , the Spirit here being the consummated Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, as the consummation of the entire Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We, the saved ones, possess this oneness as our heritage.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We possess this oneness, we enjoy it, and we apply it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To apply this oneness is to keep it, and to keep it is to practice one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If in our Christian life and our church life we do not practice one accord, we conduct ourselves as if we are unlearned people who do not know that there is such a thing as the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Suppose you have one billion dollars in your checking account.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you never write checks, it will seem as if you do not have a checking account at all, or that your account has a zero balance.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Your writing of checks is the practice of your realization that there is one billion dollars in your checking account.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The one billion dollars in your checking account is your possession.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may liken the oneness of the Spirit to a one billion dollar deposit in our heavenly bank account.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, every day and in every meeting we need to write checks ; that is, we need to exercise to apply the oneness of the Spirit to the present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The oneness that we possess in all the churches is not merely the oneness in the Lord s aspiration and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The oneness in John 17 may be likened to a promissory note.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We do not have merely a promissory note; we possess a real bank deposit, for the promised cash has actually been deposited into the bank and has become our possession.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We may consider this possession as our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The oneness that we have is the accomplished oneness, the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We all have the Spirit in our bank account, that is, in our spirit Rom 8:9, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This Spirit who is in our spirit is the equivalent of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have the oneness as a deposit in our account, but we may not write checks of oneness because we may not remain in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Instead, we may remain in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When a certain brother prays, we may be in our mind discerning whether that brother s prayer is genuine, or whether there is hidden intention in his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Thus, we may not say Amen to his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In such a situation, there is no practice of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The one accord actually is the using of the oneness, which is the using of our possession.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We all need to realize and to learn that not to be one with the saints, not to have one accord with others in the church, is serious.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This indicates that the oneness is not applied.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To keep the oneness, to apply the oneness, to use the oneness, to enjoy the oneness, to spend the oneness, we need to practice the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, we should practice the one accord not only among the saints in our particular locality; we must practice the one accord among all the churches universally.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>During the past two and a half years, the teaching of the absolute autonomy of the local churches was promoted among us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This teaching was based mainly on the book The Churches of God by G. H. Lang.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This kind of teaching encourages and even promotes differences among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is serious to say that all the churches should be different.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We are not for uniformity among the churches, but we are for oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Uniformity and oneness are not the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In a family there may be a grandfather and a grandmother who are over eighty years of age, a father and a mother who are about fifty years of age, and a number of children ranging from eighteen down to four years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They all are different in age, different in the degree of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In such a family it would be impossible to make all the members uniformly the same age.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>However, although the members of a family can never be the same age, they can still be one.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Likewise, in the church we do not practice uniformity because in the household of God, a large household, there are many degrees of maturity among the children.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>To eliminate the degrees of maturity would be absolutely wrong and would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>However, this does not mean that we do not need oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In the practicality of the church life, as in the family life, there is the need of oneness; but in the degree of the growth in life, it is impossible to have uniformity.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>To make all the children the same in the growth in life is not to practice oneness; it is to practice uniformity.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>To have a clear vision of the proper one accord as the practice of the genuine oneness also is a part of the scriptural remedy for the intrinsic problem in the present rebellion among us.</S>
