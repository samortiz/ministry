<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF DANIEL</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE VICTORY OF THE YOUNG DESCENDANTS<br>OF GOD'S DEGRADED ELECT<br>OVER SATAN'S FURTHER DEVICES</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(6)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>OVER THE SUBTLETY THAT PROHIBITED<br>THE FAITHFULNESS OF THE OVERCOMERS<br>IN THE WORSHIP OF GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Dan. 6</H1><P>Daniel 6 is very crucial because it shows us how God carries out His economy with His elect for Christ's coming. God desires to carry out His economy, but man is needed to pray for His economy on earth. God carries out His economy on the earth through His faithful channels of prayer. Satan's strategy is to frustrate the prayer which is for God's move. Thus, the center of this chapter is man's prayer for the carrying out of God's economy.</P><P>God's move is like a train which must have rails for its move. Man's prayers are like the rails which pave the way for God's move to go on. There is no other way to bring God's economy into fullness and into fulfillment except by prayer. This is the inner secret of this chapter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE EXALTATION OF DANIEL<br>AS ONE OF THE OVERCOMERS IN THE CAPTIVITY<br>OF GOD'S ELECT IN MEDO-PERSIA</H2><P>Daniel 5:31 says, "Darius the Mede received the kingdom at about the age of sixty-two." It pleased him to set up over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps (a Persian loan- word meaning "protectors of the kingdom"), who would be throughout the whole kingdom (6:1). Daniel was set by King Darius to be one of the three chief ministers over these one hundred and twenty satraps (v. 2). Daniel distinguished himself among the chief ministers and satraps, and the king considered setting him over the whole kingdom (v. 3). By this time, Daniel was no longer a young overcomer but had become an older overcomer; he may have been close to one hundred years of age.</P>
