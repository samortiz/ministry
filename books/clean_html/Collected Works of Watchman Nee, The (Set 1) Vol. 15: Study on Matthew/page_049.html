<P>Two passages of the Bible reveal the direct requirements for rapture. First, Revelation 3:10 mentions the keeping of the word of the Lord's endurance. When people revile the Lord today, the Lord endures and does not strike them to death with lightning. (This will not be so in the millennium—Zech. 14:17-19.) We need to stand in the same position with the Lord (Rev. 1:9), not loving glory, because the Lord has not received glory and was silent when rejected (Isa. 53:7). Second, Luke 21:36 says, "But be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail [or, be accounted worthy—KJV] to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man." We need to be watching at every time, not just for five minutes. In the dark night we should not sleep but should be able to discern the Lord's brightness and the world's darkness. We must always pray that we may be truly accounted worthy and considered qualified to participate in the first rapture. If we cannot refuse the blessings of this world, neither can we escape the calamities of the great tribulation.</P><P>The reapers are the angels, the sickle mentioned in Revelation 14. They do not refer to men; otherwise, the religious inquisitions carried out by the Roman Catholic Church would be approved. The tares will be burned up in the furnace of fire, that is, the lake of fire, beside the Valley of Hinnom (cf. Isa. 30:27-33; 31:9; Rev. 20:10; Isa. 66:23-24).</P><P>Matthew 13 speaks of three kingdoms: (1) the kingdom of the heavens (referring to the realm—v. 11); (2) the kingdom of the Son of Man (v. 41), referring to the millennial kingdom on the earth, which is for the Gentiles and the Jews; and (3) the kingdom of the Father (v. 43), referring to the heavenly millennial kingdom, which is for the believers and at which time the righteous will shine forth like the Lord as the Sun of righteousness. (During the tribulation, He will be the morning star.) Therefore, he who has ears to hear, let him hear.</P><P>The parable of the mustard seed: The mustard seed is not the seed mentioned in the first and second parables. Here the emphasis is on the mustard seed as the smallest seed. The Israelites usually use the mustard seed as a figure of the smallest (Matt. 17:20), just as we use dust as a figure.</P><P>Verses 31-32: The mustard seed signifies the principle of God's word of life. "A man" signifies Christ, while the "field" signifies the world. While men were unaware, the Lord sowed the word of God in the world. (In Palestine, the shortest mustard plants are about ten feet high, and the tallest are about fifteen feet high. The Lord used the mustard seed to signify the smallest thing becoming the largest thing.) Before 1828 the majority of Bible expositors said that the mustard seed signifies the outward prosperity of the church, for in just a short time the church had spread throughout Asia. They also said that the leaven signifies the inward prosperity of the church and that the three measures of meal signify the whole world. After 1828 people such as J.N. Darby rose up to criticize the error in this, because this kind of explanation was altogether unscriptural and was based merely on personal imagination. If the whole world could be improved, then there is no need to mention the tares in the previous passage, or to mention the fruitlessness of three-fourths of the soil. The subsequent passage concerning the species in the sea also is unnecessary. Furthermore, where in the Bible has God used the number three to represent the world? We can find only the numbers two (the Gentiles and the Jews) and four (every nation, all tribes, all peoples, and all tongues—Rev. 7:9) representing the whole world. According to the facts in the foregoing parables, we cannot expect the world to have a good result.</P><P>How then should we explain the parable of the mustard seed? From Genesis 1:11-12 we see that in God's creation everything is after its kind. Therefore, the vegetables will always be vegetables, and the birds will always be birds. Monkeys can never become human beings. Nevertheless, this mustard seed became a tree. This is contrary to God's will. Originally, the church was ordained to be the smallest, the weakest, and the least noticeable. However, the church has become Christianity, signified by the tree. Today the composition of Christianity is very complicated. This is due to the invasion of the church by Gnosticism during the second and third centuries, as portrayed in the second parable. From then on, under the hand of the Roman Catholic Church, the church brought forth many shameful things. Under one command, tens of thousands of soldiers were baptized in one day. By becoming Christians, people had the privilege to receive four ounces of silver and two changes of white raiment. Alas! The church became a tree! The birds of heaven signify the evil one, Satan (Matt. 13:4). He is most clever, and he knew where he could settle down. Therefore, how could he let this opportunity pass by? The Roman Catholic Church is truly absurd and thus becomes Satan's headquarters. The Protestant Church also follows in its footstep in things such as Christmas, which is a "bird" that "flew" from the Roman Catholic Church to the Protestant Church.</P><P>What do the birds denote? And what does the tree refer to? Daniel 4:20-22 speaks concerning the power and authority of Babylon. Ezekiel 31:3-6 speaks concerning the power and authority of the Assyrian king. Therefore, the tree here refers to the power and authority of this world, especially in relation to the political aspect. Birds denote sins, which come from Satan. Therefore, the sins in today's church actually include the sins of the entire world. What sin is not found in the church? The church has become Babylon, which is utterly in confusion. She is also like a large department store. Satan is most clever, and he devoured the seed (Matt. 13:4). However, he was not altogether successful. Therefore, he changed his tactics by causing the tree to grow larger so that all the birds could come and lodge there. This is, in effect, hanging up the signboard of Christianity but selling the medicine of Satan.</P><P>What has the Lord ordained for the church? First John 3:1 says that the world does not know us; Galatians 6:14 says that the world has been crucified; and 1 Peter 2:11 says that we are strangers and sojourners. What the Lord has ordained is so small, even having no relationship with the world. To the Christians the world is a pathway when they are alive and a tomb when they die. Mr. Panton once said something to this effect, "When I am living, the world is a pathway; when I die, the world at most will give me a coffin. If it does not give me that, I will not mind either." Actually, how did the church become great? (That is, how did the mustard seed grow to be a tree?) It is because her roots are very long, and they grow deeply into the earth to get nourishment. Thus, the world helps the church to grow. Therefore, a Christian should not obtain glory from the world. For example, the archbishop of the Anglican Church is a member of the House of Lords. When that happens, the mustard seed has become great. Vegetables and trees are different. First, vegetables are annual or biannual herbs, whereas trees are perennial plants. Today the church has lost her sojourning nature. Second, vegetables have leaves, and trees have branches. The church's enterprises are greatly advertised, and the church is divided into sects. Third, the roots of vegetables are only two to three inches deep, whereas the roots of trees are several times longer than their trunks and go down deeply into the earth. This indicates that the church is worldly and has been rooted in the world. Vegetables will die in two or three months, but the trees will not. This means that the church has lost her original attitude of looking to God. God desires the church to return to the principle in Genesis and be a vegetable. Unfortunately, the church prefers to be a tree. The church as a tree has merely an outward appearance and is without reality. Moreover, she has lost her chastity and is unable to lead the world to repentance. Satan is the one who gets the most profit. Hence, we must preserve our "smallness" and not admire others' greatness. Let us surpass others in suffering hardships and yield to others in enjoying comforts. We should have the mind, the determination, to suffer, which is more precious than actually going through the sufferings. We may be poor in our pocket so long as our spirit is not poor. The secret of overcoming is to stand in the position that the Lord has given to us. Saul considered himself to be small, and God used him (1 Sam. 9:21). Later on, when he became great, God turned to David (1 Sam. 15:30: 16:1). God seeks the small vessels, not the large ones (1 Sam. 10:21; Acts 9:15).</P>
