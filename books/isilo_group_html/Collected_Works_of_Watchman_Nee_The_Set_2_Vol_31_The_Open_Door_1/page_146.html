The Lord began to work in San-Ban-Gang three years ago. Brother Hu Siao-lan from the church in Dong-Gou came to visit us occasionally. Last winter there were more than one hundred twenty believers. Forty-six of them had been baptized into the Lord's name. We still must ask the Lord to work and lead us all forward until He comes. Peace.</p><p>Your smallest brother,<br />Huang Wan-jin<br />March 16<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Mo-Gan-Shan, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Thank God for constantly gracing us during the six months we lived as refugees. He always covers us. I think that Brothers Chou Hsing-yi, Tang Shou-ling, and Chou Fu-en and their wives have already told you about our condition in detail, so I will not say too much. We especially thank God that we suffered no loss through hardships, even though our houses in San-Chiao-Bu were burned and we were robbed twice. We can even say that we did not feel frightened by all these things. Praise the Lord! The meetings of the brothers and sisters have never stopped. I believe that God's grace will never change. I really am thankful for the prayers of the brothers and sisters in Shanghai and every other place. Before the Lord we often remember the brothers and sisters that have met with similar hardships. We can only feel for them and respond to their needs in prayer. I have written these few lines hastily because someone is going to Shanghai, and I wanted to greet you. I really think of Brother Stephen Kaung. Please greet him for me. May God keep you safe.</p><p>Your weak sister,<br />Sun Chen Yao-jen<br />April 30, 1938<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Gao-Mi, Shantung Province</h2><p>Greetings to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>I received Issue Nos. 1&mdash;5 of The Open Door. The Lord's light really shined into my heart. Because the Lord is working in every place to save souls, our hearts are filled with thanks and praise. We thank the Lord even more that through this printed communication, the brothers and sisters are able to fellowship with each other during this time. We truly admire the saints' heart for the Lord and feel ashamed for ourselves at the same time. There is not a meeting in Gao-Mi that is truly according to the Scriptures. On March 2 Brother Chang Tze-jieh was led by the Lord to meet in Gao-Mi for seven days. He preached the gospel in the morning, and some were saved. He did some building work in the afternoon. It seems that the Lord has begun to work. We meet every morning at ten o'clock for prayer. We preach the gospel on Wednesday and Saturday mornings at eleven o'clock. There are not many people in one accord with us. We really need to wait before the Lord to deal with everything. We must know His heart's desire, seek His will, and wait for His arrangement. Please pray for us and ask God to establish our faith. May God gain us more. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Wang Shu-ge, Ju Sung-shan, Hu Shen-fu<br />April 26<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_145.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_147.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 146</div><br></body></html>
