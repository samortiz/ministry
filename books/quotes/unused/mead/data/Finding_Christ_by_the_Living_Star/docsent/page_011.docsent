   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WANDERING STARS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is also a negative aspect to the stars the wandering stars.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jude 12 and 13 tell us, "These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots...wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should be the stars, but not the wandering stars.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These are the false leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So many Christians today are not stars; some, however, are stars, but they are wandering stars.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are leaders and teachers in today's Christianity who are in this category.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do you know what a wandering star is?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not know astronomy, but I can tell you a little.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A proper star has a certain position and fixed orbit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It continues in its course steadfastly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But there are some stars with no fixed position or orbit: they are wandering stars.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It seems that some Christians are stars, it seems that they are shining, but their shining is a deception.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are stars, but they are not the steadfast stars.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you follow them, you will be misled; eventually you will not know where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They themselves are wandering: they have no ground, they have no standing, they have no certain way to go on with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today they say this, and tomorrow they will say that; they are wandering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Be careful!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You can never find Jesus by following a wandering star.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How may we know the wandering stars?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are some signs.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are trees without fruit, they are the clouds without rain.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You must look for the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus said that we may know a tree by its fruit Matt 7:16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we follow the wandering stars, eventually our portion will be the same as theirs the blackness of darkness forever.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must follow the shining stars, those with a definite standing and a certain course.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are the stable stars, the steadfast ones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If anyone comes to you without a definite standing and certain course, avoid him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The proper standing is the local church, and the right course is to go on in the Spirit in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Never be a wandering star, and never follow a wandering star.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Take the proper standing, and get yourself in the right course.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you are wandering, you are wasting your time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you would go to a certain place, get out your map, get on the right road and in the right lane; and as you drive, you will reach your destination.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am not speaking these things lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You are aware of today's confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Oh, the dead things!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Oh, the frustrations, the distractions of the wandering ones!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Anyone who keeps us from the genuine local church and from meeting on the ground of unity with the Lord's people is a wandering star.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The true stars are those who turn many to righteousness, those who do not lead people astray, but turn them to the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today the only way for you and me and for anyone to find Christ is to see the living star.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hallelujah!</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You just have to contact them; you just have to keep company with them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They will lead you to the place where Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord be merciful to us that we may always be kept in the right way to meet the Lord, to worship Him, and to offer our love to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May the Lord make us all like those wise men, following the star to find Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today the living star and the living stars are in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let us follow them and let us be one of them.</S>
