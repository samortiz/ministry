The law of the consummated Spirit is the means for the release from the bondage of sin. The release from the bondage, the slavery, of sin, the law of sin, is the goal of the law of the consummated Spirit. But in order for the law of the consummated Spirit to operate, there is the need of our cooperation by setting our mind on the mingled spirit (v. 6b) and by walking according to the mingled spirit (v. 4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>By the Sanctification of the Consummated Spirit<br>from the Present Age of the World</H2><P>We also need to be saved in the divine life of Christ by the sanctification of the consummated Spirit from the present age of the world (Rom. 12:2a; 6:19b, 22b). This consummated Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God. Through the steps of incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, the Triune God was processed and consummated. Through the final step of resurrection, the process was completed, and the Spirit was consummated. This consummated Spirit can bring the divine life into us to regenerate us. Before incarnation, the Spirit of God had no qualification or position to impart God's life into us because our sins had not yet been dealt with according to God's righteous requirements. This dealing was accomplished by Christ's redemption. Before incarnation, humanity had never been joined or mingled with divinity. Through incarnation, death, and resurrection, the Spirit of God became equipped and qualified to impart life to man and to save man in the divine life.</P><P>We need to be sanctified by the consummated Spirit, not by our strong will or mind, from the present age of this world. I may read the newspaper in order to realize something concerning the world situation. But when many of the sisters read the newspaper, they may immediately try to find information about the sales in the department stores. These sales are something of the age of this world. We need to be saved from the present age of this world. To be occupied with different department store sales annuls our being holy and promotes our being common, worldly, and modern according to the style of this world. We need to be saved from the style of this world by a holy separation.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> </body></html>
