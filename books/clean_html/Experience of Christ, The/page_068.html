<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MEEKNESS AND CONSIDERATENESS OF CHRIST</H2><P>Second Corinthians 10:1 says, "Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and considerateness of Christ" (Gk.). This verse does not mean, however, that Paul was imitating Christ. No, because he lived by Christ, Christ's meekness became his. Hence, he could beseech the Corinthians through the meekness of the Christ by whom he lived. Paul was meek, not in himself, but in Christ. Whatever he expressed as meekness was Christ's meekness, not his own.</P><P>Furthermore, Paul also besought the Corinthians by the considerateness of Christ. Other versions render the Greek word here as "lenience." This means that Paul was not legal, but was flexible and lenient. Like his meekness, his lenience was not of himself; it was of Christ. Paul experienced Christ as the One who was kind, gentle, and flexible. Because he lived by Christ, Christ's lenience was his. Because Paul lived by Christ, he had the virtues of Christ, including the virtues of meekness and considerateness. In his ministry, writing, and speaking, Paul was in Christ. Everything he did was done by the virtues of Christ. In everything we do we need to be found in Christ. Oh, that I may gain Christ and be found in Him in a condition that is based upon faith! I do not want to do anything by my struggling or endeavoring. Rather, I want to do everything by living in Christ that His virtues may be spontaneously expressed in my living.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TRUTH OF CHRIST</H2><P>In 2 Corinthians 11:10 Paul says, "The truth of Christ is in me." The truth of Christ was in Paul because Christ Himself was in him. Christ is the truth. This is a further proof that Paul lived by Christ. Otherwise, he could not have had the truth of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GRACE OF CHRIST BEING SUFFICIENT</H2><P>In chapter twelve Paul prayed three times that the thorn in his flesh would depart from him. Verse 9 says, "And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me." The power of Christ overshadowed Paul, tabernacling over him. This also is the experience of Christ. Paul did not do anything on his own, nor did he insist upon his preference. He simply looked to Christ, trusted in Christ, lived by Christ, and learned to enjoy Christ's overshadowing. To him, Christ was a tabernacle overshadowing him, no matter what difficulties he was experiencing. Under this overshadowing, Paul enjoyed God's sufficient grace. Therefore, little by little and step by step, he came to know Christ, not only by revelation, but through his personal experience. He could testify and boast that the grace of Christ was sufficient. He knew that when he was weak, he was strong, because in his weakness the power of Christ was made perfect. This is the living out of Christ. What an experience of Christ the Apostle Paul had!</P>
