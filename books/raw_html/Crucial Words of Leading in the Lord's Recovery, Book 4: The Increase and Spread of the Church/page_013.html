	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH BEING<br />
ACCORDING TO LAW</h1>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING A PLAN BASED ON ACTUAL RESOURCES</h2>
<p>We must have a proper understanding regarding the making of a plan. Effective plans are based on actual resources. For example, the production of goods is determined by the resources that are available to make it. For example, a farmer does not develop a plan to grow certain crops out of thin air. His plan is based on the amount of farmland he has, his manpower, his time, and his finances. He must base his plan on the actual condition of his land, manpower, time, and finances. Every line of business faces these same considerations; that is, a business must make a reasonable plan based on the availability of actual resources.</p>
<p>The increase of the church does not depend upon organization. Its resources are related to life, not to organizational structure. Nevertheless, without planning, life alone will not produce the maximum results. Although we have emphasized life over the past twenty-eight years, our annual rate of increase has been less than three percent. The issue of our emphasis on life has been limited because we have had no accompanying plan. A farmer who does not know the acreage of his farmland, the level of his manpower, the availability of his time, or the extent of his finances will not reap the same benefit as a farmer who does have a plan. Even a farmer with significant resources will not obtain maximum results without a plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REDEEMING THE TIME</h2>
<p>A plan for the increase and spread of the church will ensure that we redeem the time. Ephesians 5:15-17 says, &ldquo;Not as unwise, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.&rdquo; The best way to redeem the time is to follow a schedule. If a person desires to obtain the most benefit from his education, he needs to follow a schedule so that time is not wasted. As human history developed, an educational system also was developed, beginning with kindergarten and advancing through elementary school, junior high school, high school, college, and graduate school. Every country in the world, almost without exception, follows such a system, because through experience this system has been proven to be effective.</p>
<p>Private education in China in the past typically involved one person teaching a group of children to recite ancient literature. There was not much educational advancement with this method because the classes consisted primarily of memorization, recitation, and some writing. However, educational methods have changed, and now most countries follow a schedule that goes from kindergarten to graduate school. This system helps to redeem the time. Without this system, a person could be in school for many years and not advance very much.</p>
<p>In the past twenty-eight years we have been speaking of truth and life in a general way, yet even now many people cannot speak some basic truths. This shows that our way needs to be improved. Over three thousand &ldquo;students&rdquo; have been meeting several times a week, but when they speak on the essential Spirit, the economical Spirit, the cross, and the breaking of the flesh, it is as if they are like the students who recite ancient literature. After twenty-eight years I am concerned that we do not have many elementary school graduates, much less university graduates. An elementary school graduate at least understands some basic arithmetic, but many saints among us cannot speak even a basic word on the truth of justification, sanctification, or redemption. This shows that our time needs to be redeemed by using a schedule.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INCLUDING A SCHEDULE IN A PROPER PLAN</h2>
<p>Some sisters are housewives, and after seeing their children off to school and their husbands off to work, their main responsibilities relate to household matters. If these sisters do not have a schedule to complete the things that need to be done during the day, they can easily waste time and accomplish nothing. Similarly, it is difficult to read the Bible consistently without a schedule. Even though we love the Lord very much, there are only twenty-four hours in a day. If we are busy with other things and do not have a scheduled time to read the Bible, we will not be able to find the time to read the Bible. If we love the Lord, we should live to the Lord by making a schedule; otherwise, our day will pass by in a flash, and before the Lord, we will regret our failure to redeem the time.</p>
<p>We must consider our physical condition when we set up a schedule for work and rest. If a person is not healthy, he must care for his body for the Lord&rsquo;s sake and set aside sufficient time for rest. Then everything else that needs to be done in a day should be included in a schedule, including reading newspapers. In this way we will have time to read the Bible, pray, and serve the Lord. Without a schedule we will read the Bible unceasingly when we are happy and put the Bible aside when we are not happy. It is difficult to work with a person who is controlled by his moods rather than a schedule, and even his completed work is not helpful because it has been done improperly. A person who cannot get things done properly cannot serve the Lord.</p>
<p>When I first began to serve the Lord, I was very busy and I frequently received letters. However, I often had little time to reply because I did not know how to arrange my time. When I was able to reply, I would begin by apologizing for not writing sooner. At first my conscience was not bothered by this, but the more I repeated this excuse, the more my conscience was bothered. One day I asked myself, &ldquo;Were you really busy, or did you just not arrange your time well? If you were &lsquo;busy&rsquo; only because you did not manage your time, you are lying.&rdquo; After this, whenever I was late in replying to a letter, I could only say, &ldquo;I am sorry for not replying until now.&rdquo; Even though this was an honest word, I still was not truly peaceful because a late reply is never good. This is an example of our need to schedule everything in a proper way.</p>
<p>I believe many saints have had similar experiences. For example, if we decide to read a certain number of chapters in the Bible every day, but do not set a schedule, we will soon stop reading the Bible. Although we can excuse ourselves by saying that we have been busy, the real reason is that we have not set a schedule to manage our time. When we have a schedule, there will always be time to read the Bible.</p>
<p>Often we see sisters running to the meeting in a rush because they love the Lord and do not want to be late. But since they love the Lord, they should not waste time, and then there would be no need to rush. They rush to a meeting because they have no schedule, and then they linger long after a meeting because they have no schedule. This shows our need to redeem the time according to Ephesians 5:16. Redeeming the time involves scheduling our time. We need to consider our use of time and make a schedule; otherwise, we will lose many opportunities to redeem the time. A schedule enables us to seize our time and redeem it.</p>
<p>Schools set a schedule and have a system so that students will not waste time. A school schedule involves the number of days in a week, semester, and year; the number of hours per day and the length of time for each course, which is usually fifty minutes with a ten minute break between classes for each course; and the number of hours required for study at home. All students are given this schedule and are expected to follow it. They cannot come to school late simply because they had only a few hours of sleep; they must get up at six o&rsquo;clock every morning, arrive at school by seven-thirty, and begin classes exactly at eight o&rsquo;clock. By following this schedule day after day, week after week, they gradually learn. Thus, they learn to redeem the time.</p>
<p>Many young people can follow a schedule when they are in school, but once they graduate, they become loose. I know of a young sister who kept a schedule quite diligently when she was in school, but after graduation she was unable to get out of bed to go to the meetings. During winter and summer breaks many students do not rest according to a schedule; as a result, time flies away. If we truly love the Lord, we must have a plan and a schedule for our time.</p>
