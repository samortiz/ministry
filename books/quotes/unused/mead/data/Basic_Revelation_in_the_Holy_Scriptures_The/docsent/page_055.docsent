   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO ENDS OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REFLECTING EACH OTHER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the materials that comprise this holy city are found in the first two chapters of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Genesis 2 there is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By the tree there is a river.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Where the river flows there is gold, "and the gold of that land is good."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is bdellium, a pearl produced by the plant life, and onyx stone Gen 2:9-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Following this, at the end of the chapter, there is a bride for Adam 2:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Revelation 21 and 22 there is a bride, a city built of gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Within the city is a river, and in the river is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These six items the bride, gold, pearls, precious stones, the tree of life, and the river are all found in the first two chapters of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The difference is that in Genesis the city had not yet been built.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The three materials were there but not built into a city.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some six thousand years later, through God's building work, all the materials have been built into a city.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do you see how these two ends of the Bible reflect each other?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1963 I went to Tyler, Texas and stayed in a brother's home.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After one of the meetings a friend of his, who was a traveling minister, picked up the phone in his home and called his friend, James Barber, in Plainview, Texas.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He told James to come and hear me at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The next evening James Barber was in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That night I gave a message on how the two ends of the Bible reflect each other.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This man James Barber was caught.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After the conference he said he was clear to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was the beginning of the church life in Texas.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I hope we also can have such a glorious impression of the Bible's beginning and end reflecting one another.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is God's economy to build up His eternal dwelling with the created things transformed to be His materials.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>GOD'S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>IN EXODUS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the children of Israel had been brought to Mount Sinai, God revealed to them the design of His tabernacle, and they built it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That was a type.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Holy of Holies within the tabernacle there was nothing but gold to be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Gold overlaid the boards, and upon the ceiling could be seen the golden thread.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Upon the high priest was the golden breastplate complete with twelve precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The twelve stones on the breastplate had the names of the twelve tribes of Israel Exo 28:15-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was God's special "alphabet" to reveal His thought to His children by means of the Urim and the Thummim Exo 28:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can see, then. that the thought of God's building, using precious stones, is also in Exodus.</S>
