<h1 class="title">PREFACE </h1> 
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei in 1960. Chapters 1 through 7 were given in co-workers&rsquo; meetings from July through October. Chapters 8 and 9 were given on the last two days of a training held from October 1959 to April 2, 1960.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">TWO PROBLEMS FACING<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S SERVING ONES&mdash;<br />
BEING DISCOURAGED AND BEING PROUD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">ASKING THE LORD TO INCREASE OUR FAITH</h2>
<p>Luke 17:5-10 says, &ldquo;The apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith. But the Lord said, If you have faith like a mustard seed, you would have said to this sycamine tree, Be uprooted and be planted in the sea; and it would have obeyed you. But which of you, having a slave who is plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, Come immediately and recline at table? Will he not rather say to him, Prepare something that I may dine, and gird yourself and serve me until I eat and drink; and after that you will eat and drink? He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were ordered, does he? So also you, when you do all the things which are ordered you, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done.&rdquo; This portion of the Word does not say that &ldquo;the disciples&rdquo; said to the Lord but that &ldquo;the apostles&rdquo; said to the Lord. The speakers were in a position of service. They were apostles, serving ones; they were not merely disciples, saved ones. The serving ones asked the Lord to increase their faith. The Lord replied that if their faith was the size of a mustard seed, they could tell a sycamine tree to be uprooted and planted in the sea, and it would obey them. Then the Lord told them a parable. On the surface, the parable seems unrelated to what was being discussed. However, verse 7 begins with the conjunction <em>but.</em> This shows that the two portions are related.</p>
<p>This portion of the Bible is simple and uses plain words, but most Bible readers admit that it is rather difficult to grasp the meaning in these verses. This portion begins with the apostles chosen by the Lord, His serving ones, asking to have their faith increased. The Lord did not answer them regarding how to increase their faith. Rather, He spoke of the effectiveness of having faith the size of a mustard seed. The Lord continued by speaking of slaves who, after plowing the land, tending the sheep, and doing many things, could not take credit for anything before their master. They needed to learn to serve the master so that he would be satisfied. Not only so, they should have the sense, the attitude, that they are unprofitable slaves. It is not easy to understand the meaning of this portion, even after reading it many times. Only after we have some experience in the Lord&rsquo;s work, in the service, can we understand the meaning of this portion.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this portion is to show that a person who is chosen by God to serve Him should not be discouraged; that is, he should learn to have faith. He should learn to believe. Believing saves us from being discouraged. As those who serve the Lord, we often encounter a discouraging situation. Sometimes we feel that we have not received a burden from the Lord, or we lament that we do not see the result of our work. As a result, many serving ones are discouraged instead of being strong and happy.</p>
<p>If we are always discouraged, we will be inwardly disturbed and continually ask the Lord to increase our faith. When the apostles asked the Lord to increase their faith, they seemed to be saying that they were not able to serve because they were short of faith. Hence, they asked the Lord to increase their faith. Instead of telling them how they could increase their faith, the Lord said that as long as they had faith, that was good enough. The apostles&rsquo; concern was that their faith was too small, but the Lord&rsquo;s concern was related to their thought concerning the absence of faith. The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;As long as you have faith, even if it is as small as a mustard seed, you can tell this sycamine tree to be uprooted and planted in the sea, and it will obey you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This word shows that those who serve the Lord do not need to ask Him to increase their faith. They only need to see that there is something in them called faith. Therefore, they should not say, &ldquo;My faith is too small.&rdquo; Christians often say, &ldquo;Please pray for me so that my faith would be increased.&rdquo; In these verses the Lord does not touch the size of our faith. Instead, the Lord points out that we have faith. It was not possible for the apostles not to have faith, nor is it possible for those whom the Lord has called not to have faith. Perhaps we consider that our faith is small, but the Lord&rsquo;s reply to the apostles shows that even a small measure of faith is sufficient. We must believe the Lord&rsquo;s word. We need to see that we do not need to increase our faith. We simply need to have faith. Every believer has faith.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO PROBLEMS FACING THE LORD&rsquo;S SERVING ONES</h2>
<p>In verses 7 and 8 the Lord continued, &ldquo;Which of you, having a slave who is plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, Come immediately and recline at table? Will he not rather say to him, Prepare something that I may dine, and gird yourself and serve me until I eat and drink; and after that you will eat and drink?&rdquo; This means that no matter how much we accomplish by faith, we have no ground for boasting. Our problem is that either we fall into discouragement, or we become proud. Once we become proud, we consider that others are not up to the standard and are not acceptable. Hence, after speaking concerning faith, the Lord gave the example of a slave in order to touch our pride.</p>
<p>When we realize that it is not a matter of increasing our faith but of seeing that we have faith, then we are standing on a foundation and are equipped to accomplish things. When we realize that even a small amount of faith is our capital, we will be able to accomplish many things by this faith. Once we grasp this key, we will be able to accomplish many things. Regrettably, we still are complicated people, because it is easy to be discouraged or proud. We cannot pretend. A brother who is discouraged can also be proud. Even if he is not intentionally proud, his self-righteous attitude and high regard for himself are expressions of pride.</p>
<p>Here are some examples. One brother might say that he does not know how to study the Bible, but another brother might give thanks to the Lord and say that he knows how to study the Bible. One sister might say that she does not know how to receive a burden from the Lord, but another sister might say that it is easy for her to be enlightened and receive a burden. One brother might say that he is confused and is not advancing spiritually; hence, he is discouraged. Another brother might say that it is easy for him to touch the Lord and that he always senses the Lord&rsquo;s presence when he prays. In Luke 17:5-10 the Lord said that even if our faith is small, we will be able to accomplish many things, but we must not forget that we are still slaves. This means that even if our faith enables us to sow the seed of the gospel, to shepherd the flock of God, and to edify the saints, we should not be proud and boast about our service.</p>
<p>We should not say that since we have accomplished much, we should eat and be satisfied. We cannot enjoy or boast of our achievements yet. After we plow and tend the sheep&mdash;that is, preach the gospel and shepherd the saints&mdash;we should still serve the Lord in order for Him to be satisfied first. After He is satisfied, we can have a little satisfaction and enjoyment. In addition, we should have the attitude that we are useless slaves and that we have done what we should have done. On the one hand, such an attitude will save us so that we may be one with the Lord. On the other hand, it will preserve us from being discouraged or proud. We are not discouraged, because the Lord has chosen us and given us a small amount of faith as our capital. With this capital we serve Him. If we obtain results, we are not proud, because we realize that no matter what we do, we are unprofitable slaves.</p>
<p>This matter concerning faith must be deeply wrought into our being. The reason we can serve the Lord is that He has put a small measure of faith within us as our capital, not because of anything else. Who among us can say that he does not have faith? We have been chosen and called by God; hence, no matter how pitiful our condition is, there is faith in us. This small faith is our capital. We must not be discouraged, because it is sufficient to have faith. This faith enables us to do many things. The Lord is wise. He knows that when we are enlightened, have learned some lessons, and gained results, we can veer off to the extreme of being proud. We will think that we are able to plow and tend the sheep, and as a result, our pride and self-content will surface. Hence, the Lord said that even if we plow and tend the sheep, we still cannot eat when we come in. This means that we cannot seek our satisfaction first or desire our own enjoyment. We should wait on the Lord with an empty stomach and allow Him to be satisfied first. Not only so, we should humble ourselves and say, &ldquo;Lord, I am an unprofitable slave. Even though I plowed and tended the sheep, I have no ground to boast. I did what I should have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two problems of being discouraged and being proud are present among those who serve the Lord. A substantial number of co-workers feel that they are pitiful because they cannot give a message or do anything else. Therefore these ones are worried and discouraged. However, a small number of co-workers have a different situation. Instead of waiting on the Lord humbly and saying, &ldquo;Lord, we are unprofitable slaves, and we have done only a little,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;We plow and tend the sheep, we receive light and vision when we read the Bible, and we are able to do this and that.&rdquo; These two attitudes are present among us. Some are worried and discouraged, but others are proud and full of self-esteem. Both situations need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, because we have nothing to be discouraged about, and we have nothing to be proud of.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM<br />
BEING DISCOURAGED AND BEING PROUD</h2>
<p>There is a seed within us, which is our faith. The Lord said that our faith needs to be only the size of a mustard seed. Our faith is the capital for our service. We need to serve the Lord with our faith. We should not be concerned with our weaknesses or our inabilities. Whether or not we have insight, can speak eloquently, or can remember the verses in the Bible should not be a problem.</p>
<p>Every person who is chosen by the Lord has faith. The problem that the Lord&rsquo;s servants face is that they are either discouraged or proud. We are either discouraged and say that we cannot see, cannot remember, and cannot speak clearly, or we are proud and say that we can see, can remember, and can speak. Luke 17 shows how we can be delivered from these two problems. We should not be discouraged, for the Lord has put faith, our capital, within us. This faith cannot be removed and enables us to serve Him. Hence, we can preach the gospel and can shepherd the saints.</p>
<p>However, when we are able to preach the gospel or shepherd the saints, we must guard against pride. We should never say that since we can do these things, we deserve to be rewarded. The Lord said that we should humble ourselves, that is, come before Him and serve Him. The Lord should be the first to be satisfied. We must stand before Him and say, &ldquo;We are unprofitable slaves.&rdquo; The Lord does not like to hear us say that we are faithless slaves. He likes to hear us say that we are unprofitable slaves. The Lord also likes to hear us say that we have faith, not that we do not have faith. He likes to hear us say that we are unprofitable slaves who preach the gospel and shepherd the saints because it is our service. If we remember that we are people of faith, we will not be discouraged; we will be able to stand. If we remember that we are unprofitable slaves, we will not be proud. We should continually be before the Lord in relation to His words in these verses.</p>
<p>We should not lose heart, nor should we envy others in their service. Not every serving one can be like the apostle Paul. There were many apostles, but there was only one Paul. Silas and Timothy were both very good, but they could not write the Epistles that Paul wrote. Therefore, as long as we have faith, we should not lose heart. Even though our faith is small, it is enough capital for our service. Furthermore, we must remember that we are unprofitable slaves and should be humble. We have received the Lord&rsquo;s mercy; hence, we should not take credit for preaching the gospel or shepherding the saints. Rather, we must continue to serve the Lord. The Lord must be satisfied first. We are unprofitable slaves, who have done what we should do. This must be our realization.</p>
<p>During my recent recuperation from an illness, I considered the condition of the serving ones. Some serving ones are discouraged, but others are self-contented and proud. One serving one told me that he has seen a vision and received a clear burden and that he always receives revelation when he reads the Bible. Upon hearing these words, I was concerned. I fear that one day problems may arise among us. We have a sickness because some of us are discouraged, but others are proud.</p>
<p>We decided that when the co-workers come together, we will seek the Lord&rsquo;s presence and fellowship concerning different situations. We must be brave and fierce in order to fight the spiritual warfare. We must also strive to bear the burden and not be afraid of sufferings. When we fellowship, our spirit should be keen, and we should open to one another in order to be balanced and corrected by others. A brother should say that he is not sure how the others feel about a situation. He should say that he has a feeling, but it may be from his natural man; hence, he is seeking to be balanced in fellowship. Among us there should be a situation of open fellowship.</p>
<p>It is not right for us to be discouraged or to be proud. Those who are discouraged are comparing themselves with others. If we have learned the lesson, we would not be in our feelings. When a brother releases the light that he has received, we would not compare ourselves with him. Rather, we would thank the Lord for raising up such a brother among us. A number of brothers are discouraged because they compare themselves with those who are successful in the work, receive light from the Bible, shepherd the saints, or give messages. There is also a number of brothers who say that that they are able to preach the gospel and shepherd the saints. They also say that they have a vision and that they can succeed when others fail. This kind of talk exposes their heart. They have unconsciously fallen into pride.</p>
<p>Some serving ones are discouraged because they have been asking the Lord to increase their faith, but the Lord has not answered their prayer. Even though many years have passed, they have not been able to get through in their Bible reading, and they have not received any burden directly from the Lord. The Lord says that it is sufficient for our faith to be the size of a little mustard seed. We must forget our feelings and not compare ourselves with others. If it were not for our small faith that upholds and maintains us, many co-workers would have fallen down discouraged. The co-workers often do not rise up in the work, because they are disheartened. There are also co-workers who consider themselves capable of administrating the church, preaching the gospel, and shepherding the saints. They do not acknowledge that they are unprofitable slaves. We lack the spirit of humility. Those whose functions are not manifested are discouraged, but those whose functions are manifested are self-contented. May the Lord have mercy on us. We do not want to fall into either of these two categories.</p>
<p>No matter how many things we accomplish, we still must admit that it is by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and that it is He who has blessed us and led us. Furthermore, we must also acknowledge that there are many things that we have not accomplished. We should realize that even if the blessing we received from the Lord were doubled, we still would not have done enough. There is nothing that we can boast of. We must prostrate ourselves before the Lord and say that we are unprofitable slaves. There is no limit to the progress we can make in regard to visions, burdens, light, reading the Bible, spiritual knowledge, leading the church, or preaching the gospel. Hence, no one can say that he has reached the peak and can go no further. We should humble ourselves. We should not be discouraged, nor should we be proud.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEM BEING OUR LACK OF MUTUAL LOVE</h2>
<p>A brother asked how we should manifest our functions when we are together. John 15:16-17 says, &ldquo;You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you. These things I command you that you may love one another.&rdquo; According to John 15, the basic condition for bearing fruit is abiding in the Lord and fellowshipping with Him. However, this chapter concerns not only a believer&rsquo;s personal fellowship with the Lord but also the members&rsquo; loving one another; that is, it concerns our relationship with the Lord and our relationship with the other brothers and sisters. Hence, there are two conditions for bearing fruit: abiding in the Lord and loving one another. Abiding in the Lord is a matter of our fellowshipping with Him, and loving one another involves all the saints.</p>
<p>Most believers see the first condition, but they often neglect the second condition. They think that as long as they fellowship with the Lord, they will not have problems. They do not realize that there is another condition in the Bible. It is necessary that we fellowship with the Lord; however, we must also love the other members. The Lord is the vine tree, and I am not the only branch; there are many other branches. I am not the only member in the Lord&rsquo;s Body; there are many other members. I should maintain a proper relationship not only with the vine tree but also with the other branches. We need to abide in the Lord and also to love the other members.</p>
<p>We become discouraged or proud, not because we lack fellowship with the Lord but because we are short of love for one another. If we practice loving one another, we will not become discouraged or proud. Loving one another is a matter of coordination. Many of us should manifest our functions. The fact that we are not manifesting our functions indicates that there is a problem in our coordination. While some are discouraged because their functions are not being manifested, others are proud because their functions are being manifested. Being proud and self-content destroys a person&rsquo;s function. Both being discouraged and being proud cause us to suffer a great loss. Both of these problems are the issue of not loving one another.</p>
<p>The Lord does not require all of us to be capable. There were many apostles, but only Paul wrote Ephesians. The Lord does not intend for each of us to be like Paul. Many believers, including Timothy and Titus, received help from Paul. The truth is balanced. On one hand, every serving one should learn to live before the Lord, but on the other hand, not all the serving ones receive burdens directly from the Lord. For example, Titus appointed elders in every city, but he did not receive this burden directly from the Lord. Instead, he was charged to do so by the apostle Paul (Titus 1:5). Perhaps some would say that they do not have the burden to preach the gospel; hence, those who have the burden should preach the gospel. This thought indicates that we are not in coordination. Coordination means that some members are eyes, and others are feet. The eyes have the function of seeing, but they need the feet in order to move. Our problem is that we want to be both the feet as well as the eyes. This means that we do not have proper coordination.</p>
<p>If the Lord would have mercy on us, we must learn to coordinate. On one hand, we should learn to live before the Lord and fellowship with Him. On the other hand, we should learn to coordinate with one another. A sister should learn to live before the Lord and to serve joyfully by means of her faith. Nevertheless, in anything related to her service, she should learn to coordinate with others and accept the arrangement. She has neither the position nor the gift to receive a burden directly from the Lord. Her position is to accept the arrangement in the work. She should also joyfully receive whatever is assigned and entrusted to her from those with whom she coordinates. Then she will have the Lord&rsquo;s presence. We are not an organization that operates according to human opinions.</p>
<p>If the Lord allows, even the speaking from the podium will be in coordination. Before the word is released on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, the brothers who are burdened to release the word should come together to fellowship concerning the content of the message and concerning their situations. Someone may say, &ldquo;I have some feeling to release a message. I feel that the Lord desires to speak concerning this matter, because this is the need of the brothers and sisters.&rdquo; He may also fellowship how he will speak so that others can consider it. Perhaps another brother may support it with a supplementary word, and still some others may add a word concerning what he needs to avoid or guard against. Some brothers serving together with him may even share something from their own experience. After this kind of fellowship, the message that is released will definitely be stronger, richer, and more practical than a message that is given without fellowship.</p><h2 class="head1">COORDINATION BEING TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER</h2>
<p>In order for the serving ones to be in coordination, we must have many service meetings. The purpose of these meetings is for the serving ones to come together and fellowship. I hope that every serving one would receive the Lord&rsquo;s mercy so that we could frankly discuss any matter. For example, the serving ones should be able to fellowship concerning the shortages in a message given by a brother. Through such fellowship the lack in the message will be covered, and strong, positive, and rich points can be added. This will strengthen and enrich the speaking. The way the Lord has taken among us does not depend on raising up one good speaker who manifests a strong ministry of the word. The Lord&rsquo;s way is to lead all the brothers who are responsible for the ministry of the word to be blended into one. Such mutual fellowship will strengthen and enrich the word that is released.</p>
<p>We should fellowship not only concerning the ministry of the word but also concerning visiting the saints, leading the church, and the young people&rsquo;s work. The full-time workers, the serving saints, and the elders should have thorough fellowship concerning how to carry out the young people&rsquo;s work. They should pray and fellowship together. Even saints who are not directly involved in a service can still fellowship concerning that service. As a result, all the saints will be brought into fellowship and built together; there will not be a distinction between those who are involved and those who are not. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word in John 15, if we love one another, we will bear much fruit. If we continue to live before the Lord individually, we will serve individually and not be balanced in our service. As a result, there will not be fruit.</p>
<p>We must change our way and practice loving one another. We should come together and fellowship concerning our service. When we receive correction from other members, our weaknesses are removed. The result of this kind of fellowship is that one person&rsquo;s work becomes everyone&rsquo;s work, because he no longer works according to his personal view but according to the view of all the serving ones. Thus, we will be blended together. Then when a brother gives a message, the message will contain not only the light he saw but also the light from the other brothers, and the serving ones will bear the result of his message. The message is not given by one person but by many brothers. Perhaps only two co-workers carry out a certain task, but all the co-workers are involved through fellowship. Thus, a practical expression of loving one another will be produced among us, and any function that is manifested will come out of mutual love. We will not only abide in the Lord, having fellowship with Him, but we will also love one another.</p>
<p>We lack mutual love that comes out of coordination. We need to lead the saints to pursue fellowship so that all the full-time serving ones and the elders will have the expression of loving one another in their service and in bearing fruit as co-branches. Every branch not only abides in the vine tree but also loves the other branches. Then we will grow in life, and our various functions will be manifested. Every member of the Body has a different function, just as our body has hands, a mouth, eyes, and feet. Some members receive burdens directly from the Lord, but others accept the coordination in the work. Some members may be like the apostle Paul. Others may be like Titus and Timothy. Nevertheless, none of these functions will override our personal fellowship with the Lord or our living before the Lord.</p>
<p>When our service is in coordination, our work will be successful, and we will have learned the lessons. Furthermore, the two problems in our service will be resolved. May the Lord have mercy on us and lead us into this stage so that in all our service in the work we would live before Him and love one another.</p>
<p>The saints in a certain local church are learning to live before the Lord and serve in coordination. After the brothers minister the word, they fellowship with all the co-workers concerning what was spoken. They also fellowship before the message is delivered. Everyone expresses his feelings. The brothers also fellowship concerning the direction of the meeting. As a result, there is an understanding among the saints, and they are in coordination.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>On one hand, we are not discouraged, because we realize that we have faith. On the other hand, no matter how much we accomplish, we still must acknowledge that we are unprofitable slaves. Not only so, in our service we should learn to abide in the Lord and love one another. We should fellowship and coordinate with one another. This is the way we should serve in the ministry of the word, in visiting the saints, in leading the meetings, and in all the other services. Through coordination we will be strengthened, enriched, balanced, and protected. This is the way to learn many wonderful lessons and avoid unnecessary mistakes.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">KNOWING GENUINE GROWTH IN LIFE<br />
AND<br />
SEEING THE REVELATION<br />
OF CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GENUINE GROWTH IN LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Man Longing<br />
for a Transcendent Life</h2>
<p>Many Christians want to live in heaven, but in His wisdom God did not create man and then put him in heaven. In His wisdom God ordained that man should live on earth. Everyone who lives on the earth must endure innumerable problems. Even those who receive grace to serve God sometimes feel that life on earth is miserable. This feeling, however, does not come from our spirit. We may feel miserable simply because we are hot or sick. Although these conditions seem like small and insignificant matters, they are according to God&rsquo;s wisdom and His plan.</p>
<p>God created man and placed man on the earth so that man would live a normal and proper life. For the past two thousand years of church history, Christians have had a longing in their hearts to live a life that is transcendent, that is, a life without troubles or distractions, so that they could pursue and fellowship with God. Christians have longed to touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence when they pray and to receive light when they read the Bible. Christians have desired to be effective when they preach the gospel, that is, to touch people&rsquo;s hearts and bring them to tears. However, God does not seem to respond to these desires.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Two Schools in Church History<br />
That Pursued a Transcendent Life</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Monastics&mdash;Living in Seclusion</h2>
<p>There have been two groups of believers who have tried to live a transcendent life, but neither group has been successful. The first group, the monastics, was composed of believers who felt that the world with its affairs was a source of trouble. So, like the religions of the East, they forsook their families and lived a secluded life far from others. They had a simple lifestyle and were freed from the mundane affairs of human life. They testified that they had God&rsquo;s presence, but they did not gain a large following.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Mystics&mdash;Touching the Inner Man</h2>
<p>The second group, the mystics, is more recent in church history. The mystics were not ascetics. Ascetics left the world and lived in seclusion, but the mystics endeavored to turn away from outward things to touch the inner man.</p>
<p>Their practice met not only a spiritual need but also a psychological need that is common to all mankind. A Chinese scholar once said that all the literature related to Buddhism could be summarized with the words <em>from the heart,</em> meaning that Buddhism develops human virtues.</p>
<p>Confucian scholars say that a person who does not cultivate his virtues is like a tree without roots or a river with no source. The cultivation promoted by Confucian scholars stresses what is in the heart. Hence, seeking what is within man does not belong exclusively to spiritual Christians. It reflects a need that is common to man.</p>
<p>The mystics were prevalent for a time because other Christian groups were focusing on outward things and had become materialistic. Large chapels and cathedrals stress outward practices. Since the believers were not satisfied, the mystics were brought forth. This kind of inner pursuit, however, is not completely spiritual, because the heart is composed mainly of the mind, emotion, and will, along with the conscience in the spirit. Even Buddhists and Confucian philosophers practice a form of psychological cultivation. This principle was present among the mystics. Hence, the pursuit of the mystics was not entirely spiritual; it also involved a certain amount of psychological pursuit. Nevertheless, with the background of materialistic Christianity, the mystics became quite prevalent.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Balanced Living<br />
in the Environment Arranged by God</h2>
<p>Monasticism and mysticism were popular for a period of time, but later they provided a negative contrast to the proper Christian life. Orthodox Christians are not monks who try to escape the mundane affairs of human life in order to live an ascetic life in seclusion. Orthodox Christians do not give up the responsibilities of human life. Rather, they live a normal human life in the environment that has been arranged by God. They do not drop their responsibilities nor leave their families, wives, husbands, and children. They learn to live in human society with proper occupations. However, they also have the presence of God. Orthodox Christians grow in the divine life and develop humanly.</p>
<p>It is good to be freed from every encumbrance, and it is good to focus on fellowshipping with the Lord, not outward activities. However, God did not arrange for us to be separated from our human responsibilities. God is balanced, and He puts us in different environments so that we may be balanced.</p><h2 class="head2">A Personal Testimony</h2>
<p>During the Sino-Japanese War, I was led by the Lord to labor in different places in the northwestern provinces in China. While I was laboring, I had the feeling that there was a veil separating me from God. Nothing I did was able to remove the veil. I also felt that the Holy of Holies was far away from me. I wanted to enter the Holy of Holies, but I always failed. Even when I returned to Chefoo, I continued to have this feeling. I felt that I was outside the Holy of Holies. Later I realized that my understanding of the Holy of Holies was not accurate. It was something of my imagination.</p>
<p>I have not arrived at absolute spiritual maturity, and it seems as if no one can reach such a state. We will never reach a condition of complete sanctification. On the contrary, the more we receive grace, the more we will feel that there is an unholy element within us. We will sense an element of imperfection, a veil that cannot be breached, a weakness that cannot be put away. This sense is not abnormal. Quite to the contrary, it is normal. I am not saying that it is normal for a Christian to be weak. Rather, there is a condition of holiness which we always desire to reach but cannot attain to. We desire to live in the Holy of Holies, but we do not fully succeed. There is a veil we want to remove, but we are unable to remove it. This sense will remain with us until we see the Lord face to face.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Learning to Be Humble and<br />
Not Being Disturbed by Our Condition</h2>
<p>In His wisdom God created man and allowed man to fall repeatedly. He ordained that man would live on the earth, even though the earth had become dark and corrupt, in order to demonstrate His wisdom. In the midst of such a dark situation, God desires to produce many children to be the glorious counterpart of His Son. When the New Jerusalem is manifested, God will be fully expressed. Today, however, this glorious situation is not manifested. On the contrary, we often feel that we are unclean and impotent and that we have many weaknesses and failures. Although we yearn to shine as the stars in heaven, we need to be balanced. We may not be satisfied with our present condition, but we should not be distracted by it. On the one hand, we should learn to be humble and not think that we have arrived at a certain state of spirituality or have seen something. On the other hand, we should not be distracted by the thought that we have not seen or attained to something.</p>
<p>Some of the serving ones are single and do not have the burden of a family. It is easy for them to enjoy the Lord in the morning, and they can also go to bed at a proper time. Other serving ones have a family and children. When a child is sick, his mother may need to get up at night in order to give him medicine. As a result, the next morning she may not be able to rise up and have morning watch. If she can spend some time to enjoy the Lord during the day, her exercise will be genuine.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Circumstances Cultivating<br />
a Genuine Spiritual Life</h2>
<p>The lessons that we learn in our difficult situations are genuine. Abraham was led by God to pitch his tent between Bethel and Ai (Gen. 12:8). On one side was Bethel, which means &ldquo;house of God,&rdquo; and on the other side was Ai, which means &ldquo;a heap of ruins.&rdquo; This means that Abraham faced the house of God on one side and a heap of ruins, that is, desolation, on the other. In our daily life there are many situations that cause us to feel confused and desolate. A husband or a child often causes a sister to feel confused and desolate. Most parents feel that their children&rsquo;s situation is chaotic and desolate, and the young people may also feel that their parents are in a chaotic and desolate situation. This is especially true when we do not have much spiritual pursuit. We often will feel confused and desolate. A brother may feel that his locality is desolate and that the messages are not satisfying him. Even though he knows that he is in Bethel, the house of God, he also has a sense of being near Ai, a heap of ruins. He senses the presence of God on the one hand and desolation on the other.</p>
<p>We cannot say that desolation is according to God&rsquo;s creation, but in His wisdom He permits us to go through numerous desolate situations. A spiritual brother wants his wife to be spiritual, and a spiritual sister wants her husband to be spiritual. Likewise, parents want their children to be spiritual. However, the result is not always according to our desire. Throughout the two thousand years of church history, it is rare to see a situation where children become spiritual simply in response to their parents&rsquo; expectations.</p>
<p>The Lord puts us in desolate situations because He wants us to recognize our situation. There are many examples of people who did not love the Lord but whose children did. There are also examples of parents who were spiritual but had worldly children. Madame Guyon was very spiritual, and she wanted her husband to love God and take the same way with her in the spirit, but her husband was her cross. God allows such situations for the cultivation of genuine growth in life.</p><h2 class="head2">The Exercise of Genuine Spirituality<br />
Being between Bethel and Ai</h2>
<p>Genuine spiritual life grows in desolate circumstances. We should not expect to always receive light when we read the Bible, to have the Lord&rsquo;s presence when we pray, to save many sinners, or that our wife, husband, children, parents, and siblings will be spiritual. These expectations are unrealistic. Those who are genuinely spiritual pitch their tent between Bethel and Ai. God does not allow us to be free of desolate situations, that is, to become a monk or an ascetic, nor does He want us to become mystics. God desires that we remain in the status in which we were called (1 Cor. 7:20). Those who have a wife, a husband, children, or a family should remain where they are. They should learn to labor and work with their hands. If we can be normal human beings in our troublesome, complicated, and fallen situations, then we will have the genuine exercise of spirituality. Living between Bethel and Ai should be our normal experience.</p>
<p>We all want the church in our locality to be spiritual, free from problems, full of harmony and God&rsquo;s presence, and in a glorious situation. However, no matter how much we try to maintain the situation, a storm may come, there will be discord, or the flesh surfaces. In other words, Ai always accompanies Bethel. Like Abraham who followed God, we must pass between Bethel and Ai. We will see God&rsquo;s house on one side but a heap of ruins on the other side. No matter how we pray or labor, we should be prepared for desolate situations. The church may be Bethel today but Ai tomorrow. This is a picture of our true situation.</p>
<p>Our outward circumstances in coordination with the operation of God give us the opportunity to develop a genuine spiritual life. We should not expect to be in a situation that is heavenly and without any problems. God did not create us to be human beings in heaven. He ordained that we be human beings on earth. His desire for us to be genuinely spiritual does not mean that we should break away from human relationships. Rather, we need to live and conduct ourselves properly in these relationships.</p>
<p>No matter how much we grow in life and no matter how many visions we see, there will always be a feeling of desolation in us, because we live on earth, remain in our old man, and have the flesh. As long as we are on earth, our circumstances will give us a sense of desolation, a sense of Ai. We are in between Bethel and Ai, and we seek progress. On the one hand, we have a sense of desolation, but on the other hand, we are in the house of God and have the presence of God. On the one hand, we are not satisfied with the ministry of the word, but on the other hand, we receive grace and are supplied. We have weaknesses and desolation, but we also have the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. We must leave our spiritual longings and learn to experience God in our desolate situations so that we may have genuine growth in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING THE REVELATION<br />
OF CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We should not have unrealistic spiritual longings, but we should live and serve with a vision. Our vision is the central line of the Bible&mdash;Christ and the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ and the Church<br />
Being the Central Line of the Bible</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Revelation of Christ and the Church<br />
in Revelation</h2>
<p>At the beginning of Revelation there are seven golden lampstands, which refer to seven churches in different localities (1:20, 11). In chapter 12 there is a universal woman &ldquo;clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars&rdquo; (v. 1). This woman refers mainly to the church. In contrast to this woman, in chapter 17 there is a great harlot, Babylon the Great (vv. 1-6). The harlot is produced by the union of religion and the world. The ultimate expression of the church, the New Jerusalem, is at the end of Revelation (21:2). The church reveals Christ. In the beginning of Revelation the Son of Man, Christ, is walking in the midst of the seven golden lampstands (2:1). At the end of Revelation the Lamb, Christ, is the center of the New Jerusalem (21:22-24). This shows that Christ is the center and the Executor of everything in Revelation. Hence, Revelation presents Christ and the church. For a clearer revelation of Christ and the church we must look at the rest of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Church Being the New Man<br />
Created by God in the Image of Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:32 says that Christ and the church are a great mystery. The central line and the key to the revelation of the Bible are Christ and the church. Genesis 1:26 and 27 say that God made man in His image and according to His likeness. These verses imply Christ and the church. God made man in His image. Colossians 1:15 says that the Son &ldquo;is the image of the invisible God.&rdquo; Since the Son, Christ, is the image of God, when God made man in His image, He made man in the image of Christ. Christ was the model, the image, according to which God made man.</p>
<p>In Ephesians the man created by God is no longer Adam of the old creation but the new man of the new creation. God&rsquo;s work in creating man did not stop with the old creation because God&rsquo;s work was not completed in the old creation. God continues to work in man in order to produce the new creation out of the old creation. When the new creation is produced, God&rsquo;s work in man will be completed.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:10 says that the believers are God&rsquo;s masterpiece. Verse 15 says that the believers are the new man. Verse 24 of chapter 4 says that the new man was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality. This word corresponds to Genesis 1:26, which says that God made man in His image. When we compare Genesis 1:26 with Ephesians 2:15 and 4:24, we see that the man created in Genesis ultimately refers to the church. The creation of man points to God&rsquo;s central desire, which is for Christ to be the model for producing the church.</p>
<p>Although there are many believers, God&rsquo;s work is not completed. The first step of God&rsquo;s work is finished; that is, the work of creating the old creation has been completed. However, the second step of God&rsquo;s work is not yet complete, because most believers have not allowed God to complete His work and produce the new creation. They have allowed God to begin His work of the new creation, but this work is still not complete. God is doing a work of further creation. This work is not the creation of the first man in the old creation but that of the second man in the new creation. The new creation is in the image of Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">The Revelation of Christ and the Church<br />
in the Epistles</h2>
<p>Many verses in the New Testament refer to God&rsquo;s work of new creation. Romans 8:28-29 says, &ldquo;We know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose. Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers.&rdquo; God causes all things to work together so that we may be conformed to the image of His Son.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:10-11 says that the believers &ldquo;have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there cannot be Greek and Jew...but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; The new man is created in God&rsquo;s image. In the new man there is no room for the old creation, for Christ is everything. God desires to work Christ into the believers so that they will have the image of Christ. The new man is the church.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we &ldquo;are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; Transformation in this verse is not mainly for individuals but for the church, the corporate new man. Every saint is being transformed, and this transformation is corporate. Philippians 3:21 says that the Lord Jesus Christ &ldquo;will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself.&rdquo; First John 3:2 says that when the Lord &ldquo;is manifested, we will be like Him.&rdquo; When Christ returns, we will be like Him.</p>
<p>According to the above verses, Christ and the church are the central thought behind God&rsquo;s creation of man in His image. Christ is the model, and the church is a corporate man, a new man, created by God according to Christ and in Christ. This new man, which is not of the old creation but of the new creation, is the church, the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>In the beginning of Revelation God has the appearance of a jasper stone (4:3). At the end of Revelation the New Jerusalem has the glory of God; her light is like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal (21:11). The New Jerusalem, the ultimate expression of the church, is like a jasper stone, which is the appearance of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Clear Vision of Christ and the Church</h2>
<p>The center and goal of God&rsquo;s work in the universe is to create a new man in Christ, according to Christ, and with Christ as the model. This new man is not man in the old creation but the man in the new creation. The new creation is the church of Christ, and the church is the central meaning of God&rsquo;s creation of man in His own image. God created man in His image, that is, in the image of Christ, for the new creation, not the old creation. God desires that we put off the old man of the old creation and be transformed into the new man of the new creation. This new man is not an individual but a corporate man. This corporate man is the church, the counterpart of Christ. This corporate man is also a city, the dwelling place of God, the habitation of God. This is what God intends to accomplish in us.</p>
<p>Genesis 1 speaks of man being created in the image of God. Chapter 2 speaks of the need for man to let God come into him to be his life. Hence, chapter 2 shows the tree of life (v. 9), which indicates that God must be received as food into man to be man&rsquo;s life so that man can become God&rsquo;s counterpart, the church. Chapter 1 presents God&rsquo;s purpose and His image, but chapter 2 presents life. At the end of chapter 2 there is a couple (vv. 18-25). This picture points to Christ with the church. This is the vision of the entire Bible.</p>
<p>The rest of the Old Testament presents the relationships between husband and wife, between the priests and the tabernacle, between the kings and the people, and between the prophets and the people. These relationships point to Christ and the church. In the beginning of the New Testament God was conceived in the womb of a virgin and born of her through the Holy Spirit. People called this child Emmanuel, which means &ldquo;God with us&rdquo; (Matt. 1:23). Later, chapter 16 says that this Emmanuel-God will build His church on the rock, which is the revelation concerning Himself (v. 18). Christ and the church are a great vision in the Bible. I hope that we will spend time to study this item of the truth in the Bible and that we would have a clear and thorough view and understanding of this vision&mdash;Christ and the church. Then we will drop our spiritual longings and live and serve according to the central revelation of the Bible.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SUFFICIENCY<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S SERVING ONES<br />
BEING IN THE BODY</h1>
<p>According to His plan, God wants to work Himself into us so that we can become a corporate vessel&mdash;the church, the Body of Christ. We have heard many messages concerning God&rsquo;s plan, but we still need to see His plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD DESIRING TO WORK HIMSELF<br />
INTO A CORPORATE VESSEL</h2>
<p>Throughout the ages God has had one desire, which is to work Himself into us. We have given many messages concerning God&rsquo;s desire, but to hear a message is one thing and to touch the reality of the message is still another thing. Only when we touch the reality will we realize the importance of this desire.</p>
<p>God wants to work Himself into us in order to make us a corporate vessel to be the church, the Body of Christ. The infinite and mighty God desires to do one thing in the universe: He desires to work Himself into us so that we would be a universal vessel. Only then can God&rsquo;s plan in creation and redemption be accomplished.</p>
<p>The Bible shows that God is doing only one thing in the universe: He is working Himself into man. Healing the sick, casting out demons, and performing miracles are not His ultimate purpose. Even creating the heavens and the earth was not His ultimate purpose. These things are merely a part of His great work. God has only one desire in the universe, which is to work Himself into a great corporate vessel so that He can be expressed through this vessel.</p>
<p>Every problem in the universe, including darkness and death, will be resolved through God&rsquo;s working Himself into this vessel. Even the problem of God&rsquo;s enemy with the authority of darkness will be resolved. When God&rsquo;s work is accomplished, light will come, life will swallow up death, and Satan and his angels will all be cast into the lake of fire. Thus, every problem in the universe will be solved. At the same time, every positive thing, that is, everything concerning the divine life, will be accomplished. We often feel weak, dry, incompetent, and incapable, but we have no way to solve these problems. The more God mingles Himself with us to be our life, thereby making us a corporate vessel, the more these problems are resolved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING OUR INSUFFICIENCY</h2>
<p>I have been a Christian for many years, but it seems that the more I pursued, the less I was satisfied. I always felt that my living was not up to the standard of a Christian. Neither was I satisfied with the condition of the church. There were times when I had a sense of accomplishment and thought that I had ground to boast. I now realize that when I felt satisfied, the Lord had loosened His hold on me.</p>
<p>When God holds us tightly in His hand, we are desperate. Our being desperate proves that God is holding us. The tighter He holds us, the more desperate we feel. When God loosens His hold, we feel that we have seen something, experienced something, or gained something. Only then do we feel that the work is in our hand and that there are reasonable results. Without God&rsquo;s measure we cannot see our true situation. When God loosens His hold on us, we fall down. However, He has mercy on us and holds us tightly.</p>
<p>The tighter God holds a brother, the more he will feel that he is incapable and dry. When he is dry, he cannot condemn the other saints. For example, suppose a brother criticizes the brothers who give the messages and says that they are incapable. God will let the brother see that even if the other brothers are incapable, his condition is even poorer. Such an experience shows that God is holding him.</p>
<p>Only those who are held tightly and led by the Lord realize that what they are and what they achieve are not of themselves but of God. We cannot do anything nor can we be something in ourselves. Everything is of God. God does not want us to have hope in ourselves. Hence, we sense that the world is dark. God does not want us to be in darkness or to feel dry or weak. All our strength and our abilities are of Him, not of ourselves.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING OUR SUFFICIENCY</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:5-6 says, &ldquo;Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God, who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.&rdquo; The sufficiency, the competency, of the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones is from God. God Himself is our sufficiency. In these verses the apostle Paul seemed to be saying, &ldquo;We are ministers of a new covenant because of God, not because of ourselves. I am not sufficient to be a minister of the new covenant, and I will never be sufficient. My sufficiency is God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul also said, &ldquo;I became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God which was given to me according to the operation of His power&rdquo; (Eph. 3:7). The operating power here refers to God. I have been observing and considering our condition for many years. God has revealed His heart&rsquo;s desire to us. He wants to enter into us to be our sufficiency, that is, to be our life, our power, our light, and our everything. This sufficiency enables us to be ministers of the new covenant. When we are mingled with God, we become sufficient. Without God we lack sufficiency; we are insufficient.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:7 the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.&rdquo; This shows that chapters 3 and 4 of 2 Corinthians are related. God desires to enter into us in order to be our sufficiency, that is, to be our life, our power, and our light. We want to be enlightened and strengthened, that is, to be sufficient, for the work. God, however, comes in to tear down our &ldquo;sufficiency.&rdquo; We want to be enlightened and strong, but when He comes, we are in darkness, and our strength is broken. We want to move, but He does not allow us to move. God wants to train us and guide us so that we realize that our sufficiency does not lie in ourselves but in Him. God is our brightness, our strength, and our move.</p>
<p>The day a believer sees that God is his sufficiency, he will experience Peniel. Peniel is where Jacob was enlightened by God to see that he was no longer Jacob; he was Israel (Gen. 32:22-32). At Peniel a believer no longer hopes to be enlightened, strong, or sufficient. Instead, he sees that God is everything, and that God is in him. After experiencing Peniel, he will limp before God, just as Jacob limped. He will no longer harbor any hope for himself, and he will not bemoan his condition. On one hand, a believer should not be content with his condition. On the other hand, when he sees the vision of God as his sufficiency, he will be delivered from looking at himself. He will know that his poor condition belongs to Ai (12:8), the heap of ruins.</p>
<p>There is a person who is life and light and who is in us as our sufficiency. We are earthen vessels, but He is the treasure. When we see this, we will understand God&rsquo;s purpose in working Himself into us. Instead of being concerned about our own condition, we will learn to rely on the Body, to depend on the church, and to serve God. Whether or not we are strong does not matter. What matters is whether or not the Body is strong. It is not a matter of our being enlightened but of the Body being enlightened. Whether or not we are weak, the Body is not weak.</p>
<p>May God open our mind to gradually understand that we are not sufficient but that He is. He is in us to be our life, light, and power. He is our sufficiency. May we also understand that having light and being sufficient are not individual matters. They belong to the Body. Hence, some saints testify that when they fellowship with other saints, they receive the supply. We must see that the Lord is our life, and we must see that He is in the Body. We must not only see that the Lord desires to mingle with us but also that this mingling is to produce the Body. Any desire to have the mingling apart from the Body cannot succeed, because the mingling is for the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GAINING GOD IN THE BODY</h2>
<p>The entire Bible speaks of only one thing: God desires to work Himself into His redeemed people to produce a unique corporate vessel. It is not enough to see the first part of God&rsquo;s desire. We must also see the second part of His desire. From our experience we know that our effort is of no avail. Furthermore, we do not gain anything when we pursue God for ourselves. In order to gain God, we must be in the Body. What we gain in our pursuit of the Lord is to supply the other members. In this way we are joined to the Body. If what we gain is not given to the Body, it will be annulled. What we have gained is multiplied and enriched only in the Body.</p>
<p>We must learn to continually deny the self and to see that the Lord is everything to us. He is life, light, and power; He is our sufficiency. In Him every problem is solved. We must also see that all God&rsquo;s riches are for the Body. The more we are in the Body, the more we touch and gain His riches. When we deny the self and focus on God, our problems are resolved. The more we enter into God, the more our problems are resolved. Furthermore, we should have more contact with the saints. We should fellowship with the saints concerning our service and the work. We should not do anything as an individual or have confidence in ourselves. Our confidence should be in the all-sufficient God. God is our sufficiency in the Body. When we rely on God and on the brothers and sisters, we will see Christ in the church. The dominion spoken of in Genesis 1:28 belongs to the church.</p>
<p>We must see these two points. God desires to work Himself into us, and God is everything to us in the church, the Body. An individual member cannot enjoy all God&rsquo;s riches. When we keep the riches in ourselves, for our personal enjoyment, we become detached members. At the end of the Gospels the Lord appeared to Mary and to Peter, that is, to individual believers. But His purpose in appearing to Mary and to Peter was to enlighten them concerning His corporate Body (John 20:16-18; 21:15-17). The Lord&rsquo;s appearing is for the saints. If we keep His appearing for ourselves and do not share it with all the saints, His appearing will become blurred. Every spiritual gain is for the Body. When we hold back what we have gained, we will lose its value before God. However, if we bring what we have gained to the Body, what we have gained will be enriched.</p>
<p>Hence, we should not live in self-pity. We simply need to admit that we cannot rise up to the standard nor can we be strong by our own efforts. We should not pretend to be strong or tell others that we are doing well in the Lord. If we are willing to tell the saints with whom we coordinate that we are incapable, we will become living. Instead of giving the saints a word of exhortation, we should learn to commit ourselves to the Lord and place ourselves in the Body by relying on the Body. Then we will receive the supply.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">ALLOWING GOD TO WORK IN US<br />
AND WORKING ACCORDING TO<br />
THE SPIRITUAL NEED</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES</h2>
<p>After a period of time many believers begin to doubt their salvation and look for proof and assurance of their salvation. Brother Nee once said that the fact a person doubts his salvation is proof that he is saved. A person who has never doubted his salvation has not been saved. This means that we should neither doubt the condition of our salvation or the fact of our salvation.</p>
<p>Whenever we speak of our own salvation, we do not necessarily feel that it is something tremendous. All our spiritual experiences have ups and downs. After experiencing salvation, a believer is joyful and buoyant, but after a period of time he begins to doubt his salvation and is no longer joyful. Our experiences concerning knowing ourselves, consecration, the cross, and following the Lord are similar to the experiences of a new believer. Every believer goes through a period of time when his spiritual condition is up, a time when he is willing to serve God, to take the cross, and to pray. Then after a point in time his spiritual condition goes down. Actually, his condition may not be going down, but he feels that he has not learned a particular lesson or that he is not acceptable in a particular matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING MANY FEELINGS<br />
INDICATING THAT WE LIVE IN OURSELVES</h2>
<p>When we feel that we have genuinely consecrated ourselves or paid a price, our feelings may not be accurate. Similarly, when we feel that there is a problem with our consecration or that we have not paid a price, these feelings may not be accurate either. Our feelings do not necessarily correspond with our condition. When we feel that we are paying a great price, it may not be so. The same applies to when we feel that we have not paid a price. We may consider ourselves to be humble, but actually we may be very proud. We may consider ourselves to be proud, but actually we may be very humble. Many times our condition is the opposite of our feelings and considerations.</p>
<p>Sometimes a believer feels that his spiritual condition is good, but his condition before the Lord is not so good. Sometimes he may feel that he cannot touch the Lord or that he does not love the Lord, but this may be the time when his relationship with the Lord is the sweetest. Our considerations are not reliable, and our spiritual condition is not according to our consideration.</p>
<p>Experiencing spiritual ups and downs shows that we are in the self. When we feel that we are doing well in reading the Bible, we are in the self. When we are not in the self, we often have no sense concerning our reading of the Bible, and when we are not in the self, we often have no feeling concerning our humility.</p>
<p>When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, he did not know that his face was shining. It was the other Israelites who saw that his face was shining (Exo. 34:29-30). Hence, we must realize that the feelings we have related to our consecration, our paying a price, our touching a certain spiritual reality, our knowing the church, our receiving of spiritual light, our understanding of the Bible, and our touching of the Lord in prayer all come from the self. After a period of time, these feelings change. This proves that these feelings come from the self. Whether our feelings are positive or negative, they are from the self. When we are not in the self, we have no feeling concerning reading the Bible or learning a spiritual lesson. On the one hand, not having a feeling about a particular matter or thing is often an indication that we are not in the self. On the other hand, certain feelings or analysis related to our spiritual condition is often an indication that we are in the self.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING THE LESSON OF BEING BROKEN<br />
IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS</h2>
<p>In His wisdom God put us in communities and groups; otherwise, every person would think that he is the best person in the world. Every person thinks that he is the only person in the universe. Without a community, our pride would not be exposed, there would not be anxiety in our environment, and we would not be provoked to lose our temper. If we did not live in a community, what is in us would not be exposed.</p>
<p>God is wise in what He does. Before we were saved, He placed us in communities. After we are saved, He keeps us in communities and uses various human relationships to expose our inner condition. For example, a sister may feel that she is perfect, but after she has three children, she might feel that she is not doing so well. She may wonder why the Lord did not place her in an environment where she can use her gift to stir others up to love Him. The Lord will never allow us to escape from human relationships. God intentionally put us in relationships so that through them our condition would be manifested, and we would learn the lessons of being broken.</p>
<p>No one can learn the lessons of being broken apart from having relationships with others. How can a saint who does not have relatives, lives alone, and does not have a service with other saints learn the lessons of being broken? If we do not learn to be broken in our relationships, our true condition will not be manifested.</p>
<p>The lessons of being broken are learned when we are with others. Whenever we encounter a new human relationship, there is the need for us to be broken further. The addition of another human relationship in our lives will increase the demand for us to be broken. When a person is not married, there is not much of a requirement for him to be broken. Once he is married, there is the need to be broken. After he has his first child, there is the need for further breaking. The more children he has, the more breaking he will experience. If a young brother does not live with other brothers, he will not experience much of a demand to be broken. If he lives with other brothers, he will experience some breaking. A brother who does not bear responsibility will have fewer experiences of being broken. Once he becomes a responsible brother, he will have more experiences of being broken. The more human relationships we have, the more demands there are for us to be broken. Single brothers who love the Lord, fellowship with Him, read the Bible, and pray regularly but are not elders or deacons and do not coordinate with other saints will not be broken.</p>
<p>However, the Lord is wise in His arrangement. He has arranged many human relationships for us from which we cannot escape. If you are not married and do not have relatives, He will give you other members in the Body so that you can serve and bear responsibility together with them. Through such human relationships, we experience being broken, and our spiritual condition is exposed.</p><h2 class="head1">LETTING GOD FIRST WORK ON US</h2>
<p>Through our various human relationships, our condition is exposed. God places us in these human relationships for no reason other than to break us. He is not interested in what we have done for Him. He cares about what He can do in us. Believers who do not allow God to work on them cannot do much for God. God first wants to work Himself in the Son through the Spirit into us. Whether or not we are willing to pay a price in our service and whether or not our consecration is genuine are small matters to Him. However, whether or not He can work Himself into us is of great importance.</p>
<p>God cannot work Himself into us if we are not broken. Very few Christians, including missionaries, have let God work on them. Hence, even though Christians are engaged in numerous activities, God is not fully expressed in them.</p>
<p>What kind of work are we doing with the young people? Are we supplying them with His pure life? Whether we can supply the young people with His pure life depends on whether we have been broken and purified by the Lord. The effectiveness of our work does not depend on persuasive messages, which can be sounding brass and a clanging cymbal. The effectiveness of our work depends on the work that God has done in us.</p>
<p>Our present need is not to deliver messages but to give our testimony. The young believers need to know what kind of person we are. They need to know our experiences of being broken. Such testimonies are more effective than messages. We can shepherd others only to the extent that we have been worked on by God. If we have not been worked on by God in a certain matter, we will not be able to shepherd others in that matter, even if we can speak eloquently.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s word and the law in the universe are definite: what we sow is what we will reap (Gal. 6:7). The seed that is sown will produce the same crop. Every serving one is like a seed. Hence, it does not matter what we say or what we do. We will bear fruit according to the kind of seed that we are. This is unavoidable. It is possible to train someone to surpass you in a skill because life is not involved. However, this is not possible when life is involved. In order to bring forth a chicken, there must be a hen. Sheep bring forth sheep. We cannot expect sheep to give birth to cows. A monkey can learn to eat with a fork and a knife, because that is a matter of learning an outward behavior. However, a monkey cannot give birth to a human being, because that is a matter of life. It is possible for an average teacher to produce an excellent student, because that is a matter of knowledge. However, this would not be possible in relation to the divine life. The effectiveness of our work cannot surpass what we are. A believer who has not been worked on by God will not be successful in the work. A person who is useful in God&rsquo;s hand faces many difficulties because God is working in him. Certain matters will be problems to him but not problems to others.</p>
<p>When we are in ourselves, we are often full of feelings. For example, we become elated and proud when we think that we are doing well spiritually. After a period of time, however, we become dejected and feel that we are not doing so well. These situations show that we are in ourselves. Therefore, God deals with us in order to break us and deliver us from the self. His work will bring us to the point that, whether we are touched by a certain matter or under the pressure of a problem, our feelings would not fluctuate. This indicates that we have been saved from the self.</p>
<p>The more God works on us to break us, the more we are delivered from the self and our feelings. We will not be focused on whether we are proud, happy, or sorrowful. We will have no ground to boast or to be discouraged, because we have been delivered from the self. This process takes place when God touches us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO ASPECTS OF SPIRITUAL PURSUIT</h2>
<p>There must be some spiritual pursuit in the church service. If our service consists merely of making arrangements concerning church affairs without spiritual pursuit, our service will fall into formality and will become empty and dead. If we want our service to be living and practical with a plan and a goal, we must have spiritual pursuit.</p>
<p>Spiritual pursuit can be carried out according to our situation. There are two aspects to our spiritual pursuit. One aspect is that the serving ones must learn spiritual lessons. It is not sufficient to be saved. We must receive the dealing of the cross in order to be broken, we must know how to fellowship and coordinate with others in the Holy Spirit, and we must be properly built up with others. The more we learn, the more spiritual insight we will have. This will enable us to see what God wants to obtain today. Then we can shepherd the saints. Without such learning, we have no way to shepherd the saints into a deeper pursuit.</p>
<p>The second aspect of spiritual pursuit concerns taking care of the spiritual condition of those who are under our care. For example, if a brother goes to a certain place and notices that there are not many new believers or that the new believers are not established, he will need to supply the saints by leading them to know the assurance of salvation. If he notices that some of the saints are assured of their salvation but have not consecrated themselves, he will need to lead them into consecration. If some saints have consecrated themselves to the Lord but have not yet learned to fellowship with the Lord, he will need to lead them into fellowshipping with the Lord.</p>
<p>Spiritual pursuit is based on what the serving ones learn concerning the spiritual condition of the saints. A teacher should first receive adequate education. If he has only an elementary education, his endeavors to teach high-school students will not amount to much, because he does not have a high-school or college education. A person must have received an adequate amount of education in order for him to teach others. Furthermore, he must observe the need of his students. On the one hand, he must receive a substantially high education, and on the other hand, he must observe the need of his students. Then he will be a good teacher.</p>
<p>The co-workers who serve in a local church must observe the spiritual condition of the saints. They need to understand where the saints are in order to lead the saints in their spiritual pursuit. Through fellowship the co-workers should determine which brothers should minister the word to meet the spiritual need of the saints. Suppose the saints have not learned how to be filled by the Holy Spirit or how to give the Holy Spirit the ground in them. The co-workers should fellowship concerning this matter during their service meeting. Some brothers will receive the burden to speak a word to enlighten the saints and open their understanding. On the one hand, many messages can be given concerning being filled with the Holy Spirit or concerning allowing the Holy Spirit to have the ground in us. On the other hand, the co-workers should also focus on this matter when they fellowship with the elders and the responsible ones. In this way, a spiritual atmosphere will be raised up among the saints, and they will be brought into being filled with the Holy Spirit and giving Him the ground.</p>
<p>The full-time serving ones must bear the burden of taking the lead. They should have a spiritual pursuit, and they should also pray, even fast and pray, concerning the saints. Perhaps giving a message should not be the first step in leading the saints. Perhaps the first step should be to gather the saints into smaller groups, not for an official meeting but to fellowship in order to determine where the saints are and what their spiritual needs are. Then the co-workers should fellowship and pray concerning how to infuse the saints with a particular burden. This is the way to lead the saints step by step in their spiritual pursuit.</p>
<p>If the churches lack an atmosphere of spiritual pursuit, our service will lose its content and goal, and we will not make progress. For example, suppose today Brother A has a burden and gives a message according to that burden, and tomorrow Brother B has a different burden and gives a message according to his burden. Even if the messages are good, the saints may not get the help. If there is no leading in our service and meetings, that is, if there is no trumpeting of the same tune, the saints will not be able to follow, and their spiritual condition will not improve.</p>
<p>In terms of educational development, a student continues to junior high school after finishing elementary school. The subjects he learns in junior high school are at a junior-high level. Hence, there is a goal and a schedule in his education. After graduating from junior high school, he proceeds to high school and studies there for three years in order to graduate. After being educated in this way, a young person will have made substantial progress. He will not only know how to read and write but also have a certain amount of advanced knowledge.</p>
<p>It makes a big difference whether or not a co-worker knows how to serve. A co-worker can stay in the same place for three years and not have results. Such a situation can be compared to a student who studies many subjects but does not progress. The co-workers must come together and fellowship concerning the spiritual condition of the saints, the need of the saints, and how to lead the saints. Then the brothers who minister the word will have the same burden. In this way, the messages will have a goal and will stir up the saints to pursue the Lord.</p>
<p>After three months the saints will have received much benefit, and the co-workers can consider the content for the next stage of spiritual pursuit. This should be the practice in every church, and every responsible one should practice this. This is similar to the educational system. Then every year we will perfect many young people.</p>
<p>I hope that the co-workers will learn how to work. They should study the situation in every locality and find out how many saints attend at least one meeting and how many attend the meetings regularly. Based on the various conditions of the saints, the co-workers can properly shepherd, teach, perfect, and build up the saints. This is a great work. The saints have been placed in our hands, and we are accountable for them. We should not be overjoyed when we are enlightened, nor should we be discouraged and consider ourselves incapable. We must realize that being overjoyed, discouraged, proud, or humble are of no avail. We must receive mercy and be delivered from our feelings. We must receive a burden before the Lord to bear the responsibility for the spiritual growth of the saints. We should know their spiritual needs and shepherd them into caring for their spiritual growth. Eventually, every church will be filled with an atmosphere of spiritual pursuit. This is the proper way to work.</p>
<p>Without adequate fellowship, the co-workers should not expect to be able to work for the Lord. The co-workers must have much fellowship in order to determine the needs of the saints. Fellowship does not mean that the co-workers agree that this week there is a message concerning love, next week a message concerning faith, and the following week a message concerning hope or endurance. Such messages would not be fruitful; they would not educate the saints. From the viewpoint of education, this is misleading. The co-workers must observe the spiritual condition of the saints in order to understand what the saints truly need. Then the brothers responsible for ministering the word can receive a burden, and the brothers responsible for visitation should pick up the same burden. Everything the co-workers say should follow the same burden. In this way, the churches will be filled with a spiritual atmosphere. When we work in this way, we will see that the Spirit will follow us and bless our labor. Many people will be saved and will consecrate themselves to take this way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR WORK BEING TO OBSERVE<br />
THE SPIRITUAL NEED</h2>
<p>Many Christian workers labor and give messages, yet after many years those whom they gain are not clearly saved. This is an indication that those workers do not know how to work. We cannot follow that way. If we notice that the saints are not clear concerning salvation, we should give messages concerning the truth of salvation in order to lead the saints to know that they are saved. Not only so, we should lead the saints into consecration as well as into having some dealings. When the saints enter into one matter, we can then help them to go further. This is the way we should work so that our labor is not in vain. Pride and humility are of no avail. We must bear the spiritual burden of the saints according to their actual condition. Hence, we must constantly study their spiritual condition so that they can advance. Then we will touch God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, and our work will be valuable.</p>
<p>When the apostle Paul was in Ephesus, he met a number of disciples and immediately asked them if they had received the Holy Spirit. They replied that they did not even hear whether there was a Holy Spirit. After learning that they had received John&rsquo;s baptism, Paul explained to them their need to believe into the One who came after John, that is, into Jesus. Then Paul baptized them and laid his hands on them so that they might receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit (Acts 19:1-7). Paul did not give a message according to his burden; rather, he served according to the need of the people he met. We must learn to know the need of the people we are with so that our leading is practical. I hope that the co-workers will pay attention to this matter and learn how to work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO ASPECTS OF OUR WORK</h2>
<p>There are two aspects to knowing how to work: letting God work in us and studying the techniques of working. To let God work in us means that we allow God to deal with what is natural and to lead us and teach us various lessons. We should also spend time to study and improve our techniques and to understand the needs of people in general as well as the needs of the saints. We can shepherd the saints and the people around us based on their actual need. Then our service will have a spiritual flavor and will be in life. Furthermore, our service will have a goal and will be living and practical. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may pay full attention to these matters. Otherwise, we may serve the saints, but they will not receive any benefit. This would be a great loss.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE OVERCOMING AND THE PURSUING<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S SERVING ONES</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning several matters related to the co-workers. God&rsquo;s work in us cannot go beyond our limitations. Both the Old Testament and the New Testament show that God encounters limitations and difficulties in every person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO SITUATIONS<br />
HINDERING OUR SPIRITUAL PURSUIT</h2>
<p>There are two situations that cause us to limit God. In the first situation, the serving ones have the feeling that they cannot find the Lord and that they do not see results in their service. In other words, it seems that others are enlightened and know how to work, but they do not receive light, and their work does not have results. Thus, they become discouraged. Many years ago this situation was not common among us, but it has become rather obvious in recent years. In the second situation, the serving ones know how to read the Bible. The Bible is open to them, and they always receive light. However, they often become puffed up and proud when they receive revelation and light from God.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to other spiritual matters. When some saints seek a spiritual experience, they gain it and immediately testify concerning the revelation they received or their experience. Other saints, however, do not have such experiences, no matter how much they pursue. It seems as though these saints do not know how to pursue or how to work. Hence, there are two groups of serving ones. This can be compared to people who study or play sports. Some people seem to have no problem understanding a subject or playing well, while others struggle.</p>
<p>Some co-workers do not have a sense of accomplishment in the gospel, in ministering the word, or in visiting the saints. The more they look at themselves, the more it seems as if they have no progress in their spiritual pursuit or in the work. Hence, they are utterly discouraged. They want to continue serving, but they feel incompetent. It is not easy for them to withdraw, because they have paid a price to serve the Lord. Consequently, these ones feel miserable. This is one situation.</p>
<p>In another situation the co-workers gain what they seek in the Lord and in the work. The way is open to them, and it is easy for them to get results. The former group of co-workers tends to be discouraged, but the latter group tends to be arrogant. Both conditions are inevitable. We cannot say that one group is deep and that the other group is shallow. In truth, both kinds of co-workers are in the self.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SELF-ABASEMENT AND PRIDE</h2>
<p>Some co-workers are disheartened and discouraged because they think that they do not know how to pursue the Lord, they do not know how to work, their gifts are not manifested, and they do not see results. These co-workers are ashamed, embarrassed, and discouraged when they see other co-workers who flourish in the work. Such feelings of embarrassment show that they are in themselves. As a result, they have an inferiority complex and think that they are hopeless. It is right not to regard oneself as being capable, but it is not right to be self-abasing. A person who is self-abasing loses his courage, is not able to contact others, and cannot pray. A person who has an inferiority complex is buried in himself.</p>
<p>In the other situation a co-worker can be haughty. This is an expression of pride. When a serving one becomes filled with pride, he becomes shallow. Those with an inferiority complex seemingly sink to the bottom of the sea, but those who are proud seemingly float like a thin sheet of paper in the air.</p>
<p>A serving one who is overcome with a sense of inferiority harms only himself, not others. When he realizes that he is incapable in the work and that he cannot pray, read the Bible, or give messages, he is unwilling to preach the gospel, to visit the saints, or to speak for the Lord. Such a person is buried in his self-abasement. But this problem is limited to himself. However, a serving one who is proud does not receive the restriction of the Lord. This is a greater problem. Such a serving one can affect others because he thinks that he has something. This is the other side of the self.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BOTH SELF-ABASEMENT AND PRIDE<br />
STOPPING SPIRITUAL PURSUIT</h2>
<p>Since not many serving ones are growing in life, can render a supply, or are effective in the work, our work and service have become stagnant. Some of our co-workers are trapped in self-abasement. Other co-workers, who are blinded by a shallow view of themselves, think that they are capable, but they have very little result due to their shallowness.</p>
<p>A person who is narrow and shallow is proud. It is easy for a narrow person to be proud, and it is easy for a shallow person to be proud. Actually, being narrow is the same as being shallow. A brother who is broad is like a large cup with a great capacity. Regardless of how many things he does, he does not feel full or proud. However, a narrow brother is like a small cup that is filled with water. If one drop of water is added to the cup, it will overflow. A person who is a large vessel with a large capacity receives more grace, but he never feels that he is someone special. In contrast, a person who is a small vessel with a small capacity is easily filled with a little grace, and he feels that he is something special. This is an indication of his smallness, and this smallness is related to his shallowness. A deep person has a large capacity, but a shallow person has a small capacity.</p>
<p>A proud person feels self-contented and satisfied and is shallow and small. Being shallow is the same as being small. Some who are shallow become proud very easily. Others may not become proud, but it is easy for them to feel self-contented. A person who becomes proud or self-contented is not effective in the work, and because he is shallow and superficial, he is unable to do a weighty and deep work. Only a person who has passed through frustrations, sufferings, and termination and who is broken can do a weighty and deep work. Such a person does not have much feeling of self-satisfaction or self-sufficiency. He continually presses forward and works steadfastly. Such a person is not a problem to the work and is effective.</p>
<p>Both self-abasement and pride stop our spiritual pursuit. Those who have an inferiority complex will not pursue the Lord, nor will those who are shallow and self-contented. It is difficult for those with an inferiority complex and for those who are shallow and self-contented to learn anything. Our spiritual pursuit is affected by self-abasement. Furthermore, we should not be proud, because pride prevents us from pursuing. Those who are proud are full. Since it is easy for them to obtain spiritual matters, they do not pursue aggressively. Both self-abasement and pride distract us and stop our genuine spiritual pursuit.</p><h2 class="head1">LACKING SPIRITUAL PURSUIT</h2>
<p>Although we serve regularly and coordinate, we have only an outward form. Our personal spiritual life might also be merely an outward form. Our experiences of fellowshipping with the Lord and touching Him through pray-reading and prayer can become an outward form. This outward form is an empty shell because we have lost our living pursuit of the Lord. The Bible shows that we cannot stop pursuing the Lord, because the Lord is inexhaustible (Deut. 8:7-9; Eph. 3:8). His riches are boundless and unlimited, and His breadth, length, height, and depth, like the dimensions of the universe, are unsearchable (v. 18).</p>
<p>When the apostle Paul was in prison, he said, &ldquo;Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue&rdquo; (Phil. 3:12). In verse 13 he said, &ldquo;I do not account of myself to have laid hold; but one thing I do: Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before.&rdquo; His fresh and unlimited spiritual pursuit caused him to forsake all that he had gained in the past, all that was old, so that he could gain Christ to the fullest extent. Paul not only forsook his past experiences in Judaism; he also did not linger in his past experiences of Christ. As one who ran the race, Paul knew only to run forward. He did not look back.</p>
<p>Our problem is that we linger in what we gain, and we treasure our experiences. For example, a brother who gains some knowledge concerning the cross lingers in that knowledge. However, genuine spiritual experiences include leaving behind what we have gained. When we pass through something, we must put it aside. This is to run the race. If we do not run in this way, we will run in circles and will not advance. The apostle ran the race; he pursued by forgetting what was behind and stretching forward to what was before.</p>
<p>Some saints have seen and gained something, but their tone is different from that of the apostle Paul. Paul said, &ldquo;Not that I have already obtained,&rdquo; but some of the serving ones boldly claim to have gained something, as if they have reached the ultimate destination, and they do not have any more goals. In Ephesians Paul saw a very high vision, but after that, he still said, &ldquo;Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue.&rdquo; Even though Christ and the power of His resurrection are both familiar topics in our messages, we need to endeavor to pursue and to experience these boundless riches.</p>
<p>We must see the enemy&rsquo;s twofold scheme. On the one hand, he uses discouragement to destroy our appetite to pursue, and on the other hand, he uses self-conceit and self-contentment to stop us from being desperate. In the end, there is no genuine pursuing. The main symptom of our problem is that we lack an earnest pursuit because we are either self-abased or self-contented.</p>
<p>Song of Songs is a book in the Bible that focuses on pursuing. From the first chapter, Song of Songs speaks of pursuing. It says, &ldquo;Draw me; we will run after you&mdash; / The king has brought me into his chambers&mdash; / We will be glad and rejoice in you; / We will extol your love more than wine. / Rightly do they love you&rdquo; (1:4). In verse 7 the seeker cries out from the depths of her being, and says, &ldquo;Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock?&rdquo; Within the seeker there is a longing to pursue. Debates and research cannot help us to pursue. The elders need to lead the saints to have a living pursuit. We must genuinely pursue the Lord. Discouragement causes us to stop pursuing, and self-satisfaction also causes us to stop pursuing. Our urgent need is to pursue the Lord. If we do not pursue the Lord, we cannot give messages concerning pursuing the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A FRESH AND LIVING ENJOYMENT</h2>
<p>Undoubtedly, we need to know how to work; that is, we need the skills to work. Some saints work diligently, but there is no result. They can be compared to a hen that lays eggs that do not hatch. However, when a different co-worker joins them, there are results. This is a matter of knowing how to work. Caring for flowers and plants is an example. When Brother A cares for a plant, it withers and dies in a couple of months, but when Brother B cares for the same plant, it blooms and bears fruit. This is a matter of skill. In spiritual service, however, the primary matter is not skill but whether or not we are living. The key to being living lies in our enjoying the Lord, having fresh fellowship with Him, entering into His presence, and pursuing Him daily.</p>
<p>Some co-workers are eloquent when they preach the gospel, but not many people are touched. When Brother James M&rsquo;Kendrick, who wrote <em>Seen and Heard,</em> gave his first message, he could not utter one word, but he had a fervent heart to save sinners. He stood at the podium and could not stop his tears. This touched the audience. He did not know how to give a message, but he had a burden for the gospel. We should not rely on our gift. Gifts are superficial. Our gift should be developed from life, but many saints treat gifts as an outward matter. We should not overvalue a gift.</p>
<p>Those who have a genuine spiritual pursuit are beside themselves. On the morning of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection Mary went to the tomb to find the Lord. She was not as clear-headed as Peter and John. When Peter and John went to the tomb and saw that the tomb was empty, they became clear that Jesus had resurrected, and they went away to their own home. Mary, however, knew only to seek the Lord; she did not care for the empty tomb or the handkerchief. She knew that the Lord was not there, and she wanted to see the Lord (John 20:1-13). This seems to have been a foolish pursuit. Nevertheless, genuine pursuit is foolish. To have a genuine pursuit is to be desperate before the Lord to the extent that we care for nothing but meeting the Lord.</p>
<p>A brother who genuinely pursues the Lord might stand up in a meeting and say that the other saints are able to gain something when they pursue the Lord, but he does not seem to gain anything. This word is weighty. Or he may say that he has been pursuing the Lord but cannot touch Him and that he cannot give a good message, but he can testify of the Lord&rsquo;s love. Such a word brings in an atmosphere of spiritual pursuit and a sense of the Lord&rsquo;s love. I once heard a brother give a message in which he arrogantly told the congregation that they were not spiritual. When we speak concerning the spiritual condition of others, we should be desperate. It is not right to merely shake one&rsquo;s head and say, &ldquo;We are not doing well; we are not doing well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our speaking should bring the saints to tears so that they can touch the Lord. Do not think that declaring &ldquo;I have seen Christ!&rdquo; will cause the saints to touch Him. We should be able to lead the saints to touch the Lord even without mentioning Christ. If we see that our prayer is powerless, that we do not know how to lead the meetings, and that our spiritual pursuit seems futile, we will have a heavy burden when we speak concerning our condition. This is the way to lead the saints to touch Christ.</p>
<p>If we truly want others to touch the Lord, there is no need to shout that we have seen Christ. Similarly, declaring that we need to live in Christ will not cause others to live in Christ. It is not a matter of shouting slogans or making declarations. Even if a brother does not feel that he has seen much, if he has a heart to pursue and is not self-abased or proud, when he tells the saints that he still does not know our glorious Lord, the saints will meet Christ and touch something spiritual.</p>
<p>It is not necessarily our testimony that will touch others. Rather, our words will indicate that there is something within us. Our words will show that we have the desire to forget that which is behind and stretch forward to that which is ahead so that we may know Christ. This principle can be applied to all our service.</p><h2 class="head1">FALLING INTO FORMALITY</h2>
<p>In the past after a person responded to the gospel, we would speak to him concerning baptism, but there was a lack of spiritual pursuit. The brothers who would do the baptizing need to pursue the Lord concerning baptism. They should seek how to bring the new believers into the experience of dying together with the Lord. This requires the leading brothers and those responsible for baptizing to pray together and pursue the Lord. Then the brief word that they speak to the new ones before the baptisms will be weighty.</p>
<p>We have not had such a practice. Rather, we give the new ones a message in the baptismal meeting. For example, we read Romans 6:3-5: &ldquo;Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death...For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection.&rdquo; We speak to those who are being baptized concerning being baptized into the Lord&rsquo;s death, being buried, and being raised up together with the Lord. We also say that after they are buried in the water, they will come out of the water in resurrection. Then we baptize them one by one. This kind of ritual may be scriptural, but it lacks spiritual reality. The responsible brothers and those who baptize must have some reality. If they are in the reality, their service will bring the new ones into reality.</p>
<p>Although our services are established and are properly carried out, they lack something spiritual. I hope that the serving ones will receive a burden concerning our lack of spiritual pursuit. The services have become routine, and they lack spiritual reality; therefore there is neither vitality nor power. As co-workers, we must rise up to deal with this situation. We should not think that we are incapable of doing certain things, nor should we be self-abased and buried by an inferiority complex. We need to overcome in this matter. Even if we are incapable, we can still pursue the Lord. We need a fresh love and a genuine pursuit of the Lord. If we gain something in our spiritual pursuit, we should not become stagnant or stop. We must be those who are running the race, forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, because there is no limit in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PURSUING WITH SPIRITUAL COMPANIONS</h2>
<p>In addition to our personal pursuit we should pursue with our companions. We often fall into a situation that we cannot handle by ourselves. For this reason, we need spiritual companions. The situation that is emerging among us indicates that we are individualistic and do not have companions. Hence, we must look for companions to pursue with. Second Timothy 2:22 says, &ldquo;Pursue...with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&rdquo; This is the way that we must take. Very few co-workers are willing to pursue the Lord with two or three others. In other words, few co-workers have companions; most pursue on their own. We cannot escape the fact that we need companions. Two or three should come together a few times per week to pursue the Lord together. There is a need for a fresh atmosphere of spiritual pursuit among us.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy the co-workers need to have a fresh pursuing. No matter how many messages we have heard or how many lessons we have learned, we must realize that Christ and His Body are the way we are taking. Hence, we must rise up and pursue the Lord in a fresh way. This is the key. Everything we do depends on this. Perhaps some of us have a weak will or do not have a proper character. Whatever our problem may be, there is a remedy, which is to have a fresh, living, deep, and serious pursuit of the Lord. Not everyone&rsquo;s function has been manifested, but if we have companions, everyone will have a deep pursuit of the Lord.</p>
<p>Galatians 6:7 says, &ldquo;Whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.&rdquo; Second Corinthians 9:6 says, &ldquo;He who sows sparingly shall also sparingly reap; and he who sows with blessings shall also with blessings reap.&rdquo; This is a principle. The amount of effort we spend determines the benefit we reap. We should not think that the co-workers who are intelligent or who have a strong will have an advantage. What matters is the effort we put into pursuing the Lord. An intelligent brother who has a strong will should not think that he can be enlightened quickly. Even if he has an advantage, it is temporary, because haste makes waste. The faster we are able to enter into something, the faster we will withdraw from it. The fact that we have gained something should not stop us from going on. That is too shallow.</p>
<p>A musician once said that if he skipped one day of practice, only he would notice it. If he skipped two days of practice, his family would notice it. If he skipped three days of practice, his friends would notice it, and if he skipped one week of practice, he would not be able to perform. This shows that the extent of our influence on others depends on our pursuit of the Lord.</p>
<p>The serving ones who regard themselves as incapable do not need to feel inferior or discouraged. Such feelings are meaningless. We need to understand that we are unable and incapable, but there is one thing that we can do: we can pursue the Lord, be drawn by Him, and have a fresh love for Him. This is precious in the sight of God. If we do not have love, He can stir up our love. We can pray because we have a pursuing heart, not because we know the right words or have the right tone. This pursuing has no end and will always be fresh. This is what Paul says in Philippians 3:12 and 13: he forgot the things which were behind and stretched forward to the things which were ahead so that he could lay hold of the Lord. This can be compared to the words of the lover in Song of Songs 1:2 and 4: &ldquo;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!... / Draw me; we will run after you.&rdquo; Our service is not a matter of gift, knowledge, or ability. It is entirely a matter of our pursuit. If we are such persons, we will always be effective, no matter what the situation is. Then our service and work will not be merely a shell or an outward form. There will be reality, content, vitality, and power within our service. Moreover, our service and work will be fresh. This kind of pursuit needs to be raised up among us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE GROUND AND THE COORDINATION<br />
OF THE CHURCH<br />
AND<br />
THE LAW OF REVIVAL</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE GROUND AND THE COORDINATION<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the ground and coordination of the church and concerning the law of revival. The brothers who visited various places in Southeast Asia observed various problems mainly related to the ground of the church and the coordination in service. The young brothers and sisters who answer the Lord&rsquo;s call need to have a broad understanding concerning the situation of Christianity and concerning the Lord&rsquo;s purpose in raising us up. We would like to present a general sketch of the Lord&rsquo;s purpose. This matter determines whether or not we will take this way in the future.</p>
<p>The difficulties, attacks, and ordeals that we have suffered for the past thirty years in the East were related mainly to the matters of the ground of the church and coordination. It has been forty years since our senior co-worker, Watchman Nee, was raised up by the Lord. Shortly after he began his ministry, he received a vision from the Lord. He gave me this vision. In this regard, I am a person who has received the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. After my salvation, I was drawn by the Lord to love Him and pursue Him; I was willing to forsake everything for Him. However, before I began to fellowship with Brother Nee, I did not have a vision. I simply loved the Lord and felt His presence.</p>
<p>In 1933 I was drawn by the Lord to drop my job. I can testify that I was filled with the Spirit and was able to affect others, but I did not have a vision. Brother Nee gave me a strong confirmation concerning dropping my job. Hence, as soon as I left my job, I had the feeling that I must go to Shanghai and fellowship with Brother Nee.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeing That Christ Is Everything and<br />
That He Is Our Life</h2>
<p>I left Chefoo and traveled through Tientsin, Beijing, and Nanking. Finally I arrived in Shanghai in order to fellowship with Brother Nee. The first impression I received was that Christ is everything and that He wants to be our life. Brother Nee opened my eyes to see these truths. I received much help during my first visit to Shanghai. The value of the help Brother Nee gave me can be measured only in eternity. Brother Nee was systematic in the way that he rendered help. By such leading, the Lord revealed Himself to me step by step. I was in Shanghai for less than two months, but I became very clear concerning the vision of Christ being everything and being my life. My visit to Shanghai was at the end of 1933 and the beginning of 1934.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeing the Death and Resurrection of Christ</h2>
<p>One time I went to Brother Nee&rsquo;s home, and we sat together and talked. I still remember our talk that day. He said, &ldquo;Brother, all of our spiritual experiences are, objectively speaking, Christ Himself, but subjectively speaking, we experience His death and resurrection.&rdquo; This word opened up a vision to me. Objectively, Christ is everything, and He is our life. This is a vision; it is theory. Subjectively, we experience His death and resurrection. This is practical. Brother Nee added a few words. He said that everything of the old creation, everything natural, that is, not only the evil things but also the good things, must be terminated on the cross. This is reality. Only in resurrection can we enter into everything that is in Christ and everything that is spiritual. We experience the experiences of Christ. Without Christ, that is, apart from Christ, all that we are and do are not only zero in God&rsquo;s eyes but also incur His condemnation. No matter how well we serve, everything we do that is outside of Christ is a problem and will be condemned. Everything must be in Christ, and everything must be Christ. He also said that in order for everything to be in Christ and to be Christ, we must experience death and resurrection. Only in death and resurrection can we experience Christ. His words were crucial to me. I am continually understanding and experiencing this fellowship.</p>
<p>From the end of 1933 until 1940, I lived in the vision of Christ being my life and in the experience of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. In other words, I lived in the vista that Brother Nee opened up to me. During this period of time, I also spoke concerning the church, concerning religious organizations, and concerning the center of our worshipping God. Not much of what I spoke during those years is in print. There is only a little booklet entitled <em>The Gleanings from the Genealogy of Christ.</em> The content of this booklet is taken from the beginning of the New Testament. It is to help young believers in their Bible reading.</p><h2 class="head2">Seeing the Blueprint<br />
of the Building Up of the Church</h2>
<p>In 1940, before the Pacific War broke out, I went to Shanghai again in order to fellowship with Brother Nee. In a private time he told me that the blueprint for the building up of the church was in his hands. These few words gave me a deep impression, and I kept asking myself what was the blueprint. During two months of fellowship with Brother Nee, he gradually showed me the blueprint.</p>
<p>His words were often concise. One time he said that this blueprint is, first, Christ as everything. The only material for the building up of the church is Christ; hence, Christ is everything. Second, this building is expressed in localities. And third, this building should be carried out in coordination.</p>
<p>In 1940 the church in Shanghai established a deacons&rsquo; service, because of the revelation that Brother Nee had related to the administration of a local church. This beginning was for the practice of serving in coordination. Brother Nee set up the deacons&rsquo; service, and he led the deacons to serve. He also led the elders in administrating the church. Brother Nee served as a deacon and as an elder, but he did not replace the deacons or the elders; he led them in their service. At that time, we had a procedure for receiving the saints, and Brother Nee personally took the lead to care for this matter. He handled the receiving of the saints in order to show the deacons and the elders how to receive the saints. He was clear that in order for us to have the practical building up of the church, he needed to be personally involved, and he needed to lead the elders and deacons by serving together with them. During this time, the blueprint was unveiled to me.</p>
<p>In summary, I received two great visions from Brother Nee. First, in 1933 and 1934 I saw that Christ is everything to us and that He is our life. I also saw that in order to experience Christ as everything and as our life, we must experience His death and resurrection. Second, in 1940 I saw the vision of the building up of the church. I returned to northern China in 1940, and from that time onward, the situation in the churches in northern China changed because I practiced the leading I had received. I led the deacons and the elders in their services. I also set up a deacons&rsquo; service so that everyone could learn to serve in coordination in order to carry out the building up. I received these matters from Brother Nee.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeing the Outline of Church History</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Inheriting the Spiritual Riches<br />
of the Past Two Thousand Years</h2>
<p>Furthermore, in my contact with Brother Nee, he also showed me two points that require our attention. First, he gave me an outline of the past two thousand years of church history. Through reading spiritual books, biographies, and church history, he had inherited all the positive things received by the church. Brother Nee was very familiar with the crucial points of the messages, publications, biographies, and history of Christianity, including Catholicism. Even the brothers of the Brethren assemblies were not as clear or well versed in matters concerning the Brethren assemblies as Brother Nee.</p>
<p>Brother Nee had a thorough knowledge of the history of the church. He could clearly say when, where, and why a certain event happened. He could even say in which book an event was recorded. We translated several books into Chinese, such as Madame Guyon&rsquo;s autobiography and also <em>Method of Prayer.</em> We also translated the writings of Francois LaCombe. I received this outline of church history during my first trip to Shanghai while I was a guest at his place.</p>
<p>In January 1934 there was a conference in Shanghai. Brother Nee gave many important and precious messages during that conference. One of the messages was entitled <em>What Are We?</em> In one meeting he stood up and asked, &ldquo;What are we?&rdquo; Then he gave a lengthy message on church history, covering the time from the apostle John to the present. He spoke concerning most of the spiritual matters and people during this period of two thousand years. He related which spiritual persons came forth during a particular time and what was their spiritual worth. He also told us why we took certain points from a person but rejected other points. The co-workers who were present in that meeting were rather young. His speaking amazed us. This was the way that the Lord used Brother Nee to open the spiritual riches from the past two thousand years of church history in order for us to have a clear outline.</p>
<p>During that time we had many long discussions with Brother Nee. We spent almost every day together, and he repeated many points to us. He said that we are not a denomination among the other denominations, but we do not reject everything in the denominations. For example, he said that we are not Baptists, but we practice baptism by immersion; we are not the Holiness Church, but we pay attention to being holy; and we are not Catholics, but we accept spiritual things from Madame Guyon. Through his fellowship, my eyes were opened to the spiritual riches. He also spoke concerning many spiritual people, from Andrew Murray to Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis. Brother Nee explained all the spiritual matters of the past two thousand years, regardless of the sect or group it concerned. This is the first point.</p><h2 class="head3">All the Spiritual Riches Being for the Church</h2>
<p>Second, Brother Nee said that we do not have a problem with receiving spiritual riches. However, we were raised up by the Lord in this age not merely to receive and inherit the spiritual riches of the past two thousand years of church history. We were raised up by the Lord to inherit these riches for the church. Brother Nee saw that in God&rsquo;s intention all the spiritual riches are for the church. He said that in the past, after obtaining a certain experience, some believers adopted it as their own spirituality. For example, although holiness is for the church, holiness believers focus on holiness merely for their own spirituality. These believers seek only their own spirituality. They do not know that spirituality is for the church. Baptism, another example, is for the church. However, the Baptist denomination adopted the truth concerning baptism merely for the salvation of individuals, thereby changing the church into a Baptist Church.</p>
<p>Brother Nee gave numerous examples to show that although in God&rsquo;s intention spiritual riches are for the church, few believers after the apostles have paid attention to the church. It was not until 1828, when Brother J. N. Darby was raised up by the Lord, that believers saw the church. No one after the apostles surpassed Darby in his gifts. We must thank the Lord for giving such a great gift to the church. Western Christianity greatly appreciates the gift of John Wesley, but J. N. Darby&rsquo;s gift was greater than that of John Wesley. However, Western Christianity knows only John Wesley, not J. N. Darby.</p>
<p>Our knowledge and emphasis concerning the church should be attributed to the help that we received from J. N. Darby. However, as a result of the subsequent divisions among the Brethren, the truth concerning the church is rather confused in Western Christianity. Hence, Western Christianity hardly touches the matter of the church. Concerning the church, Eastern Christianity is like virgin soil that has not been damaged. We must humbly admit that J. N. Darby was a great servant used by God. However, after receiving help from him, we have gone further, even though we are small servants of the Lord. We have seen that God desires the church in reality. All the spiritual gifts that God has bestowed on the believers during the past two thousand years are for the building up of the church in reality as His corporate vessel to express His Son.</p>
<p>One day in a private conversation, Brother Nee asked me to read the last verse of Ephesians 1. The verse says, &ldquo;[The church], which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all&rdquo; (v. 23). He said that the word <em>fullness</em> here is like a foreign word. He said that we should not know the church only as the Body of Christ but that we should know the church also as the fullness of Christ. The church being the fullness of Christ means that the church is the overflow of Christ. He also said that after God created Adam, He caused a woman, Eve, to overflow from Adam. Eve was the fullness of Adam (Gen. 2:21-22). At that time I was already married. Brother Nee told me that he, being single, did not have a fullness, but that I, having a wife, had a fullness. For two thousand years God gave spiritual riches in order to gain a corporate vessel to be His fullness. This fullness pleased God. God desired that His Son would be manifested in this vessel, and this vessel is the expression of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Attacks, Troubles, and Criticisms<br />
Being Related to the Ground of the Church</h2>
<p>Brother Nee said that all the sufferings and ordeals that came to us were not because we were wrong. We inherited spiritual things from the believers who have gone before us, and others have welcomed what we gave them. For example, many Chinese Christians had never heard of Madame Guyon or received any spiritual help from her. When we translated her autobiography, other believers were edified. We showed other believers Madame Guyon&rsquo;s attitude toward life in her forsaking the world and voluntarily choosing the cross, and they received it. We translated Mrs. Hannah Whitall Smith&rsquo;s writings, as well as the writings of Andrew Murray and Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis. Other believers welcomed the spiritual things from the past generations. In these matters, we did not fight, and other believers did not give us any trouble. All our afflictions were due to the truth concerning the church and due to our saying that all spiritual riches are for the church and are in the church.</p>
<p>The practice of the church depends on the ground and on coordination. Without the ground and without coordination, the church cannot exist; it remains abstract. If we do not speak concerning the ground of the church and concerning coordination, the church is merely a term without reality. Both the ground and coordination are practical. In order for the church to be practical, there must be the definite ground of the church and the practical coordination to carry out the service. Without these two items, the church would be merely a vision that could not be put into practice. In order for the church to be practical, there must be the practical ground and the practical coordination.</p>
<p>Brother Nee said that all the attacks from outsiders were due to the matter of the ground. If we would give up the ground of the church, the attacks would cease. The ground is the one point in which we cannot be in harmony with the denominations and the other groups in Christianity. If we would give up the ground, we would still be very spiritual, and we would also be able to work with every other Christian. But when we bring up the matter of the ground, other Christians oppose us. These words indicate that our brother&rsquo;s suffering in China was mainly because of the matter of the ground.</p>
<p>Among the missionary groups that first went to China, three were rather spiritual: China Inland Mission, the Christian and Missionary Alliance, and the Baptist denomination. Once, a brother in China Inland Mission asked Brother Nee whether China Inland Mission was a denomination. Brother Nee replied, &ldquo;If you say that you are not a denomination, I will not argue with you. However, let me ask, what is China Inland Mission? If you say that you are a missionary group, what is the result of your work? We all know that Paul, Timothy, and their companions were sent out to work, and the result of their work was the establishing of churches. They established the church in Corinth and the church in Ephesus. They did not establish Paul&rsquo;s Missionary Society or Timothy&rsquo;s Missionary Society. May I ask you, what is the result of China Inland Mission&rsquo;s work in China? Is it not to establish China Inland Mission in many places? This shows that China Inland Mission is replacing the churches.&rdquo; Eventually, the brother said that China Inland Mission would gradually hand everything over; it would withdraw and let the local believers form churches. This was the reply by someone in China Inland Mission.</p>
<p>Brother Nee said that for close to a hundred years China Inland Mission had been preaching the gospel in China but that its goal was wrong. It was right to preach the gospel in China, but its goal was wrong. Many of the missionaries who went to China rendered much spiritual help to the believers. The missionaries did a substantial work in spiritual matters, but they were short in the matter of the ground. This shows that the conflicts we had with Christians were centered entirely on the matter of the ground. The sufferings we experienced, as well as the attacks, troubles, and criticisms, were all because of the ground. If we had compromised, even a little, concerning the ground of the church, we would not have had any problems, and we would have been welcomed everywhere.</p><h2 class="head2">Handing Ourselves Over for Coordination</h2>
<p>The first matter concerning the church is the ground, and the second matter is coordination. During the period that I worked together with Brother Nee, he often pointed out that we say we are meeting in the Lord&rsquo;s name, taking His way, following Him, and giving up the denominations, but where can we see coordination in the churches? Can we see coordination among the co-workers?</p>
<p>In 1948 we experienced what we called &ldquo;handing over.&rdquo; At the end of 1947 several co-workers visited some major cities in Kwangtung and Fukien Provinces. Then we went to Foochow for a three-week conference. Several of us co-workers asked Brother Nee to let us stay with him for two weeks after the conference in order to have some fellowship with him. The other co-workers who attended the conference were supposed to return to their localities after the conference, but after hearing of our request to Brother Nee, they refused to leave, hoping that they would be allowed to participate in the fellowship. Eventually, Brother Nee agreed that they could participate in the fellowship on the condition that they sat behind a screen. Only a few co-workers were allowed to sit face to face with him. Brother Nee asked me to be responsible for this matter.</p>
<p>Those who have fellowshipped with Brother Nee know that he was never the first to raise a question. If someone would sit with him from nine to twelve o&rsquo;clock, without asking a question, Brother Nee would not say a word. That was what happened in our meeting. He was very patient; he sat without saying a word or asking a question. After a while, since I was the one who initiated the fellowship, I asked, &ldquo;Brother Nee, recently we traveled through Canton, Hong Kong, Swatow, and several important places in Fukien Province. We feel that the churches in these places are in confusion. What do you think should be done about this situation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Based on my question, Brother Nee gave a message concerning our lack of coordination. In essence, he said that all the co-workers feel that they are called by God, that they love the Lord, and that they are taking the way of the church in their service to the Lord. However, everything is being done without any coordination. Hence, the Lord has no way to go on. Brother Nee spoke for at least two hours. His speaking brought tears to our eyes. It was rare for Brother Nee to shed tears before people, but even he wept during that fellowship. Many co-workers, even the most hard-hearted, wept.</p>
<p>After Brother Nee spoke, the room was quiet. No one spoke, and no one moved. Among the twenty-some co-workers who were present, an older sister suddenly stood up and said, &ldquo;This being the case, why don&rsquo;t we practice it right away?&rdquo; Immediately, the rest of the co-workers agreed. Then Brother Nee said, &ldquo;If you want to do it, you must write on a piece of paper that you will hand yourself over and give it to Brother Lee. He will collect the pieces of paper for me.&rdquo; When we asked Brother Nee the purpose of our handing ourselves over, he said, &ldquo;By handing yourself over, you indicate that you are willing to accept coordination. Henceforth, you cannot be individualistic. If you want to be individualistic, you can take back your piece of paper. Anyone who hands in a piece of paper must accept coordination.&rdquo; That was the beginning of &ldquo;handing over.&rdquo; The emphasis was not on handing over our possessions but on handing over our person in order to accept coordination.</p>
<p>The church in Shanghai experienced a revival during 1946 and 1947. As a result of this revival, co-workers from various places in China, including the northern and central areas, wanted to come to Shanghai to seek fellowship. We asked Brother Nee to join us for a conference in Shanghai. In one of the meetings he said that handing ourselves over was for coordination. He showed us that the enemy&rsquo;s attack from outside was due to the matter of the ground and that the internal problems we had with one another were due to the matter of coordination. The enemy wants to remove the ground and destroy the coordination. He has been doing this for two thousand years.</p>
<p>Brother Nee also said that we are not more spiritual than the believers who have gone before us. We are not more spiritual than Madame Guyon, and our speaking concerning our co-death with Christ does not surpass what Mrs. Penn-Lewis taught. But we must see that the Lord has raised us up not for spirituality or for teachings. The Lord has raised us up for the church.</p>
<p>From 1933 to 1934 Brother Nee led me to see Christ and to experience His death and resurrection. In 1940 he showed me the blueprint for the building up of the church. By 1942 I had a deep realization that the spiritual riches of the believers who have gone before us, which we have inherited, are for the building up of the church. In order to experience the building up of the church, we must hold two concrete and practical points: a definite ground and the practical coordination. A person who wants to build a house must not only gather materials; he must also determine where to build the house. This is the matter of the ground. If he gathers materials but does not have a proper site, he cannot build a house. Furthermore, if there is a definite site, but the materials are not built together, there cannot be a house. This is obvious. In order to build a house, we need materials, a definite site, and a practical way to build the materials together.</p><h2 class="head2">The Stratagem of the Enemy&mdash;<br />
Annulling the Ground of the Church and<br />
Bringing Discord into the Coordination</h2>
<p>In 1949 I moved from the mainland to Taiwan. From then until 1957 the work overseas did not experience problems concerning the ground, nor was there anything unpleasant in our coordination. As a result of external influences, beginning in 1957 there arose among the churches in Taiwan a problem concerning the ground as well as concerning coordination. This caused me to go before the Lord to reflect upon all the leading I had received from Brother Nee. I was clear that the confusion was the result of the enemy&rsquo;s stratagem. The enemy was trying to use every means possible to annul the ground of the church and to bring discord into our coordination. This is the enemy&rsquo;s scheme. He is not afraid of people becoming spiritual, but he hates to see the church being built up on the proper ground.</p>
<p>The serving saints need a clear vision. I have no intention to dispute or to be resentful. I know what the Lord has commissioned me to do. I also know the commission He gave to Brother Nee in his ministry in China. Furthermore, I know the purpose of my coordination with Brother Nee. These items are for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of the co-workers rejoice because they have brought people to salvation, but the co-workers do not understand the purpose of coordination. When we do not hinder the coordination, we do not cause any problems, but once we hinder the coordination, we cause problems. Our senior brother was the first to receive from the Lord the blueprint for the building up of the church. When we invite someone to help us build, we are not asking him to help us draw the blueprint or to change the blueprint, because the blueprint is already drawn. We are carrying out the building work according to the blueprint. When we ask someone to help us, we are asking him to carry out the building work according to the blueprint. For example, it is acceptable to hire an expert painter who knows how to do a paint job that will last three to five years. We can also accept the work of a good carpenter, but we cannot accept any complaints about the blueprint or attempts to change the design of the doors and the windows. Whoever comes to help us in the work should help us only on the technical side. He should not change our blueprint.</p>
<p>In 1955 Brother T. Austin-Sparks came to Taiwan, and we welcomed him. However, after he came again in 1957, we could no longer welcome his ministry. During his first visit, he helped us with spiritual matters, and we are truly grateful. However, instead of helping us during his second visit, he tried to change our blueprint, especially concerning the ground of the church. We cannot accept that.</p>
<p>We must be clear concerning the areas in which we need help. We are indeed lacking in many spiritual matters, and we need to receive help from others. However, concerning the blueprint for the building up of the church, which is related to the ground of the church and the way of coordination, we do not need to receive help from others. It is regrettable that those who have come to help us have not only offered us help in spiritual matters but have also tried to change our blueprint. For the past three hundred years of church history, none of the believers who could render spiritual help to others have surpassed Madame Guyon. It is an undeniable fact that Madame Guyon has rendered spiritual help to others, but she worshipped before the statue of Mary because she was under the influence of Roman Catholicism. We cannot agree with her in this matter. We have received spiritual help from her, but we cannot accept the way that she took, such as worshipping the statue of Mary and observing mass in the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>We can receive spiritual help from any person and from any group. But we became clear twenty years ago that we cannot allow anyone to change our blueprint concerning the ground of the church and the coordination for the building up of the church. I would emphasize again that in terms of spiritual weight, spiritual stature, and spiritual practices, we need to receive help from others. However, we cannot accept anyone who touches our blueprint; that is, we cannot accept someone who tries to change the way of the church ground and our coordination. Our blueprint is the commission for which the Lord has raised us up in this age.</p>
<p>There have been many spiritual brothers in the history of the church. Andrew Murray is one of them. A number of his books, such as <em>Abide in Christ</em> and <em>The Inner Chamber and the Inner Life,</em> are very popular. These books prove that many believers are pursuing spirituality. If no one was pursuing spirituality, these books would not have any readership or have a large circulation. However, we must ask: where is the church? There is enough of so-called spirituality. In these last days the Lord desires to accomplish His heart&rsquo;s desire. Even if not all of God&rsquo;s children are concerned with the matter of the church, He is willing to have a remnant who will fulfill His heart&rsquo;s desire. His desire is for us to keep the ground in many localities and to have the practical coordination so that He can have a practical expression of the Body of His Son. This is the desire of God&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>The co-workers did not become clear concerning the ground of the church and concerning coordination until the 1950s, even though Brother Nee had given us this blueprint earlier on, and it had enabled us to know our way forward. We welcome anyone who desires to help us in spiritual matters; we acknowledge our lack. However, concerning the blueprint, that is, concerning the ground and concerning coordination, it is unnecessary, even futile, for anyone to try to change us. If Brother T. Austin-Sparks&rsquo;s second visit had been the same as his first visit, that is, if he had rendered us help only in spiritual matters, I believe that we would have continued to invite him until today because we need the help. However, during his second visit he wanted to change our blueprint; he wanted to change our practice concerning the ground and our coordination. In his private conversation with me, all the disputes were centered on these points. From that time onward, there was a turmoil raging among us.</p>
<p>For many years Brother Nee led us to learn the ground of the church and coordination. In 1939 he returned from Europe and called a conference, in which he spoke on the Body of Christ and the building up of the church. He did not speak concerning the Body in theory but concerning our practice of the Body. Where is such a practice today? In order to have such a practice, there must be a definite ground locally as well as a practical coordination. Then believers can become a corporate vessel to be the Body of Christ. This is our vision and our goal. This vision has become clearer to us. Problems come because of the ground and coordination. These two items are vital matters. Satan is trying to destroy these two items, and we are contending for them. In recent years we have been attacked because of these two matters. This is a spiritual warfare.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF REVIVAL</h2>
<p>Let us now consider the law of revival. Every feeling that we have from our heart and everything that transpires in our environment are a basis for us to be revived and to enjoy Christ more. Titus 3:5 speaks of &ldquo;the renewing of the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; which takes place within us. The Holy Spirit is doing a renewing work in us. To renew is to revive. Hence, the renewing of the Holy Spirit is the reviving of the Holy Spirit. The work of the Holy Spirit within us is to renew us, that is, to revive us, after we are saved. This is what the Holy Spirit is doing in us.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 4:16 says, &ldquo;Though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.&rdquo; From the context of verses 7 through 9, we can see that the decaying in verse 16 refers to the effect of the environment on us. The treasure in our earthen vessels manifests the excellency of the power of God (v. 7). Hence, we may be cast down, but we are not destroyed (v. 9). All the problems that come upon us destroy our outer man, but they cause our inner man to be renewed day by day. This is revival. The renewing of the Holy Spirit in Titus 3:5 refers to what takes place within us. The decaying of our outer man in 2 Corinthians 4:16 refers to the effect of our environment. The Holy Spirit works within us for our renewing, and the decaying of our outer man through the environment is also for our renewing. This renewing is a revival.</p>
<p>Hence, everything that transpires with us and everything that we encounter in our environment tell us that we need to be renewed. In other words, we need to experience Christ and be revived according to what transpires within us and according to what we encounter in our environment. If we experience or encounter suffering, we should learn to experience Christ as our joy in suffering. If our environment is pressing on us, we should experience Christ as our joy under pressure. This is the way that we follow what the Holy Spirit is doing in us. Through the feelings in our heart and through the circumstances arranged by God in our environment, we experience and gain Christ for us to be renewed and revived.</p>
<p>I hope that we will take this word and put it into practice. The more we practice, the more we will be renewed; that is, we will experience Christ and have His life. This should be our daily and moment-by-moment practice. Every feeling in our heart and everything that transpires in our environment should be the basis for us to experience Christ. Every time that we gain Christ, we are renewed, revived, just as every time we eat or drink we are strengthened and revived. Eating and drinking are the ways that we maintain our physical existence and also grow strong. This principle applies to our spiritual life as well.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LEARNING<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S SERVING ONES&mdash;<br />
TAKING CHRIST AS LIFE AND<br />
SERVING IN THE CHURCH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A FOUNDATION WITH TWO ASPECTS&mdash;<br />
LEARNING THE LESSONS OF LIFE AND<br />
SERVING IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The co-workers need the foundation of learning the lessons of life and of serving in the church. Everyone who serves the Lord needs to learn and know these two items. A serving one who lacks in either item will have problems in the future.</p>
<p>Life and the church are two aspects, two sides, of one foundation; they are not two separate foundations. A person has only one body, but he stands on two legs. The training of the co-workers has one foundation with two aspects&mdash;life and the church. A co-worker who is short in learning either aspect can be compared to a person with only one leg. This shortage will cause problems. A co-worker who is short in learning both aspects can be compared to a person without legs, who is unable to move. It is not a normal situation for a person to have only a torso without two legs to support him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO TAKE CHRIST AS LIFE</h2>
<p>Many co-workers love the Lord but lack the foundation of life. They have been saved for many years and are pursuing the Lord, loving Him, and giving themselves wholeheartedly, but they have never been trained in the matter of life. They love the Lord and are zealous for Him, but they do not know how to take the Lord as life, how to touch the feeling of the Lord, and how to fellowship with the Lord. Without this kind of training, everything we learn after our salvation is outward, and our experience of being a Christian is also outward. This can be compared to learning the actions in Chinese boxing but not having the internal strength. Such serving ones are merely Christians outwardly, not Christians in living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Improving or Adjusting</h2>
<p>Every Christian who is learning to follow the Lord must turn from outward activities in order to touch the way of life. Being a Christian is not a matter of being zealous, improving, adjusting, or changing, nor is it a matter of being right or wrong, good or bad, proud or humble, or gentle or violent. Those who pay attention to these matters are outward Christians. These things are not reliable or stable, nor do they have much value. God in His salvation wants to enter into us to be our life. He desires to enter into our spirit, to be mingled with our spirit, to be one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17) so that we may be joined to Him and take Him as our life. Then outwardly, it is we who live, but within, we live by His life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fellowshipping with the Lord and<br />
Being Dealt With by Him</h2>
<p>A proper Christian, one who is up to the standard, does not adjust his behavior; rather, he turns from outward things to fellowship and contact God, that is, to touch God, His feeling, and His presence and to take Him as life. This is the foundation of the living of a proper Christian. The meekness of a proper Christian must be the issue of this foundation, and his humility must also be the issue of this foundation. Even his zeal and his activities in the church must issue from this foundation.</p>
<p>Every co-worker must learn the lesson of touching the presence of God, that is, of touching God. When we touch God&rsquo;s presence, we have a sense within, our inner being is made alive, and we are enlightened. As a result, we will see that there are many things in us that need to be dealt with, and we will be restricted by the Lord. The Lord wants to be the living law within us in order to lead us in every situation. When we sense that He wants us to discard certain things or to be restricted in certain matters, we should pay the price to follow Him. This kind of learning is the lesson of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Discerning according to<br />
the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil<br />
but Turning to Our Spirit to Contact<br />
the Tree of Life</h2>
<p>Although many saints love the Lord and desire to be pleasing to Him, few have learned the lesson of life; that is, few have learned to turn to their spirit to contact Him. A brother who is not learning this lesson will experience a great lack. It is possible for him to be a Christian for many years and read the Bible regularly but not to have received this basic training. We need to be Christians in life. If we live by outward reforms, outward activities, and considerations of right and wrong, we are in the realm of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>As Christians, we are persons who turn to our spirit to touch the Lord, who is in our spirit as life. He is also the tree of life that has been planted within us and is now growing in us. We do not need to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil with our mind; rather, we need to turn to our spirit and eat of the tree of life. As soon as we touch the Lord, we are enlivened and enlightened, and He becomes our restriction, our law of life. Moreover, we become clear concerning the items that we should discard and concerning what we should deal with. He becomes the restraining strength within us, and we become clear as to what He allows and what He forbids, and concerning what things we have done in Him and what we have done in ourselves.</p>
<p>Knowing the things that the Lord forbids is a negative experience of life. On the positive side, the Lord desires to be our energizing power in order to motivate us to obey His will, to accomplish His purpose, and to live Him out. He wants to be everything we do; hence, we need to pay the price to follow Him.</p>
<p>Some may say that they cannot be this kind of Christian. However, only those Christians who contact the Lord can be led by His hand. Having spiritual gifts or leaving the sects cannot solve our problems. The only way to solve our problems is to take the way of life. Only when we turn from all the outward bondages to our spirit can we have genuine growth and progress in the divine life.</p><h2 class="head2">Experiencing the Termination of the Cross<br />
in Our Spirit</h2>
<p>The so-called gifts and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit are outward. The believers in Corinth spoke in tongues, interpreted tongues, and did not lack in any gift, but the apostle Paul said that they were infants and fleshly (1 Cor. 3:1-3). They did not know God according to life. They were outward Christians; that is, they were Christians according to gifts, not according to life. An outward Christian does not need the cross, but a Christian who is according to life needs the cross and needs to continually touch the Lord, touching His presence and His feeling. Every experience he has needs the cross, and the cross is in every item. The cross is not a matter of suffering but a matter of termination. The cross terminates us so that we are not the ones who are living. Rather, we live by the Lord; we take Him as life and express Him in our living.</p>
<p>We must learn the matter of life because being a Christian is not something outward, nor is it related to spiritual gifts or religious sentiments. Being a Christian is a matter of turning to our spirit, where we can touch Christ and His feeling so that He has a way to live in us. The cross must terminate our person and our preferences, our spiritual inclinations, and the way we work. Even if we are willing to pay a price and sacrifice ourselves in order to serve others, we still need to be terminated by the cross. We must come out of being good, being zealous, sacrificing for Christ, serving others, preaching the gospel, and working for God, all of which are outward, and we must turn to our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Desiring the Lord, Fellowshipping with Him<br />
with a Pure Heart, and Following Him</h2>
<p>Christians who fall into sin and the world are not proper. However, Christians who pursue being good and zealous and who seek tongue-speaking, power, spiritual gifts, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit are outward. We must turn away from the outward things to our spirit; that is, we need to forget about being good, being zealous, paying a price, and serving others, as well as our suffering, sacrificing, and working for the Lord. The way to follow the Lord does not begin with these things. If we are still dealing with these things, we will not be reliable. The way for us to follow the Lord has only one starting point, which is to turn to our spirit. We must be willing to be stripped of anything that is apart from Him, even if it is our best virtue. We must desire only Him. Here is an example. If the Lord were in me as my life, I would be willing to be stripped, imprisoned, restricted, and ruled by Him. I would not have ambitions, plans, goals, insights, inclinations, choices, preferences, decisions, wishes, or expectations. I would drop everything and be a person who turns to my spirit so that I could touch Him and contact Him. This is the beginning of learning the lessons of life.</p>
<p>When I meet with the Lord, contact Him, and touch His feeling, my inner being is enlivened and enlightened, and I know what He wants me to deal with. I also know His intention and see that my intention and my attitude are apart from Him. I also see that my actions are not in conformity with His intention, nor are they in Him. Then I am willing to be restricted by Him and to live in Him. As a result, He can move within me. Although I have stopped my activities, He is moving in me, urging me to obey Him, to pay the price, and not to care for my future or my position so that I can live in Him. These are the basic lessons that we must learn.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO SERVE IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Lessons of Life Being<br />
for the Building Up of the Church</h2>
<p>Now we will consider the aspect of the church. We must know the purpose of God&rsquo;s being our life. It is not for our individual spirituality but for us to be the church, the Body of His Son (Eph. 1:22-23). The church is produced by the Son of God building Himself into His redeemed people. The church is something unique in the universe, and the expression of the church in every locality is also unique. The things of the world and human opinions do not have any place in the church. We cannot expect every Christian to know what the church is, but we should know what the church is. Everything in the church is corporate; there is no place for individuals. A hand, for example, has its place, but that place is in the body. As believers who know the church, we meet together with the building up of the church as our goal. Our spiritual pursuit and our willingness to learn the lessons of life are not for our personal gain but for the church. We are not for our own spirituality; we are for the building up of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Learning to Coordinate in the Church and<br />
Knowing God&rsquo;s Arrangement and Order</h2>
<p>If we desire to have good coordination, we must see that there is only one church, one Body. Then we will be open to coordination, which is the building up of the church. Coordination is not a matter of organization according to human will but a matter of the growth and expression of life. It is a practical matter because when we coordinate, we know the order in the Body, and we know our place. This means that we know God&rsquo;s arrangement; we know the place that God has arranged for us, His order in the Body, and the deputy authority in the church. By knowing the church in this way and by touching the Lord in our spirit, we are saved from the things that do not correspond with the nature and the vision of the church. This experience is not according to an outward law but according to an inward vision.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when we coordinate, we see that we cannot be individualistic, because the life of Christ, which is the life of the church, is a corporate life. The Body is a matter of coordination and building. There is an order in the Body, and there is also authority in the Body. Human opinions and concepts of so-called democracy and equality cause the Body to fall apart; they cut the Body into pieces. Hence, we need a clear understanding of what the church is and how to live in the church.</p><h2 class="head2">Seeing the Vision of the Church</h2>
<p>Many people have asked me whether the many Christian groups who zealously preach the gospel are the church. We do not deny the importance of preaching the gospel. The Catholic Church also preaches the gospel; this is undeniable. However, it is not a matter of whether or not a Christian group preaches the gospel. The real issue is whether, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we have seen the vision that God desires to be our life. His purpose is that all those who have His life would be built up to be the church. This church is one universally and also one locally. Concerning the church, we can either be one hundred percent correct or one hundred percent wrong. There is no ambiguity in this matter because there is only one Body of Christ, and there is only one church of God. If we are clear concerning this vision, we will understand that there cannot be more than one church in the universe and that there cannot be more than one church in any given locality. There can be only one universal church because there is only one Body of Christ, and this one universal church can have only one expression locally. Hence, we should not participate in any group that is not the one Body. We cannot participate in the Catholic Church even though it has many believers, because it is not of the one Body, and its system is not scriptural.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Turning to the Spirit<br />
to Be Faithful to the Vision<br />
and Being Restricted<br />
in the Coordination of the Body</h2>
<p>In this age God desires to be our life and to build us up to be His church. We may not be able to bring every believer into this vision, but we must be faithful and loyal to this vision. When we see the Body, we will no longer serve God individualistically; instead, we will serve in coordination in the one Body. We cannot require every Christian to be in this coordination, but since we have seen this vision, we are willing to be restricted by it and to serve in coordination with the other saints. No matter how good or how effective other groups may be, my concern is to serve according to this vision.</p>
<p>A friend once told me that he felt it was the Lord who told him to do what he was doing. I told him that those in the Catholic Church would also say, with absolute assurance, that they were doing what the Lord wants them to do. I said that only the Lord knows who is right.</p>
<p>I hope that all the co-workers will learn to fellowship with the Lord more in order to see a vision and to know the Lord&rsquo;s feeling. They should also learn to fellowship and follow the Lord. At a certain point in time you will see His Body&mdash;the universal church and its local expression. You will also see that the church is a coordinated Body, that there is an order in the Body, and that there is also restriction in the Body.</p>
<p>All the talk by other groups concerning the church can be compared to the talks between Job and his three friends; these talks are words without knowledge, which darkens counsel (Job 38:2). They are the expression of human opinions. The more we listen to them, the more confused we will be. There is only one way to be clear, and that way is to turn to our spirit. When we touch the Lord, we should deal with whatever He wants us to deal with. In whatever way He would restrict us, we should be restricted, and if He wants us to pay a price, we should be willing to pay a price. If we are willing to follow the Lord in this way, we will see the glorious vision of the universal church and its local expression. We will also realize that we have received mercy to be members in the Body. Hence, we will be in coordination, knowing our place and the order in the Body. The Head is in this coordination, and the order and deputy authority come out from the Head. We will also realize that this living testimony is what God desires to gain in this age and that Satan hates this testimony. Only this vision can destroy Satan&rsquo;s scheme and bring in God&rsquo;s kingdom. This is the way we serve in the church.</p>
<p>Every saint must be established in two aspects: learning the lessons of life and having a proper knowledge of the church. Concerning the aspect of life, we must learn to turn to the Lord and fall before His face. Without a clear vision of the church, we will have problems in our service. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we will learn the lessons of life and the way to serve in the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">TOUCHING THE BIBLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">READING THE BIBLE BEING DIFFERENT<br />
FROM TOUCHING THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Reading the Bible is different from touching the Bible. Reading the Bible is for understanding the Bible, whereas touching the Bible is for contacting the Bible. Understanding the Bible and contacting the Bible are two different things. It is one thing to know and understand the chemical structure of water, but it is quite another thing to drink water, that is, to contact water. A child washes his hands and feet every day with water, but he does not know the chemical structure of water. A chemist knows the chemical structure of water because he studies water. A child who washes his hands with water contacts water. The child does not know the chemical structure of water, because he does not study it. This example shows the difference between studying water and contacting water. Here is another example. We eat rice every day; that is, we contact rice, but we do not necessarily know its nutritional content.</p>
<p>In a past training we spent much effort to explain how to read the Bible so that the saints can understand the Bible. We also spent several months to study the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible. However, our emphasis was on understanding rather than on contacting the Bible. We said that in order to understand a book of the Bible, we should know the general sketch, the central thought, the key words, the sections, the main themes, the types, and the prophecies in the book. If we read through a book according to these seven points, we will understand the book. These seven points of emphasis guide us through the difficult portions of the Bible. If we read Genesis in this way, we will understand its general sketch: God created, Satan corrupted, man fell, and God promised to save. If we study the Bible in this way, every book will become clear and transparent. However, these seven points are mainly for us to understand and know the content of the Bible. They do not help us to touch and contact the Bible. Hence, we must ask ourselves what is the proper way to touch the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO TOUCH THE BIBLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the Essence of the Bible&mdash;the Spirit</h2>
<p>In order to touch the Bible, we first need to know that the Spirit of God is the essence of the Bible (John 6:63). In order to contact something, we must know its essence and purpose. For example, we eat food because we know that it is edible, and we wear clothes because we know that they cover us. Similarly, we know that we should sit on a chair, not a table. These may seem to be superficial examples, but they reveal a principle. If we read the Bible as if it were a book of doctrines to be studied, it will be a book only on truth and doctrines. On the surface, the Bible is a book on truth and doctrines, but more importantly, the Bible contains the Spirit. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (6:63). Unbelievers may not agree with this, but we know that the essence of the Bible is Spirit and that the words of God are spirit and life. The Spirit of God is the essence of the Bible.</p>
<p>The words in the Bible are like seeds; they are a matter of life. We can say that seeds are the embodiment of life, the practical expression of life. Life is abstract, but in creation God caused life to be embodied in seeds. For example, the life of a flower is concealed within a seed. If we plant the seed, life will be manifested. But if we take the seed to a laboratory and conduct tests on the seed, we will not be able to find life. We will find many elements in the seed, but we will not find life. The most that any scientist can do is to determine the elements within a seed, but he cannot isolate the life within the seed in order to show others. Nevertheless, life is the most important thing in a seed. Similarly, we can find many things in the Bible, but there is something in the Bible that we cannot find when we use only our mind; we cannot find the Spirit in the Bible in order to show others.</p>
<p>The Bible presents many things. Genesis speaks of God creating the heavens and the earth and of the patriarchs living before God. Exodus speaks of the Israelites&rsquo; oppression in Egypt and of Moses&rsquo; being born and sent by God. Proverbs contains ethical instructions. Many people consider the teachings in Proverbs to be higher than the ethical teachings of Chinese families. Although these matters are presented in the Bible, they are not the life in the Bible. The Spirit and life are concealed within the Bible; nevertheless, we cannot show them to others.</p>
<p>Some people say that we are irrational because we say that the Bible contains life, but we say that the Chinese classics, such as <em>Four Books</em> and the <em>Five Classics,</em> do not contain life. When people argue and say that the Bible is only a book of black and white letters, we are not able to convince them otherwise. In such a situation it is best to be silent. A person who uses these Chinese classics to preach the gospel, however, will not be able to bring anyone to salvation. These two Chinese classics speak only of the development of a person&rsquo;s bright virtue, which cannot cause people to be regenerated. However, the verse &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life&rdquo; (John 3:16) can cause a person to repent and be regenerated. This is life. If we bury a seed in the earth, after a few days a green and tender shoot will break forth. Although we cannot isolate life, we can show people the issue of life.</p>
<p>Studying and understanding the Bible are similar to a chemist&rsquo;s studying and analyzing the elements within a seed. A chemist might be able to show that wheat, barley, and rice consist of different elements, but no matter how many tests he conducts, he will not be able to find the life within a seed. A seed must be nurtured in order for the life within it to be manifested. Seeds need soil in order for them to be nurtured and grow. We do not understand life nor can we isolate it, but the life within a seed is manifested when the seed sprouts.</p>
<p>The Bible has the aspect of &ldquo;elements&rdquo; and also the aspect of spirit and life. Even the most renowned biologist cannot explain life. A person can study the numbers in the Bible and learn that the number seven signifies perfection and the number three signifies resurrection. These are the elements that can be studied in the Bible. After studying Numbers and Deuteronomy, he can conclude that Numbers is a book on coordination and building but that Deuteronomy is a book on living and worship. However, this is not the way for a person to touch life in the Bible. Seemingly, the Word of God concerns only teachings, but the essential component of the Word of God is spirit and life. Our knowledge of the Bible must include these two aspects, both of which are related to us.</p>
<p>The Word of God contains the Spirit of God and the life of God, both of which cannot be explained. Hence, we may say that the Bible is the embodiment of the Spirit. Unless we know the Bible to this extent, we will spend all our time only studying the Bible. I am concerned that some saints cannot discern between the two aspects of the Bible, that is, between the outward elements and the inward essence of spirit and life. We must discern between these two aspects so that we not only understand the elements of the Bible but, even more, touch the spirit and life within the Bible. The Bible is the embodiment of the Spirit of God.</p><h2 class="head2">Contacting the Bible<br />
Being to Contact the Spirit</h2>
<p>To contact the Bible is to contact the Spirit of God. Christians should not be superstitious, but when we contact the Bible, we must be focused in our concept, feeling, and attitude to realize that we are contacting the Spirit. Without such an attitude, it will not be easy for us to touch the essence of the Bible. Similarly, when we contact food, it is with the intention of eating it. Without such a focus, we will not eat the food. Hence, our focus is important.</p>
<p>Every time we come to the Bible, we must ask ourselves whether we want to study the Bible or to contact it. If our purpose is to study the Bible, we will learn the elements, but if our purpose is to contact the Bible, we will touch the Spirit of God. Most of the people who read the Bible only study the elements in the Bible. By God&rsquo;s mercy, many times when we study the Bible, we touch the Spirit of God with our spirit. We can say that sometimes we &ldquo;stumbled upon&rdquo; the Spirit. This may not be a good illustration, but the principle is correct. Initially, we were studying the elements of the Bible; we had no intention of contacting the Spirit. But while we were studying, the Spirit of God touched our spirit. The Spirit can be found in the Bible; hence, when we contact the Bible, we contact the Spirit. Very few believers are clear concerning this matter. On the one hand, we need to study the Bible, and on the other hand, we need to touch the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL EXERCISES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Building Up the Habit of Contacting the Spirit</h2>
<p>Many children of God cannot discern the difference between studying the Bible and touching the Bible. Most believers merely read the Bible; they do not know that the purpose of reading the Bible is for them to contact and touch the Bible. We are intentionally using this word <em>contact.</em> Some believers may argue that reading the Bible is the same as contacting the Bible. In our use, we are saying that contacting the Bible is different from reading the Bible. To read something is to study it, but to contact something is to touch it so that it may operate in us. What believers refer to as studying the Bible may be likened to studying the nutritional content of food. What we refer to as contacting the Bible may be compared to eating a meal. Studying the Bible is entirely different from contacting the Bible.</p>
<p>We need to consider how much we contact the Bible. If we had not received particular leading, over ninety percent of the time we would only read and study the Bible. Do we open the Bible because we want to contact the Spirit or because we want to study the Bible? I am afraid that we rarely open the Bible in order to contact the Spirit. We need to learn to contact the Bible. Whenever we come to the Bible, we must have the concept that we are coming to contact the Spirit of God. We must exercise in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Dropping the Desire to Understand</h2>
<p>In order to contact the Bible, we must drop the desire to understand it. Initially, this may not be easy, because we have a habit of studying it. If we would open the Bible for the sake of contacting it rather than studying it, we would be delivered. For this reason we need to practice. If we can learn this secret and practice it, our Bible-reading will gradually become profitable. As soon as we contact the Bible, we will also contact the Spirit. Some may ask how they can understand the Bible without studying and researching it. This is to fall victim to the notion of wanting to understand. We think that we cannot receive inspiration if we do not understand the Bible. If we would practice contacting the Bible, we would realize that, in fact, our understanding of the Bible comes from inspiration. When we read the Bible, we should not focus on understanding it. We must drop this concept.</p>
<p>This fellowship may seem contradictory because reading the Bible helps you to understand it, yet you are being told not to focus on understanding what you read. How do we explain this? Every time we come to the Bible, we should reject the desire to merely understand, because this desire will hinder us from touching the Spirit. We should not fear our inability to understand the Bible. At a certain point in time, we will gain a genuine understanding. We must drop the concept of merely wanting to understand the Bible. When we are invited to a rich feast, we should simply eat and drink and enjoy the food that is set before us. We should not analyze the food. We need to be delivered when we read the Bible. When we open the Bible, we must have the concept, focus, and desire to contact the Spirit of God. We must be so foolish that if we understand something when we read the Bible, we would say, &ldquo;Lord, even though I understand, I still want to contact Your Spirit.&rdquo; If we are willing to spend the time and practice reading the Bible in this way, we will discover that it is very beneficial.</p>
<p>Not many saints have the practice of touching the Bible. We cannot avoid the term <em>reading the Bible,</em> but we must change our practice. Formerly, we read the Bible as if we were reading a chemistry textbook. It is not easy for us to drop the concept of studying and researching the Bible. We need to be corrected in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Coming with the Spirit<br />
and Learning to Use the Spirit</h2>
<p>When we read the Bible, we must use our spirit more than our mind, because our intention is to contact the Spirit. God is Spirit, and He needs us to touch Him with our spirit. Our heart and mind are also involved with reading the Bible, but the primary matter is to use our spirit. When some brothers read the Bible, they use only their mind but not their heart; that is, they do not love to read the Word of God, nor do they have a heart to receive His words. Hence, they read the Bible like someone who is reading a newspaper. Other brothers use not only their mind but also their heart. They love God&rsquo;s words, take delight in His words, want to hear His words, receive His words, and are willing to pay a price to enjoy His words. However, they do not know how to exercise their spirit. As a result, they do not receive the supply of life from the Bible. Even after reading the Bible many times, these ones can receive only teachings concerning improving their behavior; they cannot touch the words of life.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, we must learn the lesson of using not only our mind and our heart but also our spirit. In other words, we should contact the Bible with our spirit. When we come to the Word of God, we are coming to Him; hence, we must have a spirit of worship and not merely a sincere heart. God is Spirit, and we must worship Him in spirit. This means that we should not use only our mind or our zeal. God&rsquo;s words are spirit; hence, we must exercise to not rely solely on our ability to comprehend and learn but, instead, contact His words with a spirit of worship. This requires exercise.</p>
<p>If we would exercise our spirit when we come to the Word, then even if we read only half a chapter, our spirit will touch the Spirit in the Word. By contacting God in this way for ten or twenty minutes, our inner being will be refreshed, illuminated, strengthened, and satisfied. This is the result of touching the Spirit of God. As serving ones who desire to receive something from the Bible, we should spend some time to practice so that the Bible becomes our food and our supply. This is the most precious aspect of the Bible. It is also true that the light and truth in the Bible supply our mind. This is another aspect. </p>
<p>The Spirit of God is located in the words of the Bible. Hence, our primary purpose in contacting the Bible is to contact the Spirit. For this reason, when we come to the Bible, we must reject our desire to merely comprehend, and instead, we must use our spirit to contact the words of God. When we use our spirit to touch His words, we contact the Spirit. As a result of this kind of contact, we receive holiness, power, love, and comfort. These can be compared to the fruit produced after a seed is planted in the soil. Such fruit is not the issue of teaching but the result of the growth of life. Such fruit is the result of our spirit touching not only the words of God but also the Spirit of God, because His words are spirit and life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">TOUCHING THE BIBLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to fellowship concerning touching the Bible. We must understand that the Bible is the embodiment of the Spirit of God. Hence, when we open the Bible, we must maintain an attitude of contacting the Spirit. We must always use our spirit when we read the Bible. This is the positive aspect of touching the Bible.</p>
<p>Contacting the Spirit in the Bible with our spirit requires a substantial effort. This is not an easy matter for believers who are new to the Bible. Using our spirit to contact the Spirit through reading the Bible involves learning some necessary skills. When believers who are spiritually young begin to practice this, there are many encumbrances that must be overcome.</p>
<p>When the limiting factors are reduced, our ability to touch the Spirit is increased. These factors can be likened to heavy loads that press down on a person and hinder his ability to move forward. As the loads are taken away, his ability to move forward gradually increases. When all the loads have been completely removed, he will be able to move freely. This principle applies to using our spirit to contact the Spirit while reading the Bible. After the limiting factors have been removed, we will be able to reach a higher level when we read the Bible. However, it is not so easy to deal with these limiting factors.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIMITATIONS TO CONTACTING<br />
THE SPIRIT OF GOD WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We may read the Bible many times, but our spirit will not necessarily touch the Spirit because there are many limitations within us. In other words, there are many things that press down on us. Unless these limiting factors are removed, we will be unable to rise up. Every time a limitation is removed, we will rise up a little higher. When all the limitations are taken away, we will be fully released. When the apostle Paul read the Scriptures, he used his spirit to contact the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:6). There was nothing oppressing him, and he was free from every encumbrance. Having broken away from every earthly encumbrance, he was able to exercise his spirit.</p>
<p>A new believer is restricted by a number of things within him that have not been dealt with. Suppose a new believer is illiterate. He knows that God gave him the Bible and that God can be contacted in the Bible. However, he is unable to use his spirit to touch the Spirit in the Bible, because he is restricted by his inability to read. This brother would need to expend a substantial amount of effort in order to learn to read so that he can read and understand the words in the Bible. This is the way for him to remove this restriction. When he begins to read, he will be able to touch the Spirit with his spirit. The sense in our spirit must pass through the other parts of our being. If we do not understand the words we read, we will not be able to comprehend the sense in our spirit. This means that the sense in our spirit must pass through our mind. Hence, it is difficult for a person who is limited in his ability to read to understand God&rsquo;s Word and to receive inspiration in his spirit; it is difficult for him to contact the Spirit.</p>
<p>Our inability to touch the Spirit when we read the Bible should help us realize that there are limitations within us. Now we will consider some limitations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Problems of Our Heart</h2>
<p>The first limitation we encounter is related to our heart. Our heart is rather complicated and has many problems. The first problem is a heart that veers toward something other than God. A person with such a heart will not receive inspiration. It is true that when we read the Bible, we must use our spirit to contact the Spirit. However, no matter how resolute we may be, as soon as our heart leans toward something other than God, we will not receive inspiration. Our heart must be adjusted; otherwise, there will be no enlightenment from the Spirit.</p>
<p>The second problem is having an indifferent heart. Although we may read the Bible, we may have an indifferent attitude toward God and His Word. When we are indifferent, our heart falls short in its pursuit of God&rsquo;s Word. Even though our heart may not lean toward things other than God, we may have no heart for God, be indifferent toward Him, and not care for the meaning of the words we read. In this situation we will not be able to understand the Bible. This principle is not relative but absolute.</p>
<p>The third problem is a divided heart. This means that a believer wants God, yet he does not want Him. It seems as if he has no heart for God, but he still has a little heart for God. It seems as though he does not obey God, but he does obey. Such a believer has many considerations other than God and always considers the price he must pay. This situation is what the Bible calls &ldquo;double-souled&rdquo; (James 1:8; 4:8), that is, having two souls. God made man with one soul, consisting of the mind, emotion, and will. A double-souled person has a divided heart, a heart that is both for God and for the world. A person with a divided heart wants God and also other things. He wants to touch God&rsquo;s Word, but at the same time he has no firm desire. Such a believer can be likened to a light switch with a loose connection. When the switch is pressed down firmly, the light turns on, but once you take your finger off the switch, the light goes off. Only when the connection is firmly secured, will the light stay on. When our heart is divided, there is constant turmoil in our spirit. Our experience confirms this fact.</p>
<p>The fourth problem is a heart that is not absolute. Our heart may be undivided, but it is not absolute; it is not steadfast or firm. This kind of heart tends to be light and idle. The depth of our contact with God depends on the absoluteness of our heart. Our spirit always follows our heart. When our heart is not absolute, our spirit has no way to go on. We must understand that as long as there is any reservation in our heart, our ability to contact God will be limited. Hence, we need to deal with our heart.</p>
<p>The fifth problem is an agitated heart, a heart that cannot be calm. We all have experienced this. When we are disturbed, when something has stirred up our heart or agitated us, our Bible reading is negatively affected. Whenever we are disturbed, it is difficult for us to touch God in the Bible. Our moods can be likened to ocean waves that are constantly billowing up and down. No matter how serious a matter is, we should exercise to stay calm and steady. No matter how much turmoil there is in our environment, we must learn to contact God in His Word and to keep our heart calm and undisturbed. Every Christian must learn this lesson. We receive more help when we contact God in the Bible.</p>
<p>The sixth problem is a heart with worries and cares. When we have a problem or when there is turmoil in our environment, our heart is in a state of flux. At this time we need words from the Bible to comfort us. We all have experienced this. Whenever we are worried about something, such as our family or our career, we can gain much benefit from reading the Bible. The words in the Bible comfort us and become our salvation. Whereas it is one thing to receive help and salvation from God, it is another thing to touch God in our spirit. Sometimes we receive help from the words we read, but we may not touch God with our spirit. Consequently, it is possible for some believers to receive comfort from the Bible when they are afflicted and worried; however, when the difficulty passes, not much of the element of God has been imparted into them. They might remember how God&rsquo;s words comforted or helped them during their affliction, but they do not seem to gain the element of God. They were comforted by the Bible, but they did not touch the Spirit with their spirit.</p>
<p>Many famous sayings and proverbs in the world can also give comfort in times of affliction. We experienced this before we were saved. These sayings and proverbs, however, did not contain God. The way that some saints receive benefit from the Bible in times of difficulty is not any different from the help they could receive from worldly sayings and proverbs. They do not receive the element of God; instead, they receive some intellectual enlightenment or psychological fortification. They do not touch God.</p>
<p>The function of the Bible is to supply us with God. If we can learn to contact God&rsquo;s words with our spirit, then no matter what our situation is, the element of God will be imparted into us. We will not only receive comfort from His words; when the difficult situation is over, the element of God will remain in us; we will be more intimately related to God and mingled with Him.</p>
<p>We must deal with these six problems of the heart. If we have even one of these conditions, our spirit will not be able to rise up to contact God. We must deal with the problems of our heart one by one. We must deal with a heart that leans toward things other than God, an indifferent heart, a divided heart, and a heart that is not absolute, not calm, and full of worries and cares. Then it will be easy for our spirit to contact the Spirit. There are still other situations that can limit us, but these six items cover most of the problems related to the heart.</p><h2 class="head2">The Problems of Our Mind</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Studying the Meaning of Words and Allegories</h2>
<p>Besides the problems related to our heart, we must also deal with the problems related to our mind. The first problem related to our mind is that we do not have adequate education. In a previous example we said that it is difficult for a believer who is illiterate to touch the Spirit in the Bible. One way for him to be delivered from illiteracy is to ask someone to read the Bible to him. However, this might not be the best way.</p>
<p>We must understand the meaning of the words used in the Bible. We should understand not only the Bible in Chinese but also numerous portions of the text in Hebrew and Greek. This understanding will help us to receive inspiration. The Chinese Union Version is a good translation, but in several places it needs to be improved because the meaning of the original text is not clear. It is difficult to translate the Bible. Even the books of poetry, such as the Psalms, are very difficult to translate. Hence, if we can understand the text in the original language, we will receive help. If we cannot understand what we read, we will not understand the sense in our spirit. The sense in our spirit passes through the understanding in our mind. If the sense cannot be interpreted in our mind, we cannot understand the sense.</p>
<p>In order to understand the Bible and touch the Spirit, we must spend time to study the words used in the Bible. I often use dictionaries and reference books. I have more than twenty reference books that I use to understand the meaning of a word. Although I do not know Greek well, I can consult reference books. One reference book focuses on how a particular word is used. Another book covers the common roots of a word and how it is derived. Still another reference book shows how a particular word was used in its historical setting or what its meaning was in a legal sense. Furthermore, a reference book may also say how many times a word is used in the New Testament and how it is translated in various places. Another reference book might speak of the spiritual meaning of a word in the Bible. We must spend an adequate amount of time to study these matters.</p>
<p>It is not possible for us to study every word used in the Bible in this way, but we must make an effort to study the crucial words so that we understand the deeper meaning and touch the Spirit. For example, the word <em>expiation</em> is used in the Old Testament (Exo. 29:33; 32:30; Lev. 1:4; 4:31; 5:16; 16:6). In the Chinese Union Version this word is translated as &ldquo;atonement.&rdquo; A believer who has not studied this word may think that since we committed sins and offended God, we need to pay a price to atone for our sins. However, if we study the word, we will discover that the root of this word in Hebrew means &ldquo;to cover.&rdquo; Hence, it is better to understand this word as &ldquo;sin-covering.&rdquo; The expiation, the covering of sins, accomplished through the sacrifices in the Old Testament points to the redemption accomplished by Christ in the New Testament.</p>
<p>The words <em>created</em> (Gen. 1:1; 2:4) and <em>formed</em> (v. 7) have different meanings. The words <em>righteousness, love</em>, and <em>mercy</em> also need to be studied in depth. If we understand the meaning of these words in the original text, the Bible will become a new book to us. The meaning of the Bible is conveyed in its words and depends on our understanding. If we do not understand a word, we cannot obtain a deeper meaning.</p>
<p>Here is another example. The New Testament uses at least three different words in Greek for the word <em>life.</em> One word, <em>bios,</em> refers to the physical life; the second word, <em>psuche,</em> refers to the soul-life; and the third word, <em>zoe,</em> refers to God&rsquo;s eternal life. There is a great difference in the meaning of these three words. We must devote adequate time to study such matters. The purpose of studying is to train our mind. If our mind is not properly trained, we cannot receive proper inspiration. The education of our mind is related to studying the words in the Bible.</p>
<p>Another matter that requires understanding is allegories. In order to properly read the Bible, we must use our spirit to touch the Spirit, and we must study the allegories in the Bible. For example, the book of Numbers concerns the Israelites&rsquo; being formed into an army, while the book of Deuteronomy concerns their daily living. In addition to understanding the words and phrases in the Bible, we also need to understand the allegories. We may understand the word <em>tithe</em> but not understand its allegorical usage or know that there are three kinds of tithe (Num. 18:21; Deut. 12:5-7; 14:28-29). If we do not understand the allegories in the Bible, we will not have a deeper understanding, nor will we receive much inspiration concerning these matters. If we understand the allegories in the Bible, we will understand the sense in our spirit when we contact the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>In order to receive the full benefit from the Bible, we must study the allegories in the Bible and contact the Spirit. This can be likened to a feast. On the one hand, we must not only obtain produce but also cook it. On the other hand, we also need to eat. When we touch the Bible, we eat God&rsquo;s words. If we are lazy and are not willing to rise early in the morning, that is, to purchase produce, we will have nothing to prepare, and our meal will consist of &ldquo;crackers&rdquo; and &ldquo;water.&rdquo; This shows that our problem is not a matter of eating but of preparing the food.</p>
<p>We must touch the Spirit with our spirit when we read the Bible. However, the question is whether we regularly study the Word. If we do not study, we will be confused when reading the genealogy in Matthew 1. We will not receive inspiration when we read verse 2. There is a pamphlet entitled <em>The Gleanings from the Genealogy of Christ.</em> If we are willing to spend half a day to study this pamphlet and to read verses 1 through 17, we will understand the genealogy. Then when we contact Matthew 1 with our spirit, we will receive inspiration. If we spend time to &ldquo;cook&rdquo; in this way, we will enjoy reading the Bible. The pamphlet <em>The Gleanings from the Genealogy of Christ</em> gives the spiritual significance of the genealogy of Christ.</p>
<p>When some saints read Exodus or Deuteronomy, they might not have received inspiration from phrases such as <em>the firstborn among the animals...whether it is an ox or a sheep</em> (Lev. 27:26), <em>give a tenth</em> (Deut. 14:22), or <em>the place which Jehovah your God will choose...to put His name</em> (12:5), because they were not educated concerning the allegories in the Bible. If they are willing to spend three to four months and to study Exodus according to this fellowship, they will be enlightened and nourished when they read it. If we are willing to study the Bible in this way, we will receive inspiration no matter what portion we read. This shows that we are educated not only concerning the meaning of words but also concerning the allegories.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must read the Bible and study the Bible; we need to be taught. If we do not understand the meaning of a chemical formula, we need to be taught in order to understand the many symbols and formulas. On the one hand, the Bible is simple, but on the other hand, it is a specialized book, which cannot be understood by a casual reader. We must be trained in the deeper meaning of the Bible. If we do not receive adequate education, we will not receive much inspiration when reading the Bible, and it will not be easy for our spirit to touch the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head3">Needing a Proper Mind</h2>
<p>In addition to being limited in our education, our mind is also improper. The majority of our problems are due to our fallen mind. Few people have a proper mind. Even psychologists say that most people have a slight mental problem. In spite of this, we need to use our mind. The Bible speaks of the renewing of the mind (Rom. 12:2). Our fallen mind is not proper; hence, it needs to be renewed. When some believers read the Bible, their mind travels everywhere without restraint. The kind of Bible that we have is determined by our person. This concerns the state of our mind. The kind of person we are determines the kind of mind we have, and the kind of mind we have determines the kind of Bible we read. If we desire to use our spirit and touch the Spirit in the Bible, we must look to the Lord for His mercy so that we would have a proper mind. Without a proper mind, we cannot receive proper inspiration; rather, we will receive strange inspiration.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Needing a Focused Mind</h2>
<p>Third, our mind needs to be focused, not scattered. A scattered and disturbed mind will prevent us from receiving inspiration. No one has a mind that is absolutely focused and undisturbed. However, our experience testifies that when we sit down to read the Bible, we have difficulty staying focused. That is the time when our mind travels from one place to another place. One minute it is set on one thing and the next minute it is set on something else. Although our eyes are looking at the Bible, our mind is somewhere else and is not focused on the words that we are reading. How can we receive inspiration under such circumstances? And how can we touch the Spirit? We must learn to focus our mind and to control our thoughts.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Needing a Clear Mind</h2>
<p>Fourth, our mind should be clear. Some saints have a mind that is proper but not clear; their mind is often confused. Some saints begin to daydream the moment they open the Bible, whereas others do not know what they read. For example, a brother may read about the Ark, but when he is asked about the dimensions of the Ark, he will speak about the bronze altar. When he is asked about the bronze altar, his response is related to the incense altar. Not many people have a clear mind. Most believers do not know the difference between Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. They think that these four books are more or less the same. This indicates that they do not have a clear mind.</p>
<p>In the New Testament Peter was often mentioned first among the apostles (Matt. 10:2; Mark 3:16; Luke 6:14; Acts 1:13). However, in Galatians James was mentioned first (2:9). If we read the Bible hastily without some consideration, we will miss this kind of detail. It is not so easy to find a believer who has a proper and clear mind. Some believers are very smart, but their mind is not proper. Some believers are well-behaved, but their mind is dull, not clear. Some believers do not have a proper or sharp mind because it has been damaged; hence, their thoughts wander and are not focused. These situations are the result of Satan&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Spending Time to Study the Bible</h2>
<p>The limitations related to our mind include not being educated, proper, focused, or clear. These problems hinder us from touching the Spirit when we read the Bible. In order to touch the Spirit, we must deal with these problems. We must learn the meaning of the words used in the Bible. We must set aside some time every day to contact God through reading the Bible, and we must spend sufficient time to study the Bible. We should not waste our time with idle talk, newspapers, or television. We must save our energy and our time in order to focus them on God and the Bible. We should spend three months to study Genesis and another three months to study Exodus. It would be good to study the first few books of the Bible in this way. Then we can spend time to study Joshua, the Kings, the Chronicles, and Psalms. This is not a waste of effort. To study the Bible thoroughly can be compared to purchasing produce and preparing meals. Then when we need to eat, the food we need will be prepared.</p>
<p>Some saints have not prepared anything, so when they come to the Bible, they have nothing to eat. When they come to Exodus 25 concerning the Ark, they do not understand it. They do not understand the meaning of acacia wood being overlaid with gold. This is indeed the case with some saints. As a result, they do not have much interest in reading the Bible. If we cannot understand the Bible, it is a loss to us.</p>
<p>We must spend time to study God&rsquo;s Word book by book. I hope that this message will reach all the churches and that all the saints will rise up to read, study, and understand God&rsquo;s Word. However, it is not enough to study the Bible; we must also eat every day. We must spend time to touch and contact God&rsquo;s Word every day. Our heart and our mind must be exercised so that we may understand the words and the allegories. Then it will be easy for our spirit to touch the Spirit. The apostle Paul was such a person. He was educated, and his mind was focused, proper, and clear. Regardless of which book in the Old Testament that he read, he was inspired, and his spirit touched the Spirit. Since his heart was dealt with and his mind was trained, it was easy for him to touch the Spirit in the Bible.</p><h2 class="head2">The Problem of Our Emotion</h2>
<p>Now we come to the emotions. In addition to the limitations related to our heart and our mind, we also experience limitations related to our emotion. Our emotion is different from our mind. Emotion refers to what we usually regard as our mood. When we are not in a good mood, it is difficult to be inspired when we read the Bible. Hence, we must learn to control and adjust our emotion, our mood. It is not possible to list all the problems related to our emotion. We can only say in a simple way that we need to keep our mood in a stable condition. No matter what happens to us, whether it is something joyful or something sorrowful, whether it is of great benefit to us or of no benefit to us, we need to keep our emotions stable. Furthermore, we need to learn to always set our emotion on God. This means that we must <em>love God.</em> When we set our emotion on God, no matter what happens to us, our emotion will be fixed on God. In everything we must learn to be calm, always maintaining composure.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Problem of Our Will</h2>
<p>Finally, we must consider the problem of our will. We need to ask ourselves whether we are resolved, determined to obey the Lord&rsquo;s commands. We should not make resolutions according to the worldly understanding. The worldly way of making a resolution is useless. In relation to the will, we must be firm and determined in our desire to obey the Lord. We love God, and we obey Him, not because we have made up our mind to do so but because we are firm and determined in our will. Furthermore, we would not depend on ourselves. Depending on ourselves to make a resolution will cause us to fail and will be a distraction to us. Although we have a determined will, we should never depend on ourselves.</p>
<p>We must depend fully on the Lord. The consequence of depending on our resolution, our will, is failure. If a brother relies on his will, his determination, he will be distracted when he reads the Bible, because he will become proud. Hence, our determination, our will, must not come from ourselves. Instead of depending on ourselves, we must depend on God in our resolution to love and obey Him.</p>
<p>We can set our will to depend on the Lord because we know that when He commands us to do something, He will accomplish it by coming to us and doing it in us. He comes to us to fulfill what He wants us to do. For this reason, we should not have any worries or fears. We have the faith to declare, &ldquo;Since God commands, He will accomplish it for me.&rdquo; Therefore, we must be resolute and determined in our will to stand with the Lord, just as Caleb and Joshua fully followed God (Num. 14:6-9, 24; Deut. 1:36; Josh. 14:14). Caleb fully followed God because he knew that God wanted the children of Israel to enter into the good land. He also knew that no matter how strong their enemies were, God would fight for them. Since God wanted them to enter the good land, He would accomplish everything for them. Caleb seemed to say, &ldquo;If we know that we are weak, God knows that we are weak. If we know that the seven Canaanite tribes are strong, God also knows that they are strong. Since God knows these things, He would not ask us to enter the land of Canaan unless He intends to fight on our behalf and destroy our enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are three things we must remember concerning having a resolute will: not depending on ourselves, depending only on God, and knowing that He will fulfill what He requires of us. His supply always meets His requirement. We must have this realization so that our resolution is of the spirit.</p>
<p>Another matter related to the resolution of our will is that we must say, &ldquo;Lord, since You want me to do this and You have commanded me to do it, I am willing to obey You even if I must lose everything, including my life.&rdquo; Our resolution must be so strong that we are willing to die in order to obey (Rev. 12:11). As long as we have received the Lord&rsquo;s words, we must be willing to die in order to obey. In other words, no sacrifice is too great, nor is there a price that is too high. Such a resolution means that we do not depend on ourselves but on God. Furthermore, we know that whatever God has said, He will fulfill. We are willing to obey Him even if we must pay a great price, such as death. Such a resolution of the will is a spiritual resolution.</p>
<p>I hope that the serving saints will deal with their heart, their mind, their emotion, and their will. On the one hand, we should use these faculties. On the other hand, we must learn to not come to the Bible only with our mind. Instead, we should contact the Spirit with our spirit. This is the way for us to see the fruit of our learning. Initially, it may not be easy. We might feel like a clumsy child who is learning to ride a bicycle. However, after we practice a few times, we will realize that this is the most efficient way to read the Bible. We must pray earnestly and follow the spirit. If we do not learn to follow the spirit, we will not learn to read the Bible properly.</p><h2 class="head1">KEEPING A TIME TO READ THE BIBLE DAILY</h2>
<p>The saints who serve full time in the Lord&rsquo;s work and the responsible brothers who take the lead in the churches should set aside a substantial amount of time every day in order to study the Bible. They must treat this matter seriously and be consistent. There have been times when a saint came to fellowship with me, but I told him that I did not have time because I was reading the Bible. I regard reading the Bible to be more important than anything else. In our daily living we should have a time to read the Bible. We should not consider reading the Bible as a pastime or think that other things are more important. Reading the Bible is indispensable and cannot be put aside. We must keep the time to read our Bible. There are letters that I have yet to reply to because I must spend time to read the Bible. I cannot put my Bible aside simply to reply to these letters. If our Bible reading is always being interrupted for various reasons, sooner or later we will discover that we have suffered a great loss. This is true especially for those who minister the word. If they do not spend an adequate amount of time to read the Bible, they should not expect their speaking to be rich and strong.</p>
<p>When we read Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, we sense that he was well versed in the Old Testament; hence, he was able to quote it skillfully and with ease. This is not our condition; hence, our messages are poor. Sometimes we do not have anything to say because we do not have a thorough knowledge of the Bible. Sometimes we see situations in the church, but we do not have the words to meet the need; we are not able to cause the saints to be open and vital. If our Bible reading is thorough, we will not only be able to meet every need; we will also be able to bring vitality to the church life through the enlightenment and revelation that we receive from the Bible. This is the way to lead the churches forward. For example, we should be able to spend three months to speak concerning the worship of the church as portrayed in Deuteronomy. As a result of such speaking, the saints would be led to pursue this kind of worship.</p>
<p>We must always use our spirit to contact the Spirit. As we learn the meanings of words in the Bible and study the allegories, deal with our heart, our mind, and our emotion, and receive some training, we will touch the Lord whenever we read the Bible. When we read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, using our spirit to contact the Spirit, we will be fed and satisfied; we will be inwardly watered and refreshed. Moreover, we will have the ability to experience this any time of the day.</p>
<p>When we use our spirit to contact the Spirit, we will gain a deeper understanding of the Bible. We will touch the desire of God&rsquo;s heart and receive fresh revelations. Reading the Bible by studying it and using the Bible to touch the Spirit are interdependent and support each other. If we consistently practice to study the Bible and to touch the Spirit in the Bible, we will gain a substantial understanding of the Bible. We will discover that the sections we never understood will become clear to us. We will be skilled in reading the Bible, and our mind will be trained to understand the sense in our spirit. Thus, the Bible will be an open book to us.</p>
<p>Not only so, the Bible will be a living book. We are not superstitious, but we will be able to say that whenever we contact the Bible, we touch God. Furthermore, we will not touch God in a superficial way; we will touch the desire of God&rsquo;s heart as well as His thoughts. He will open Himself to us through His words. This is the way to be persons who know the Bible and who receive the benefit of the Bible.</p></body></html>
