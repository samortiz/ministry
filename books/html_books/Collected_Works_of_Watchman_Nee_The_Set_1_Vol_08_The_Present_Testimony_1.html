In Chinese it is called Fu-shing, which means "revival." The first issue of fourteen hundred copies was published in January 1923 in Foochow. Its theme was specifically the deep things of God and was composed of messages on life with the Lord Jesus as the center, especially emphasizing His life, His crucifixion, His resurrection, His intercession, His Body, His coming back, and His kingdom. These messages were especially designed for the cultivation of the spiritual life and made no attempt to engage in intellectual debate.</P><P>"This magazine continued until 1925 when Watchman had the burden to publish The Christian. The publication of The Present Testimony was resumed in January 1928 in Shanghai. The following excerpts taken from his second testimony, given at Kulangsu on October 20, 1936, and his open letters reveal the purpose of the magazine and the reason for resuming its publication:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Before I became ill I not only visited various places to conduct special meetings, but I also had a great ambition to compose a good comprehensive commentary. I intended to devote much energy, time, and money in writing a large commentary consisting of about a hundred volumes. After completing The Spiritual Man, which I began in Nanking when I became ill, I realized that the task of expounding the Scriptures was not for me. However, since that time I have frequently met with temptation in this respect. After my illness, God revealed to me that the central point of the messages He gave me was not for expounding the Scriptures, preaching the ordinary gospel, paying attention to prophecies, or anything outward, but for laying stress on the living Word of life. For this reason I felt I should resume publishing The Present Testimony to assist God's children in spiritual life and warfare.</P><P>"We continue with a portion from his open letter from the twenty-fourth issue of The Christian, published in December, 1927:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>The Bible contains numerous teachings which ordinary believers cannot fully understand. Moreover, the testimony of the Lord is so incomparably great that we cannot receive and preach it completely. During the time of my waiting and praying, God committed to me the testimony which He wishes me personally to bear. I consider the book The Spiritual Man to be an outline of the special testimony which the Lord has committed to me. In the past years, day by day the hand of the Lord has become heavier upon me, forcing me to realize that He desires me to bear a special testimony for His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. There are many who have ordinary testimonies, but the Lord wants me to bear a special testimony for Him. Therefore, I am ready to give up the work of expounding the Scriptures, which thing I would like to do most, in order that I might bear the specific testimony which God has freshly committed to me. The wonderful thing about it is that the Lord is also leading all the brothers and sisters who are meeting and having fellowship in Shanghai in the same way. Hence, by means of the coming issues of The Present Testimony, according to what we have received from God, we shall specifically explain "the deep things of God" to the Body of Christ. We wholeheartedly desire to bear this unique testimony which the Lord has committed to us. We also fully realize that the Lord will raise up many other believers besides us to bear this testimony together. The more we walk on the spiritual path the more we realize the importance of the message of the cross. Believers today have failed because they have not allowed the cross to work deeply and destroy all the works of the flesh. There is still a mixture of the new and the old creation in the lives of believers, because the old creation has not yet been replaced by God. Such mixture always results in loss to the new creation. Correctness in outward behavior, excellence in church organization, increase in Bible knowledge, and exertion in God's work are all insufficient to guarantee against a mixture of the flesh within. On the contrary, the flesh can act freely in all these things and promote them with all its might. For this reason, the work of the cross annihilating the old creation is indispensable. Without the cross standing between the new and the old creations, a person's spiritual life is false, shallow, and superficial. Since a believer's life is always related to both "self" and the Lord, the cross must destroy the self so that the Lord can have His legitimate place. The time of the millennium will be the right time for the Lord to overcome Satan. Therefore, by the grace of the Lord we would remind the church of God that the Body of Christ must rise up to work with Him to bring in the kingdom. Our desire is that the enemy might soon be put to shame and that Christ might soon be glorified.</P><P>"In his open letter published in the first issue of The Present Testimony of January-April 1928, he said:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>We publish this little magazine because we have received the commission from God to help His children specifically in matters relating to spiritual life and warfare. In every age there is a unique truth especially needed for that period. For those of us living in these last days, there must also be some specific truth which we especially need. By means of The Present Testimony, we intend to bear testimony to the truth needed in this present age.</P><P>"The following words are taken from the open letter in the nineteenth issue of The Present Testimony of January-February 1931:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Some may think that the content of The Present Testimony is too deep and too specialized. However, many readers have written to us saying that while other magazines are greatly used by the Lord, The Present Testimony provides what the others do not. For this reason we are convinced that the command which we have received of the Lord is right. By the grace of the Lord, The Present Testimony will therefore continue to speak forth the deep things of God this year and in the years to come, the Lord willing.</P><P>"Publication of The Present Testimony was suspended following the thirty-sixth issue of July-August 1934 and was replaced by The Testimony in 1948. However, publication of The Present Testimony was resumed in January 1951." </P><P>(The above is quoted from Watchman Nee-A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age by Witness Lee, published by the Living Stream Ministry, 1991, pp. 225-228.)</P><P>In the Collected Works, we have included only the thirty-six issues of The Present Testimony printed since January 1928 because the earlier issues of 1923-1925 are not available to us. These thirty-six issues are divided into four volumes. Issue Nos. 1 through 18 are in Volume 8, Issue Nos. 19 through 23 are in Volume 9, Issue Nos. 24 through 31 are in Volume 10, and Issue Nos. 32 through 36 are in Volume 11. In Volume 11 we have added a few messages from the Third Overcomer Conference, which were not published in the original magazine, but which form part of the series of messages in that period.</P><P>We have included only those messages which were written by Brother Nee himself, plus a few editorials written on his behalf by Ruth Lee. We have not included any translated articles by writers such as Jessie Penn-Lewis, Evan Roberts, T. Austin-Sparks, etc. This latter category of translated works appeared more often in the earlier issues of the magazine; latter issues were almost exclusively Brother Nee's messages. To give the readers an idea of what was published in each issue of the magazine, we have included the table of contents of every issue of the magazine at the back of Volume 11.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN OPEN LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 1</H2><P>The time of the Lord's return is at hand. For this reason we are reevaluating many matters in the light of the judgment seat. Are there not many publications today? Why add another one, The Present Testimony? If it were not of the Lord and if there were no special reason for its existence, The Present Testimony would just be a tiring reiteration of things already said, and it would be completely useless to those who are truly men of God. We publish this little magazine because we have received the commission from God to help His children specifically in matters relating to spiritual life and warfare. In every age there is a unique truth especially needed for that period. For those of us living in these last days, there must also be some specific truth which we especially need. By means of The Present Testimony, we intend to bear testimony to the truth needed in this present age.</P><P>Therefore, within the narrow confines of these pages, we would not present anything except "the deep things of God." We intend to make no mention of other questions. All general teachings or the meanings of scriptural passages are good, but they are outside our scope. You should not, therefore, expect to find articles on these categories in The Present Testimony.</P><P>We are deeply convinced that the present time is a preparatory period. If the children of God are to become a harvest that God can reap, they must first become ripe (Mark 4:29). We may say that the time of rapture is at hand. But the most important question is whether or not the church is ready. The Lord Jesus was caught up after His crucifixion; therefore, how can the church take a different path? We deeply believe that in the last days God will lead His children into a deeper experience of the cross of His Son so that they might ascend to the heavens. God's goal today is to quickly perfect the Body of His Son and destroy His enemy in order that He might usher in His kingdom. We can say that all of God's purpose in this age is being hindered by the church. We firmly believe that within a short period of time, God will surely gather His children into oneness so that His church might cease to be an object of hindrance, but rather would work together with God to accomplish His eternal ordination. We humbly desire that we might have a little part in this glorious work under God's hand.</P><P>All those who have eyes can easily recognize the darkness of the present age. It is heartbreaking to realize that if God's children were to rid themselves of all that is "of man," there would scarcely be anything left that is "of God." What is most apparent today is men's doings. Even in many good works which are considered to be spiritual, how much is there that is really God's own doing? The most pitiful thing is that many works which are done "for the Lord," "in the name of the Lord," "for the Lord's kingdom," and "for the church of Christ" are but activities of men's corrupted flesh. They are done by men without seeking the Lord's will, without listening to His command, and without trusting in the strength of God. The Lord's children do things merely according to what they think is good. Today, they have everything but God. Their thinking, planning, and working have replaced God. If the Lord's children do not turn back, they will find that they have no spiritual usefulness. They will damage the work of God and suffer loss themselves.</P><P>We know that we are unworthy; but by the grace of God, we would be faithful. We hope that the readers of these pages will not read with a critical spirit or with the intention of exploitation. If they have a humble heart and a prayerful spirit, they will inevitably receive some benefit. All that we write has but one aim: that the reader will give himself wholly to God in the new creation and become a person useful in the hands of God. Now we wholeheartedly commit our writing, our readers, and ourselves to God, who preserves men forever, and we hope that His Spirit will guide us into all His truths.</P><P>Watchman Nee<br>January 1928</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WHAT IS PRAYER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 1</H2><P>Prayer is the most wonderful action in the spiritual realm; it is also the most mysterious matter.</P><P>Prayer is a mystery. After we present a few questions concerning prayer, we will see how mysterious prayer is. These questions are hard to answer. But this does not mean that the mystery of prayer is unknowable or that the questions concerning prayers are unanswerable. It merely means that those who have the answers are few. For this very reason, there are few who can accomplish works for God in prayer. It is not a matter of how much we pray, but a matter of how much we have prayed according to the principle of prayer. Only those prayers that are prayed according to the principle of prayer are worthwhile.</P><P>The first question we will ask is: why should we pray? What is the use of praying? God is omniscient and omnipotent. Why would He work only after we pray? Since He knows everything, why do we have to tell Him anything (Phil. 4:6)? Since He is almighty, why would He not do it by Himself? Why does He need us to pray? Why is it that only those who pray receive, and those who seek find, and those who knock enter (Matt. 7:7)? Why does God say, "You do not have because you do not ask" (James 4:2)?</P><P>After asking the above questions, we also want to ask: is prayer contrary to the will of God? What is the relationship between prayer and justice?</P><P>We know that God does not do anything that is contrary to His will. If it is His will to open the door, why does He have to wait until we knock before He will open? Why would He not open the door for us according to His will, without us knocking? He knows everything. If He knows that we need an open door, why will He wait until we knock before He opens? If the door should be open, if it is God's will that there is the open door, and if God knows that we need to have the door open, why does He not just open the door? Why do we have to knock? What convenience does it give to God for us to knock on the door?</P><P>We also have to ask: Since God's will is to open the door, and since it is His will to have the door open, will God not open the door if we do not knock? Will He allow His will and His justice to be delayed and not accomplished just for the sake of waiting for our prayer? Will He allow His will of opening the door to be limited by our not knocking on the door?</P><P>If this is so, then God's will is restricted by us! Is God really omnipotent? If He is, why can He not open the door independent of us? Why must He wait for us to knock before He will open the door? Will God really accomplish His will? If He will, why does the opening of the door (His will) have to be controlled by our knocking on the door (prayer)?</P><P>After we have asked these questions, we will see that prayer is indeed a great mystery. Here we can see a principle of God's work. This principle is that God's people have to pray before God will rise up to work. God's will is accomplished by the prayer of those who belong to Him. The believers' prayers accomplish God's will. God will not accomplish His will alone; He will only accomplish His will when His people are sympathetic with Him in prayer.</P><P>If this is the case, prayer is nothing but the believers' act of working together with God. Prayer is the union of the believers' will with God's will. The prayer of the believers on earth is an utterance of God's will in heaven. Prayer is not an utterance of our own wishes, a plea for God to yield to our cry and fulfill our own wishes. Prayer is not to compel God to change His will by force or ask Him to do what He does not want to do. Prayer is the believers' utterance of God's will out of their own mouth; it is the believers' request before God that He accomplish His own will.</P><P>Prayer does not change what God has ordained. Prayer never changes anything. Prayer only accomplishes what God has ordained. On the contrary, the lack of prayer and the absence of prayer changes things. When God's people do not work together with God, He will allow many of the things ordained by Him to be delayed and not be fulfilled.</P><P>"Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven" (Matt. 18:18). These two sentences are very familiar to us. But they refer to prayer. This is why following this, it says, "Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens" (v. 19).</P><P>This passage explains clearly the relationship between prayer and God's work. God in heaven will only bind and loose what His children on earth have bound and loosed. Many things that God should bind, He will not bind alone; instead He wants His people to bind them on earth first, and then He binds them in heaven. Many things that should be loosed, God will not loose them alone; instead He has to wait for His people to loose them on earth before He will loose the same for them in heaven. Every action in heaven is directed on the earth! All the moves in heaven are restricted on the earth! God is willing and happy to let all of His works be managed by His people. (I am not saying such words to fleshly persons, for they are not qualified to hear such words. We should listen carefully, lest the flesh comes in, and we offend God even more.) In Isaiah there is one passage which says the same thing as it says here: "Thus says Jehovah, / The Holy One of Israel and the One who formed him, / Ask Me about the things to come... / And concerning the work of My hands, command Me" (45:11). When we read this, we should be fearful and not allow the flesh to come in. God wants us-the humble human beings-to command Him! His work is carried out through our commanding. Whether it be binding or loosing, all of God's work in heaven is carried out according to our command on earth.</P><P>It must first be bound on earth before heaven will bind. It must be loosed on earth before heaven will loose. God will not do anything against His will. It does not mean that when something is bound on earth God will be forced to bind what He does not want to bind. God in heaven is binding what has been bound on earth because He has already intended to bind what has been bound first on earth. He is waiting all the time. When His people on earth bind what He in heaven intends to bind, He will follow their command and bind according to their requests. The fact that God is willing to follow His people's command to bind what they are binding shows that it has been God's will all along-which is eternal-to have such things bound.</P><P>Then why will God not bind such things sooner? Since it is His will to bind and since His will is eternal, why will He not bind what should have been bound long ago according to His will? Why does He have to wait until they are bound on earth before He will bind in heaven? Does it mean that He will not bind in heaven if it has not been bound on earth? Does it mean that when the binding on earth is delayed He will also delay the binding in heaven? Why is it that what God has desired to bind for a long time will only be bound when it is bound on earth?</P><P>If a believer can answer these questions, he will become more useful in the hands of God. We know that God created man for the purpose that man would become one with Him to destroy Satan and his works. Man has a free will, and God's intention is that man would will to join his will to God to oppose the will of Satan. This is the purpose of creation; it is also the purpose of redemption. The life of the Lord Jesus demonstrates this. Although we do not know the reason, we know that God would not act independently. If God's people would not sympathize with Him, if they would not subject their wills, and if they would not express their oneness with God in their prayer, God would rather delay and sit back, than do anything alone. God has shown great honor to His people to allow them to work with Him. Although He is omnipotent, He loves to be restricted by His children. Although He is zealous for His own will, He would rather allow Satan's evil plots to run rampant, if His people neglect His will and do not sympathize with Him or work with Him. Oh! If God's children will not be as cold as they are now, and if they will be willing to stop themselves, to submit to God's will, to care for God's glory, and to keep His word more, God's eternal purpose concerning what He intends to accomplish in this age will be fulfilled much sooner. The church also would not be in so much confusion, sinners would not be so stubborn, the Lord Jesus would return sooner, the kingdom of heaven would descend sooner, Satan and his hosts would be cast into the abyss sooner, and the knowledge of Jehovah would spread over the earth sooner. It is because believers care too much for themselves and do not work with God that so many enemies and so much lawlessness remain unbound, and so many sinners and so much grace are not loosed. Oh, heaven has been too restricted by men on earth! Brothers, God has entrusted so much to us. Do we trust in God in the same way?</P><P>How do we bind what God intends to bind? How do we loose what God intends to loose? The Lord's answer is to ask "in harmony." This is the meaning of prayer, and this is the prayer of the Body. The highest point of our working together with God is to ask in one accord for God to accomplish what He intends to accomplish. The true meaning of prayer is for the praying one to seek for the accomplishment of the will of the One to whom he prays. Prayer is an indication that we want God's will. It is to say that our will is standing on God's side. Without this kind of prayer, there is no real prayer.</P><P>How many prayers today are for the expression of God's will? How many prayers are a setting aside of oneself and a seeking for the accomplishment of God's will? How many believers are there who truly work together with God in prayer? How many believers echo back to God His heart's desire daily before Him and empty out their hearts to seek after God and to ask for God to accomplish what they understand as God's will? Oh! Let us realize that a selfish heart is no less prominent in prayer than in other things! How many of our own requests are standing in the way! How numerous are our own wills, our own desires, our own plans, and our own cravings! With so many things of our own, it is difficult to expect that we can forget about ourselves completely in prayer and seek after God's will alone. One should, of course, deny the self in everything, and to deny the self in prayer is as important as to deny the self in our walk. We should know that as saved ones we should live unto the Lord who died and resurrected for us. Therefore, we should henceforth live completely unto Him, not reserving anything for ourselves. Among all the things in our life of consecration, prayer should also be one consecrated item. One great and common error in our thoughts is to consider that prayer is an expression of our needs and that prayer is but our cry to God for help. Little do we realize that prayer is to ask God to fulfill His need. We have to realize that God's intention is not for the believers to accomplish their will through prayer. God's intention is to accomplish His own will through the believers' prayer. This does not mean that believers should not ask God to fulfill their needs. It only means that believers should first understand the meaning and principle of prayer.</P><P>Every time believers have a lack, they should first ask whether or not such a lack will affect God. Is it God who ordains that they have such a lack? Or is it God's will that they be supplied? Only after one has seen that it is God's will that his needs be met, should he pray for God to accomplish His will (with regards to meeting his need). Only after one has understood God's will, should he pray for the will of God which he has understood and ask that God's will be accomplished. The question now is not whether or not you have a lack or that you need to be supplied. The question now is whether or not God's will is accomplished. Although your prayer may be the same as before, your attention is turned to the accomplishment of God's will in such matters and not to the fulfilling of your own needs. Here lies the failure of many. Believers think that their own needs are the priority. Even after they have understood that God's will is to supply their need, they still pray tenaciously for their own needs. We should never pray for our own needs. There is only one legitimate prayer in the whole universe-only one prayer that pleases God-the prayer that asks for the accomplishment of His will. Our needs must be lost in God's will. Whenever we see God's will concerning our need, we have to drop our need immediately to seek after the accomplishment of God's will. A direct prayer for the fulfilling of needs (whatever kind of need it may be) is never the noblest prayer. All prayers for personal needs should only be made indirectly while one is seeking for the accomplishment of God's will. This is the secret to prayer, and this is the secret to victory in prayer.</P><P>God's goal is that we be filled with His will to such an extent that we forget our own interest. God wants us to work together with Him to accomplish His will. The way to work together with Him is to pray. For this reason He wants us to abide in Him to learn His will in various matters and then ask according to His will.</P><P>Genuine prayer is a real work. Prayers that are according to God's will and which ask for God's will to be done are a work of dying to the self. We must be weaned from the self completely, that is, we must not have a bit of self-interest. We must live completely to God and only seek after His glory. Then we will like what He likes, pursue what He pursues, and pray what He wants us to pray. Indeed, it is difficult enough not to have any self-interest in working for God. It is even more difficult not to have any self-interest in praying for God's will. One who would live completely to God must be so.</P><P>In the past generations, God could have done many things and, in fact, would have liked to have done many things, but because His children did not work together with Him, He did not perform them. It was not God who failed, but His people. If we review our entire personal life, we will see the same story. Had we only had greater faith and more prayer, our life would not have been so. Today God is seeking that His children would be willing to be one with His will and through prayer proclaim this kind of union. No believer has ever fully experienced the greatness of being completely one with God's will.</P><P>Once a servant of the Lord said well that "prayer is the railroad track of God's work." What tracks are to a train, prayer is to God's will. A locomotive does have great power and ability; it is able to run thousands of miles in one day. But if there are no tracks, the locomotive will not be able to move one inch. If it tries to move one inch, it will sink into the mud. It can go everywhere except where no tracks have been laid by man. This is the relationship between prayer and God's work. We do not need to explain in detail. The meaning of the illustration should be obvious to all. Indeed, God is almighty. No one can oppose His work. However, if you and I do not work together with Him in prayer or prepare the way for His will through prayer or by means of all prayer allow Him the possibility to move in many directions, He will not work and cannot work. Today locomotives cannot pass through many places in interior China. It is not because their engines have no power, but because there are no tracks on which to run. God wills and wants and even delights to do many things. But because His children do not express their sympathy with Him or pray to open the way for Him, He is limited. All of us who are fully consecrated to God should consider if we are daily limiting Him.</P><P>Thus, our most important work is to open the way for God. There is no other work more important than this. With God there are many possibilities. But if we do not open the way for Him, all will become impossibilities. Therefore our prayers in one accord with God should increase more than ever. Let us pray thoroughly-let us pray on all sides-so that God's will will reach all directions. No doubt our activities among men are important. But before God, working together with Him by prayer is even more important.</P><P>To pray does not mean to change the mind of heaven. It is the greatest mistake to think that God is hard and stubborn and that we must use prayer to battle with Him until He yields to us and changes what He has predetermined. Actually, any prayer that is not according to God's will is useless. Because God's will has suffered a hindrance from either men or demons, we come before God (as if we are wrestling with Him), asking that He execute His will and that His (predetermined) will not suffer through hindrances to His "permitted will." If we really desire God's predetermined will and if we have such prayer, such wrestling with God, and such resisting of any hindrance to His will, it will cause Him to carry out His predetermined will, not allowing anything of men or demons to (temporarily) come in the way. It is true that it appears that we are wrestling with God. Actually, this is for the accomplishment of His will. It is not that we have a certain idea and are trying to change His will. For this reason, unless we really know what God's will is, we shall not be able to work together with God in prayer.</P><P>Dear brothers, once we know the true meaning of prayer, we have to be careful not to allow the flesh to speak anything. O dear ones, if God will send laborers by Himself, the Lord would not have told us to ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers! If His name will automatically be hallowed, if His kingdom will come without our cooperation, and if He will cause His will to be carried out on earth by Himself, He would not have taught us to pray this way. If He will come again without the need for the sympathy of the church, His Spirit would not have inspired the apostle to ask Him to come quickly again. If God the Father will automatically cause His believers to be one, there would not have been the need for the Lord to pray such a prayer. If the cooperation of God and man is not important, what is the point of Christ interceding in heaven continuously today? O dear ones, praying in sympathy with God is more important than doing anything else. He can only work on matters in which His children sympathize with Him. He is not willing to work where there has been no prayer, where He does not have His people's will in union with Him. This union of the wills is real prayer. Obtaining an answer to prayer is not the highest goal of prayer. The purpose of prayer is that we be one with God's will so that God can work. When our will is one with God, even though we may at times ask amiss and our prayer is not answered, God still receives the benefit because He is able to work as a result of our sympathy with Him.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE END OF THE AGE<br>AND THE KINGDOM</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 1</H2><P>We deeply believe that we have come to the end of the age. We know that after the age of the church is the age of the kingdom. We have said in other places that God's eyes are turned to the kingdom and concentrated on the kingdom. If we understand correctly, we deeply believe that in His eternal purpose He is earnestly trying to bring in the kingdom. The church is for the kingdom.</P><P>After servants of God see the position the kingdom occupies in God's eternal purpose, how willing are we to see the kingdom come quickly, and how eager are we to see all of God's children working with God to bring in this kingdom quickly! By receiving more new light, we become even more zealous for God's kingdom. The one verse that we have received is Matthew 24:14, which says, "And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come."</P><P>Here we see the relationship between the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom and the coming of the end. It is hard to understand all that this verse says, and in the past, among God's children, many contentions have arisen from this verse. I do not wish to debate about anything here, for we can never arrive at the same understanding anyway. However, we can speak about the clear light that we have received.</P><P>"The end" refers to the end of this age. Strictly speaking, according to the study of prophecy, it refers to great trial. This short period of great trial, "the great tribulation," will end our present age. The age of the Holy Spirit, the age of the church, the age of grace, and the age of the gospel are the various names given to this age. The age designated by these names will be terminated by "the great tribulation," which is "the end."</P><P>Before we go on, we have to know that the rapture is not determined at "the end" time, for believers can be raptured at any time. The great tribulation has to do with this age, but the great tribulation is not directly related to the church.</P><P>The church is responsible for working together with God to bring in His kingdom. At the same time, God's kingdom will only appear physically at the end time. For this reason, the church has to pay attention to the end time. The end has to come before the kingdom can come. Hence, in order for the kingdom to come, the end must first come. The end itself is not related to the church, but it has much to do with the work of the church.</P><P>The Lord Jesus said that only after the gospel of the kingdom has been preached will the end of this age come. In other words, the gospel of the kingdom must spread before the kingdom can come. The Lord Jesus is speaking of the condition that is necessary for this age to end quickly and the kingdom to come. He is also prophesying of the situation towards the end of this age and the coming of the kingdom. Indeed, if this age is to end, God's children must testify afresh for the gospel of the kingdom. At the end of this age, we must see the revival of the gospel of the kingdom.</P><P>The recent decades can be considered as a period of revival in the teaching concerning the kingdom. In particular, during the past few years, the Lord has turned His children in China to pay attention to the matter of God's kingdom. This is the best sign.</P><P>But what is God's kingdom, and what is the gospel of the kingdom? Our common understanding is that the kingdom is the time when Christ and the church reign. Actually, there is a deeper significance than this.</P><P>Many people want to make a distinction between the gospel of the kingdom and the gospel of grace. Actually this is not all that necessary. If our readers think that there should be such a distinction, we can say that the gospel of grace is particularly for the sinners, while the gospel of the kingdom is particularly to deal with the demons. The gospel of grace  refers to sin and blessing, while the gospel of the kingdom refers to the oppression of Satan.</P><P>There are many ideas today about the kingdom. Let us look at what the Lord Jesus said: "But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you" (Matt. 12:28). The kingdom means many things, but what the Lord says here is the most important meaning.</P><P>The kingdom has a great deal to do with Hades. The Lord Jesus said that the kingdom is the casting out of the demons, that is, the activity of the Spirit of God in casting out the demons. This is the proper meaning of the kingdom. One big lack in the present-day Bible expositions is the negligence concerning Hades. The church, in its position, work, thought, and speaking, has often forgotten that its unique enemy is Satan. It does not realize that God has chosen the church for the purpose of opposing Satan and bringing in the kingdom of God. This is why the first time the church is mentioned in the New Testament, it is linked with Hades (see Matthew 16).</P><P>The time of the kingdom will be for a thousand years. What does this one thousand years have to do with Satan? The first few verses in Revelation 20 tell us that this will be the time when Satan himself will be bound in the abyss (vv. 1-3). This will be the time when Satan is disgraced the most.</P><P>"Do you not know that we will judge angels?" (1 Cor. 6:3). Those who have not sinned need not be judged. Only those who have sinned need be judged. In the future the church will judge the angels who have sinned. These angels who have sinned joined Satan to rebel against God. They are the principalities and powers today, the princes of the kingdom in Daniel 10:13. God said that we will judge them. When will we judge them? We will judge them when Christ comes again to set up His kingdom (Rev. 20:4).</P><P>This is the kingdom. The kingdom is the time when Satan is in the abyss. The kingdom is the time when the principalities and powers are judged. The power of Hades will be destroyed at the time of the kingdom. At the time of the kingdom, the "sons" under Satan's hand, who are the beast and the "spirit," the false prophet, will be thrown into the lake of fire. All the other countless evil spirits will be driven out of the world and will be imprisoned. Satan himself will be openly put to shame and spend one thousand years in a life of darkness in the abyss. That will be the time of disintegration for the household of Satan. It will be the time of the kingdom. It will also be the time for God's children to be vindicated, the time when the cross of God will gain the total victory. It will be the time when God's purpose concerning Satan, which was purposed in eternity past, will be fulfilled. It will be the time for Isaiah 14 to be fulfilled. That will be the time of the kingdom. In this kingdom Satan will have no more power.</P><P>The gospel of the kingdom of heaven is nothing but God (who rules in heaven today) ruling the earth and completely casting away the ruler of this present world together with his messengers and evil spirits, so that man (i.e., Christ and the church) can rule on God's behalf.</P><P>The gospel of the kingdom of heaven is aimed particularly toward the power of darkness. When the Lord Jesus first preached the gospel of the kingdom of heaven, all His works were aimed at dealing with the power of darkness. "The Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil" (1 John 3:8). He healed the sick and cast out the demons. The casting out of the demons is surely an annulling of the power of darkness. But what about healing the sick? The apostle gave us a footnote to healing: "Healing all those who were being oppressed by the devil" (Acts 10:38). If we study the Gospels carefully, we will see that throughout His life, the Lord Jesus was destroying the work of the devil. Hence, His work in this world produced more effect on the demons than on men.</P><P>The Lord Jesus said that at the end time, some of His children will rise up to bear this testimony. We thank the Lord that during the past few years, quite a number of God's children have risen up to wage war against Satan. Spiritual warfare is no longer just a term; it has become a reality that is experienced by many believers. Truly we are at the end of this age.</P><P>Brothers, if we want to see God's kingdom come, so that God's rule is manifested in this world, and the devil and his government cast out, we have to stand up to testify for the gospel of the kingdom of heaven. In other words, we have to bear testimony to the victory of the cross of Christ. We should declare that Christ has judged the prince of this world, that He is fully victorious, that the kingdom, glory, and power are all His, and that Satan, who has no further place in this present age, is occupying it illegally. Everyone who has accepted the Lord Jesus has been delivered from the power of darkness and has entered the kingdom of His beloved. We should preach the gospel of the kingdom of heaven, the gospel of the casting out of the demons, the gospel of the defeat of Satan, and the gospel of the destruction of Hades. This kind of testimony will bring this age to a close. This age is the age of the church because the church appears only in this age. But at the same time, the Bible calls this age "an evil and adulterous generation" (Matt. 12:39), an "unbelieving and perverted generation" (17:17), and "a crooked and perverted generation" (Phil. 2:15). God's purpose is to draw this age to an end. God desires that the end of this age come quickly so that His kingdom can follow. However, God's children have a duty to perform. God's children should work together with God to bring this age to a close. Prayer is one way, but testimony is also indispensable. Dear ones, we should stand up in an unprecedented way for the kingliness of the Lord Jesus Christ, and we should testify in an unprecedented way for His government. The kingdom of Antichrist will come before the kingdom of Christ. We should testify for the kingdom of Christ before the coming of the kingdom of Antichrist. We should bring this age to its end.</P><P>This is not a new gospel, but one that has been neglected by the church. The apostles preached this gospel-Acts 14:22 and 28:23 testify to this. Furthermore, after the Lord Jesus resurrected, He preached this topic to them. If we want to be the true successors to the apostles, we have to bear the testimony that the apostles bore. The church has forgotten about the victory, majesty, and kingship of Christ. Those who dare to testify that "only Christ is the king" and that "Satan is not the king" are the ones who are truly preaching the gospel of the kingdom of heaven.</P><P>Brothers, we should not be ones who have fallen behind in this age! There is only one gospel today which matches this age. We are not saying that we should not preach anything else; we are merely saying that God wants us to pay special attention to this. We must catch up with all that God has ordained for this age. God's emphasis in this age is the expatriation of Satan and the triumph of His Son. If we are not one with God in this matter and do not pay attention to what God pays attention to, we are not accomplishing God's eternal will, no matter how much work we have done. We are too far off from God's best! What we need today are Christians who match this age. God needs to gain a group of people who will sympathize with Him, who will work with Him, who will bring this age to a close, and who will bring God's kingdom in. If Christians think that their highest responsibility in this world is to save souls (which is a glorious work, and we have no intention to despise it), and they merely save souls for the sake of saving souls, they have not accomplished God's highest goal. They have to realize that they have a greater responsibility in this world than saving souls, which is to bring this age to an end and to usher in God's kingdom. Their greatest responsibility lies in the destruction of God's enemy together with all the powers of darkness. They must see that all their work should have this as their final goal. Prayer is not for prayer alone; it is to inflict a loss on Satan. Saving souls is not for saving souls alone; it is for the infliction of loss on Satan. Whatever we do, it is done with a view to inflict a loss on Satan. We do not despise the work of saving souls; but we should not lose sight of the kingdom in saving souls. Those who always put God's kingdom before them-that which touches God's will and His enemy-are the most useful workers in the hands of God.</P><P>Why will the end come when God's children testify for the kingdom of heaven in this way? Here again we see the cooperation between God and man. God desires that the end come. But unless God's children work together with Him to oppose this age and insist on the coming of God's age (the kingdom), God would rather delay. When His children truly hate the condition of this age and truly seek for His termination of this age and His giving of the kingdom, He will rise up to work. When God's children rise up to testify for the gospel of the kingdom of heaven, they will want what God wants and hate what God hates; their will will become one with God's will, and God will rise up to work. We should never think that the end will come by itself. If we reject God's will, it is possible to hinder His will. God is waiting for those who are one with Him and who will work with Him so that He can bring this age to an end. Who is willing to participate in such a great work?</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE DAWN OF REVIVAL</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 2</H2><P>After the February conference, we naturally were praying and waiting for God's further leading. Thank the Lord that through paying a price, some brothers and sisters have advanced further. Although they have lost their position, fame, and benefits, they feel that they are released from a heavy burden. This does not mean that they have been brought to an easier environment. On the contrary, they feel more lonely and experience more hardship. Nevertheless, they experienced the struggle at least once, and then declared that they will not yield to the flesh and to Satan, but will yield to God alone.</P><P>Other than what God has revealed to us and the things with which He has burdened us, we dare not trust in any of our work, and we dare not do anything. The Lord has wonderful provisions for the need in the work. We could never imagine that one believer in South Africa would send in money to help us in the printing of the Little Flock Hymnal! We could never imagine that the printing cost of other written testimonies would be covered by the offerings of believers who are not so wealthy!</P><P>Since such a testimony is new, it is bound to arouse misunderstanding. Yet we are comforted in the realization that those who are truly seeking have been released through the Lord's truth.</P><P>Some sisters among us are going to testify for the truth that the Lord commissioned us with in the Amoy area. Those who sojourn in Shanghai are continuing with the written testimony, and they are also waiting for God's further leading.</P><P>One cannot exhaust speaking about the peril of this age and let down his guard against it. We are striving onward by the one dawning ray of revival. We do not intend to have any great work. However, we would dread to give up and turn back through the weakness of the flesh! We maintain that if a person walks in God's will, God will never fail. All we ask from ourselves is faithfulness!</P><P>We thank God that He has opened up many doors for preaching the Word. Although we cannot accept all of the invitations, we know that when God's time comes, He will direct us to cast the net in the deep waters. May we lose track because of the calls from all around.</P><P>Watchman Nee<br>May, 1928</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>MAN'S FIRST SIN</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 2</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:9, 16-17; 3:4-8</H1><P>Today we want to see how mankind sinned the first time. This will serve as a warning to us. As the first sin was, so also are all the sins to follow. As Adam sinned, so we likewise sin. The sin that Adam committed is the same sin that we commit. If we understand how the first sin was committed, we can understand how all the sins are committed in the world because, according to the Bible, there is only one principle concerning sin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ONE PRINCIPLE CONCERNING SIN</H2><P>With all sins,  the word self  is always connected to them. Today men divide sins into many, many categories. It is difficult to say how many millions of categories there are. But in summary, there is only one sin-all thought and conduct which have something to do with "self" are sins. In other words, all the sins in the world, though many in number, are based on just one principle. Sinning is being for the self. All the sins are due to self. If there were no self, there would be no sin.</P><P>What is pride? Pride is nothing but the exalting of the self. What is envy? Envy is nothing but the intolerance of others being over the self. Why does one strive? Striving is for the self. Why does one become angry? It is because the self has been hurt. What is fornication? It is nothing but acting according to the self's lusts. What is cowardice? It is nothing but caring for the self's weaknesses. There are millions of other kinds of sins that we cannot enumerate. If we examine each one of them, we will see that the underlying principle is always the same: every sin always has something to do with the "self." There is not a single sin that is not associated with the self. Where there is sin, the self must be acting. Where there is the self's activity, there is sin before God.</P><P>If we examine the fruit of the Spirit, which is the virtues of the believers, we will see that they are the behavior that is apart from the self. What is love? Love is not caring for the self but loving others. What is joy? Joy is not looking at the self but hoping in God. Patience is ignoring the self's afflictions. Peace is not caring for the self's losses. Kindness is not remembering the self's right. Meekness is not thinking of the self's merits. Self-control is controlling the self. Faithfulness is to be self-regulating. If we look at all the virtues of the believers one by one, we will see that there is no virtue in a believer except what is apart from the self and not caring for the self. There is only one principle to the fruit of the Spirit-complete renunciation of the self.</P><P>I have only mentioned a few sins and virtues, and we have already seen that sin is simply the pursuit of the self, while virtue is the forgetting of the self. If we have more time, we can examine the differences between all the sins and virtues in our daily living to see if their differences actually lie in their relationship with the self. Brothers, let me tell you truly: other than "selflessness," there is no other virtue; while other than the "self," there are no other sins. Our self is the root of all sins.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SIN COMMITTED BY ADAM</H2><P>The verses we just read tell us that there were two trees in the midst of the garden and that Adam brought sin into the world by eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Now we want to take a look at these two trees. I want to use one word to represent each tree. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies independence, while the tree of life signifies dependence. Let us first take a look at the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</P><P>The first thing we should understand is that eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil does not just involve heinous sins. Adam did not fornicate, neither did he murder, nor did he commit many dirty sins. He merely ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. What Adam did was not a horrible sin. But just by eating once of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he brought about his own fall, his descendants' fall, and caused the whole world to be filled with sins. Although the sin committed by him was not the most defiling one, nevertheless, the most defiling sins came out of this "not-so-defiling" sin. According to our concept, the first sin committed by mankind, which was the mother of all the sins to follow in the world, must have been extremely defiling. However, what we see is simply a man who ate a fruit which he should not have!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FIRST SIN</H2><P>God considers the sin committed by Adam as a pattern of the countless sins that mankind would later commit. God wants us to understand that the nature of Adam's sin is the nature of the thousandfold worse sins that men have committed since. God wants us to understand that outwardly some sins may be refined and others may be coarse, but their nature and principle are always the same. Adam's sin was going along with his self-will. Since God forbade him from eating the tree, Adam should have ignored his self-will and obeyed. But Adam ignored God's command and ate according to his self-will. By this, he committed sin. His sin was acting apart from God according to his self-will. Although his descendants' sins are quite different in form from his  (because no man can commit Adam's sin again), in principle they are the same because they involve acting according to the self-will.</P><P>Is it really a sin to have the knowledge of good and evil? God also knows good and evil (Gen. 3:5, 22)! Is it a sin to be like God? Is it not good to pursue the knowledge of good and evil? Is it not good to pursue being like God? Yet this is the very root of man's sin and trouble. Why is this? Truly this is the best kind of pursuit, but God did not command us to do this, neither did He promise us this. Adam was trying to gain this knowledge apart from God and by his own self-effort. Therefore, it was a sin. Brothers, do you see the word independence here? All independent acts are sins. Adam did not trust in God, nor did he deny himself to obey God; rather, he acted alone, apart from God, and declared independence from God by trying to gain the knowledge of good and evil. God said this was his sin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHAT IS SIN?</H2><P>Dear saints, please see this clearly! Sinning is by no means just committing many dirty and horrible acts. In God's eyes, all activities apart from Him are sins. "To be like God" is certainly a good thing, but when we do not obey God's command and wait on Him, even the desire "to be like God" is, in God's eyes, a sin. We all consider evil things as sin and good things as righteousness. However, God does not look at it this way. He does not contrast good with evil; rather, He cares for the way a thing is done. Anything done without seeking His heart's desire, waiting for His arrangement, or depending on His strength is something carried out according to one's own desire, with one's own eagerness, and by one's own ability. Even though what is done may be the very best and unsurpassed in man's eyes, God regards the thing that the believers are doing as sinning. God does not care if something is good or evil. He only cares where it comes from and by whose ability it is done. Besides His own will, God is not satisfied with anything else; besides His own ability, God does not value anything else. Even if the believers can accomplish something better than God's will, God does not approve it. In fact, God sees it as sinning.</P><P>Dear saints, are all of your work and pursuit truly according to God's will, or are you just doing something independently out of yourselves? Is your work initiated by God, or are you working according to your own delight? Brothers, our independent actions, no matter how good they are, are not accepted by God. In God's eyes, every action that is not a result of a clear understanding of God's will is sin. In God's eyes, everything done without depending on Him is sin. Today's Christians are too capable, too active, and have done too many good things! God does not care how many good things you have done. He only cares about what you have done according to His instructions. God does not ask how you labor for Him; He only asks how much you depend on Him. Brothers, it is not fervent activity that pleases Him; rather, it is dependence on God that pleases Him. No matter how zealously you work for God, all of your works are useless; the only thing that is useful spiritually is the work done by God through you. We should ask ourselves: Are all my works done by God through me, or are they just my own works? All independent works that are not done through an absolute trust in God are sin.</P><P>Brothers, we may be committing sins while saving souls. If we try to exhort others to turn to the Lord merely according to the gospel we have understood and the experience we have acquired, without trusting in God Himself, in God's eyes, we are not saving souls but committing sins! If we try to edify the believers according to our biblical knowledge and clever words, without realizing our own weaknesses and without applying only God's power and trusting in such power, in God's eyes, we are not giving a message but committing sins! All acts of love, all works of charity, and all endeavors which look good outwardly are sins in God's eyes if they are not done through a deep realization of one's helplessness, or if they are done through sudden impulse from the self or through the power of the self. Brothers, God does not ask whether or not you do well; He only cares whether or not you have trusted in Him. Everything that comes from the self will be burnt on that day before the judgment seat, but everything that comes from God will remain.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MEANING OF<br>THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL<br>AND THE TREE OF LIFE</H2><P>The meaning of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is man acting apart from God, man pursuing goodness according to his self-will, man hastily and impatiently seeking after the knowledge that God has not granted, and man pursuing progress by his own means rather than by trusting in God. What all these mean is that man is simply acting alone and independently, outside of God. Dear brothers, this is the first sin committed by man. In God's eyes, the meaning of sin is not necessarily related to committing many defiling acts. As long as man seeks anything, does anything, or acts in any way by himself, he has sinned, regardless of whether the thing he seeks after or does is good or bad.</P><P>God hates to see man acting independently apart from Him. God wants man to depend on Him. The purpose for God to create and save man was for man to depend on Him. This is the meaning of the tree of life. God told Adam: "Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it" (Gen. 2:16-17). Among all the edible trees, God specifically mentioned the tree of life in contrast to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. "The tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil" (v. 9). We see from God's specific mention of the tree of life that it was the most crucial tree among all the edible trees. This was what Adam should have eaten first. What is the reason for this?</P><P>The tree of life signifies God's life-God's uncreated life. Adam was a created being; hence, he did not have this life. Although Adam was sinless, he was natural, one among all the animals; he did not have the divine life. God's intention was for Adam to exercise his will to choose the fruit of the tree of life, thus establishing a life-relationship with Him. This would transform him from something created by God into something born of God. God wanted Adam to refuse his created natural life, unite himself with God's life, and live in dependence on His life every day. This is the meaning of the tree of life. God intended that Adam would live according to a life that was not his originally. Here the significance of dependence or reliance is most obvious. When a creature lives according to his created life, he does not have to depend on anything, because life is independent and can exist by itself. But the minute a creature decides to live according to the Creator's life, he has to exercise dependence, because such a life is not in him; it is only in God. Hence, he cannot live independently from God but must depend fully on God and must have unceasing fellowship with Him. Since this life was not within Adam, he had to exercise dependence before he could receive it. Adam did not have the strength to live out this life. Hence, he had to continue to exercise a dependence on God so that he could be preserved. The condition to receive is the same as the condition to be preserved. Adam had to depend on God every day so that he could have the life of God every day.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S DEMAND ON US</H2><P>The same is true with God's demand on us today. In Genesis, figuratively speaking, God's life and man's life were only planted together in the midst of a garden. Today God's life and man's life are both within us. The saved believers are all regenerated, that is, we are all born of God and have established a life-relationship with God. The created life is within us and so is the Creator's life. The present problem is whether or not we live according to God's life and completely depend on God in our daily living. As our physical body cannot survive without the created life, in the same manner our spirit cannot survive without the Creator's life.</P><P>Brothers, God wants us to have no activity apart from Him. He wants us to die to ourselves. He wants us to attach ourselves to Him as if we could not even move without Him. God does not want us to initiate anything by ourselves, but He wants us to act according to His instruction in everything. God wants us to realize that we are helpless and that we should depend on Him wholeheartedly. We should reject any independent act apart from God. It is altogether of the self to do anything, try to do anything, or have done anything without praying, without waiting for God, without seeking His will and clearly understanding it, without recognizing the self's weaknesses and impotence, without helplessly turning to and depending on God, and without the assurance (through the inspection of the conscience) that nothing of the self is involved. In God's eyes, without this assurance, what we do just involves sins. Brothers, God does not care how well you have done something; He only cares about who does it. God will not be moved just because we have done something good. Besides His own work, God is not satisfied with anything else. You may act, work, labor, or suffer for Christ and His church, but unless you are certain that this is what God wants you to do, and unless you realize your own inability in fear and trembling and turn to God to work through Him, in God's eyes, you are sinning just like Adam. Brothers, stop your own work! Never think that you can do something just because it is good. God's view is not as small as ours! You can labor, and you can do something according to your own delights; but you will not have any spiritual usefulness at all.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INABILITY OF OUR SELF</H2><P>We know that a person who does not believe in the Savior cannot be saved, regardless of how good his conduct may be. But why is this? We know many unbelievers. Their conduct is really good, and they are very kind, loving, humble, and patient. An ordinary Christian may come far behind such people in moral character. Yet, why are they not saved in spite of such good moral character? It is because their goodness issues merely out of their natural life, that is, from their own self. This is why they do not please God. God only delights in something that belongs to Himself and that issues from Himself. Therefore, brothers, if an unbeliever cannot please God by his genuinely good behavior, is it possible that you can please God by your zealously good behavior? Other than the life which God has given us, we are exactly the same as the unbelievers in our self-life; there is not the slightest difference between the two. The created life of a sinner is exactly the same as the created life of a saint. The way that God rejects all the good deeds performed by this life in an unbeliever indicates that He will also reject all the good deeds performed by the same life in the believers.</P><P>What a pity that we have forgotten so soon the lesson we have learned. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, God convicted us through the Holy Spirit so that we realized that our goodness was absolutely useless before Him and that we possessed nothing except sins. However, after we are saved, we think that our goodness and righteousness are useful and that they can please God! We should know that our salvation and regeneration have not improved our own life. Except for the new life which we have received, our old self and our old life remain the same. We should also know that the initial principle of our salvation should be sustained continually. It was not due to our independent acts that we were saved. Therefore, neither is it due to our independent acts that we can please God. God dislikes anything that comes from those who act independently of Him. Regardless of whether it is a sinner or a saint, independent acts are always rejected by God.</P><P>Brothers, let me repeat, God dislikes anything that comes as a result of acting independently of Him. Let me say again, regardless of how well you have done, unless it has been done in complete, helpless reliance on God, there is no spiritual value whatsoever to your work. You may boast of how much work you have done, how much hardship you have suffered, how much blessing you have received, or how much fruit you have produced, but in God's eyes, these are dead. They have no true value. The reason for this is that they are all done by your self; they are not initiated by Him or accomplished by Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DANGER OF SELF-CONFIDENCE</H2><P>How hard it is to be dependent! How hard it is for the wise to be dependent! And how hard it is for the brilliant ones to be dependent! Many times we are well able to act without depending on God or receiving His special strength. How hard it is for men to willingly forsake their own abilities and become helpless before God, and how hard it is to give up their trust in their abilities and depend only on God! Brothers, every time we speak or move, God wants us to forsake ourselves, drop ourselves, deny all our abilities, confess our weakness and impotence in a definite way, and acknowledge that we can say nothing and do nothing apart from His help. God wants us to trust in Him in this way. All the things keep us away from God. All of our ability, wisdom, strength, and knowledge lead us to believe in ourselves and lose a trusting heart. Unless we willingly and continually forsake these things, we surely will not depend on God. When a child is young, he needs his parents to do everything for him; he depends on his parents in everything. Once he grows up and has gained some ability and wisdom, he wants to be independent and does not want to trust in others anymore. In our relationship with Him, God wants you to be a child all the time because He wants you to depend on Him all the time. Do you think that you have some abilities? Do you think that you are already sanctified? Do you think that you are already filled with the Spirit and that you have achieved something in your work? This kind of thought will cause you to lose your trusting heart. You have to maintain your helpless position before man so that you can advance in God's way. If you allow your self to creep in secretly and think that you possess something, you will find that you cannot trust in God anymore.</P><P>Brothers, the brother who is talking to you now does not have any assurance concerning his own future. He does not know whether or not he will still be a gospel preacher this time next year. Unless God preserves him, he may not be able to minister Christ or follow Him this time next year. He is very sad to say this, but he knows that he truly does not have any way to preserve himself. If God had not preserved him, he confesses that he would not even have been able to maintain the lowly position that he holds today. He recalls the times since he became a believer until today and confesses that a countless number of times he has tried to separate himself from Christ. But he praises the Lord, because the Lord has preserved him. My dear ones, let me tell you, except for a total dependence on God, that is, a moment by moment dependence on Him, I know of no sanctified life. Unless we depend on God, we do not know how long we will continue to be for the Lord. We should know that unless we trust in God, we can do nothing; we cannot even be Christians for yet another day.</P><P>Do we feel this way, or do we still think that we ourselves have some ability to sustain and that we can succeed in many things? Dear ones, self-confidence is the enemy of God-dependence. The amount of self-confidence we have speaks of the amount of independence we exercise towards God. God must bring us to our end before we realize that our self-confidence is altogether useless. Unless He grants grace, everything shall fail. God must bring us to the point where we fully realize our poverty and impotence and where we dare not exercise self-confidence at all. In this way, we will not have any independent actions outside of God, but will constantly, fearfully prostrate ourselves before God to seek for His grace. If we are not brought to this point, in our nature we will always think that we are capable and always delight in activities, so as to cause us to be unable to depend on God.</P><P>Today as I look back at those brothers with whom I was acquainted a few years ago, so many have fallen. I still remember that one of them said to me, "Sir, we already know all the things that you have taught us from the Bible. We have advanced, and we are not necessarily any poorer than you or your co-workers." But today these brothers have altogether disappeared. Oh, the self-confidence! I remember recently one brother said to me, "Brother, I may not know much about other things, but as far as the Bible teachings are concerned, I am not that ignorant." As soon as I heard this, I knew he was in danger. Today he is no longer in the right way. O brothers, as I recall the past, I can remember so many sad histories. But in all these failures, there is only one underlying cause-self-confidence. The cause for all the failures is always self-confidence.</P><P>Today the only thing that God wants is that we know ourselves and know that we are absolutely unreliable. God wants us to acknowledge that we are weak and altogether useless all the time. God wants us to realize something that we have never realized before-that we are helpless. If He does not preserve us, we will not stand even for a moment. If He does not strengthen us, we can do nothing. May we allow God to break us today so that we will no longer dare have an independent action or attitude outside of Him. Otherwise, vanity and failure will be the certain result.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN OPEN LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 3</H2><P>Our heart is full of a sense of gratitude as we send out another issue of The Present Testimony. Although it is not a great work of any kind, it is a testimony for Jesus. In the matter of serving Him, nothing is too small or unworthy of our labor. It is quite amazing to consider how men like us could serve Him. Grace saves us, and it is also grace that gives us the privilege of serving the Lord.</P><P>Presently, we are still in a time of waiting. God is still examining our living so that the sacrifice of the burnt offering will not have any blemish. We enjoy proclaiming the grace and mercy of God, but toleration of any unrighteousness was never the intention of God's grace and mercy. When we put our past living and work in God's light, how ugly and detestable our flesh is! Although we would rather avoid it, we must not be afraid of knowing the self too thoroughly. God has many words to speak; our duty is to listen quietly.</P><P>Sister Lee and Sister Wang, two sisters in our midst, are still in the area of Amoy, working in the name of the Lord among the sisters. We thank the Lord that He has used them. Although the meetings have not been great or widely publicized, God has been using them to perfect His daughters and to simultaneously release many who were bound by evil spirits. One brother said in a letter, "Thank the Lord, who through His sent ones at this time is releasing quite a few." Certainly, only the truth can set people free. Since they have not yet returned, those who are bearing the responsibility before the Lord to pray should continue to do so.</P><P>Finally, concerning the publication of The Present Testimony, in these few months we have really seen the hand of the Lord, confirming that our move has been of Him. Letters of testimony from various places have increased our strength quite much. Our hope is that we may be an up-to-date testimony for God in these end times. We are deeply thankful for all the help from God's faithful stewards. Although this is a heavy burden (in the first month 2,000 were printed and in the second month 2,500), as yet there has been no hardship. If God's grace has been trustworthy in the past, then in the future also it will not fail. May God bless you all!</P><P>One with you always,<br>Watchman Nee<br>June 1928</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>KNOWING THE SELF</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 3</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture reading: Deut. 8:2</H1><P>If we want to understand the reason for this Scripture, we must go back to see the promise made by the children of Israel at the foot of Mount Sinai. When God appeared on Mount Sinai, He said, "If ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people" (Exo. 19:5). Immediately after hearing this word, without any objection, the children of Israel "answered together, and said, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do" (v. 8). How straight forward this was! The children of Israel thought that because God had saved them, led them, supplied them, and protected them to such an extent, they would absolutely obey whatever He might require of them and whatever word of command He might speak to them. So when God asked if they would obey His word, they all "answered together" and said they were most willing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE VALUE OF TESTING</H2><P>But what your mouth speaks and promises is not necessarily what your hands do or the way your feet walk. God must test you in practical matters to see if you really desire Him and His will. Although in your heart you think and also feel that you are completely willing to obey God's word, your flesh is nevertheless corrupt, and what you feel and think is hardly reliable. God must test you to see if you will really obey His commandment or not. Moses told us that God wanted to test the children of Israel, that is, to test what was in their heart, whether or not they would keep His commandments as they had promised on Mount Sinai. For this reason, God humbled them and tested them in the wilderness for forty years. Such humbling and testing were not to depress their spirit, but simply to expose their true condition.</P><P>Have we ever considered that the experience of the Israelites in the wilderness is also what we as God's children must pass through? If there had not been the humbling and testing in the wilderness as well as the failure and rebellion that resulted, who would have known that the children of Israel were so exceedingly corrupt? If we only saw the fervent promises made at Mount Sinai, would we not have considered that they were the most obedient and law-abiding people? However, those who promised with swearing at Mount Sinai are the very ones who worshipped the golden calf, murmured and lusted in the wilderness, and were unwilling to enter into Canaan. It was after so many failures that the children of Israel realized how corrupt they were and that there was nothing worth boasting of in their flesh. What they had bragged about, that is, the things in which they thought they were better than other nations, were all false. Actually, they were not one bit better than any other kingdom in this world. Then they knew that God had chosen them, not because they were superior to other nations, but because of His free grace. "`I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion.' So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy" (Rom. 9:15-16). The way God led the children of Israel in the past is the same way He is leading His children today. The lesson God wants to teach His children today is the same lesson He taught the children of Israel, that is, to know the self. God wants His people to know that their self is corrupt, hopeless, incurable, filthy, and weak. God wants to bring the believers to the end of themselves, to have absolutely no hope in themselves, and to know that they are useless. This is so that they will solely trust in God in helplessness, seek His will, and depend on His power to fulfill His purpose. But how many believers really feel this way? How many really know that the self is absolutely useless and is actually filled with corruption and filth? Are there not many believers who think that the self has something, can do something, or knows something? Does not every believer think he is quite reliable and that he is stronger than others? Who really knows himself thoroughly?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REASON GOD ALLOWS US TO FAIL</H2><P>God has no need to know our failure and falling. Whether we are standing up and overcoming or falling down and stumbling, God knows that the flesh is corrupt all the same. God knows our natural form. God has no hope that we will fulfill His righteousness by our flesh. He knows that we have nothing but sin. When we do good, He knows we are corrupt; when we do evil, He also knows we are corrupt. He does not need to wait until we fail or fall to know we are incurable. But we need failures and falling because, if it were not so, we could not know the self. When everything is going smoothly, when favorable winds are in the sails and we are victorious and filled with happiness, we think we are quite good and have what others do not have. Although we dare not boast in an obvious way, when we have a slight advancement in spiritual life or a slight success in spiritual work, it is hard for us not to think of ourselves and consider that we are indeed holy, able, and far superior to others. At such times, we unavoidably lose our trust in God and become careless. Therefore, God allows us to fall from glory to dust. He allows us to sin, fall, and backslide, in order that we would know that the self is unbearably corrupt, beyond cure, and that we ourselves are the same as the worst and most evil sinner in the world. As a result, we dare not assume anything in ourselves or glory in ourselves or boast in ourselves; rather, in everything we trust God with fear and trembling. Brothers, we need failures and fallings to humble us, to cause us to know the self and to know the flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD WANTING THE BELIEVERS TO BE<br>DELIVERED FROM SELF</H2><P>Before we were regenerated and saved, the Holy Spirit caused us to be convicted so that we would know that we were just sinners and that all our goodness and righteousness in the past were simply filthy rags, insufficient to cover our nakedness or to save us. We also knew that even if we tried our best to do good for the rest of our lives, our righteousness would still not be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the law. As a result, we knew we could not go about establishing our own righteousness outside of Christ (Rom. 10:3). We knew we had to come to God helplessly, to receive the righteousness of the Lord Jesus and be saved through Him. That was our past experience. But how forgetful we are! When we were saved and regenerated, we knew it did not depend upon our goodness and righteousness, but entirely upon the merit of Christ. At that time, the Holy Spirit revealed our perishing condition to us. He showed us that not only was our righteousness untrustworthy, but that we ourselves were filled with filth and exceedingly corrupt. After we were saved, though we were filled with joy, we were still very humble because we had just received the grace of being forgiven. However, after a while, we forgot the initial principle by which we were saved. Because this new life had new desires, we began again to fulfill the righteousness by ourselves, to meet the outward demand. When we were saved, God told us, "Your own goodness and righteousness are useless." However, we did not realize that He would also be telling us forever, "Your own goodness and righteousness are forever useless." We did not realize that, just as God said we would not please Him when we were saved (no matter how it looked outwardly), He would say the same thing to us after we are saved. The way we took to obtain salvation is the way we also should take to nurture this life after salvation. The principle at salvation should continue till eternity. The self is always useless; it is always judged by God and should be put to death. But it is very regretful that the goodness and righteousness we threw away at salvation is welcomed again by us after a while. The self, which we confessed to be useless when we believed in the Lord, gradually becomes active again. God originally intended that after we were saved we should know the corruption of the self more deeply and, as a result, forsake its goodness and righteousness more deeply. The attitude we had toward the self when we first believed in the Lord was only the beginning of God's good work. God's goal is to work deeper and deeper in such a way that the believer becomes completely freed from the rule of the self. However, the believer destroys the work of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY GOD LEADS BELIEVERS<br>TO KNOW THEIR SELF</H2><P>The first work of the Holy Spirit in a believer is to bring him to know the self after he is saved. This is so he will, according to God's will, forsake all that is from the self and completely depend on God. But how difficult it is! How unflattering it is to know the self! How unbearable it is to forsake the self! A believer often does not know the self or want to know the self. Because he does not know the self, he thinks the self is reliable; because he does not want to know the self, the Holy Spirit has no way to reveal to him his true character under God's light. Under such circumstances, God has no other way than to use a more painful method to cause a believer to know the self. This method is to deliberately allow him to fail.</P><P>Just as the failures in the wilderness caused the children of Israel to realize their self-motives, failures similar to those in the wilderness also cause believers to know the hopelessness of the self. Because believers are self-confident and think that they themselves are competent, able, capable, and perhaps talented in many ways, they lose a heart of complete dependence upon God. Therefore, God allows them to fail in all their affairs and have no true abiding fruit. This makes them realize that they themselves are not reliable. Many believers imagine that they are naturally patient, kind, gentle, and pure. For this reason God causes various things to come upon the believers to bring them to the point that they can no longer be patient, kind, gentle, and pure, to make them know that not one thing that comes from the inherent self is reliable. Believers may consider that they love God. They may want to boast of the completeness of their consecration or the diligence of their work. But God allows the world and its people to attract them and cause them either to be secretly corrupted or openly unfaithful. As a result, the believers realize that their love for God is very shaky. Other believers may feel that they are completely for God, that nothing is for themselves. God will cause these ones to experience the praise and welcome of men so that they will see how they steal God's glory and covet men's exaltation. Sometimes when believers have progressed slightly in their spiritual path, they feel that they are victorious and sanctified. But while they are satisfied, God permits them to fail and sin just like others, or even worse than others, thus making them realize that they are not any better than anyone else.</P><P>Brothers, if you do not misunderstand me, I would like to tell you one word: God likes His children to sin more than He likes them to do good. The more believers sin, the more God is pleased. Please do not misunderstand what I mean or deliberately misunderstand my words. I am not persuading you to sin, nor does God want you to sin. However, the believers' self-confidence, self-boasting, self-satisfaction, and every selfish thought, feeling, and act cause God to prefer that they commit sin rather than do good. If they did not sin, they would not know themselves and break away from their pitiful, ludicrous, and detestable self-life.</P><P>We must know where God wants us to arrive. We must know out of what and into what we have been saved. It is true that we will go to heaven and not to hell. But does God's purpose stop there? No, God wants to save us completely from the self into His life. He wants us to live absolutely apart from the soul-life. From God's point of view, there is nothing more filthy than the self. The self is the source of all sins and is God's greatest enemy because the self declares independence from God in everything. God considers everything of the self to be utterly filthy, unacceptable, and useless. What is the self? It is all that man has, all that he can do, and all that he has done without seeking God, waiting on God, and depending on God. This is the self and the things that result from the self.</P><P>Although God hates the self very much, the believers' view of the self is totally different from God's. They depend on the self, admire the self, and glorify the self. They do not know the true character of the self. They do not know how filthy, corrupt, and weak they are in God's eyes. They do not have God's view. They still have no self-knowledge, that is, they do not know the self. Under such circumstances, if they have more progress, success, or are continuously victorious, their self-life will become stronger. It will become even more difficult to forsake it. At this point, the more good or righteous work that they perform, the more they will be alienated from God. The more strength they have, the more veils there will be between themselves and the Holy Spirit. The more success they have, the more the self will gain the glory, and the more the detestable self-life will be prolonged. This is why I say that God would rather have the believers commit sins than do good. The more they commit sins, the more they will realize the untrustworthiness of the self. The weaker they become, the more they will realize their vanity. The more falls they have, the more they will know the incurability of the self. God is not bothered by believers committing sin because sinning causes them to know the self and depend on God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD LEADING MEN TO THEIR END</H2><P>Brothers, God now has no other goal than to bring you to an utter end. God wants you to be disappointed about your self, to lose hope in your self, and to confess that you are incurable and worse than anyone else. God wants you to know the self. How many times in the past have you aspired to victory, yet always failed in the end! It was for no other reason than this: God wanted to bring you to know yourself. You mourned, struggled, strove, sought, prayed, worked, labored diligently, and used hundreds and thousands of other means in the hope that you could overcome sin and be sanctified completely. But you invariably failed. Although sometimes you might have had a small amount of success, it never lasted. Although you did whatever you could to maintain your success, your success took wings like a bird. You thought your struggle to succeed was unsuccessful because you were worse than everyone else. Brothers, these experiences were for one reason only: God wants to help you to know your self. You fail not because you are too bad, but because you are not bad enough. Brothers, you should know that to mourn is your self, to struggle and try hard is your self, to pursue prayer is your self, and to work and labor diligently is also your self. It is all your self that is working, and it is all for your self. How much of it is in complete dependence upon God? How many really know that they are incurable and as a result depend on God? By struggling and seeking in such a way, what are you really after? Is it not something for the self? Yes, you are seeking victory over sin and evil, and you are seeking sanctification, but what are they for? Is it not for the self to be happier, more glorified, and more boastful? If you have not reached the point where you are fully aware of the weakness and deceitfulness of the self, God will still allow you to stumble and fail. This makes you realize that you are powerless and that you do not deserve any honor or glory.</P><P>Brothers, God wants us to be in union with Him, relying on Him, carrying out His will, and giving Him the glory in everything. If you do not know the true character of the self and think that the self is good and capable, naturally, you will not be able to depend on God or give Him the glory. Naturally you will be self-confident and self-glorying. Even until today, you still do not know how weak the self is. That is why God allows you to fail again and again. Every failure is His indication that you are weak. But you would not believe it. You are not disappointed at your self but are still full of expectation. You think that the last failure was because you exerted too little effort and that if you exerted more energy next time, you would succeed. But you have failed so much already! There have been so many ups and downs with you! But you still do not know how weak you are. You still cannot receive the lesson God wants to teach. Rather, you are still planning to make a final endeavor to gain a final victory. After experiencing so many failures, you still do not know how to be completely and helplessly disappointed. You still do not know how to forsake your self efforts and cast yourself completely into God's hand. You still may not know how to trust in Him by stopping your own scheming and managing while, at the same time, not having any knowledge of what to do. Since you have not learned your lesson, greater and more numerous failures must come upon you before you will know the self. Brothers, until you cease your own working, you should not expect God to deliver you.</P><P>We know that those who rescue people from water will not start saving them immediately after they fall in. This is because at that time a person's strength is still very great, perhaps even greater than usual. If a rescuer approaches the drowning one too quickly, he seizes him, entangles him, and prevents the rescuer's hands and feet from further movement. As a result, both sink. Only after the drowning one has struggled for a while, exhausting his own means to save himself, and only after his strength is all gone, reckoning that he must die, will the rescuer dare approach him and bring him back to shore with one hand under him. God allows His children to struggle now in order that they might see the uselessness of their struggling. He allows them to approach a dangerous position day after day. He is now waiting for them to be exhausted and deem themselves about to die. He is waiting for them to surrender to Him and reckon that unless God saves, they cannot sustain themselves even one more second-unless God saves they will die. Only then will He stretch forth His hand of deliverance. Whenever believers give up relying on themselves, God will save them fully. God's only goal is to make the believers realize that the self is completely useless with regard to God's life and His work. Apart from depending on God, they have no other work or living.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD WANTING THE BELIEVERS TO REALIZE<br>THE DECEITFULNESS OF THE SELF</H2><P>God also wants the believer to realize the deceitfulness of the self. Many times the mouth speaks of dependence on God, but in actuality it is dependence on self! Many times there is some dependence on God, but more dependence on self! When the believer is in this condition, God has no choice but to allow him to fail some more. This will show him how much he is still secretly depending on his self. Every failure makes the believer realize that he has fallen to that state only because he has made reservation for his self.</P><P>How deceitful we are! How intense is our heart for the self! Is it not true that in everything we do and in all our motives, there is the mixture of the self? Perhaps we have consecrated ourselves to God, and we think that we are more faithful than others. Yet we do not realize how wild and unbridled our heart and mind are toward the world and its people. God must bring us to the place of failure, to expose our hidden and secret motives through our conduct, before we realize how deceitful we are. Our mouth may say that we are living fully for God, and outwardly we may act as if we are serving Him wholeheartedly. Actually, all these are for our own boasting, glorying, and receiving the praise of others. God wants us to know the self; He wants us to realize that these are our motives. Therefore He allows us to fail so that in our failure we may judge ourselves and learn to realize that even when we have not failed, we are still for the self and are stealing God's glory.</P><P>Many believers are still living according to the deceitful self! Many believers are still taking self as the principle of all their living! Nearly everything is for the self and from the self. One category of believers-the deceitful believers-is more dangerous than all. It seems that they can never break away from their self. If they learn one more thing or know one more matter, it is all for glorifying the self. This is true not only in spiritual matters, but in secular matters as well. If they have learned something or understood something, they will take this as a reason for them to boast about their self. Oh, the deceitfulness of the flesh! Who can fully know it? God must break and demolish such believers and strip them of all their smooth environments so that they will be deprived of all their means to expand themselves. God has to deal with them in the most severe environment; otherwise, they will still exalt and boast about themselves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LESSON IN THE WILDERNESS</H2><P>Brothers, God spent forty years to personally guide the children of Israel through the wandering in the wilderness. He allowed them to stumble and sin for the unique purpose of teaching them about their self. Today God is working on you. In the past, He has allowed you to fail time and again in order that you would know the true character of the self. But even now, you have not learned the lesson well. God wants you to realize that you are powerless, thoroughly corrupt, unable to bear any burden, and your heart toward Him is not perfect or chaste. You have not loved Him as much as you think. You are not that great or that wonderful. You are not an important person; you are quite insignificant. Your past failures should have convinced you of your total vanity. Yet today, you still admire your self. This is why God has to leave you in the wilderness, so that you will experience more of the failures of the wilderness and realize the corruption, vanity, and weakness of your self in the eyes of God. If you do not learn your lesson today, you will continue to fail.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW</H2><P>Several thousand years ago, God gave the law to man. What was God's purpose for doing this? The law was not given for man to keep. The law was given for man to break. The law was established for man to violate. Do not be surprised at this. This is God's goal. This is what the Bible has shown us. God knows how corrupt and unbearable we are. All along, His purpose has been for us to be saved through His grace freely. He knows that we are corrupt to the uttermost and that there is nothing we can present to Him. However, although God knows us, we do not know ourselves. This is why God has to use these ways to teach us, so that we would know what He knows-realizing our own corruption and receiving His grace. God's way is to use the law; He wants us to try to keep the law. If we are good, we will try to keep the law, and if we are corrupt, we will violate the law. In other words, if we violate the law, it means that we are corrupt. The fact that we cannot keep the law shows that our flesh is weak (Rom. 8:3). Only when men see that they are so weak and cannot fulfill the demand of the law will they lose hope in themselves entirely. Only then will they stop trying to save themselves by works and seek for God's grace. This is why the Bible says, "Why then the law? It was added because of the transgressions," that is, it was added to expose man's corruption "until the seed should come to whom the promise was made" (Gal. 3:19). This is the Lord Jesus and His salvation.</P><P>We all know that a man is not saved by works, but by grace. But have you ever wondered why we are not saved by works but by grace? It is because we are corrupt, weak, filthy, and unable to fulfill God's righteousness, to fulfill God's law, or to have any good works. This is why we need grace. When God saves us by grace, He is saying that our self is corrupt to the uttermost and that there is no other way except for Him to grant us grace. Brothers, we have all been saved. When we entered the gate of salvation, we realized that we were powerless. Why do we still think that our self is so wonderful? Have we still not learned the lesson God has been teaching for thousands of years through the law?</P><P>God allowed the children of Israel to fail so that they would know their self. God allowed those under the law to fail so that they would know their self. Now, God allows you to fail so that you will know your self. You may wonder why the cross of the Lord Jesus has no effect on you. You have heard the truth concerning dying with the Lord and tried to appropriate it by faith. Yet it seems to have no effect on you; you still fail, stumble, and sin. You weep, pray, and strive and yet cannot overcome sin. Why is this the case? Is it because the truth concerning dying with the Lord is only a philosophy? Otherwise, why would it have no effect on you? Brothers, do you still not see your error? Do you really want to die? Do you still believe in the self-hope, trust, resolve, strive, and struggle in the self? Do you not realize how weak you are? This is why God allows you to fail, stumble, and sin, so that you will lose hope in your self completely and surrender to His Spirit fully. Only then will you be victorious. You still do not have a clear understanding of your self and are not willing to reject your own power, wisdom, goodness, and righteousness. Although you have accepted the cross of the Lord Jesus, you have only accepted it in your mind; you have not accepted it in your life. The cross judges, condemns, and crucifies the self. Yet you still believe in the self, trust in it, and admire it. If you do this, how can the cross have its effect on you?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CROSS</H2><P>In our testimony, we pay special attention to the principle of the cross. But we have to realize that the cross is not a kind of magical power which delivers one from his sins once we invoke it. Unless we willingly accept the principle of the cross, we will not see the effect of the cross on ourselves. The cross is a principle, and this principle is the rejection of the self and surrender to God. If we do not realize the corruption of our true nature and expect the cross only to free us from sin when we are in danger, we will find that there is no magical power in the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FOOLISHNESS OF THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>Some have said, "I am surprised that I can commit that kind of sin." If we say such a word, we do not know our self. We do not know how corrupt we are and that we can commit any kind of sin. We have to realize that other than the new life which God gave us at regeneration, we are no better than anybody else. Indeed, every man has the possibility of becoming a robber, and every woman has the possibility of becoming a prostitute. We do not become such because we are placed in different environments. Brothers, I have to admit that the seed of all sins is within me. If it were not for the ruling of God's life, I could commit any kind of sin.</P><P>Many tears shed for sins today are not actually shed for sins; they are shed because the self cannot come up to the standard of the believers' expectation. Many seekings, prayers, and faith are outwardly directed toward God; but inwardly they are motivated by an expectation that the self can improve. God allows you to fail in order that you will realize the corruption of the flesh and the weakness of the self. He wants you to give up your self, turn to Him, and depend on Him. When you see your self as such, you may weep, but this does not mean that you are giving up your self or that you are accepting the judgment of God on your flesh. You are weeping because you bemoan the fact that your own life is not as good as you would have it. Dear ones, you still have not realized that the flesh is incurable. After you have wept bitterly, you exert even more strength to make up your mind to be watchful and on the alert. You exert more strength to exercise self-control and seek more for the Holy Spirit to apply the cross in you. At the same time, you cherish more hope in the self, thinking that it will change for the better and that you will not fail as before. But the sad thing is that you still fail as before. Brothers, have you not seen through your own corruption yet? Each time you fail, you should realize your self that much more. Each time you fall, you should realize your weakness that much more. Each time you sin, you should give up hope on your self and reject your self that much more. Unfortunately, every time you fall, you struggle that much more, strive that much more, and shore up your own strength that much more. It is useless for you to believe and to call with your mouth, if you do not accept the principle of the cross in judging your self.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE APPLICATION OF ROMANS 7</H2><P>Has not the Bible told us about this kind of mistake? We know that Romans 6 speaks of our dying with the Lord, chapter seven speaks of the battle between the new life and the old, and chapter eight speaks of the victory in the Holy Spirit. We should have overcome through dying with the Lord. Why have we not overcome even after we have understood and accepted the truth in Romans 6? It is because we lack the experience of failure in Romans 7. Chapter six tells us that the death of the self is a fact (v. 11). But after many have believed in this truth, why do they still not have the victory of chapter eight? The reason for this is that they have never failed. God must bring the believers through the failure of chapter seven; they must fail again and again, and they must be brought to the final point where they have exhausted all their means and declare, "I am fleshy, sold under sin...For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells" (vv. 14, 18). This is the knowledge of the self. This is to know our self. The reason God allows us to fail all the time is that He wants us to realize our true condition. God allows us to repeatedly stumble so that we would concede that we are "sold under sin" and that in us "nothing good dwells." Then we will know that in order to overcome, there is no hope except to receive power from outside. This is why there is the cry: "Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me...?" After we have realized our own corruption and conceded that we cannot overcome sin without the salvation of Christ, then the beginning of chapter eight refers to our dying together with Christ as mentioned in chapter six. It also mentions how the believers have fully overcome through this death. Brothers, we are familiar with the salvation of dying together with Christ, and we indeed hope for the glory of overcoming. But the question today and the work now is to know our self. How difficult it is for God to bring us to know our self and put our self in the position of death! We have suffered many failures in the past. But we are not willing to know our self through our failures. On the contrary, we try our best to improve our self and cover up our self. If we examine our past failures in the holy light of God, we will realize what kind of persons we are. If we go on further to deny our self, God will then lead us into the Canaan rest.</P><P>Of course, all of us have some self-knowledge, and all of us know a little about our self. In our past experiences, we received God's leading and knew briefly the corruption of the self. But brothers, I am afraid that many do not have a sufficiently deep and satisfactory knowledge of their self. We must not be afraid to know our self too much! Although the self is ugly and even horrifying, and although it is loathsome and detestable, we have to somehow know it. We must never think that we fully know our self. Brothers, we are still far from the mark! Self-satisfaction and self-contentment also harm us in the course of knowing the self. The stronger the self-life is, the more we think that we have this and many other things. Little do we realize that we are Laodicean believers. God has to subdue us so that we will no longer be self-contented or self-confident.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LIFE-LONG LESSON</H2><P>Knowing the self is a life-long lesson for the believers. God desires that believers be completely free from their self and be in Him; therefore, He allows them to fail time after time so that they will know their self more and more. Stubborn believers will experience failures that others have not experienced before, so that they can reach God's goal. Such believers may think that the Lord is especially harsh towards them. They do not realize that the reason for this is that their tie with their self is stronger than that in others. God allows the believers to fail so that they will know their self and trust in Him. After a believer has learned to trust in Him, God will give him the victory to see whether or not the believer will still trust in Him completely and whether or not he will steal the glory for himself. It is most pitiful that shortly after believers have won a victory, they begin to be boastful again and no longer trust in God in fear and trembling but claim glory for themselves. As a result, God has to allow them to fail again. Today a countless number of believers are still living this life of victory after failure and failure after victory. But they still have not learned the lesson which God wants them to learn. Brothers, besides the way of self-knowledge, self-judgment, and self-denial, there is no other way to enter into spiritual life. If we judge our self all the time through a knowledge of the self, we will avoid many failures. Otherwise, as soon as we forget our weakness and become active again, God will allow us to fail again. This will cause us to bow our heads and acknowledge that there is no goodness within us.</P><P>After God has broken you in such a way, you will not see anything else except the evil and abomination of the self. You will not dare to initiate anything by yourself, nor dare to do anything by your own strength. Instead, you will wait on God's will in everything and trust in God's power. If there is any success, you will not dare be boastful, for you know that you do not deserve any glory. Today those who are (1) following their self-will, (2) relying on their self-power, and (3) giving glory to themselves do not know their self.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN OPEN LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 4</H2><P>In the past few days, I truly felt a weakness which I have never had before. It indeed made me see that besides the grace of God, we really have nothing. This feeling of weakness is necessary for the believers. If this kind of feeling would make us rely more on God, it would certainly be a great profit. But if it causes us to hold a defeatist view because we keep looking at ourselves, it profits nothing. To realize our corruption and vanity is very important; nevertheless, this should not hinder us from relying on God and from coming to serve Him. We need to know ourselves so that we may cease our own work, not that we may feel let down in the will of God.</P><P>We thank God that we are now able to send out another issue of The Present Testimony. That this copy can be in your hands shows that He has treated us kindly. It is not because of our prosperity, but because He is rich.</P><P>Our two sisters have returned. The real result of their work will be manifested only in eternity. In the eyes of those who love great things, it seems that they were not very grand; however, God knows how this recent work will affect the Body of Christ. Nevertheless, we firmly believe that God is not seeking a great work which would shock heaven and shake earth. Men only care for what is seen, but God is not so near-sighted. We do not trust in the kind of work which publishes photos and issues reports. It is a sad thing that while the children of God realize that God is not in excitement, they still are bent on having excitement. Hence, we have to be careful that we do not consider everything that sounds good as from God. I feel that the unprecedented need today is to discern between the work of the spirit and that of the soul.</P><P>There is still one more thing. In the last four months I have devoted my entire being to the writing of The Spiritual Man. Because of this, I have been unable to reply to many incoming letters which have piled up. I hope the brothers and sisters who have written me will realize that my delay does not mean that I do not have a heart for you. Every letter has been carefully read. I am most sympathetic toward your problems. However, because of the limitations of time, I have been unable to reply immediately. I hope all those who correspond with me will bear this in mind. Now The Spiritual Man is finished, and I hope that within a month it will be published.</P><P>Brothers, today indeed is an evil age. On behalf of our Lord Jesus Christ may we guard our hearts in virginity.</P><P>Watchman Nee<br>July 1928</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FAITH</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 4</H2><P>In the Bible God demands faith of His children. Without faith we cannot please Him. All spiritual blessings and arrangements in our circumstances can only be received through faith. We marvel that God considers the faith of the believers so important. Without exception, all the aspects of God's full salvation in the Bible are gained by faith. One thing we know: God hates man's own works, whether they are those of a sinner or those of a saint. Anything from ourselves, anything done independently of God, and anything done according to one's own intention by one's own strength, is hateful to God. Many of these things may seem very good in man's eyes, yet God hates them all. The Lord Jesus told us that there is only one who is good-God. In the Lord's eyes, no one is good. Therefore, anything not according to the will of the good God or anything not done through the power of the good God is not good; it is sin. Nothing but God is good. For this reason, every work outside the will and power of God is not good. Hence, all that a believer does must be of God and through God.</P><P>Here the matter of faith comes in. Faith has two basic principles: (1) stopping man's own work and (2) waiting for God's work. We commonly think that faith is believing, depending, and waiting for God's work. But there is a step before this, that is, stopping man's work. This stopping of one's own work is the work of faith. Waiting for God to work is something that happens inside a believer and is not visible. But stopping one's own work is something that is outwardly visible at times. The greatest accomplishment of faith is not that God works for the believer, but that the believer stops his own work.</P><P>The importance of this step cannot be overemphasized. God has never allowed His own work to be mingled with the work of man's flesh. He demands the believers to totally stop everything that is of the self, whether it be in intention or in ability. He likes to be trusted and entrusted by the believers. How is such a heart of trust in God expressed? It is expressed in an absolute stillness and quietness of the self. This is the first step of the work of faith. Does a man still tire himself with planning and working, after he has fully entrusted a work to his friend? If God is reliable and His power sufficient, does He still need our help? If we believe that God works for us, why are we still anxious? Is it because we are afraid that He will not do well? If so, we have not yet believed. Faith demands that we fully rest. This is a rest in which the heart is free from anxiety and the body free from labor. If there is still restlessness in our heart and body, whether it be anxiety or labor, it shows that we have no faith. The first principle of faith is to stop our own work. If we are still worried from looking at our poor self and our difficult environment, it means that we have never yet relied on God. If we still use our own ability, power, friends, connections, and tact to labor, it means we have not yet realized our uselessness; we have not yet completely committed matters into the hand of God. A life of faith is a life of giving up the self. Acts of faith are but acts of self-surrender. Faith requires us to give up our pettiness with its worries. It also requires us to give up our ability with its accompanying labor. Putting an absolute stop to our own work is the first expression of the work of faith.</P><P>It is interesting that this kind of faith does not come from the believer himself. Inasmuch as the faith at our initial salvation was given by God (Eph. 2:8), the faith in our daily life is also given by God. Nothing else is needed to prove how useless a believer can be in himself; we only need to look at the matter of faith in God. The believer himself does not even have faith; he has to receive it from God. All faith is given by God. This is what the apostle meant when he said that faith is one item of the gift of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>Are we not many times very willing to believe in God and fully trust Him in our circumstances? We have heard other brothers telling us that we should exercise faith to believe in God. But no matter how hard we exercise, is it not true that we simply cannot believe? Many times we exert such an effort that it seems as if our hearts are almost bursting. Yet is it not true that this kind of faith produces no effect? We center our whole being on struggling with doubt, yet we still do not reach our goal. Such a situation is most painful. The most difficult time a believer has is when he is struggling with doubt.</P><P>This, however, is not faith. Faith cannot be invoked or generated by man, nor can it be brought forth from his heart. Faith is given by God. This faith controls the believer; the believer does not control this faith. Many times, we desire faith in order to achieve something, only to find that there is no way to obtain such faith. At other times, we ourselves have no intention of doing anything, yet God grants us faith and causes this faith to be expressed through our prayer, thus bringing forth the greatest achievement. God does not grant faith to satisfy our cravings. Our rightful position is death, as those who prostrate themselves in the dust. According to the will of God, the saints on the earth should live for His will and glory. It is wrong for a believer to decide, desire, or do anything out of himself. God wants us to be His vessel, but that requires us to die. Even in the matter of believing in God for the fulfillment of a certain work, God wants us to simply be a vessel. When He wants to accomplish something, He grants us the faith to petition in prayer for His work. Only then will He move to accomplish the work. Of course, this is a suffering to the flesh, because there is no possibility for its activity and no room for its craving. But since a true believer lives only for God and not for himself, he is happy and willing to simply be a dead instrument to accomplish the supreme will of God.</P><P>See what wisdom God has! If faith were ours, something that came from within us, it would be possible for us to direct our faith. In other words, if we wanted something carried out, all we would have to do is believe a little, and we would get God's work done. But this is not the way faith works. Faith is given by God. Before God gives faith, there is no way for us to believe. Many of us have experienced that we often had no way to enter into rest because we could not produce faith. Then suddenly God would grant us faith. (Sometimes this comes through one or two verses; sometimes it comes after prayer, when a believer understands the will of God in his intuition.) When this happens, we are immediately assured, and our hearts are spontaneously calmed down. It seems that we have the assurance that God will definitely accomplish His work. There is no need for struggling. There is no need for anxiety. There is not even the need to worry about exercising. Assurance simply comes spontaneously without invitation. When God grants faith this way, the believer immediately has the work of faith, that is, rest without anxiety. Any other way is not faith and will never give rest.</P><P>At this point, we must clarify something. To say what we have said does not mean that we can now neglect everything and simply wait for the visitation of this faith. There are two kinds of faith: special faith and general faith. Special faith is a kind of faith granted by God for a special matter. It is a faith which believes that God will surely accomplish a certain matter for us. We do not have this kind of faith in every situation. General faith is the daily faith of an experienced believer toward God. This kind of faith is not directed towards any special matter, but it is directed towards all things. Such a believer believes that whatever God does can never be wrong. He believes that whether it be failure or success, God's good pleasure is there. Although we do not always have special faith in everything that happens to us, we should have general faith. We must believe that our God does everything right and that everything is in His hand. He knows whether it is good for us to suffer or succeed. We should have this kind of general faith all the time. Even when special situations arise, we should not lose this kind of faith. But regardless of which kind of faith we have, faith should always have its manifestation in our conduct; there should always be rest for those who have faith; and there should also be no struggle and fleshly energy in trying to help God.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN OPEN LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 5</H2><P>My original desire was that one issue of The Present Testimony would be published each month. But we have only been able to publish this one issue after three months. Since I finished The Spiritual Man, my whole being has been exhausted, physically and mentally, and I have had no choice but to rest for a while. I have really stretched myself even to get this issue finished. To those brothers who wrote to me, I need your special patience, for I do not have time to answer each one of you.</P><P>The Lord's work is still going on; we are encouraged by many things, but at the same time we are also grieved by many other things. Nevertheless, God is the Lord of all.</P><P>Because our burden is very heavy today, I beg my brothers and sisters to pray for me and all my co-workers. Do not think that I do not need anyone to pray for me; actually, my need for your prayers is great.</P><P>One thing which has comforted me very much is that we are one in spirit and that no geographical difference can separate us. Our life of oneness in the Lord is so strong that nothing in this universe can separate us. If the Head and the Body are not separated by the distance between heaven and earth, is it not the same for the members of the Body?</P><P>The Editor<br>August 1928</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SIN AND THE BODY</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 5</H2><P>Romans 6:6 and 11 through 14 explain the relationship between sin and the body in the clearest way. We want to look at this portion briefly.</P><P>Verse 6 says, "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves." Before we were regenerated to be a new man, though we did not admit it, we were simply an old man. Only when we received the new man was our old man exposed. This old man includes everything we have in the old creation. In His crucifixion the Lord Jesus was a substitute for our sin and death. He also brought every sinner to the cross. His death was the death of the entire human race because through incarnation He became one with man. His death was the death of our old man because through faith we are one with Him. It is a fact that "our old man has been crucified with Him." The Lord Jesus accomplished this for us.</P><P>What is the purpose of our crucifixion with Him on the cross? It is so that "the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves." Here we see the relationship between sin and the body. We "serve sin" because "the body of sin" has not been "annulled." All the power of sin is in this body. The base and stronghold of sin are the body. Man is a slave of sin because the body is a slave of sin. If the body is not dealt with by the cross, our whole body will be entangled by sin.</P><P>Other verses in the Bible also link sin and the body together because the body is the dwelling place of sin. Romans 7:17-18 says that sin "dwells in me...in me, that is, in my flesh." Verse 23 says, "Making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members." Colossians 3:5 says, "Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and greediness."</P><P>From God's point of view, the body of man is actually the body of sin because sin is the instigator of the body. By reading the foregoing verses, we can see how closely sin and the body are related. All sins committed by man are affected by the body. Understanding the reason for this is not very difficult because "the lust, having conceived, gives birth to sin" (James 1:15). The root of sin is lust, and the hiding place for lust is the body. The Bible speaks of "the flesh with its passions and its lusts" (Gal. 5:24). Actually, countless numbers of sins originate from our physical body. Because a certain kind of lust exists in the body, the corresponding sin issues forth.</P><P>If a man wants to be delivered from the power of sin and to no longer be a slave of sin, he must overcome his body. In Romans 6:6 the apostle tells us how the Lord saved us from the bondage of the body: He took our old man with Him to the cross, thus annulling the body of sin. According to the original text, the meaning of the word annul is to "disable," "dull," and "wither." By His accomplishment on the cross, the Lord has disabled and withered our body of sin, so that we no longer need to be the slaves of sin. The body still exists; it is not annihilated or totally dissolved. But all the lusts that come as a result of our physical make-up are withered away and made of no effect by the Lord. Although we all have our natural weaknesses inherited from our physical make-up, we can still have complete victory through the cross.</P><P>Verse 11 says, "So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus." Verse 6 tells us three things: a fact, a purpose, and a result. To die together is a fact, to be annulled is the purpose of dying together, and to overcome sin is the final result. But verse 11 teaches us the way to practice verse 6, by reckoning what the Lord has accomplished as real. Verse 6 says that our old man has been crucified with Him and that the body of sin has been annulled. Now, by believing this to be true, we receive that work of the Lord's cross which deals with our body. And soon we shall see all the passion, evil desire, and natural disposition and affection of the body put to death by the Holy Spirit.</P><P>Verse 12 says, "Do not let sin therefore reign in your mortal body so that you obey the body's lusts." The salvation of the Lord Jesus is complete in that He has crucified our old man; "therefore," we can be liberated now. If sin still reigns in our mortal body, it is no longer because we have to obey sin; rather, it is because we choose to allow sin to reign. The whole question now is a matter of the choice of our will. Since the Lord Jesus has crucified our old man, the problem is no longer whether or not the body of sin can be overcome. The question now is how do we choose? If we "do not let" sin reign in our body, the evil desire in the members cannot force us to surrender. On the other hand, if we do not use our will to choose what the Lord has accomplished for us, we may still serve sin as slaves in our experience, even though the Lord has crucified our old man. Many believers do not understand why they do not see the effectiveness of their co-death, even though they have believed the truth of co-death. I believe that not a few have made their mistake here. Though we believe that the fact in verse 6 is true, our will must resist the reigning of sin as stated in verse 12. Only then will the fact accomplished by the Lord become effective. Otherwise, if our will responds to sin, our believing will be of no effect. Formerly, the body and sin were deeply united (hence the term "the body of sin"). Now, however, because of the Lord's salvation, believers need not let sin reign in their body any longer. Although the body still has its lusts, the believers need not obey them.</P><P>Verse 13 says, "Neither present your members as weapons of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as alive from the dead, and your members as weapons of righteousness to God." Here we have the word "neither" which follows "do not let" in verse 12. "Do not let" is related to the body, and "neither present" is related to the members. The first verse refers to the whole, while the second verse refers to the parts. The first verse refers to a denial of the place of sin in the entire body, and the second verse refers to a denial of the reigning of sin in the individual members.</P><P>What a relationship we can see here between sin and our body with its members. Sin needs the body to be its dwelling place and the members to be its instruments. Without the body and its members, there is no place for sin to be expressed. If believers want to overcome sin in their body, they must reject its reign. If they want to overcome sin in their members, they must not be its instruments.</P><P>In the following verses there is the matter of two presentations. One is the presentation of ourselves, and the other is the presentation of the members. The phrases "do not let" and "neither present" are on the negative side, whereas the two presentations mentioned in verse 13 are on the positive side. Presenting ourselves is presenting our entire body. It is to completely present to God our entire being through the exercise of our will, allowing God to be Master over everything. Presenting the members means consecrating every individual member to God to accomplish righteousness. These presentations are all in the realm of resurrection. If the believer wants to overcome all the natural lust, addiction, and inclination of his body, as well as all the weakness, uncleanness, and sin which come from his physical constitution, he must rely on the fact that he has died together with the Lord and must exercise his will to oppose and reject the authority of sin in his body. He must not allow sin to use any of his members as an expression of its power. Moreover, based upon the resurrection of the Lord, he must yield himself to God so that he may employ his members positively in accomplishing righteousness. If a believer merely has faith in the co-death but does not exercise his will in rejecting, his faith is dead and is of no effect. On the other hand, if a believer merely exercises his will to "not let," and does not take as a foundation the fact of our co-death with the Lord, the exercise of his will is in vain. After he has thus properly taken care of the negative side, he must also believe on the positive side that he is resurrected with the Lord. Then he must yield himself and his members to God.</P><P>Presenting oneself positively is the most important step in overcoming the body. Our will must be subject to God. Otherwise, there is no possibility of overcoming. We must not only renounce sin but also pursue God. It is not enough to stop committing sin; we must also desire righteousness. The positive going forward will keep us from the negative sliding backward. If we act according to the order God has set forth and specifically present ourselves and all our members to Him who has called us unto consecration, He will surely accept such a presenting of ourselves. He will saturate us with Himself and cause us to do His will in all things. We must present ourselves continuously and believe that the resurrection life of Christ is being lived out of us in reality. The result of this practice is verse 14: "Sin will not lord it over you."</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THIS ISSUE OF THE PRESENT TESTIMONY</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 6</H2><P>In the last issue's open letter, our brother Watchman Nee told how he completed the work on that issue even though he was being stretched out in different ways. In spite of the situation he was in, he proceeded to prepare the current issue of The Present Testimony for publication. This period of our brother's life has been filled with fierce conflicts and perilous fighting. While writing The Spiritual Man, his days were spent in the crevices of Satan's teeth. Since its completion Satan has been fighting even more with all the power of hell, attempting to completely wipe our brother out and make void the testimony of his book. This kind of warfare has occupied us and made us inactive for many days. These have been days of chanting lamentations. But at this very hazardous moment, our loving Father, our victorious Savior, has led our brother to the ascended position in the heavenlies to overcome Satan's fierce attack. With tears of joy we thank the Lord today that He has enabled us to put out this issue of The Present Testimony in His victory.</P><P>Here we would express our deep gratitude to all the brothers and sisters who are concerned for Brother Nee's health. Please continue to pray for him, so that he will receive the full blessing from the Lord during this period of rest and will be able to serve God more faithfully.</P><P>Two sisters among us will be preaching during the latter part of October in Yi-lin and Su-chia-chue in Kiangsu to the village women. They will also do some work among a few sisters. We pray that the Lord will protect the two sisters so that they may soon return safely from their temporary place of residence.</P><P>Recently, we were oppressed by the power of darkness. But this only serves to cause us to lift up our heads more, humbly and simply trust in God our Father, recognize the reality of spiritual warfare more, and maintain the testimony of a spiritual man to the end. Now, we can at last sigh in relief and continue with the work which was almost stopped. Without the covering of God's grace and the support of many prayers, we could not go on in peace. Therefore, we earnestly beseech you, "Please do not forget to pray for us!"</P><P>The co-workers of Watchman Nee<br>On behalf of the editor<br>December 24, 1928</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRESENTING OF THE BODY</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 6</H2><P>Romans 12:1 says, "I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service." We can see from this verse that the apostle exhorts the believers to present their bodies. He could command, but he would rather exhort, because if the presenting of our bodies is not willingly done, it will never work. Even if it works, it will be useless. In this verse, the apostle did not ask the believers to present their spirits or their souls, but their bodies. What is the reason for this? Here we see the importance of the body. The presenting of the body is "well pleasing to God." Although God does not deal with man directly through his body, He takes up man's spirit as His dwelling place. He never despises man's body. Although the spirit is the most important part, the body also has its place. Although believers should allow the Spirit to take precedence over everything, this does not mean that we should ignore our bodies. After we have seen how much God cares for the intuition, fellowship, and conscience of the spirit, we may easily have a wrong concept that God does not care for the body, and that the body only does us harm. We may also think that as long as the life in our spirit is strengthened and filled with power, we can ignore the outward body. However, God does not view it this way. Although He cares very much for the life in our spirit, He realizes that the salvation of His Son must also reach the outermost part of our being, our body. The effect of salvation is incomplete if it does not reach our body.</P><P>Furthermore, the presenting of our bodies is the presenting of our entire being, because the body mentioned in this verse represents the totality of our being. The believer's spirit belongs to God. There is no need to present this part anymore. But the believer's soul and body are still estranged from God's life. Therefore, they must be presented. Although here it mentions the body only, without mentioning the soul, in reality the soul is included as well, because our body now is closely interwoven with the soul. This is why the Bible calls the body "a soulish body" (1 Cor. 15:44). To present the body is to present everything that a person has in himself. God's purpose involves not only our inward man, but also our outward man. In fellowshipping with God, only the inward man is needed; the outward man is useless in this respect. But in other things, the importance of the outward man cannot be neglected. Otherwise, the Holy Spirit would not have made such a call here.</P><P>What is the real meaning of presenting our body? It is to work for the Lord and to live for Him. We must pay attention to the word body before we can understand the meaning in this verse. There is a great difference between the body and the spirit. The body is a matter of time and space, while the spirit is a not a matter of time and space. The body is outward and, therefore, is particularly related to the outward matters. The presenting of the body is naturally the presenting of time and space because the body is of time and space. It is the presenting of everything that is in contact with the natural realm. The presenting of the body means nothing less than working for the Lord and living for the Lord. Of the two, living for the Lord is more important. Many people think that living for the Lord is working for Him. But there is a great difference between the two. A man can work for the Lord without living for the Lord. But all those who live for the Lord are working for the Lord. The meaning of living for the Lord is to give no time to any seeking for oneself, but to give all of one's time to the Lord. This is the meaning of living for the Lord, not working for the Lord. The Holy Spirit is now calling the believers to present their bodies to live for the Lord.</P><P>Now we can consider the meaning of Romans 12:1. "Brothers" refers to the believers. "I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies." The presenting of the body is based on God's compassions. Because God has graced and loved us, we should present our bodies. This matches 2 Corinthians 5:14-15, which says, "For the love of Christ constrains us...that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised." What is the purpose of presenting the body? It is to be "a living sacrifice." All sacrifices are dead. But God wants our bodies to be a living sacrifice. All the bodies of the sacrifices in the Old Testament were presented to the altar dead. But God wants our bodies to be presented as a living sacrifice to Him. This means that we live in death. We are to be presented as a dead sacrifice for as long as we live. This kind of sacrifice is "holy, well pleasing to God." Through the compassions of God, this becomes a "reasonable service." Brothers, since God has gained the ground within us, He requires that we also present to Him everything outward. Since He lives in our spirit, He is waiting also for us to present our bodies to Him. Since we have life by Him, let us also live for Him. Since our spirit has been renewed, He desires that our bodies would also be fully committed to His hands so that our renewed spirit will have the cooperation of a body in full agreement.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ADDITIONAL WORD TO THE ARTICLE<br>"THE FAITH OF ABRAHAM"</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 6</H2><P>Abraham is our model. God wants to lead and guide us, as He did Abraham, into Canaan, a place full of idols and often in famine. In this place only a small parcel of land belongs to us. Here Satan is the ruler of everything, and little fruit is produced from the land. Everything in such an environment seems to speak contrary to God's promise, and it seems unlikely that God would have brought us to such a place. Is this what we get for leaving behind our old way of life, kindred, and country? Where is the land and the seed that God has promised? What did Abraham see in that day? He saw nothing. Year after year until he died, he only begot Isaac. Of the numerous descendants promised to him, who would be as many as the stars in heaven, the sands by the sea, and the dust on the earth, he only saw Isaac! When his wife died, he did not have one plot of land in which to bury her. He had to buy a burial ground. Is this what God had promised? Yet the father of our faith did not doubt. He knew what faith was and what it was to not live by sight. He followed God. Abraham can see now and will see the complete fulfillment of God's promises in the kingdom to come. Today is there anything that man can see and feel elated about? This is the way God leads every one of His faithful believers to take. Although we see and feel nothing today, the future will be full of spiritual land and descendants.</P><P>[Editor's note: An article, "The Faith of Abraham," was written by Ruth Lee and included in the same issue of the magazine.]</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A LETTER ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(By Ruth Lee)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 7</H2><P>We are now sending out another issue of The Present Testimony; it has been three months since the publication of the sixth issue! We have kept many readers waiting for a long time, but we ourselves have been thinking about this every day. Yet due to special reasons, we would rather delay its publication than move rashly and fill up the pages carelessly. May God grant us grace that the eighth issue will not be delayed so much.</P><P>During the past few months, God the Father has granted mercy and great grace to His servant, our brother Watchman Nee. We thank Him for this! However, Brother Nee wishes to wait on God quietly for the next four or five months and seek further and clearer revelation from the Lord before launching himself on the way ahead of him. During this period, we wish to clarify two things: first, all mail from brothers and sisters to Brother Nee personally will regrettably not be answered by him for now, and second, he will try his best to answer all questions related to spiritual experience at a later date. Brother Nee apologizes for not answering any questions related to biblical interpretations, not because he is unwilling, but simply because he does not have the time.</P><P>The more our vision is enlarged to see the eternal will of God, the more joyful and hopeful we are, and the more we need to recognize clearly the boundaries which God has measured to us. If God has raised up some to do another kind of work, we ask the Lord to bless it and our hearts rejoice for it. But we, in ourselves, dare not start a work in order to meet the pressing need in our environment. What we pray for and hope for is that we may be faithful to the Lord within the limits which He has measured to us. When we consider that the church shares the same life as Christ and will ultimately grow up fully into Him, the Head, we simply cannot refrain from praising with singing this mystery of the gospel. Oh brothers and sisters, may the Lord stir up our fervent and loving heart to rise and pray. Pray to hasten the completion of the building of the Body of Christ and the coming of His kingdom!</P><P>March 27, 1929</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A LETTER ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(By Ruth Lee)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 8</H2><P>Thank the Lord that He has not disappointed us. This eighth issue of The Present Testimony has not been published with too much delay. Dear readers, we do wish you to know how much hope we cherish in our prayers every time The Present Testimony is sent out! We do not want the truths of God to be stored only in the heads of men, nor to be always displayed on bookshelves. Rather, we want them to be assimilated into the human spirit and to be manifested in human living. Hence, although every issue contains only a few pages, the messages therein are important. We hope that with every issue you receive you do not merely read through it, but rather spend time to comprehend it in depth. It is not simply by knowing the truth that it becomes yours. Rather, it is after you have experienced the truth that you obtain its deliverance and freedom.</P><P>Although Brother Nee has been resting according to God's will during the past few months, he is still responsible for the messages in The Present Testimony. Therefore, please continue to pray for him so that the ninth issue of The Present Testimony can be ready soon.</P><P>It seems as if we have become completely silent on our end! Many concerned brothers and sisters have inquired about us. All we can say is that during these few months, some brothers and sisters continue to travel around for gospel work, the literature work continues, and the music score for the Little Flock Hymnal is being prepared, but we have no new work to report to you. We are now praying. If we receive any definite revelation from God concerning our work in the future, and when there is the need to inform you of our work, we will report to you.</P><P>May 18, 1929</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A LETTER ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(By Ruth Lee)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 9</H2><P>It is again by God's grace that we can send out this issue of The Present Testimony in peace. Let us thank the Lord together. None of the articles in this issue is vain theory. If we will humble ourselves and give diligence, we will see the truth of Christ in us. How real, how significant, and how glorious! We shall also see how much prayer we need in order to be fellow workers with God, and what attitude we need in order to cause Satan to be cast out of heaven.</P><P>Oh readers, now is really the time that we need the Lord to revive us. However, we must discern the difference between a revival of human works and a revival of the Holy Spirit. If it is an artificial revival, even though grandiose and noisy, it is but the flesh in another form. When we learn to put ourselves aside and only exercise our faith to identify with Christ in His fullness, how restful it is. We already have too many ways, and we already have too many failures. God does not want us to save the situation, nor does He want us to be discouraged and shrink back. Rather, He wants us to admit that we have come to the end of our road and that the goodness of our flesh is but vanity. Thus, we must turn to Him to seek His will. Our greatest dangers are that we are not willing to ask God to examine all our lives and works, that we are not willing to lay aside our natural ability and opinions and wholly trust in God, and that we are not willing to stop struggling in our failures and weaknesses and look to God alone. We really have to pray to the Lord to grant us the light of revelation that we might know ourselves and the salvation of God, in order that we may obtain the revival of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>To my readers who are expecting to be raptured, I would say that we all must be watchful! A little thought for the flesh is enmity with God; a little care for this life is sufficient to make our hearts entangled. If we are not yet ready, then let us not be at peace. Our brother Watchman Nee says, "I tremble at the thought that the lamps of the foolish virgins will not burn long enough." Readers, how do you feel?</P><P>Some brothers and sisters are always concerned about whether or not we are working and other details concerning our daily living. We would take this opportunity to thank you for your care! And we would like to tell you that we are neither working, nor are we not working. Although it is entirely possible that we can misunderstand God's will, our hearts are seeking after His will and are satisfied with His will. The God we serve is full of grace and full of everything. We thank Him.</P><P>June 20, 1929</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A LETTER ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(By Ruth Lee)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 10</H2><P>We humbly and devoutly send out the message of this issue. At the same time, we are prepared to be taught in soberness and trembling. We also need the edification of the truth as much as all other children of God do. May the cross of Christ do a deeper work in every one of us through the Holy Spirit.</P><P>During the summer holidays, this magazine will be published and mailed as usual. If readers are away during the summer and do not receive this magazine, please claim it from your original address. Although we have printed two thousand copies every issue, at present they are barely enough to meet the need. We are afraid that we cannot send you any extra copies. Please take note of this and bear with us for the inconvenience.</P><P>The first issue of this magazine has long been out. There are only a few copies left of the second issue. Other issues are likewise down to a few copies. All those who ask for back issues will only receive what we have. In the near future, we may decide to print three thousand copies, and then no brother or sister will be disappointed. The expense for every issue has always been met through the Lord's grace. We believe all burdens that are according to God's will are easy. We thank the Lord!</P><P>Although Brother Watchman Nee is still resting and waiting for the timing in the Lord's will, thank God the Father that He has not allowed His servant to waste his days! We ask all the brothers and sisters who are concerned for Brother Nee's health to continue to pray for him so that he can serve God more faithfully through the renewed grace that he receives.</P><P>August 9, 1929</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A PERSONAL LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 12</H2><P>To the brothers and sisters who have received the same heavenly calling in the Lord Jesus:</P><P>I have not met with all of you here for over a year. I believe that from other sources as well as through this magazine you all know that I have been ill. Indeed, since 1926, my body has daily grown weaker. I have been ill time after time, and in addition, I have suffered from lack of rest due to the many responsibilities which are still upon me. My health has been increasingly deteriorating. The writing of The Spiritual Man exhausted my strength, and since completing its writing, I have suffered continual illness even up till now.</P><P>I feel very sorry about one thing: During the past two years, I could not answer your letters on time. Some of them I have not been able to answer at all. Although one or two brothers and sisters have answered on my behalf during my illness, we have still missed many letters. I have to ask for your understanding in this. You are aware that normally I am busy enough. With my sickness, I became even weaker. I hope that you will not be offended by this.</P><P>I feel very grateful concerning this one thing: While I was perplexed on every side, a number of brothers and sisters in the Lord came to help me in my trouble. At the resurrection of the just, may the Lord reward them richly. Many brothers and sisters are aware that I do not have a constant livelihood. So for the Lord's sake, from the north and from the south, they deprived themselves, generously and voluntarily supplying me with abundant gifts, that I need not be anxious during my illness concerning my lack. Their excellent kindness and favor toward me have been overflowing. Surely I am not worthy. I am one of the most useless servants of the Lord. I quote Paul's words: "You sent both once and again to my need...I seek the fruit which increases to your account." My only prayer is that your kindness toward me would not be for nothing. I hope that when I am up again, I may be able to accomplish a small portion of my work in God's enterprise. Besides their financial supply, many brothers and sisters have written to show me their concern, and I express my thanks. I say to all who have ministered to me in such a way: Please accept my grateful, heartfelt thanks.</P><P>Of course, what I have experienced during my illness is most profitable. From the very beginning I prayed that I would gain from this illness what I needed, for I am not willing to be ill for nothing. As I look back over the past year, I can gratefully say that God's treatment is just right; not one single day could be omitted. Many of these experiences cannot be made public, but I fully believe that they are for my personal enrichment and for your gain as well.</P><P>Now, through God's unlimited and inexhaustible grace and through your ceaseless prayers, once again I have returned from the gate of death. I look to the Lord that in a time convenient to Him He would bring me to complete recovery. At present I rest and at the same time work. I now present myself once more to God to accomplish His will and to serve His saints. Many things concerning my personal future may have to change. There may need to be a change in direction concerning the literature work, the local work, and the work in other provinces. My co-workers and I are seeking before the Lord. We desire to have deeper obedience under greater light. When "the pattern on the mount" is clear, very clear, we will inform you as well. Since our conference last February, many have asked about the time for our next conference and would like to join us for such a conference. At present we cannot say anything. We will wait until the Lord's will becomes apparent.</P><P>Beloved brothers, the time of the Lord's coming back is fast approaching. We must be faithful. In the days ahead we may suffer more misunderstanding and more severe opposition; but since we have been destined for this, we should remain faithful. The apostate ones will increase, so will the backsliding ones. Darkness will increase, and we will encounter more evil treatment. But all these things only show that the Lord is near. During these days, God has said, "Let him who does unrighteousness do unrighteousness still; and let him who is filthy be filthy still; and let him who is righteous do righteousness still; and let him who is holy be holy still" (Rev. 22:11). Brothers, please continue to remember me in your prayers so that in all my afflictions I may be able to stand fast, faithfully bearing a good testimony for the Lord.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Just a few more miles beloved;<br>And our feet shall ache no more;<br>No more sin, and no more sorrow;<br>Hush thee, Jesus went before;<br>And I hear Him sweetly whispering,<br>"Faint not, fear not, still press on;<br>For it may be ere tomorrow;<br>The long journey will be done.</P><P>The peace of the Lord be with you.</P><P>A servant of Christ,<br>Watchman Nee<br>December 1929</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GALATIANS 5:24</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 12</H2><P>We have to see clearly that what is spoken of here is not a matter of experience (no matter what experience one may have); rather, it is a matter of divine fact. "They who are of Christ Jesus"-whether they be strong or weak-"have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts." You may say that you are still sinning. But God says that you have been crucified on the cross. You may say that your temper is still with you. But God says that you have been crucified on the cross. You may say that your lust is very strong. But God says that your flesh has been crucified on the cross. Please do not look at your experience for now; pay attention first to what God has said to you. If you do not listen and believe in God's word but look at your own experience, you will never have the experience of the crucifixion of the flesh. Forget about your own feelings and experience. God said that your flesh has been crucified, and it is crucified. First listen to and believe God's word, then the experience will follow. God has said to you, "Your flesh has been crucified." You should answer and say, "Amen. That is right. My flesh has been crucified on the cross." If you do this, you will see that your flesh is truly crucified.</P><P>We have to realize that the Bible has never told us to crucify ourselves. Rather, it tells us that we are those who are crucified. We are not being crucified alone, but have been crucified together with the Lord Jesus (Gal. 2:20; Rom. 6:6). Since we have been crucified together, the time that the Lord Jesus was crucified is the time that our flesh was crucified. Furthermore, our crucifixion is not a self-crucifixion. Rather, we were brought to the cross by the Lord Jesus at the time He was crucified. Hence, in God's eyes, our flesh has been crucified on the cross. This is something that has been clearly accomplished on God's side. It has been clearly accomplished and now it is a fact. Whether or not a man has the experience, God still says, "They"-every believer-"who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh." The way for us to receive the experience of the crucifixion of the flesh is not by paying attention to our experience (which though good, should not be given too much place), but by believing in God's word. God says that our flesh has been crucified, and we believe that our flesh is indeed crucified. God says that our flesh has been crucified on the cross, and we acknowledge that what God says is true. If we do this, we will have the experience. We should first pay attention to God's fact, then to man's experience.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN OPEN LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 13</H2><P>Brothers and sisters in the household of faith:</P><P>It is good to receive grace from God, but it is also important not to forget God's grace. For this reason, we must greatly honor our responsibility and take care that we glorify God's name in our work. As The Present Testimony now enters its third year of publication in Shanghai, we would take this opportunity to say something concerning this magazine.</P><P>Today there are numerous books and magazines; each has its own responsibility, and each serves its own purpose. Many spiritual teachings and scriptural expositions are helpful, but they are not within our function. Others may do them, but they are not within the limits that the Lord has measured to us. We do not want to step beyond our boundaries and tread upon others' ground. We have seen that the main lack in the church of God today is Christ and Him crucified. This is not only an historical event; this is God's never-changing spiritual principle which He desires His church to confirm in her experience. We consider this as the center of all truths, and all other matters are merely secondary. Therefore, besides specific preaching on the spiritual principles of God, there are no Bible expositions or other such things in our magazine. Those things are good but they are not our task. The Lord is now teaching us not to argue, because once we argue we have fallen from our spiritual position. What is lacking now is life. This is true with individuals as well as with the church as a whole. We are short of the resurrection life of Christ, the life which overcomes death, the grave, and Hades. Today, almost all the terms in the Bible have lost their original meaning. The words are still the same, but what they denote is altogether different. The power which they speak of today is not the power which was spoken of before. The work which they speak of today is not the work which was spoken of before. Formerly, it was man being baptized into the death of Christ, but today baptism has become a religious form. Formerly, laying on of hands was for sympathy, but today it has become a formality. Things which were full of life and spiritual reality have now become mere empty ritual. Even though matters such as preaching the gospel and sending missionaries abroad may be considered quite living, such things as these are very different from the situation in the beginning. Therefore, the need today is to be filled with the life of the Lord in order to obtain spiritual reality. When life comes, all the existing terminologies will then become our experience.</P><P>Our goal, therefore, is fixed on this alone. While many secondary matters are quite urgent, we cannot give our attention to them. We believe that if the children of God are filled with the resurrection life of Christ, they will be able to adequately take care of all secondary matters with ease. However, the basis of resurrection is death; death followed by resurrection is God's principle. Therefore, we repeatedly stress in our preaching the fact and the principle of dying with Christ. We realize that some will accept the principle but ignore the fact, and some will believe the fact but neglect the principle. In either case, their life will become abnormal. If a person disbelieves the fact of dying with Christ, yet acts according to its principle, he commits spiritual suicide. If he does not walk according to the principle of dying with Him, while only believing the fact, his belief is just spiritual ideology. Hence we emphasize both.</P><P>Presently, we know that we are bearing a lonely testimony. In this time when love has grown cold, teachers have increased, and ears are itching, we know that our testimony will be rejected by many. But we also know that our isolation is worthwhile. We reckon that we can afford to be isolated because we are standing on God's side. We thank God that during the past years and days He has given us many friends. We thank you for expressing sympathy towards us. Many have written letters to us to tell us how they have prayed for us.</P><P>During the past two years, we have sent out close to thirty thousand copies of our magazine. Although we have never asked directly or indirectly for help with the cost of printing and postage, the Lord has always moved the hearts of His children to send us contributions to help this publication. We are especially thankful to the Lord for not having received large sums of money or contributions from rich ones. What we have received are offerings of a few dollars and cents from ordinary believers. Since God has provided for us in this way in the past, we believe that He will be faithful in the same way in the future.</P><P>During the past two years, we have sent out a few hundred thousand gospel tracts. At times we have received reports concerning how they have saved people. Although the cost has been high, thank the Lord that we have not been lacking, and not once have we been without means when the bills from the print shop have come; every time we have paid the bills in full. This kind of work is still continuing this year. We hope to send out more tracts than last year. We want to take this opportunity to especially thank those brothers and sisters who have helped us.</P><P>I would like to say a few words concerning the books that I have written which are published by the Gospel Book Room, because there has been some conjecture from those outside. Since the time the Lord called me to serve Him full-time, I have seen one thing: in preaching the gospel for the Lord, there should not be any wages attached. The leprosy that grew on Gehazi's hands is my warning (2 Kings 5:20-27). This is why during the past few years, except for some freewill gifts which some have given to me through the Lord's prompting, I have not received one penny from my speaking or my writing. Although I have written some books, they have not increased my income at all. On the contrary, I have had to put in some of my own money. Such words should not need to be said. But like Paul (with whom I am most unworthy to compare myself ), I have to say a few words. In 2 Corinthians 11:7 and 17, the apostle considered his confession that he "announced the gospel of God to you free of charge" as a speaking that was "not according to the Lord but as if in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting." Yet in 12:11 he said, "I have become foolish; you yourselves have compelled me."</P><P>Allow me to say another frank word for the few sisters and the one brother who are co-working with me here. They have not lived by the support of the Gospel Book Room. They all look directly to God for their sustenance. Although no one knows their need, God has not permitted them to be in debt even until today. Although we the co-workers are like the apostle who had occasions "both to abound and to lack" (Phil. 4:12), in looking back over the past few years, we can only say one word: Ebenezer (1 Sam. 7:12).</P><P>As far as I myself am concerned, I am still partly resting and partly working. Although there are many things which I still cannot do, I have to thank God for what I can do! Concerning the question of the conference, we do not have any plan for now. If there is going to be one, many will want to come, and the lodging will be a problem. Regarding many who have written asking questions on the Bible, frankly speaking, I cannot reply. If I were to answer each question, I would need to open a Bible correspondence course. However, if there are problems concerning spiritual life, I might be able to allot a little time for them.</P><P>Some have asked for my opinion concerning a new translation of the New Testament by a certain place in Nanking. I would say that, in my opinion, it is not as good as the original version published by the Bible Society. At this time of confused voices, it is better for us to be a little more careful concerning any Bible published by private parties.</P><P>We feel most sorrowful concerning the news of the passing away of Miss Barber in Lo-hsing Pagoda, Fukien. She was one who was very deep in the Lord, and in my opinion, the kind of fellowship she had with the Lord and the faithfulness she expressed to the Lord are rarely found on this earth. In reading the hymn published on the cover of this issue of the magazine, one can imagine the kind of person she was.</P><P>The servant of Christ,<br>Watchman Nee<br>March 12, 1930</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SPIRITUAL OR MENTAL</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 13</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:6</H1><P>The word "letter" in 2 Corinthians 3:6 refers to the law. When the law is compared to the Holy Spirit, the former kills because it does not have the life-giving power of the Holy Spirit. The Lord Jesus said, "It is the Spirit who gives life" (John 6:63). Other than the Holy Spirit, nothing can give life to man. God's life is within the Holy Spirit. Our physical world was formed initially through the brooding of the Holy Spirit. The birth of the Lord Jesus and God becoming a man were done through the Holy Spirit. According to the revelation of the Bible, everything that has life and gives life is of the Holy Spirit. The law is only according to the letter; it is not of the Holy Spirit. This is why it is dead.</P><P>Not only does the Old Testament contain "letters" (i.e., the law) that kill, the New Testament also has its "letters." The Old Testament emphasizes the law. The Bible tells us that this law is of God; it is holy and spiritual. But the fact that the Holy Spirit is not within it means that it, like all other literature in the world, has become the letter that kills. Although many truths, commands, exhortations, and teachings in the New Testament are of God and are influential to man's conduct and morality, apart from the power of the Holy Spirit, they are just the letter that kills.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EVERYTHING BEING DEAD AND POWERLESS<br>WITHOUT THE HOLY SPIRIT</H2><P>A truth that has been neglected by many believers is the fact that apart from the Holy Spirit, there is no life. Apart from the Holy Spirit, everything is dead. We have not thoroughly realized that other than a total dependence on the operation of the Holy Spirit, we can do nothing. We admit that the flesh is corrupt, but we have not understood the power of the Holy Spirit. As a result, we may admit as much as we like, but we are still not free from the realm of the flesh. God wants to bring us to the point where we will fully live by the Holy Spirit. He wants us to realize that unless all our work, conduct, prayer, and pursuit of the truth are the result of the Holy Spirit's operation within us, and unless they are produced through the power of the Holy Spirit, they all are dead. To Him, all these are dead works and should remain in the grave.</P><P>God is calling His children today to receive the more abundant life. God wants us to remove death and overcome death. Yet we only pay attention to overcoming sins; we do not pay attention to overcoming death. God is not only delivering us from the law of sin, but also from the law of death (Rom. 8:2). Only the Holy Spirit can give us this life. Where there is no Holy Spirit, there is no life. Instead there is death. A Christian should not merely be one who does not sin, he should also be one who overcomes death and who is filled with life. God hates death as much as He hates sin. Sin separates us from God, while death blocks our fellowship with God. The overcoming of sin is on the negative side, while the filling of life is on the positive side.</P><P>We have to see clearly that everything in Adam is dead and that everything in Christ is living. But in what way is everything living? It is living through the Holy Spirit. "The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." This verse shows us that not only is everything of the flesh dead, but even the perfect law that God has given us is also dead apart from the Holy Spirit. The letter kills.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S WORD AND GOD'S SPIRIT</H2><P>God's Word cannot be separated from God's Spirit. God has written His word into the Bible and has given this Bible to us. At the same time, God has a condition for man to receive His word-he must receive it through the power of His Spirit. God supports His word with His Spirit; He proves His word with His Spirit. His Spirit guarantees that His word will not fail. Those who only contact God's Word without contacting His Spirit will see that God's Word does not have the power. Without God's Spirit, God's Word will become dead letters.</P><P>The Bible tells us that the fleshly person does not understand the things of the Spirit of God; he considers them to be foolish. When an unbeliever studies the Bible by his own wisdom, he finds that the Bible is dead. This does not mean that the Bible is no longer God's word or that it is powerless. It merely means that without the Holy Spirit, the Bible is merely a dead and powerless book to that person.</P><P>The Word of God does not change. However, for some it is life, while for others it is just letters. Where is the distinction? The distinction lies in the fact that the former receive God's Word by the power of the Holy Spirit, while the latter understand God's Word with the wisdom of the mind. God's word is powerful and living, but if man receives it into his mind, the truth will merely become thoughts in man's mind. These truths will certainly not produce any effect on him. When need arises, he will not be able to apply them. Although he may know the reason, the fact, and the history, and although he may be well acquainted with God's promises, he will not receive the power in them. These truths will not be truths to him; they will only be empty teachings to him. The reason for this is that he cannot prove the reality of these truths. If we want to know if a believer is receiving God's Word by the power of the Holy Spirit, all we have to ask is whether or not the word that he has received is producing any power in him. God gives the Holy Spirit to the believers to verify His Word. Hence, whenever God's Word is not verified, it is because there is the lack of the power of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>The present danger is for believers to listen to sermons, study the Bible, and seek after the truth only by the wisdom of the mind. God has joined together His Word with His Spirit. However, man either separates His Spirit from His Word, or separates His Word from His Spirit. The error of the two is the same. To take God's Spirit away from God's Word will make everything a person receives theoretical, while to take God's Word away from God's Spirit will make a person's conduct very peculiar. However, more people fall into the trap of the former than of the latter.</P><P>Many people study the Bible like studying a science book. They think that as long as they have a sharp mind, proper instruction from others, and diligent labor on their part, they will understand the Bible. Research and study may make them understand a little of the history and doctrines of the Bible, but they will not make them experience the power of God's Word. We must be brought by God to the point where we read His Word by His Spirit and understand His truth by His power. Only the Holy Spirit can apply God's Word and the life-power in His Word to a believer. Those who receive the truth with their mind will not see this life and power.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION</H2><P>What is the distinction between receiving the truth by the Holy Spirit and receiving the truth by the mind?</P><P>First, anyone who receives the truth from a book, a teacher, or even from the Bible itself without praying, dropping his own strength, and relying on the Holy Spirit is receiving the truth by his mind. The meaning of receiving the truth by the mind is to receive the truth directly from books, teachers, and the Bible without going through the Holy Spirit. The Pharisees understood the Bible directly in this way. This is why all they had was dead; they did not have a living experience before God. God's Word is to draw men to God, and God Himself is Spirit. Therefore, without God's Spirit, the reading of God's Word alone will not put one into contact with God.</P><P>Second, the Galatians, who believed in the gospel, later turned back to the keeping of the law. Paul then asked them, "Did you receive the Spirit out of the works of law or out of the hearing of faith?" (Gal. 3:2). The apostle said that they had begun in faith but were now trusting in their works. The apostle asked them another question, "Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?" (v. 3). The apostle said that they had begun by the Spirit, but now they were trusting in the flesh. From these two questions, we discover one very important principle: everything that issues from the Holy Spirit is by faith, and everything that issues from the flesh is by works. The Holy Spirit is joined to faith in the same way that the flesh is joined to works.</P><P>Hence, there is a great difference between pursuing the truth by the mind and pursuing the truth by the Holy Spirit. This difference is that one does not require faith, while the other requires faith.</P><P>In order to receive the truth by the Holy Spirit, one has to have faith. To receive by the mind merely causes one to understand, but to receive by the Holy Spirit causes one to believe. Let us consider an example. The believers' death with Christ is the source of Christians' life and power. We have emphasized this and have preached much on this. This truth is understood by many believers, and many have risen up to testify for this truth. But how many have really received this truth by the Holy Spirit? Many people's tone of voice has exposed their true experience. I know one brother who thinks that he knows the truth of co-death very well. Once while he was preaching, he told others that they should die and that if, at times, they could not die, they should put themselves to death by the power of the cross. These words seem spiritual, but actually they are misleading. These words show that he only understands the matter of co-death in his mind and has not received the power of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>What do I mean? If a man wants to experience the power of the Holy Spirit in reality, he must first have faith. The Holy Spirit will only work when man believes in God's Word. Faith comes first, and the work of the Holy Spirit in man follows. If a man does not have faith, all the truth that he knows will only be ideas. The Holy Spirit will not make the accomplishments of the truth real in him.</P><P>Let us return to the question of co-death. The Bible teaches us that when Christ died, He already included us in His death. Just as Christ's dying for us is a fact, our dying with Christ is also a fact. Our death is as real as Christ's death. Just as we are delivered from punishment by believing in the death of Christ, so we are delivered from the power of sin through believing in our death with Christ. The Word of God teaches us this. Now it is up to us to believe. If we believe, the Holy Spirit will testify for God's Word and will cause sin to not lord it over us in our experience. Only when we have reached this stage can we say that we have received the truth by the Holy Spirit.</P><P>Here we see the order of receiving the truth by the Holy Spirit: first, the teaching of the Bible; second, the faith of the believer; and third, the work of the Holy Spirit. None of the three can be missing. Those who receive with their mind do not have faith. After they have studied the truth themselves or have heard it from others, they begin to understand the reasoning behind co-death. They begin to know that a dead man is free from sin. But they do not have faith, and they do not clearly see the position their old man occupies in the death of Christ. As a result, they cannot say that they are those who are already crucified with Christ. In their conduct, they still strive to put themselves to death. When they exhort others, they unconsciously say, "You should die." Even when they become more advanced and understand the reality of their death with Christ, they may acknowledge with their mouth that they have been crucified, but in their conduct they are still crucifying themselves more than trusting in the accomplished crucifixion on the cross of Christ.</P><P>Third, if a truth is received in the power of the Holy Spirit, that truth will surely become a person's experience. The purpose of the Holy Spirit revealing a truth to the believers is not to furnish them with more material for the mind, but to lead them into the content of the truth. Mental apprehension may result in an admiration for the truth, but it will not cause a person to receive help from that truth. Many people agree with certain truths and love them, but these truths remain only in their heads. If a truth does not have power within a person, then the truth is only in his head, and the power of the Holy Spirit is not there.</P><P>We must see the difference and relationship between principle and application. Many principles must be revealed through the Holy Spirit. However, the facts have accumulated and teachers multiplied; this makes it possible for many people to understand the principles of spiritual life through these means. This understanding, however, is in the mind. In order to apply these principles to life, one has to rely on the Holy Spirit. The mind can understand the principles, but only the Holy Spirit can turn these principles into applications. In algebra, it is easy for a person to solve an equation, but it is hard for a person to express a problem in an equation. In the same way, it is easy to learn a spiritual principle. But it is beyond the ability of the mind to apply such a principle to life. Those who study geography can tell you the general conditions of great metropolitan cities and of agricultural and commercial communities of the world as well. But they may have never once stepped outside of their door. A man can understand much through searching the Scriptures with his mind. But unless he depends on the Holy Spirit, he will not have any experience.</P><P>The present danger is that many seek after biblical knowledge; they understand many mysteries, and they are able to grasp many spiritual principles. They can find out the deeper meaning of things in God's Word, and they have a certain amount of realization concerning the accomplished work of Christ. Yet, all these things remain in their head; they are not given to them by the Holy Spirit. As a result, they do not have the power to put these things into practice. This makes the Bible the same as any other science book; no contact is made between the writer and reader. Actually, even though God's words have been spoken and recorded in the Bible, these words, like God Himself, are found in the Holy Spirit. If a reader receives God's Word directly without trusting in the power of the Holy Spirit, nothing will happen between him and God. This will diminish the value of the Bible and turn the Bible into another dead book like those in the world. Although an understanding of the Bible will somewhat clarify a person's thoughts and concepts, it has no practical effect on the spiritual life and work of a person. This explains why many have preached the truth, but the truth is powerless in them as well as in their hearers. If a truth remains only in the mind of the speaker, it will for sure remain only in the mind of the hearer.</P><P>It is useless to have the truth without the Spirit of truth. When the Lord Jesus told the disciples that He was the truth, He went on to tell them that the Spirit of truth would come to lead them into all the truth. A believer is joined to the truth through the Spirit of truth. Otherwise, truth will still be the truth, and a believer will still be a believer. Just as the disciples were not able to understand and experience Christ in a real way before they received the Holy Spirit, the believers today will not be able to understand and experience God's Word in a real way if they do not trust in the power of the Holy Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TRUE SPIRITUAL WORK</H2><P>Many messages today are filled with profound words and spiritual teachings; they are orthodox in faith and they have satisfying explanations. They may even be quite moving and affect the hearers' conduct and morality. Yet these messages can be something that issues from man's wisdom rather than from the Holy Spirit. We must realize that the proverbs spoken by profound men throughout the ages can also encourage and change people. But these proverbs are not the result of the work of the Holy Spirit. I am afraid that many messages produce desirable results, even though they are not the work of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>A man must be annulled, turned to nothing, and terminated on the cross. God is everything. He has everything, and He can do everything. Consequently, He should do everything. Everything should be done in the power of the Holy Spirit. Some may think that to do so would annul man and cause great loss to God's work. Some think that it would cause God's work to come to a halt, and the fruit would be diminished. But what we really want is fruit before God and genuine spiritual work. Only this will bring in the greatest spiritual benefit. Works produced by man's wisdom may bring in prosperity in other areas, but they will not have spiritual worth, nor will they be of use in God's hand. Works that truly belong to God can only be accomplished by the Holy Spirit. The less ground man occupies, the more the power of the Holy Spirit will be manifest. There is more spiritual value to five minutes of work by the Holy Spirit than one hundred years of labor by us. Why labor day and night to get nothing? Why not wait for the Lord to come and give the order and then bring in a full net of fish?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PLACE OF MENTAL ABILITY</H2><P>Is man's mental ability completely useless with respect to God's truth? No. The mind has its place. We should differentiate between man's mind and the function of his mind. It is the Holy Spirit who reveals the truth, and it is the renewed human spirit that receives the revelation of the Holy Spirit. Only the renewed human spirit can receive revelation. The mind cannot be the organ to receive revelation. The function of the mind is only to communicate revelation. A renewed mind can help a person communicate to others the truth he has received through revelation. But the mind itself cannot discover God's truth. An unrenewed mind may hinder a man in his work of communication, but if this man's spirit is renewed, nothing will hinder him from receiving revelation. God has annihilated the old creation. Natural shortcomings will not stop a person from receiving revelations, and natural virtues will not help a person to receive revelations. A brilliant mind may help a person in his communication, but it will never give him or others revelations. Moreover, we have to remember that one who communicates to others receives nothing himself through such communications.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE VANITY OF NATURAL ABILITIES</H2><P>Many teachers of God's Word are able to search, understand, and convey some truths to others through their extraordinary natural talents. They may even be able to render help to many people. But in reality, they have not accomplished anything that is of any true spiritual value. Those who are naturally brilliant have often become the teachers of those who are naturally slow. But many times their spiritual conditions are the same. At other times the teachers are even worse spiritually than those who are being taught.</P><P>A very dangerous condition exists in the church today: many people become famous and exalted not because their spiritual condition is better than others, but because they exceed others in natural talents. I am not referring only to those who possess mere worldly knowledge and who are wise in the world; I fear that even some who are renowned in Christianity are in the same condition. Today many Bible teachers and church leaders do not become successful and powerful leaders through knowing the Holy Spirit more than others, but through their bright talent and intellect and through their application of such talent and intellect in biblical and spiritual matters. Many spiritual things are not spiritual at all because the Holy Spirit is not in them! They are merely spiritual thoughts in the mind. Many teachings and sermons are just the results of research; they are not lessons taught by the Holy Spirit. Naturally, they can only render help to the mental thoughts of others.</P><P>Many people think that as long as they can apply their natural talents to suitable use, they will perform works that glorify God. But natural talents are just natural talents; they will not please God even if they are applied to spiritual works. The Holy Spirit can use man's natural talents, but such talents must be fully subject to the Holy Spirit. God needs men who are filled with the Holy Spirit more than anything else. We must be clear whether it is our sharper-than-usual mind or our true knowledge of the Spirit of God that qualifies us to lead others on.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INDISPENSABILITY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</H2><P>God wants us to have the deep realization that just as the Bible is the inspiration of the Holy Spirit; therefore, the Bible requires the revelation of the Holy Spirit. Just as the Bible was written by men moved by the Holy Spirit, the Bible is to be read by men moved by the Holy Spirit. Just as the Bible was written by the Holy Spirit, it also needs the enlightening of the Holy Spirit. God wants us to realize that even the clearest exposition of the Scriptures is not reliable. Our ability should come from the Holy Spirit alone. Although human wisdom will make a person understand the truth in the Bible, it will not bring to that person the benefit of that truth.</P><P>Many people seek after the truth with wrong motives. Either they try to understand the truth for the sake of satisfying their intellectual craving, or they do so in order to prepare sermons to teach others. Their goal is to solve the problems in their intellects, not the nourishment of their own spiritual life. Since this is their motive, they feel gratified once they have understood something in their mind; they think that they can teach others and see no more need to seek after spiritual reality.</P><P>We have to see that a man is saved only by the Holy Spirit, the truth can be understood only by the Holy Spirit, prayer is answered only when it is offered through the Holy Spirit, and our spiritual life will grow only by trusting in the Holy Spirit. Only after we have realized this will we believe and trust in the Holy Spirit. How many times have we truly sought for God's light? I am afraid that only a few people have really prayed for God to give them light. I am afraid that more time has been spent on thinking, researching, and pursuing than on praying. This is why many believers are dry in their spiritual life even though they understand many truths.</P><P>In modern preaching, man emphasizes mental consent more than life in the spirit. We have to realize that works which are truly worthwhile are accomplished in man's spirit, not in man's mind. God only recognizes one kind of work-the work that His Spirit performs within the spirit of man, when Christ's life is infused into man's spirit. This is true with respect to the initial work as well as to the later work that He does in giving us the more abundant life. Mere mental consent without the infusion of Christ's life is empty work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S DISCIPLINE</H2><P>This lesson is most difficult to learn. When man's flesh rebels against God, it likes to sin and does not submit to God's law. But when a man tries to please God, he stands independent from God and thinks that he can serve Him without receiving any power from Him. Therefore, man will never trust in God's Holy Spirit. Even in the pursuit of truth, he thinks that his own wisdom is sufficient. God is thus forced to allow His children to pass through many painful experiences so that they will know that everything they gain through self-strength and self-wisdom will not be of any help to them or others. In this way they are willing to deny all fleshly power that comes from themselves and seek after the Holy Spirit and His power. Many works are prosperous at the beginning, but as time goes on they are not as glamorous and even gradually die down. This causes the workers to realize that their work is wrong in some aspect. The glamour caused by the flesh is but temporary. God is leading His workers to realize the vanity and uselessness of their works so that they would have a new beginning in the Holy Spirit. How painful are such experiences!</P><P>There are many other believers who think that they have much understanding. They think that they can be more than conquerors through these truths. Yet they still fail most of the time! Although they struggle to hold on to these truths, it is to no avail. When warfare comes, the truths that they know become but weapons of hay and stubble. They weep and cry. Is it the truth of God that is wrong, or is it something else that is wrong? God wants them to realize that the sword of the Holy Spirit can only be brandished by the Holy Spirit Himself; the flesh using the weapons of the Holy Spirit is as unsuitable as David putting on Saul's armor. Although these believers have understood the truths in their head, they have not put these truths into their lives through the Holy Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PROCESS OF RECEIVING THE TRUTH</H2><P>God's truth comes to the believers in two phases. One may say that it has two comings: (1) to the head and (2) to the spirit. The coming to the spirit is often later than the coming to the head, sometimes as late as a few months or a year. Once God has given a truth to a believer, that is, after the believer has understood the truth in his mind, God will work in the environment and lead the believer to the point where he can only overcome through such a truth. Only then will the believer know this truth in the power of the Holy Spirit, and only then will he have the full experience. But unfortunately, after a believer has understood God's truth in his head, he feels satisfied and does not seek after the full experience. Instead, he goes to teach others this truth, making it harder for God to bring him into the reality of the truth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO MISTAKE IN HAVING OR NOT HAVING THE POWER</H2><P>We need to constantly realize one thing: the Holy Spirit is full of life and power. Therefore, everything that is of the Holy Spirit should be full of life and power. When we see a person who knows a certain truth but has not received any help in life or increase in power, who merely has some beautiful thoughts which enable him to analyze things but do not help him in times of fierce temptations, we have to doubt if he has the work of the Holy Spirit. We should not think that words which are full of meaning are necessarily good. We must seek the power of the Holy Spirit. Many times men speak about the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, yet they do not have the power of the Holy Spirit. What believers lack is the life of God, not anything else.</P><P>The interesting thing is that if a man understands God's truth with his mind, he has to hold on to this truth all the time. But if he understands the truth by the power of the Holy Spirit and keeps this truth by the power of the Holy Spirit, in a time of need, he will not need to hold on to it like a drowning man grasping for a rope for help. Instead, the Holy Spirit will cause the truth to lay hold of him and deliver him. The difference is most clear.</P><P>Even God's truth is dead if it is separated from God's Spirit. Just as man's life cannot be interrupted for a moment, the power from the Holy Spirit must also be constantly renewed and must continue all the time. What He has done once cannot become a guarantee that He will do the same thing every time. Every time we contact Him, we only receive the strength for that time. There is no once-for-all experience in our dealing with the Holy Spirit. Therefore, in receiving the truth of God, we have to trust in the power of the Holy Spirit all the time. For example, when we hear about others' spiritual experiences, it is very natural for us to imitate them and wish that God would lead us in the same way and grant us the same results. However, we are often disappointed. The reason for this is that others' experiences are of the Holy Spirit, but our encounter is only of the mind. God has to disappoint us all the time so that we will seek after Him directly through the Holy Spirit. All imitations from the mind are futile. Even to quote verses from the Bible will not make any difference. The Bible is inspired by the Holy Spirit. We may think that by quoting more Scriptures we will have the strength. Actually, this never happens. The Holy Spirit must repeat the word to us again before the power will be there.</P><P>Therefore, what we must now pursue is the Holy Spirit's dispensing of life to us through the truth. We should seek after His revelation and application and allow Him to move the truth from our head into our spirit. Let us fully trust in God's Word. Let us wholeheartedly believe that all of His words are real and not be satisfied with the knowledge of biblical theories.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ONE DIED FOR ALL,<br>THEREFORE ALL DIED</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 14</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 5:14</H1><P> When Christ was incarnated, He included all flesh in Him. Just as the act of one man, Adam, represents the acts of all mankind, in the same way, the work of one man, Christ, represents the work of all mankind. Only after we have seen that Christ includes all mankind will we understand the meaning of redemption. When the one man, Adam, sinned, all men past and present also sinned. This is because Adam was the head of the human race, and all men were born of Adam. In the same way, when Christ was justified, all men past and present were justified, because Christ is the Head of the new human race. All men in the new human race are born of Christ.</P><P>Hebrews 7 quotes one incident which illustrates this point. In order to prove that the priesthood of Melchisedec was greater than that of the Levites, the apostle mentioned how Abraham paid tithes to Melchisedec and how Abraham received the blessing from Melchisedec. This proves that Melchisedec was greater than the Levites. How did he prove this? "For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him" (v. 10). We know that Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Levi. Levi is the great-grandson of Abraham. When Abraham tithed and received the blessing, Levi was not yet born. Even his father and grandfather were not born. But the Bible considers Abraham's tithing and receiving of the blessing as Levi's tithing and receiving of the blessing. Since Abraham is inferior to Melchisedec, Levi also has to be inferior to Melchisedec. This fact explains why, when Adam sinned, all sinned, and when Christ was judged, all were judged. The reason for this is that when Adam sinned, all men were already in Adam, and when Christ was judged, the life of all the regenerated sinners was already in Christ. Therefore, when Christ was judged for man's sin, all those who believe in Him were also judged. As a result, all those who believe in Him need not be judged anymore.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE WAR BETWEEN<br>THE NEW AND THE OLD</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 14</H2><P>After a believer is regenerated, he should know two very important things: how much he has gained through regeneration and how much of his natural disposition remains. This knowledge will keep him advancing along his spiritual pathway. We now need to explain what man's flesh includes and how the Lord Jesus has dealt with the elements of the flesh in His redemption. In other words, we want to see what a believer has received at the time of regeneration.</P><P>Romans 7:14 says, "I am fleshy, sold under sin." Verses 17 and 18 say, "Sin...dwells in me...that is, in my flesh." From these two verses we can see that the flesh is composed of "sin" and "I." This "sin" is the power of sins, while the "I" is what we usually call the self. If a believer wants to understand what spiritual life is, he must make a clear distinction between these two components of the flesh.</P><P>We know that the Lord Jesus dealt with the sin in our flesh on the cross. Therefore, the Bible tells us that "our old man has been crucified with Him" (Rom. 6:6). The Bible never tells us to be crucified concerning sin because this is something that Christ has fully accomplished. There is no more need for man to do anything concerning sin. Therefore, the Bible tells us to reckon ourselves to be dead to sin (v. 11). In this way we can receive the effectiveness of the death of Christ and can be fully delivered from the power of sin (v. 14).</P><P>Although the Bible never tells us to be crucified for our sins, it does tell us to bear the cross in regard to the self. The Lord Jesus mentioned many times that we have to deny our self and bear the cross to follow Him. The reason for this is that there is a difference between the Lord's dealing with our sins on the cross and His dealing with our self on the cross. We know that it was only after the Lord went to the cross that He bore our sins. He did not bear them before this time. However, He did not just deny Himself after He went to the cross; instead, He denied Himself all the time He was on earth. A believer can overcome sin in a minute, but he must deny himself for his whole lifetime.</P><P>Galatians makes clear to us these two aspects of the relationship between the flesh and the believers. On the one hand, it tells us that "they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts" (5:24). This means that on the day a person begins to belong to Christ, his flesh is crucified. If a man has not been taught by the Holy Spirit, he may think that there is no more flesh because it has been already crucified. But the Bible tells us to "walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh" (vv. 16-17). These verses clearly show us that a person who belongs to Christ and who has the Holy Spirit dwelling in him still has the flesh. Not only is the flesh still present, but it is particularly powerful. Why is this? Do these two passages contradict one another? No, they do not. Verse 24 deals particularly with the aspect of sin in the flesh, while verse 17 deals particularly with the aspect of the self in the flesh. The cross of Christ deals with sin, while the Holy Spirit deals with the self through the cross. Through the cross Christ has freed the believers completely from the power of sin so that sin will no longer lord it over them. Through the Holy Spirit, Christ is dwelling within the believers so that they can overcome the self day by day and fully obey Him. Victory over sin is an accomplished fact, while victory over the self is a work that is being accomplished day by day.</P><P>If a believer understands the full salvation of the cross, he will, at the time of regeneration, (i.e., at the time he receives Jesus as his Savior) be completely free from sin on the one hand, and receive a new life on the other hand. Unfortunately, many workers have not presented God's full salvation to the sinner. As a result, the sinner only believes in a half-salvation and only receives a half-salvation. His sins are indeed forgiven, but he does not have the power to overcome sin. Sometimes the way of salvation is indeed fully preached, but the fact that a believer only desires the grace of forgiveness without sincerely desiring the power to overcome sin, also results in his only receiving a half-salvation.</P><P>If one believes and receives full salvation at the time of his regeneration, he will have little experience of being defeated when battling with sin and more experience of battling with the self. But very few believers are like this. Although we cannot say how many are like this, we can say that the number is very small. Most believers receive only a half-salvation; therefore, most of their battle is with sin. Some do not even know what the self is at the time of their regeneration.</P><P>This has something to do with the experience of a person before his regeneration. Many people have the inclination for doing good even before they are regenerated. Of course, they do not have the power which enables them to do good. Although their conscience is relatively clear, they have little strength to do good, and conflict becomes inevitable. This is what the world calls the conflict between reason and lust. After these people hear about full salvation, they sincerely receive the grace of victory over sin in the same way that they receive the grace of forgiveness from sin. But other people have a darkened conscience before they believe, and they are very sinful. They have never tried to do good. When they hear about full salvation, they naturally lay hold of the grace of forgiveness and neglect (but not reject) the grace of victory over sin. This kind of people invariably experiences conflict with the sin in the flesh after being regenerated.</P><P>Why is this? The reason for this is that as soon as a man is regenerated and receives the new life, this life will turn him away from the reign of the flesh to submit to this new life. God's life is absolute, and it will not stop until it gains full control over a person. Once it enters a person's spirit, it will free him from his former master -sin -and will bring him into full obedience to the Holy Spirit. However, sin is deeply rooted in man. Although man's will is renewed through the regenerated life, his will is still joined to sin and self, and many times it still inclines toward sin. For this reason, a great conflict exists between the new life and the flesh. Because many people experience this conflict, we will pay special attention to this experience. But we have to remind the readers that such prolonged conflict with sin (note, not self) and such defeats are unnecessary.</P><P>The flesh wants total domination. The spiritual life also requires total domination. The flesh demands that man belong to it forever, while the spiritual life demands that man fully submit to the Holy Spirit. The flesh and the spiritual life are different in every way. The nature of the flesh is of the first Adam, while the nature of the spiritual life is of the last Adam. The motives of the flesh are earthly, while the intentions of the spiritual life are heavenly. The flesh takes itself as the center for everything, while the spiritual life takes Christ as the center for everything. Since they are so different, it is inevitable that man often comes into conflict with the flesh. The flesh induces man to sin, while the spiritual life induces man to righteousness. After a believer is regenerated, there is always this experience of conflict within him because of his ignorance of the full salvation of Christ.</P><P>A young believer is often bewildered at this kind of conflict within him. As a result, some become discouraged. They consider themselves to be too evil and feel that it is impossible to advance any further. Some even begin to doubt the genuineness of their regeneration. Little do they realize that they experience such conflicts precisely because they are regenerated. Originally the flesh was reigning, and there was no hindrance to its reign at all. Moreover, because their spirit was dead, they did not feel sinful even though they committed many sins. Now the new life has come in, bringing with it a heavenly nature with a new intention, new light, and a new will. Once this new light enters into man, it exposes the true vileness and corruption in man. The new intention surely does not want to remain forever in corruption and vileness; it wants to walk according to God's will. The flesh naturally fights with the spiritual life. Such conflict causes a believer to think that there are two persons within him, each having their own opinion and strength, and each vying to overcome the other. If he goes along with the spiritual life to overcome, he will feel much joy. If his flesh prevails, he will feel condemned. This kind of experience proves that a person is already regenerated.</P><P>God's goal is not to reform the flesh, but to destroy it. God gives His life to man at the time of regeneration in order to destroy the self in the flesh through His life. Although the life God gives to man is very powerful, a regenerated person is just like a newborn baby; he is still very weak. Because the flesh has reigned for so long, it has become very powerful. In addition, the person has not yet laid hold of God's full salvation by faith. At such times, though a man is regenerated, he is still fleshly. The meaning of being fleshly is to be ruled by the flesh. It is most pitiful for a believer to be regenerated, to be enlightened by the heavenly light, to realize the evil of his flesh, and to fully desire to overcome his flesh, yet be unable to do these things because of the feebleness of his strength. This is the time when tears flow the most and sorrow is the greatest. Every regenerated person invariably has some new aspiration to eradicate sins and please God. Yet the will is not strong enough and is often overcome by the flesh. As a result we see more failures than victories. How could one not feel remorse?</P><P>The experience Paul described in Romans 7 is a story of the conflict during this stage. "For what I work out, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do...For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not. For I do not do the good which I will; but the evil which I do not will, this I practice...I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me. For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man, but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members" (vv. 15, 18-19, 21-23). His final sighing should find an echo in the hearts of many people with similar experiences: "Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?" (v. 24).</P><P>What is the meaning of this warfare? This warfare is one aspect of the discipline of the Holy Spirit. God has a full salvation prepared for man. But man fails to obtain it either through ignorance or through an unwillingness to obtain it. God can only give man what he believes in, what he accepts, and what he claims specifically. Therefore, when man asks for forgiveness and regeneration, God forgives and regenerates him. By this way of warfare, God makes the believers seek and lay hold of the full victory in Christ. If believers do not have full victory because they do not know about it, they will seek to know about it after such warfare. In this way, the Holy Spirit will have the chance to reveal to them the way Christ dealt with the old man on the cross. He will cause them to believe and receive. If a believer will not receive full victory because he does not want it, all the truth he has is merely in his head. He will realize after this warfare that mere knowledge is useless; through constant failure, he will be made to aspire to experience the truth that he already knows.</P><P>This kind of warfare increases as time goes on. If believers will not lose heart, but will faithfully press on, there will be more fierce warfare ahead of them. Such warfare will not stop until the believers are fully delivered.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A PERSONAL LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 15</H2><P>Dear Brothers and Sisters!</P><P>My heart rejoices at the sending out of another issue of The Present Testimony. I believe that the desperate need today is to testify of the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. Our hope is that God's children will fully overcome sin, the world, and the devil in this age through applying the accomplishment of Christ's death and resurrection, to the extent that we all can testify that our Lord is indeed living and resurrected. A defeated life has no testimony, no matter how much truth the mind has received. For this reason (and actually, for more than this, that is, for the glory of God) we send out this issue of our magazine. Our attitude, however, is not one of preaching from a high position to those below. No! We are preaching to ourselves as well. In fact we are first preaching to ourselves. It is for our mutual exhortation that we have written these pages. We are not saying that we have already obtained or that we are already perfect. We are still pursuing with thousands of other children of God and are pressing together toward the mark. Whatever our personal achievements may be, we believe that the following pages contain the truths, and not only so, but truths that our hearts treasure. I hope that my readers will read this issue of the magazine with prayer and that they will truly gain what it says.</P><P>I will also take this opportunity to say a few words concerning myself. This letter is written in Kuling, Kiangsi. Through the love of a Western missionary in Nanking, I was able to secure a quiet and cool house here. The year before last, she was willing to let me use this house, and this year she allowed me to use it again. I am so thankful for this. Because of my psychological and physical needs, I cannot live in the low plains during the summer. It is also necessary for me to spend some time every year quietly before the Lord to learn to pray and receive revelations. I thank many of God's children as well as my co-workers for caring for me and tending to my needs in such a special way so that I have no lack here. I know that in the summer, many readers will want to come up to the mountain. I hope that they will come and visit me. The best time is from ten o'clock in the morning until twelve noon. At other times I am occupied by other affairs. My room number is 103.</P><P>As far as other matters about myself are concerned, I believe that my friends' advice, my work schedule, and my health have all caused me to consider some changes. After long periods of prayer and consideration, I feel that I am beginning to be somewhat clear. But I still do not know about God's actual arrangement for my future.</P><P>I have a deep feeling that God's children do not have a living experience of Christ. This is why they are not willing to spend and be spent for the sinners. The Lord Jesus is coming soon, and there is the urgent need to proclaim God's testimony concerning His Son. My dear ones, consider what lowly worms we are. Yet God, the Creator, has called us to participate in the rejection of His Son. What a wonder this is! How few are such opportunities, and how short the time! It is hard to say if today is the last day. Who can say that the Lord will not receive His children back to His home? For this reason, we need to seek after His lost sheep in an unprecedented way. God has only one Son, and He was a preacher! Should we not be the same?</P><P>As for those who possess wealth in this world, I exhort you to offer generously to the Lord. I feel most sorry that many rich ones who ought to offer hundreds of dollars are only offering a few dollars and a few dimes! The poor ones offer more than the rich! Yet God's work is suffering, while the rich ones' silver and gold are corroding! God's workers are lacking, and the bottoms of their wallets are often empty. Yet the rich ones are still gathering money for needs that will never come! We know that we will be judged for how we use our money as well as how we do not use our money. Of course, I am not advising you to offer it to unprofitable works, because many workers are no longer God's workers, and many works are no longer God's works. What I am saying is that we should care for those who are genuinely going out "on behalf of the Name..., taking nothing from the Gentiles"-those who live by the Lord. According to my knowledge, there are at least a few dozen people in China now who are of this kind. How great are their needs! Yet the rich believers have not cared for them.</P><P>The next issue will follow immediately after this issue. We pray that the Lord will bless it! Brothers, I most earnestly need your prayers. Please pray for me in faith continually. Peace be to you!</P><P>The servant of Christ,<br>Watchman Nee<br>June 17, 1930</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE EXTENT<br>OF THE BELIEVER'S SALVATION</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 15</H2><P>We all know that we are sinners and that we have eternal life through faith. Today we want to see to what extent God saves us through Jesus Christ. In other words, to what extent will our person be saved by God through Jesus Christ?</P><P>In the last two or three years, I have noticed one thing: I have felt that there is definitely something wrong with my personal Christian life. When I read the Bible, I confess that I do not have what the Bible says. Although the Christian life of some seems to be worse than mine, and although some who have deeper experiences have answered my questions by saying that I have already attained, I still feel that I do not have what the Bible says. Thank God! Now I know! Indeed there are better things in Christ. Indeed these better things can be obtained and can be obtained even now.</P><P>So, today what I want to talk about is the extent of our heritage in Christ Jesus. This is not about the future heritage in heaven-something which we will have in the future. We are not talking about eternal life-something which we have through regeneration. We are not talking about the glory in the kingdom-something which will be ours in the millennium to come. Rather, we want to emphasize the extent to which God can save us as persons today.</P><P>Let us read some verses in the Bible. We will read them one by one as we move along. We want to see the extent to which God can save us today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. CONSCIENCE</H2><P>Hebrews 9:14 says, "How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?" This verse speaks of the extent to which Christ saves our conscience. His blood can purge our conscience from dead works.</P><P>Brothers and sisters! Please ask yourselves today if there are still accusations in your conscience. If from time to time there are still accusations in your conscience, then what you have obtained is not yet complete. The Lord saves us, and His blood purges our conscience. Our conscience can be purified by His blood from every kind of self-accusation. When we gather together, we pray, "O God! We thank You that our hearts have been sprinkled from an evil conscience." But many times we still feel uneasy. What we have done is just a cover-up and a mental gloss-over. But the blood of God's Son does purify. If your conscience still accuses you, it does not mean that God's salvation cannot save you to that extent. It merely means that the salvation which you have received is not yet complete. Thank and praise God! He can save us to such an extent! It is possible for our conscience to be purified.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. HEART</H2><P>Mark 7:21-23 says, "For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil reasonings, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, foolishness. All these wicked things proceed from within and defile the man." Also Matthew 5:8 says, "Blessed are the pure in heart." These two verses speak of the original defiled condition of our heart. They also tell us how Christ can save our heart to the extent of being pure.</P><P>Brothers and sisters! The heart mentioned in Mark is our natural heart. What about this heart? The Lord said that all evil things come from men's heart. All these evils are from the heart. But the Lord said, "Blessed are the pure in heart." The Lord is able to save such a bad heart to the extent of being pure.</P><P>The salvation of our heart does not mean the suppression of the inward evils so that they do not break loose. The salvation of our heart means that our heart is cleansed from within. If we plan to cover up or seal up, this is not salvation, because we have not been saved by God to the extent of being pure. We have to ask God, "How many evil thoughts are there in my heart? How much deceit? How much jealousy? How much pride?" If all these are merely suppressed inside us and we are merely covering them up tightly, our heart has not been saved. What God says is, "Blessed are the pure in heart!"</P><P>Today our shortcomings, problems, and lack of testimony are due to the fact that our heart has not been cleansed to that extent. Many times we see someone sin, but we dare not reproach him, because we realize that this person's outward condition is but the blossoming of sin; the seed of this blossom is also in his heart. Although we do not love the world like some, our hearts are nevertheless affected. We are no different from others. When we do not have a pure heart, we do not have a testimony.</P><P>God would not leave any filthiness in our heart. Even a heart that is as evil as the one mentioned in Mark can be saved by God to the extent of being clean. God can save us until we have a pure heart. We praise and thank God that He can save us to such an extent! He can deliver such an evil heart to become a pure heart.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. HEART, SOUL, MIND, AND STRENGTH</H2><P>Mark 12:30-31 says, "`And you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.' The second is this: `You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'" These verses say that God can save us to such an extent that we love God with all. He can also save us to the extent that we love others unselfishly.</P><P>How difficult it is to love God with all! Oftentimes we want to love God, but we secretly want to love the world as well. We want to serve God, and we also want to serve mammon. Oftentimes the love in our heart toward God is distracted by many people and many things. But God can save us to the extent of loving God "with all." We can love God with all our heart, with all our soul, with all our mind and with all our strength. God can even save us so that we not only love God, but we also love others without any selfishness at all.</P><P>Brothers and sisters! If we cannot love God to the extent of "with all," if there are still other persons, other objects, or other things besides God as the center of our love, and moreover, if we cannot love others as ourselves in addition to loving God, then the salvation we have obtained is not complete. Christ can save us to such an extent that we can love God "with all" and we can love others unselfishly. This is possible. We praise Him!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. MIND</H2><P>Second Corinthians 11:3 says, "But I fear lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your thoughts would be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity toward Christ." This verse implies that our mind can be saved to the extent of being "simple and pure."</P><P>Many times we want to obey the Lord, consecrate to the Lord, and only love the Lord. But how difficult this is! It is very, very difficult because we do not have the strength. We often find ourselves failing. We wish we could love the Lord with all our love. We wish our heart towards the Lord would be simple, without corruption, and single and pure. How good such a condition would be! We hope for this experience, but it seems that it can hardly be realized. However, God can save us to such a degree. This is possible. This can be done. Our heart must be simple and pure. If we are always double-minded, we will be like Eve. On the one hand, Eve saw that the fruit was good for food and, on the other hand, she was reminded of what God said about not eating the fruit. On the one hand, she saw that the fruit was pleasant to the eyes and was to be desired; on the other hand, she thought of God's commandment of not eating. Her heart was moved, and once she loved the fruit, she ate it. For just an instant and by a slight deviation, Eve lost her simplicity and purity toward Christ.</P><P>Brothers and sisters! Do we want a simple and pure heart toward Christ? We should love Him! We should not be afraid of loving Him too much. We should love Him unreservedly and love Him without reasoning. Praise and thank God that He can save us to such an extent that we have a simple and pure heart toward Christ! This is possible!</P><P>Romans 12:2 says, "And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect." This verse tells us that God can save our mind to the extent that we are transformed by its renewing and that we can prove the will of God.</P><P>Brothers and sisters! Have you ever thought about this? A renewed mind is able to prove the good, well pleasing, and perfect will of God. Many times, this seems to be God's will, and that also seems to be God's will. Many times we take John for Jack and Jack for John. Only a renewed mind can rightly discern God's will. If our mind is not renewed, we cannot prove what the will of God is, and the salvation we gain will not be complete. Not only did God save us to what we are today, God will also save us to the extent of being perfect. We should desire after this. Praise and thank God! This is possible. This can be done.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THOUGHTS</H2><P>Second Corinthians 10:5-6 says, "As we overthrow reasonings and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ. And we are ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled." These two verses speak of God being able to save our thoughts unto the obedience of Christ. God can save our thoughts, all our thoughts, unto the obedience of Christ.</P><P>Brothers and sisters! Every one of us should ask ourselves, "Can we control our thoughts?" We know that there are many thoughts which we cannot control. God does not allow us to have confusing and disorderly thoughts; God intends to bring our many thoughts to the obedience of Christ.</P><P>Brothers and sisters! Let me ask you, "Have all your thoughts been brought to the obedience of Christ?" We should not have any wandering thoughts, filthy thoughts, or world-craving thoughts. If we still have these thoughts, we have not obtained a full salvation. God's salvation can bring the thoughts of every believer to the obedience of Christ. This can be done. We can surrender all our thoughts to the Lord, that is, to the obedience of the Lord. This is the salvation which is prepared for us in Christ. Not only does God save us unto eternal life or to heaven, but He also wants to save our whole being, that is, all our thoughts, to the obedience of Christ. Praise and thank God! This can be done. This is possible. He can save us to such an extent.</P><P>First Peter 1:13 says, "Therefore girding up the loins of your mind and being sober, set your hope perfectly on the grace being brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ." "The loins of our mind" refer to our thoughts. This verse tells us that God is able to save our loose mind to the extent that it is focused.</P><P>I have mentioned before that the Jewish garment was like the garment worn in the Ming Dynasty. It was loose and buttonless. Whenever the people worked, the loins had to be girded up to facilitate movement. Our loose thoughts are like an ungirded loin. But just as a person can gird up his loins, God can save our loose thoughts and bring them into focus.</P><P>Many times, though our thoughts are not filthy, they are loose and wandering. We pray a little, and then we find that our mind wanders away. We read the Bible a little, and again our thoughts are lost. It is true that the thoughts may not be bad. But minds set on good or tasteful things, if not done at the proper time, also indicate a looseness of the loins of our mind and lack of concentration. God can save us to such an extent that we can control our thoughts and focus our mind. How loose are our thoughts! If we cannot concentrate in our mind, we have not obtained the complete salvation. If we have not obtained it, we should know that Christ can save us not only to our present state, but He can save us to the state of perfection. Praise and thank God! He can also save our loose thoughts to the extent of being focused. This is possible. This can be done.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. HEART AND MIND</H2><P>Philippians 4:6-7 says, "In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses every man's understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus." These two verses say that God can save a person's heart and thoughts, delivering him from anxiety. To what extent is the Lord's authority able to save a person? He is able to save a person to the extent that the peace of God guards his heart and thoughts.</P><P>The word guard has a special meaning in the original language. The most accurate translation for this word is a special term used in military science. It can be translated as "garrison." The verse means that the peace of God guards our hearts and thoughts in a way similar to a curfew set up in a locality. During a curfew, the army is empowered to garrison the curfew area, making the area safe and free from danger. God's peace can guard our hearts and thoughts in the same way as an army guards a locality to keep it peaceful. God can deliver us from all anxiety. The peace of God garrisons our hearts and thoughts.</P><P>I have not yet seen many Christians who are without anxieties about something. The majority of them are full of worries. There was a mother who had seven sons. She said, "I worried about each son until he grew up and got saved. There are two who are now in heaven, so I don't have to worry about them anymore. But I still worry about the remaining five sons." A brother told her that worrying in this way was a mistake; it was a sin. But she said, "A mother ought to worry for her own children. If she does not worry, that is sin." The brother pointed out Philippians 4:6-7, but she thought that the anxiety mentioned there did not apply to her kind of worry. According to her, the wife must worry about the husband, the parents must worry about the children, and the businessman must worry about his business. But the Bible says, "In nothing be anxious." It does mean that we can worry about a few things. It means to not worry about anything.</P><P>I have not seen many brothers or sisters who are anxious in nothing. This is not full salvation. If you worry about your whole family and are anxious about so many things-about this and about-the peace of God is not guarding your heart and thoughts. Such a person cannot testify, saying, "My Lord is the One who bears my burden day by day."</P><P>Anxiety is a sin. God can save you from all anxiety. No matter how big or small, heavy or light a thing is, you ought to be anxious for nothing. If you still have not experienced the peace of God keeping your heart and thoughts, the salvation you have obtained is not complete. If you have seen this matter clearly, you will say, "O Lord! I have gained too little of what You have given me." Praise and thank God! He can save us from all worry, to the extent where we are anxious for nothing. His peace is sufficient to guard our hearts and thoughts. This is possible. We must praise Him!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. WILL AND MIND</H2><P>First Peter 4:1-2 says, "Since Christ therefore has suffered in the flesh, you also arm yourselves with the same mind (because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin), no longer to live the rest of the time in the flesh in the lusts of men, but in the will of God." These two verses say that God can save our mind to the extent that we are willing to suffer as Christ did.</P><P>Are we afraid of suffering? Yes. We all want to have an easy daily life that is free from suffering. Whenever we have a little difficulty, we ask God to remove it. When we really submit to God and our future becomes difficult and hard, we ask God not to allow the difficulty to come to us. But God can save us to such an extent that we are not afraid of difficulty or hardship, that we arm ourselves with a mind for suffering.</P><P>What is our armor? Herein is the best armor: a mind to suffer just like Christ's. Whenever you submit to God, man may tell of difficulties and may set ways to deal with you. But by thinking of the suffering of Christ in the flesh and resolving to do the same, you are armed. Now you are able to say, "The Lord came to suffer. Suffering was not only His portion but also His duty. Suffering was His business. He wished to suffer." You can overcome all things if you arm yourself with such a mind. Not only will you not be afraid of suffering, you will welcome suffering. Not only will you not turn away from suffering, you will let suffering come looking for you. If you fear and shrink back whenever you think of suffering, your salvation is not complete. God can save you to the extent that you can have a mind to suffer. If you have a mind to suffer, you are living the rest of your time in the will of God. Praise and thank God! This is possible! He can save you to such an extent.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. SPEAKING</H2><P>James 1:26-27 says, "If anyone thinks himself to be religious and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this one's religion is vain. This is pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unspotted from the world." James 3:8-10 also says, "But the tongue no one among men is able to tame; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made according to the likeness of God. Out of the same mouth come forth blessing and cursing. These things, my brothers, ought not to be so." These two passages talk about the tongue which no man can tame. But God can save an untamed tongue to the extent that it becomes a tongue that can be bridled by us.</P><P>I met a person who said, "James said clearly that no man can tame the tongue. Therefore, it is excusable for Christians to be unable to tame their own tongues." But we need to know that James 3:10 plainly says, "These things, my brothers, ought not to be so." Moses could not enter Canaan for one reason: he said a quick word. The words Moses spoke were unbecoming of a learner. Not only do we need a learner's ear, but we need a learner's tongue as well. Only then will we know how to speak. God can save not only our heart, mind, and thoughts to a full extent, but He can also save our tongue to a perfect extent. If we cannot bridle our own tongue, I say again, we are not fully saved. Praise and thank God! He can save our tongue to a perfect extent. This can be done. It is possible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. THE LUST OF THE BODY</H2><P>Romans 8:12 says, "So then, brothers, we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh." This verse says that God can save us to the extent that we can overcome the demand of the fleshly nature and be released from the demand of the fleshly lusts.</P><P>Here, I want to mention specifically three things concerning man's body. Generally speaking, the functions of our body are in three areas: first, the area of nourishment for man's sustenance; second, the area of reproduction for man's continuation; and third, the area of defense for man's protection. Before man's fall, these three things were proper; sin was not in them. But after man sinned and inherited a sinful nature, these three things became the carrier of sins.</P><P>Because of the need for nourishment, the world tempts us with eating and drinking. The very first temptation that man faced was regarding food. As the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil tempted Eve that day, the enjoyment of eating and drinking has become a sin of the flesh for us today. We should never underestimate the matter of eating and drinking, because many fleshly believers have failed because of this. The fleshly Corinthians caused many brothers to stumble because of eating (1 Cor. 8). For this reason the elders and deacons of the churches in those days had to be those who had overcome in the matter of eating and drinking (1 Tim. 3:3, 8).</P><P>Second, after man's fall, reproduction became a matter of lust to man. In the Bible, the body and lust are particularly related. Even in the garden of Eden, the sin of indulgence in eating immediately aroused lust and shame. Paul also related these two things together (1 Cor. 6:13, 15); he also considered drunkenness and defilement to be related (vv. 9-10).</P><P>Another area is man's self-defense. After sin assumed authority, the power of the body stepped up its strength in order to survive, and anything that threatens its peace and comfort becomes its enemy. Man's temper with the resultant anger and strife all arise from the flesh and are sins of the flesh. From the matter of self-defense, countless sins are produced directly or indirectly. This is because of the presence of an inward motivation of sin. For the sake of preserving one's profit, existence, reputation, opinion, and a thousand other things related to oneself, many of the darkest sins in the world are committed.</P><P>If we analyzed all the sins in the world one by one, we would see that, generally speaking, they are all related to the above three things. A fleshly Christian is one who is controlled by any one or all of the above three things.</P><P>But Paul said that we are not debtors to the flesh, not at all. Every one of us does not have to live according to the flesh. Christ can save us from the demands of the fleshly nature and fleshly lust. What is lust? As human beings, we have two needs. First, we have the natural physical need. Second, because of this natural need, a craving is produced, and we try by devious means to satisfy this natural need. This second craving is lust. Our Lord Christ, however, can save us from this lust.</P><P>The Lord can save each one of us to the extent that we are free from this lust. Moreover, the Lord can save each one of us to the point that we can overcome the natural demand. Do not be mistaken. The Lord is not saving us so that we have no natural need; He is only saving us so that we can overcome it. The Bible does not tell us that the flesh will disappear. It only tells us that we are not debtors to the flesh; we are only free from its demands. For if we are debtors, we still have to pay back. But if we are no longer debtors, we have power over ourselves.</P><P>For example, if a person is hungry, he has to eat; this is man's natural need. But if he has no money to buy food, and he wants to use some illegal means, that is, he wants to steal to buy food to satisfy this natural need, he is in reality satisfying the demand of the lust of his flesh. When man has a natural need, he can only satisfy it according to the way of the Bible. When you are hungry, and if you have money, you can buy food to eat. This is not sin. All the natural needs can be attended to according to the teaching of God. Anything more than this is the demand of lust. When we say that God can save us so that we can overcome the natural need and be free from the demand of lust, we mean that if we are hungry and without money, we can overcome the demand of hunger and refuse any illegal means of satisfaction. Hunger is inevitable, but we can be free from the demand of lust.</P><P>Not only in food, but also in reproduction and self-defense, the principle is the same. We can only take care of the natural needs; anything more than this is sin. It is not sin for us to have natural needs, but we are not debtors to the flesh-there is no need for us to pay back anything. In these two aspects, God can save us to be free from the demand of lust and overcome the natural needs.</P><P>Not being a debtor to the flesh is not limited to only these things. Even when we are sick, we are still not debtors to the flesh. Though we may be slightly fragile mentally, we need not lose our temper. Though we may have physical problems that bring about psychological problems, we can also overcome them. God's Word says that we are not debtors to the flesh. Is God unable to save a Christian because he is handicapped in a certain area? Certainly not. We are not debtors to the flesh.</P><P>Brothers and sisters! Have you ever been ensnared by some troubles in your body? Are you trapped by some problem of eating or drinking? Know for sure that Christ's salvation can match all the circumstances and difficulties. As much as your difficulty abounds, God's salvation also abounds. If a Christian starves for one day, two days, or even three days, do you need to tell him that he need not steal to satisfy his hunger? Suppose he says that he is hungry and that he is obligated to steal. Can he say that? Oh! There is no need for anyone to be obligated to sin. God can save each one of us so that we do not live according to the flesh. Romans 6:6 says, "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves." Brothers and sisters! Before God I can say this: "God, I thank You! All that is in my old man is crucified with Him." No matter what it is-envy, pride, filthy thoughts, a confused mind, worries, or the flesh-Christ can save us from all of these things. Praise and thank the Lord!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. MEMBERS OF THE BODY</H2><P>Romans 6:13 says, "Neither present your members as weapons of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as alive from the dead, and your members as weapons of righteousness to God." Verse 19 also says, "I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness unto lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification." These two verses say that God can save our members to the extent of being sanctified.</P><P>Our members were slaves to sin, slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness unto lawlessness, but how about now? Have we been freed from the sins of every member of our body? Does every member yield itself to be the slave of righteousness? If we have not yielded our members as slaves to righteousness, we are still the slaves of sin, and the salvation which we have received is not complete. The salvation Christ renders is a salvation that saves us to the extent that we yield all the members of our body as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification. This is possible; this can be done. We praise and thank Him!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI. I</H2><P>Galatians 2:20 says, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me." We are very familiar with this verse. Many of us can even recite it. This verse says that God is saving us not only to the extent of being crucified with Christ, but also to the extent of having Christ living in us right now.</P><P>The word here is not that we should be like Christ or that we should imitate Christ. It says that Christ has become me. Now it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. God saved Paul to such an extent; He will also save us to the same extent.</P><P>Brothers and sisters! If we still do not have Christ living in us, the salvation we have received is not complete. Praise and thank God! He saves us to the extent that for us to live is Christ. This is possible. This can be attained by every Christian.</P><P>Brothers and sisters! We need to pay attention to one thing: the full salvation which God has prepared for us must be received in full and obtained in full. I do not believe in perfection in sinlessness, perfection in eradication of sin; but I believe in the perfection to which God can save me. I believe that the cross is not an eradication of me, but a substitution of me through the Lord's death. God is not uprooting my sin or evil; rather, He is giving me a Christ who lives in me. Formerly, it was Christ who died for me on the cross. Now it is He who lives for me within. Before it was the substitutionary death; now it is the substitutionary living. The extent of my receiving salvation is the extent of God's salvation to me. We do not have to remain in any temper, worry, filthiness, or lust. God can save us and set us free from all of these things. He will deliver us not only from what is bad but also will impart what is good into us.</P><P>Now we can see how great God's salvation is and how great the extent of our salvation is! It is as if we have selected some merchandise. Now we must ask, "How do we obtain it?" We know that a price must be paid. Concerning this, there are several conditions which we will talk about next time. But today I will just ask you to do one thing: believe in God's Word. God's Word says that He can save us to such an extent. If we believe it, we will have it. We ought to believe that this is possible. The biggest problem lies in the fact that we do not believe in what the Bible says. God will fulfill according to our faith. If we do not believe in it, we will not have it.</P><P>This is a most solemn matter! God has spoken His word! Now if we say that we can do it, then we can do it. But if we say that we cannot do it, then we cannot do it. We must believe in God's Word; only then can God accomplish what we believe.</P><P>Mr. Andrew Murray was a very deep person in the Lord. I purposely studied the notes of his sermons. Each time he mentioned the victorious life, the sanctifying life, or the resting life, he always listed some conditions. There was a common condition that he mentioned each time: "one must believe that it is possible." Indeed if you think it is impossible, God will have no way to fulfill it for you. If you believe in what God has said and that He will do it in you, you will see His accomplishment of what He has said in you.</P><P>Brothers and sisters! What do you think of your own Christian life? If you confess that your present situation comes short in so many ways, are you ready to see God's full salvation fulfilled in you? If you are, you should right now believe that this is possible and that this can be done; you must also allow God to accomplish His work in you.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>RESURRECTION AND REGENERATION</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 15</H2><P>We must realize that to be resurrected together with the Lord is not an experience which only takes place after regeneration. Actually, our regeneration is our resurrection together with the Lord. This is because the death of the Lord, (i.e., our dying with Him) solved the problem of our sinful life. When the Lord resurrected (i.e., when we were resurrected with Him), He gave us a new life to commence as Christians. For this reason, the Bible says, "God..has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead" (1 Pet. 1:3). Thus, every regenerated Christian is one who has been resurrected with the Lord. However, the apostle told us in Philippians 3 that a Christian should pursue to "know Him and the power of His resurrection" (v. 10). Many Christians have been regenerated and resurrected together with the Lord, but they lack the manifestation of the power of resurrection.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE BRIDE OF CHRIST</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 15</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:18-23</H1><P>In Genesis 2:18-23 there are two types: Adam, who typifies Christ, and Eve, who typifies the church (Eph. 5:31-32).</P><P>Ephesians 5:25-29 speaks of the believers' relationship with Christ; Genesis 2:18-23 speaks of the believers' relationship with God.</P><P>In Genesis 2 we can see a big difference between the thoughts of God and the thoughts of man. God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him." Man did not say this.</P><P>The thought stressed in the Bible is what God has said. When we desire sinners to be saved, we usually think only in terms of the benefit to the sinners themselves. We think if they do not repent, they will perish and suffer, and if they believe in the Lord Jesus, they will receive eternal life. But in Genesis 2:18-23, God's thought is on Christ, not on man. When sinners are saved, they are given by God to Christ-"the men whom You gave Me out of the world" (John 17:6). God has not only given Christ to men, but has also given men to Christ. God has presented a special gift to Christ, which is the sinners. God's intention in doing this is to satisfy Christ's heart.</P><P>The one great purpose for the believers to live on earth is to live for Christ. Adam was not created for Eve, but Eve was created for Adam. In the same way, believers are made for Christ. For this reason, we should satisfy Christ.</P><P>There are two stories of marriages in the Bible. They show, on the one hand, the direct relationship between Christ and the church, and on the other hand, the indirect relationship of God giving the church to Christ. The two stories are Abraham seeking Rebekah for Isaac, and Jacob marrying Rachel through suffering under Laban. Isaac did not know Rebekah; his father, Abraham, arranged the marriage. As to Rachel, however, Jacob himself suffered for the marriage. If Rebekah was not good, Isaac could have complained to his father, since Rebekah was selected by his father. Of course, we know that the one whom Abraham chose for his son was a true satisfaction to his son. God has chosen the church for Christ, and God must make the church a satisfaction to Christ. Rachel was dispositionally not that pure, and she was jealous. But Jacob did not murmur because he loved Rachel and was willing to suffer much for Rachel's sake. Christ is to the church as Jacob was in his marriage to Rachel, while God is to the church as Abraham was to Rebekah in the marriage of his son. The church is given to Christ through the hand of God. Our attention now is on the aspect of the church as Rebekah, who was given to Christ by His Father.</P><P>In God's view, Christ seems to be incomplete without us, as though it was not good for Christ to live alone, and as though He would still be lacking if He did not have the sinners. God's purpose in saving us is not just for us but also for Christ. God wants Christ to be satisfied, pleased, and completed. Therefore, He gives us to Christ. Let us see that we are called not just for our own blessings, but also to satisfy Christ's heart. Our responsibility is not to fail God. To whatever extent we satisfy Christ is the same extent God has not failed Christ.</P><P>There are two passages in the Bible which speak of "satisfaction." One says that in the coming days, Christ will see "the travail of His soul..and will be satisfied" (Isa. 53:11). The other says that "when [the believers] awake [in resurrection], [they] will be satisfied with Your [Christ's] likeness" (Psa. 17:15b). May we be able to satisfy Him.</P><P>We ought to save the sinners, for he who has life should beget more life and should beget the same kind of life that he has. The reason that God created man and saved him is that He is life and that He begets the same kind of life as He is. However, we must never forget that this is all for Christ.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A LETTER ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(By Ruth Lee)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 16</H2><P>Brothers and sisters in the Lord:</P><P>The messages in this issue closely follow the previous issue (No. 15). May the Lord bless all of us so that we would truly gain something. We have to believe that the overcoming life is not a theory; on the contrary, it is something that every Christian can attain.</P><P>Many brothers and sisters are aware of the fact that our brother Watchman Nee has been weak and ill for the past two to three years. Although he is resting, he has not dropped his work completely. Now we feel that he should have full rest, and we have advised him not to do anything for a while. The Present Testimony this year will continue, and we will not disappoint the readers. But, perhaps, Notes on Scriptural Messages will be changed to one issue per month for the next three to four months. When Brother Nee becomes well, it will resume on a bimonthly basis. Some brothers and sisters have written personal letters to Brother Nee. Please excuse him for not being able to answer you personally.</P><P>Although printing costs have increased twenty percent since July, we thank the Lord for His grace that the zealous supply of brothers and sisters everywhere has covered all the shortages.</P><P>Concerning the gospel tracts, many have inquired about the printing costs. We will repeat what we announced in Issue No. 14 of this magazine: the gospel tracts are not for sale, but are given away at no charge in the name of the Lord. Our purpose, however, is to help those who do not have the ability and yet are burdened to do this work. Those who are able can help with the printing and mailing costs according to their ability. We would like to supply those who do not have through the many who have. We do not wish to see those who do not have stop their work because of their lack of means. At the same time, we do not wish to see others become negligent in contributing their part in helping this work just because we are giving these tracts away at no charge.</P><P>The musical score for the Little Flock Hymnal, provisional edition, has been drafted, but we have not yet printed it. We have to wait until the other hymns are ready before we can categorize them according to subjects. For this reason, we still cannot publish it.

Peace be to you in the Lord!</P><P>September 1930</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE OVERCOMING LIFE</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 16</H2><P>We saw last Lord's Day that it is possible for the life of every Christian to reach the stage of perfection. (See "The Extent of the Believer's Salvation.") It is possible for every Christian to have a pure conscience and a clean heart, and it is possible for him to be anxious in nothing. It is possible for him to be pure in his mind and focused in his thoughts. It is possible for him to be fully obedient to God and to fully honor and love God. It is possible for him to overcome the particular constitution of his physical being and present his members as weapons of righteousness to God unto sanctification. Every Christian should be able to reach the stage where he can say that he is crucified with Christ and that it is no longer he who lives, but Christ who is living in him. This is entirely possible and attainable. Today I will speak to you about another matter: the way to obtain the overcoming life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE LIFE OF CHRIST ON EARTH</H2><P>We know that when Christ was living on earth, He submitted fully to God; He did not love the world at all and did not speak or act according to His own will at all. He never allowed Himself to be overcome by temptations, and He never once sinned. He was submissive to God unto death. This is the life of Christ.</P><P>How about us? Have we fully submitted ourselves to God? No. Have we fully rejected the self-will? No. Are we fully sinless? No. Are we fully free from the love of the world? We may not love the world outwardly, but in our heart, we still love it secretly. Who among us is never moved by temptations? Not one. How shocking this is! According to the Bible, a Christian should be one who is fully subject to God, one who is completely free from the love of the world, one who does not go along with his self-will at all, one who does not sin at all, and one who is never once agitated by temptations. Yet, brothers and sisters, you will say that this is impossible. I say that this is impossible also. Some of us have been Christians for at least one or two years. Most of us have been Christians for three, four, or even five years. During these few years, what have we achieved? Many times we repent, regret, and even weep. But where is victory?</P><P>We know the standard of being a Christian according to the Bible. We should not go along with ourselves at all; we have to be as righteous as God is, and we should seek after the kingdom single-heartedly. But what are we like? We often sin. Our hearts are defiled. We still lose our tempers. We still secretly love the world, and we are controlled by our lusts. We do not love to read the Bible or pray. Sometimes we even think that it is better not to be a Christian at all.</P><P>The Bible says that we should, but we say that we cannot. We should do what we should. But we cannot do what we cannot. Can we say that God's truth should be lowered a little? Can we say that it does not matter that much if we sin once? Or will we say that it is all right for some to love God, submit to Him, deny themselves, and be holy, but that such a standard is not for us, but only for a special class of people?</P><P>Brothers and sisters, we have to see that even though we ourselves cannot do it, there is One who can do it. This One is Christ. We ought to be perfect, but we are not. However, Christ has achieved this; He has attained this perfection. This tells us three things:</P><P>(1) The standard of living that God has ordained is something to which every Christian can attain.</P><P>(2) We cannot attain to it.</P><P>(3) Throughout history, only One has attained it-Christ.</P><P>Do we believe that we cannot do it? Yes. Do we believe that Christ can do it? Yes. We should do it, but we cannot. We all admit that Christ is perfect. What then shall we say? A standard of living that is according to God can only be lived out by God. Not only is this true in the case of God, who is higher than us; it is also true in the case of lives that are lower than ours. We must have the same life before we can have the same living. Take the example of a bird. One must have the bird's life before he can have the bird's living. Take again the example of a beast. One must be a beast before he can live the life of a beast. Only God can live the life of God. Christ is God; therefore, only Christ can live the life of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE CHRISTIAN LIFE DESCRIBED IN THE BIBLE</H2><P>Philippians 1:21 says, "For to me, to live is Christ." Does it say here that we should live like Christ? No. Does it say that we should imitate Christ? No. Does it say that we should take Christ as our pattern and follow Christ? No. It says, "To live is Christ." Imitating is absolutely useless. Doing good is also absolutely useless. Even if we can study the Bible, pray, conduct a good life, and have a proper pursuit, when our life is a wrong life, we will have a wrong living. We may aspire, weep, repent, and say to God, "O God, I truly desire to obey You." This is surely good. But there is one thing wrong: our life is wrong.</P><P>God ordained not only that Christ should die for us on Golgotha, but that He should become our life. Brothers and sisters, please be clear about one thing. God has not asked us to be Christians in such a painful way. God has never asked us to be Christians in the way that a monkey is taught to wear clothes, eat food, or exercise like a man. It would be a great pain for a monkey to try to be a man. It would be much more comfortable for the monkey to be a monkey than for the monkey to try to be a man. God has not dealt with us in this way.</P><P>When we read the Bible for five minutes, we may not find any taste to it; we may be more interested in reading other books. When we pray, we may receive nothing. Yet if we do not pray, our conscience condemns us. It is difficult for us to not love the world; yet we have no peace to love the world. In this way, we find it difficult to be a Christian and impossible to live the life of God. What wretched men we are! It is better that we feel wretched because this means that we are still on the way. If we do not feel any wretchedness at all, I feel sorry because this means that we have left the proper path.</P><P>Many times though we see that the temptation of the world is fierce, we cannot say anything against it because, within us, we feel somewhat swayed ourselves and cannot quite condemn those in the world for being swayed. Many times we see men giving themselves to God, turning their face to God and their back to the world, and submitting to God, and we think, "How wonderful it would be if I could be like them!" But when we try to practice it, we discover what a suffering it is to us. Brothers and sisters, it would indeed be a great suffering if God were to require us to be such a Christian. If the standard is so high, how can we make it? It is a cruel thing to ask a five-year-old child to bear a four-hundred-pound weight. It would be even crueler to ask this child to bear a thirteen-thousand-pound weight. It is a greater suffering to ask a Christian to try to live the life of God than it is to ask the five-year-old child to lift a four-hundred or fifteen-thousand-pound weight.</P><P>Many times we think we can try; we try to endure some sufferings and cravings. But the result is one sin after another. We have hardly finished regretting before the thing which we regret comes back to us again. Our tears have hardly dried before the thing that brought us to tears comes back again. Brothers and sisters, it would be wonderful if we would believe that we cannot do what we try. God does not want us to try. The Bible tells us that the life that we have received from God is not one that fails and asks for repentance, only to fail again and repent again. It is a life in which "to live is Christ." It is also a life in which the Lord Jesus lives Himself out of us.</P><P>Mary gave the Lord a body, and the Lord was able to express the life of God out of it. In the same way, we should give ourselves to the Lord and should receive this Christ into us so that He can live His life out of us and we can live as He lives.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, please be clear: being holy, denying the self, and loving the Lord single-heartedly are not things that a Christian should try to do, or are they things that a Christian can imitate. God has prepared Christ for us. This is the full salvation. God ordained Christ in two ways. On the one hand, Christ kept the law for us. On the other hand, He is within us causing us to keep the law of God. On the one hand, He has died for us. On the other hand, He is living within us. He accomplished salvation on Golgotha, and He is now accomplishing in us what Golgotha has accomplished. On Golgotha, He justified us. Now He is living within us to make us justified. Not only has He obeyed God, but He is also causing us to obey God within us. Not only has He done something for us, but He is doing something within us.</P><P>Here we can see the importance of resurrection. Paul said, "And if Christ has not been raised...you are still in your sins" (1 Cor. 15:17). He did not say that the record of sin still remained because the record of sin was removed when Christ died. But if Christ has not resurrected, we are still in our sins; what we have is only a half-salvation. When we preach the gospel, we often use the illustration that our transgressions are like debts which have been incurred. Christ is like a rich friend. When He died, He paid the debt for us. This is right, and this is the gospel. Unfortunately, this is only half of the salvation. It is true that the Lord Jesus has paid our debt. But we have to ask if paying the debt was the only thing that He did. Does it mean that we will never incur more debt? Christ has paid the debt, but does that mean that I may still owe money in the future? It is true that my friend has paid my past debts. But if I borrow again and my friend has to help me again, does this not mean that I have received only a half-salvation? Although my friend has paid for me, I still continue to owe. Although Christ has died for me, I still continue in sin. Is this God's salvation?</P><P>God's salvation caused the Lord Jesus to die for me on Golgotha, and it also causes Him to live within me. He has paid all the debts for us, and He is living within us so that we do not need to borrow anymore. God does not stop at saving us from hell and into heaven. He is saving us to the extent that Christ becomes our life. If we have only received a half-salvation, we will still suffer and not have the joy of salvation. Jesus Christ is our life. God has never said that a Christian should do this and that. Paul said, "For to me, to live is Christ." Paul was able not only to suffer others' beatings and persecutions, but also to pass through many dangers and be imprisoned in Jerusalem and sent to Rome, because Christ was living in him. He was not like Christ or imitating Christ; rather, Christ lived in him. Without this he could not have gone through these things. A monkey cannot become a man. In the same way a Christian cannot become Christ by imitation.</P><P>Philippians 2:12-13 says, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure." In Philippians 1:21 we see Paul's personal experience. In these two verses, we are told that every Christian can have the same experience.</P><P>"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling." When many people read this verse, they think that salvation is something that they should work out. For this reason they make up their mind to rise up early, to study the Bible, and to become zealous to testify to others. Yet they find that they cannot succeed. They have forgotten the words in verse 13: "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure." Since the word "for" is in verse 13, it means that verse 13 is the "cause," while the working out of salvation in verse 12 is only the "effect."</P><P>Our activities in our daily life consist of only two things: (1) the willing, which is an inward resolving, and (2) the working, which is the outward conduct. The totality of our living is of these two things, the inward resolving and the outward working. Both the willing and the working are the result of God's operating within us. Here it does not say that we ought to will and work. Rather, it says that it is God who operates within us to the extent that we can will and work. To operate is to work. It is God who works within us to the point that we can will and work. The reason we can work out something is because God has worked within. Without the working within, there can never be the working out.</P><P>Many times we say to God, "O God, I want to obey You fully. Yet it is so hard! I want to not love the world. Yet it is so hard! I want to not go along with myself. Yet it is so hard!" Here is a way of salvation. God can work within you to the extent that you can fully obey God; He can work within you to the extent that you do not love the world and do not go along with yourself. Although you cannot do it within, God can work to the extent that you can.</P><P>What is perfect salvation? It is not for a Christian to remove a sin today and an evil tomorrow. Perfect salvation is to receive the perfect Christ. When we have Christ, we have the perfect salvation. The most difficult Christian to help is one who does not turn his eyes to Christ! What he sees is only his own goodness or his own evil! He pays attention to his certain sins, certain bondages from certain people, and certain attractions from certain things. He condemns himself, feels sorry for himself, and attempts to overcome all his problems. Yet he commits a great mistake. God has not intended for him to overcome these things one by one or perform good works item by item. God wants him to receive a perfect Christ.</P><P>Suppose a child loves fruit. When he wants pears, he goes to the orchard to buy some pears. If he wants oranges or bananas the next day, he will go and buy oranges or bananas. Later he finds out that his father owns the orchard and that his father has given the orchard to him. From that time on, his eating will be different. All the fruit belongs to him. As Christians, we want to perform this thing today and accomplish that thing tomorrow. We want patience today and love tomorrow; we are like the child who wants pears today and oranges tomorrow. But God wants us to receive a perfect Christ. The whole orchard is ours. If we buy separately, there will be times of lack and there will be a need to buy again and again.</P><P>I am not saying that you do not have to be patient or to love. You should be patient, and you should love. But if you are practicing these things item by item, you will find that you cannot practice them. If you do this, you will find out that day after day, you will love the world more, you will become more proud, and you will go along with yourself more. You have to realize that the whole orchard is yours. God wants us to have one common goal, which is to gain the one perfect Christ. He can operate within us to the extent that we can will and work for the accomplishment of His good pleasure.</P><P>We may have heard of the truth concerning Christ living His life within us. But let me ask today, "Do you have this experience?" Many times, we know something. Yet we only want to try it out. The result is failure.</P><P>First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption." If we read this verse slowly, we will see that when we were saved, God made Christ our righteousness and our sanctification. Therefore, if anyone were to ask what sanctification is, our answer should be that Christ is sanctification. What is victory? It is just Christ. What is patience? It is just Christ. What is humility? It is just Christ. If we can answer this way, we will be victorious. Our whole being is fleshly and nothing but corruption. But Christ is sanctification; He is our sanctification. No one has sanctification or victory in himself. There is only one way; we must say to God, "O God! I receive Your Son!"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. WHEN DID CHRIST COME TO LIVE IN US?</H2><P>The overcoming life is only found in Christ. But when did Christ come to live in us? It was at the time that we were saved. At that time we received Christ, for "He who has the Son has the life" (1 John 5:12). "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name" (John 1:12). At the time we believe, we receive Christ. Second Corinthians 13:5 says, "Do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?" Who are the ones who are not disapproved? "Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out" (John 6:37). Have we come to the Lord? Yes, we have. If we have come to the Lord, we will by no means be cast out. What then do we have? We have Jesus Christ in us. Therefore, if anyone says that we do not have Christ within us, even though we have believed in the Lord, and that we ought to receive the word of Christ, he is making a great mistake. If we are not saved, we should receive Christ, and if we are saved, Christ is already living in us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. HOW TO LET CHRIST LIVE HIS LIFE OUT OF US</H2><P>Now we know that only Christ can overcome. We also know that Christ is living within us. We know moreover that when we believe, we have Christ. Yet day after day we remain the same and nothing is changed. What should we do so that we can let Christ live His life out of us? There are two ways or, one may say, two conditions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The First Thing to Do Is Surrender</H2><P>It is true that Christ is in us. But if we do not allow Him to work, He will not work. We must submit ourselves to God. What is to surrender? Surrendering is to not promise God that we will do His will and do good; it is to not covenant with God to do what we cannot do. Surrendering is to let our hands go from our life. It is putting into God's hand our good, evil, merits, shortcomings, our past, future, problems, life, and ourselves, and single-heartedly allowing Him to work.</P><P>If you do not let your hands go, God cannot live His life out of you. Suppose you are giving a book to someone. If your hand does not let go of the book, the other person cannot have your book. When you come to God, you should tell Him, "I am giving You all that I have, including my good, evil, what I want, what I do not want, what I will, what I will not, what I can do, and what I cannot do." Are you willing to do this? If you are not willing to do even this, God will not be able to do anything. Are you willing to hand over the "you" that has failed? You have to be responsible for this step. Today God only asks you to do one thing: hand over yourself, the sinner, to Him.</P><P>Surrendering is not an act in which God asks you to do what you cannot do. It is just handing over everything including your good, evil, merits, and shortcomings. I have read the story of a young man who said that he was willing to do everything except one thing: he was definitely not willing to preach to Catholics. Brothers and sisters, are we willing to hand over this heart of unwillingness?</P><P>There are two kinds of surrender. One is to surrender to God for Him to use us, while the other is to surrender to God for Him to work on us. Many people think that to surrender to God is just to allow Him to use us. Brothers and sisters, God is asking us to do one thing: to henceforth hand ourselves over to Him. This is the meaning of dying to the self. This is the meaning of being delivered from the flesh. You have to hand over yourself. Are you willing to do this? If you are willing, you will succeed.</P><P>It is very difficult to take your hands away from the people and things that you love. I can tell you frankly that it is very difficult to do this. The thing that will cost the greatest price to give up will be the thing which you hold most tenaciously. For example, you may realize that you fail most often in the matter of friendship. But in this very matter, it is very difficult to say that you give to God all your friends, good or bad, and ask for God's deliverance in the matter. Take another example: suppose you pray about the sickness of one whom you know nothing about. It is very easy to believe that God will help him. If no one is going to help him or heal him, it will not bother you. But if it is your parents or your husband or wife that is sick, it will not be easy to commit them to God. If no one will help them or heal them, you will fear that they may die. This shows that the more you love someone, the more difficult it is for your hands to give them up.</P><P>Today God is not asking you to do any good works. He is only asking you to commit everything you have to Him. You have enough failures to make your heart tremble. I had one sin which, until a few months ago, I was not able to overcome. I did not have any faith to commit it to God. It was like this once, twice, three times, four times, and even many times. Finally, I decided to commit it to God just like that. Today, you do not have to care about anything else. All I want to ask you is if you are willing to commit yourself completely to God's hand. Whether it be concerning a person, the world, some sin, or some matters that you cannot give up, all you have to do is to be willing to say to God, "I commit to You what I am reluctant to give up. Please work in me to the extent that I am willing to give up." I am not afraid of your reluctance to give up someone. I am not afraid even if you are a hundred times weaker than you are. I am not afraid that you would commit more sins than you do now. I am only afraid that you are not willing to commit yourself to God's working. Are you willing to commit to God your loved ones, your sins, your problems, and the things that are displeasing to God? It is all right even if you have a thousand or ten thousand weaknesses or failures. The question is whether or not you are willing to tell God, "I commit everything to You."</P><P>Surrendering is not taking a bitter pill; it is not suffering to death. Surrendering is just allowing God to work within you until you become willing.</P><P>Surrendering does not require you to do what you are not able to do. It is just putting yourself in the hand of God and allowing God to work, to the extent that you become willing to obey God and give up everything. If you are willing, God will have a way. God does not worry about how many sins you have or how evil a person you are. God is only concerned that your heart be in His hands.</P><P>In short, surrendering is a submission of our will; it is committing ourselves into the hand of God and allowing Him to work to the extent that God can accomplish His pleasure.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Second Thing to Do Is Believe</H2><P>After we have surrendered ourselves, we must believe that God can deliver us from our love, our reluctance, and our inabilities. Psalm 37:5 says, "Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass." To commit is to surrender. To trust is to believe, and the result is that He will bring it to pass. We can do nothing in ourselves. When we commit our ways to God, we believe that the Lord living within us will bring them to pass.</P><P>Can we say that we have overcome? Hallelujah! I can say that I have overcome, because the Bible tells me so. How pitiful that our faith is not as great as a grain of mustard seed. It is not even as great as a speck of dust! If we had faith, God would have worked already. God exercised only His mouth when He created the heavens and the earth; when He said let there be light, there was light. When we have faith, God will work, for He is willing to accomplish His own work.</P><P>A few weeks ago, a brother came to talk with me. He told me that he had three to four kinds of sins that he could not overcome. At times he even wanted to kill himself. I asked him, "Do you believe that Christ can save you from your sins?" He answered, "Yes, I believe." But immediately after saying this, he said, "Yet I have committed these sins again and again. I have overcome all other sins, but these few sins still remain." I read Romans 8:1 with him, which says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus." I then said to him, "The Bible gives one condition for being saved-to be in Christ Jesus. Are you in Christ Jesus?" He replied, "Yes, I am." Then I said, "All right, then see what the Bible says: `For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death'" (v. 2). He said, "The Bible says that I have been freed from the law of sin and of death." I then asked, "Are you free?" He replied, "I dare not say." I said, "Where is your faith?"</P><P>I am not afraid of men's weakness, corruption, or sin. But I am afraid of one type of person: one who does not believe in God's Word. How precious are the words "has freed me!" God's Word says that we have been freed. It does not say that we shall be free. Do we believe it?</P><P>Christ has died for you. When you believe in Him, you have eternal life. What evidence do you have for this? Is it not merely because the Bible has said it? In the same way, today the Bible says, "The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." Therefore, I am already freed, and I am already delivered from the law of sin and death. Even if there are a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand sins, I am free from them all. I am free even from the spiritual death which I have inherited from Adam.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, do you believe in this word? Do you believe that you are free from the law of sin and death? The Bible says that you are free. If you believe it, you will say, "Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! God's Word says that I am free from the law of sin and of death!" Do you have some sin or unclean thoughts that you cannot overcome? If you do, you should know that there is a gospel for you today. The law of the Spirit of life has freed you in Christ Jesus from such sin.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, we must see that to surrender and to believe are two interrelated matters. When we put the two together, we will have the victory. Otherwise, we will have failure. It is impossible to overcome merely by believing without committing one's life to God in exchange for Christ's life. Although we obtained everything at the time of regeneration, unless we exercise our will to commit ourselves to God and allow Christ to live, God will never force us. However, if we merely surrender without believing, such surrendering is but a kind of dead work, because we have merely provided God the chance to work, without providing Him the chance to come in.</P><P>We have to first lift up our heads to tell God that we are committing everything into His hand, and, second, we have to believe that God has accomplished everything according to His Word.</P><P>Christ has borne all the conflict for us. The government is now upon His shoulder. We should believe in Him this way, day after day. Faith is continual, while surrender is instant; it is a once-and-for-all act. Although some may surrender gradually and slowly, it is unnecessary to do this. We can commit everything to God in an instant and stop all our work from that point on. If we have committed, we should then believe that God will cause Christ to live out His holiness and victory from within us. Our former salvation saved us from the punishment of hell. Our present salvation saves us from the power of sin. There is no need to do anything else. All we have to do is commit and believe. I hope that every one of us can testify that we are victorious.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, there is only the need to believe. If we do not believe, nothing will work. If we believe, we will see changes. God has spoken, and we only need to praise and thank Him! We only need to believe in a "cold-blooded" way and ignore our feelings. God has said it, and it is so. We have never seen heaven and hell, but we believe there is heaven and hell because God's Word says so. If we can believe, that is good enough; there is no need for further evidence. There is only one evidence-the Word of God. We need no other evidence. I do not have to see if there is any change in me; I only need to believe that whatever God has spoken will count. If we believe, we will see change. If we do not believe, we will not see change.</P><P>Once I spoke to a brother about Romans 8:2. I asked if he believed in it. He said he believed. I asked him further, "What will you do if you wake up tomorrow and sin again? If you still sin, what are you going to do?" He did not know what to say. Brothers and sisters, the greatest danger lies in the first temptation. Satan will say that to surrender and believe are vain, that we have sinned again, that we have not changed at all, and that we are the same as we were! But brothers and sisters, we have to repeat again and again, faith is long-lived. If it is short-lived, it is not faith. Of all the lives in the world, faith is the most long-lived. Temptations may come. But if God says that we will overcome, we will surely overcome, and the temptations will fail. The way we deal with the first temptation proves if we have the faith or not.</P><P>The Lord Jesus told the disciples, "Let us go over to the other side" (Mark 4:35). Later, a windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was beginning to fill up. The disciples woke Jesus and said, "Teacher, does it not matter to You that we are perishing?" (v. 38). The Lord woke up, rebuked the wind and the waves, and the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. Then the Lord rebuked the disciples: "How is it that you do not have faith?" (v. 40). Since the Lord commanded them to go over to the other side, they were surely able to go over to the other side. Even if the windstorm had become fiercer, it would not have stopped them from going over to the other side. Brothers and sisters, the most important thing is to believe in God's Word. If God has said it, that is enough. We do not have to worry about anything else.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE FOREMOST CONDITION<br>IN THE SPIRITUAL LIFE</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 16</H2><P>The one thing a seeking believer should fear most is the over-activity of the soul --activity that goes beyond God's boundary. The soul has reigned long enough. Even when a believer is willing to consecrate himself to God, he still thinks that he must work and accomplish what he has consecrated himself to do, in order to please God. Many believers do not realize that the cross should work deeply until all the power from their living is rejected. Many believers do not realize the reality of the indwelling Holy Spirit in them. They do not realize how much authority He should have and how all of their thoughts, desires, and feelings should be under His control to the extent that they have no self-confidence. Without this, the Holy Spirit cannot accomplish His work. Therefore, the greatest temptation that befalls zealously seeking believers is to exercise their own strength in the work of God.</P><P>The call of the cross of the Lord Jesus is to hate our own life. We should look for opportunity to lose our life and not for an opportunity to keep it. The Lord's intention is that our self should be sacrificed and fully consecrated, so that the Holy Spirit can work in us. All opinions, works, and mental powers of the soul-life must be put to death before we can regain our true life under the life and leading of the Holy Spirit. The Lord also spoke to us about the matter of hating or loving our soul-life. The soul loves itself. Unless we hate our natural life wholeheartedly, we cannot genuinely live in the Holy Spirit. If believers do not understand this, they will not be afraid of themselves or their wisdom, and they will not trust fully in the Holy Spirit, wait on Him, or look to Him. This is the foremost condition in the spiritual life.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A LETTER ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(By Ruth Lee)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 17</H2><P>Brothers and sisters in the Lord:</P><P>By the grace of God, we are sending out this issue of The Present Testimony. We humbly pray that God will use His truth to edify both you and us. Many times we err in our way because we only know part of God's truth without knowing the rest. Many times we grope in darkness and do not find a way out because we lack the enlightening and leading of the truth. The message in this issue will free us from our burden and also cause us not to relax.</P><P>For the most part, our work goes on as usual. Although we have seen much need in the church of God, we are not yet made ready by Him. If we do not have God's explicit command, how can we dare act presumptuously? We request that all the brothers and sisters who have placed hope in us would pray much for us, so that the portion of the work that God has assigned to us will not be delayed by us.</P><P>Recently in our meeting place at 212 Wen-deh Lane, Hardoon Road, some brothers have risen up to preach the gospel every Lord's Day afternoon at half-past three. Readers who live near Shanghai can bring unbelievers to come and hear the gospel.</P><P>We still have to say a few words about our brother Watchman Nee. For the past few years, he has been strenuously working. Although some do not realize how weak his body is, we, his co-workers, realize that he really needs the rest. For this reason, when friends sometimes come to visit him, we have to reluctantly stop them from seeing our brother. At present there are many letters which he cannot personally answer, and there are many questions which he cannot answer. We ask the brothers and sisters who love our brother to forgive him and us in these matters. Our greatest hope is that the prayers of many will cause his health to be recovered soon, and that he will not disappoint the earnest hope of many brothers and sisters. May God bless you!</P><P>Shanghai,<br>October 14, 1930</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TWO SIDES OF A MOST GLORIOUS TRUTH</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 17</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Phil. 2:12-18</H1><P>We know that the Epistle to the Philippians was written by Paul when he was imprisoned in Rome. Paul not only wrote Philippians; he also wrote the Epistles of Ephesians and Colossians as well. Each of these three Epistles has its own emphasis. Ephesians talks about the church as the Body of Christ. Colossians talks about how Christ is in the church. Philippians does not talk about such profound doctrines as those contained in Ephesians and Colossians; rather, it emphasizes one thing: freedom from disputes. Philippians 4:2 says, "I exhort Euodias, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord." These two serving sisters did not get along peacefully. For this reason Paul specifically beseeched them.</P><P>Philippians places special emphasis on the matters of humility, peace, and love for one another. We may say that Philippians is a footnote to 1 Corinthians 13. Paul beseeched the Philippians to consider one another in lowliness of mind more excellent than themselves, not regarding each his own virtues, but each the virtues of others also. After this he mentions how the Lord emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men, humbling Himself, becoming obedient even unto the death of a cross. Paul told them that this was the mind of Christ; therefore, he beseeched them to let the mind that was in Christ Jesus also be in them. However, there was a difficulty here. Although there was a willingness, there was not an ability. Listening is one thing, but doing is another. The apostle Paul talked about how the Lord emptied Himself, humbled Himself, and became obedient even unto the death of a cross. With such a high standard, the two sisters undoubtedly thought that it was impossible for them to attain to this standard. Therefore, Paul continued and told them how it could be done in verses 12 through 18 in chapter two.</P><P>Verse 12 says, "So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling." So then refers to the previous context. My beloved was used by Paul whenever he was giving a very important word. Since he used this designation, what follows must be very important. "Even as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence." What is the meaning of this word? Paul said that in the past when he preached the gospel to them, they always obeyed. Since things had gone wrong, they should obey even more. They obeyed him when he preached the gospel there, when he was an example there, and when they had contact with him; therefore, they should still obey him. These few words contain three points. First, they obeyed Paul when he was there because he had contact with them. Second, in Paul's absence, they should obey even more because they were entrusted more to God. Third, they needed to obey so that they could work out their own salvation with fear and trembling.</P><P>"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling" (2:12b). We should read this verse several times. Fear is toward God, trembling is toward ourselves. On one hand, we should fear God; on the other hand, we should tremble toward ourselves. Temptation is strong; therefore, we tremble. God is great, therefore, we fear. How can salvation be worked out? We thank God that He has a way; salvation can be worked out.</P><P>The Bible has divided the matter of salvation into three stages. First, in the past, God delivered us from the punishment of hell. Second, in the present, God saves us from the power of sin. Third, in the future, God will cause us to enter into the kingdom to be co-kings with Christ. Let me give a few examples:</P><P>Second Timothy 1:9 says, "Who has saved us." This occurred in the past, and every believer has received this salvation.</P><P>Hebrews 7:25 says, "Hence also He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him." This is the present salvation, and it can be received today.</P><P>Hebrews 9:28 says, "So Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time to those who eagerly await Him, apart from sin, unto salvation." This is the salvation in the future.</P><P>The Bible clearly mentions three kinds of salvation, one in the past, one in the present, and one in the future. Some Christians may have received the past salvation, but they may not have received the present and the future salvation. Some Christians have received the past salvation as well as the present salvation, and they are going to receive the future salvation. It is possible to be delivered from the punishment of hell and yet sin daily. It is possible to be delivered from the punishment of hell, but this does not necessarily mean that one will be a king in the future. I will mention three more verses in the Bible to prove these three stages of salvation.</P><P>Ephesians 2:8 says, "For by grace you have been saved." This is the past salvation.</P><P>Romans 8:24 says, "For we are saved by hope" [KJV]. This means that we are in the process of being saved; this is the present salvation.</P><P>Romans 5:10 says, "For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled." This is in the future.</P><P>We thank and praise God that we have been saved! However, there are still two kinds of salvation which we have not yet achieved. Therefore, we need to pursue further. Some may not think that they are saved, so we tell them that once they believe they are saved. This refers to being saved from the punishment of hell. We have been saved from hell, but we still need to be delivered from the power of sin and pursue after the glory in the future kingdom. Therefore, we should work out our salvation with fear and trembling.</P><P>Dwight L. Moody was a very powerful preacher and extremely capable in saving souls. In his lifetime he said that he had never seen a lazy person be saved! Even if a person desires to be delivered from the punishment of hell, he cannot obtain it if he is lazy. "Therefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you" (Eph. 5:14).</P><P>In the past few weeks I have mentioned many times that we are incapable in ourselves. If it is up to us to do anything, it will be very difficult. But if we are willing to surrender and believe, then Christ will do it on our behalf. While one should listen to this side of the truth, there is another side of the truth: to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. This is our responsibility for, if we do not do this, we are off. No doubt, Christ has died on my behalf, shed His blood on my behalf, and resurrected and ascended on my behalf. Some may think that since this is the case, all we need to do is just worship and be absolutely passive. There is no need to pray, read the Bible, and donate. However, we need to know that since God has done this, we can work out our salvation even more fervently. Since God has done it, we should work it out. How can we work it out? The following verse tells us the answer.</P><P>Philippians 2:13 says, "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure." Verses 12 and 13 are two sides of a most glorious truth; they include everything. If you look at the first verse, you think that we should do everything. But if you look at the second verse, it seems that God will do everything. On one hand, we should work out our salvation, and on the other hand, God will work it out. This is not contradictory, but complementary. Verse 12 says that we should work out our salvation, and verse 13 says that God is able to make us do what we should do.</P><P>These two verses explain two very important aspects of truth in the Bible. In one aspect there are many severe commandments in the Bible from God. He commands us to do this and do that. It seems that God has given us a hard burden that we can hardly bear. It seems almost impossible to take any step forward. We seem pressed to death. But in the other aspect there are many promises from God. They tell us that this and that are taken care of by God. Everything is God's grace and God's doing. It seems it is not necessary for us to do anything. Due to a lack of understanding of these two aspects of truth, some people tend to go to the extreme. Some think that everything is a commandment from God and that they must do it all by themselves. They see God's commandments as heavy burdens. They are not able to bear them, yet they are afraid not to bear them. They seem to be pressed to death. Others think that everything is according to God's grace. Everything is God's doing, and everything is done by God. They themselves do not need to bear any responsibility. This invariably leads to laxity toward themselves. When man deviates-it does not matter which way he deviates-there is a danger that he will neither abide by God's commandments nor receive God's promises in the Bible. God's truths are balanced on both sides. God is working inside of us, and we are working outwardly-working out what God has done within us. If we only let God work inwardly, without our working outwardly, we cannot receive anything. But if we are working outwardly, and nothing is being done by God inwardly, we cannot achieve anything.</P><P>All things in our human life are covered by these two matters: the willing and the working. To will is an inward decision; to work is an outward behavior. Whatever is decided within, we fulfill without. This is the willing and the working. Willing refers to our inward situation; working refers to our outward living. But both our inward willing and outward working are God's operating within us, which operates until we fulfill His good pleasure. All our willingness is according to God's operating, and all our working is also according to God's operating.</P><P>Oftentimes, we want to obey God, but we cannot do so. However, God says, "I am operating in you; therefore, it is possible to obey; you can do it." Many Christians suffer so much because they cannot do so many things. Many times they tell God, "It is such a suffering to obey You. I just cannot do it. I want to forsake the world, but I cannot do it. I should not hate someone, but I cannot help it." However, God has no intention for you to suffer. He wants to operate within you until you can do it. Therefore, you should tell God, "Although I cannot obey You, and I cannot give up the world, nor do I know how to love others, I ask You to work within me until I am willing to obey You, until I am willing to give up the world, and until I am willing not to hate others." If you believe after you pray this way, there surely will be changes. Even if you have things which you have not been able to overcome for years, by committing and believing this way, you will be able to overcome.</P><P>When Mr. [Chapman] first began his ministry, his congregation grew day by day, and he had a large chapel built. When Mr. Moody heard of his name, he took a train to listen to his preaching. After Mr. Moody arrived at the meeting hall, he sat there silently listening. At the end of the meeting, Mr. Chapman, who knew Moody, came down from the platform to Moody to ask his opinion. Mr. Moody said, "Brother, what you have ministered is a failure. It is not a success. There is some flaw in your life." When Mr. Chapman heard this word, he was not happy. He thought, "Mr. Moody should not have criticized me in this way. He has no authority to say that." However, Moody had said what he said. At any rate, Mr. Chapman knew that there was one weakness in himself. He realized that he was too attached to his wife and children. He felt bad for two or three weeks. Finally, he said to God, "I have no way not to love my wife and children, but I pray You would work until I can." From that day on, he learned how to love his wife and children. Later, he ministered effectively. Someone asked him to give a testimony, and he said only a few words: "If I know how to preach the gospel and minister, or if there is anything good in me, I know where it came from. It came from that time when I obeyed."</P><P>God wants to work to the extent that we are able. Abraham asked an old servant to bring back Rebekah. The servant had to bring her to Canaan, but the camel for the journey was prepared by Abraham. The Samaritan helped the robbed one on the way to Jericho ride on his beast and sent him to the inn. By ourselves we have no strength to walk. We are damaged by our sin, and we can never have the strength to walk by ourselves. However, God operates within us to cause us to will, work, and perform. Everything that can fulfill God's good pleasure comes through His operation within us. He makes us to will and work for His good pleasure. We will be on the right way if we can remember this.</P><P>D.M. Panton of England said once, "Whatever God can do, we can do also, since we have God abiding in us." When one sister died, there was a word about her on a sign which said, "She did what she could not do!"</P><P>Every day we live a life which we can hardly live. If we want to obtain full salvation, if we want our life to be clean and perfect, we need God's operation. Many have tried to imitate Christ, but it can never be done. It is God who operates; consequently, we can work. Every day we should hold on to the fact that it is not we, but God who operates within us. We can only do what God has done. If we see the Bible as a high standard, think that we should do all of these things, and try to do them, we will surely fail. We should only ask God to operate until we are willing.</P><P>Mr. Panton told another story: There was a doctor who instructed a nurse to ask a patient to do a certain thing. The nurse asked the patient to do it. However, the patient said that he could not. The nurse reported to the doctor what the patient had said, and the doctor then went to see the patient. After an examination, the doctor said that it was not that he could not do it or was unwilling, but rather that he himself could not be willing. We are not willing inwardly and not able outwardly. If we are inwardly unwilling to forsake the world, we will be outwardly unable to forsake the world. However, God is able to operate within us until we are truly willing and able to carry out His good pleasure.</P><P>Since God has worked in us, we can work out. Because God has operated within us, we can work out His good pleasure. We should pay special attention to carrying it out. Whoever is a believer has Christ abiding in him. Second Corinthians 13:5b says, "Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?"</P><P>There are two common mistakes: one mistake is to think, "I want to do good, I hope to do good, and I hope to obtain a spiritual life." The second mistake is to think, "I am already saved, and there is no need for me to move a finger." It seems as if Christ will make this one zealous without prayer, reading, or making any offerings. The former mistake is thinking that one can do good by himself; the latter mistake is thinking that one needs to do nothing after he is saved. When a person is saved, he cannot have a spiritual living if he is not diligent. But if he does not trust in God, he will not succeed either. He must believe that God is operating within to enable him to will and work, which results in being able to pray, read the Bible, and testify. Believing comes first, then the working out. The kingdom is taken by violence, and only violent men seize it (Matt. 11:12). Day by day we have to diligently work out our salvation. We are not hopeless because God has operated. Since we have received this operation, we will surely be able to do it. Let us consider an example.</P><P>When the Lord taught His disciples, He said, "Take heed to yourselves. If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him. And if he sins against you seven times in a day and turns again to you seven times, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him" (Luke 17:3-4). Right after this word, the disciples prayed, "Increase our faith." The disciples knew they could not do this. It is difficult enough to be sinned against once, twice, or three times. But if someone sins against you seven times a day and repents seven times, it becomes rather annoying and hard to endure. Therefore, they asked the Lord to increase their faith. How did the Lord answer them? "If you have faith like a mustard seed, you would have said to this sycamine tree, Be uprooted and be planted in the sea; and it would have obeyed you" (v. 6). How is this related to forgiveness? Because you have faith within, you are able to say to your hating heart, "Hatred, get away from me." Since you have such faith, when others ask you for forgiveness, you are able to say, "I forgive you." Since you believe that God has done it, you are able to do it. Faith is needed not only in forgiveness, but also in reading the Bible, praying, and not loving the world. If you believe that God makes you able, you are able.</P><P>Philippians 2:14 says, "Do all things without murmurings and reasonings." The apostle told the believers that it was God who operates within them to will and work. The result of this kind of operation is peace with others without murmurings and reasonings. Being without reasonings is having nothing doubtful or indecisive. Being without murmurings is being able to believe others and love one another. Verse 13 tells us that God's life is operating within; as a result, in verse 14 there is complete peace.</P><P>We see this not only in Philippians, but in similar examples in Ephesians and Colossians as well. After Ephesians 3:19, "That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God" (verses 20-21 are words of praise), 4:2-3 immediately says, "With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing one another in love, being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace." When the inward operating of the power of God is manifested in a believer, the result is peace. Colossians 1:11 says, "Being empowered with all power, according to the might of His glory, unto all endurance and long-suffering with joy." The might of His glory is God's great power. We think that if we have the might of God's power, we can do marvelous things, perform miracles, and accomplish great things beyond understanding. Little do we realize that long-suffering and forbearance is the supreme expression of God's power.</P><P>It is more difficult to pray to God and ask for an answer than it is to be patient with a bothersome saint. Long-suffering is hard, but God's power can enable us. All three Epistles speak about a Christian being able to have peace with others and being long-suffering and forbearing once he receives the operating and filling of God.</P><P>Philippians 2:15 says, "That you may be blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as luminaries in the world." "Blameless" means that others have nothing to say against you. "Guileless" is being inwardly single and not double-minded. "Crooked" is not straight, while "perverted" means disjointed and unrelated. The word "generation" in this verse can be translated as "species" according to the original text. The main point of this verse is that a Christian is distinct in the midst of a species which is crooked and disjointed from the will of God; he is single and blameless. He is like a light in the world. To "shine" is an expression of life.</P><P>Verse 16 says, "Holding forth the word of life, so that I may have a boast in the day of Christ that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain." Some believers think that it is not necessary to open their mouths to testify and that they only need to lead others by good behavior. However, this is only what quiet believers would say. We should hold forth the word of life. We should bring forth the word of life; in other words, we should lift it up purposely so that others may see. Not only do we need to testify by our lives, but by our mouths also. The Bible never tells us to testify only by life, without our mouths. Among our relatives, friends, and people we have contact with, we must open our mouths to testify; otherwise, we have not held forth the word of life. It is true that Matthew says, "You are the light of the world" (5:14). However, the Bible also tells us to confess the Lord's name. If you are able to believe, please believe that you are not only able to shine among those around you, but you are also able to testify to them as well. Paul meant that if you do this, you will be perfect.</P><P>"The day of Christ" is the day when Christ will reign. "Run in vain" refers to finding the sinners and preaching the gospel. "Labor" refers to serving the saints, shepherding them, and preaching to them. The apostle was indicating that if the Philippians would hold forth the word of life, he, in the day of Christ, would not have run in vain, neither labored in vain.</P><P>Philippians 2:17 says, "But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and I rejoice together with you all." This is the same as Romans 12:1 which says, "Present your bodies a living sacrifice." Paul meant that if the believers were able to present themselves to God, he was willing to even give up his life and die with them. If they really presented themselves as gifts to God, he was willing to even give up his own life.</P><P>Paul had rejoiced already. However, he also wanted them to rejoice with him. Philippians 2:18 says, "And in like manner you also rejoice, and you rejoice together with me." Verse 17 says that Paul had rejoiced already and that he would rejoice with them all. In this verse he said that they should rejoice and rejoice with him. Oh, those who have God's power operating within them have nothing else but joy.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, we should believe in what God has done; then we will also be able. Now all we need is to be willing.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SURRENDER OF THE WILL</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 17</H2><P>There are two aspects to our union with God: one is a union in life, and the other is a union in the will. Our union with God in life refers to receiving the life of God at the time of our regeneration. Just as God lives through the Holy Spirit, we also, henceforth, live through the Holy Spirit. This is a union in life. We share one life with God. This is something inward. What expresses this one life is the will. The union in the will is something outward. The meaning of a union with God in the will is that we have only one will with God. These two unions are related to each other and are not independent. But here we will only speak of the union in the will; other matters are beyond the scope of our discussion. The union of the new life is spontaneous, because this new life is just God's life. There are some problems related to the union in the will, however, because the will obviously refers to our will.</P><P>After our regeneration God is seeking a union between our will and His will day by day. If our will is not fully joined to God, salvation has not yet been fully accomplished; man is not yet in full harmony with God. Not only does God desire that we receive His life, but He also desires that we be in union with Him. The will is absolutely ours. If our will is not in union with His will, then we are not in union with God.</P><P>If we read the Bible carefully, we will find a general principle concerning all sin: sin is rebellion. We perish due to the sin of Adam, and we are saved through the obedience of Christ. Formerly we were sons of rebellion, but God wants us to be children of obedience. Actually, rebellion is agreeing with our own will, while obedience is submission to God's will. God saved us so that we would deny our will and be joined to His will. Believers today often commit a great mistake here. They think that spiritual life is simply a matter of happiness in their emotion and knowledge in their mind. They diligently seek after all kinds of feelings and biblical knowledge; they think that these things are most excellent. At the same time, they accomplish many good, great, and important works according to their feelings and thoughts, thinking that these works will be most pleasing to God. Little do they realize that God does not require believers to feel or think anything; He only requires believers to be joined to Him in their will. He desires to see believers wholeheartedly seeking after what He is after and willing to do what He says. Without the believers' unconditional surrender and willingness to accept the whole counsel of God, all of their so-called spiritual living is superficial, no matter how much holiness and joy they feel, and no matter what strange teachings they obtain. All visions, dreams, voices, signs, zeal, work, activities, and labor are outward. If believers are not resolved in their will to finish God's course, everything else is useless.</P><P>If we are joined to God in our will, we will immediately cease from all activities that originate from our self. This means that we will no longer have any independent acts. To our self we have become dead, and to God we have become alive. This does not mean that we will act for God according to our impulse or ways. It means that we will move as a result of God's moving and that we will be delivered from all activities of the self. In other words we have changed our center and starting point. Formerly, all of our works were centered upon our self, and all activities originated from our self. Now everything belongs to God. God does not ask about the nature of the things we initiate; He only asks who initiates them. God does not care for anything that is not completely free from the self, no matter how good it may be.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A LETTER ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(By Ruth Lee)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 18</H2><P>Brothers and sisters in the Lord:</P><P>This issue will be the last issue of this magazine for this year.

Chapter one can be separated into two large sections. The first section speaks of what one receives by the riches of God's grace-the apostle told the believers the measure they had received, that God in Christ had blessed them with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies (vv. 1-14). The second section is the apostle Paul's prayer. Though they had obtained, he prayed for them lest they not know what they had obtained. In this way they might come to know the might of His strength that raised the Lord Jesus from the dead (vv. 15-23).</P><P>Chapter two is an explanation of the mighty power of resurrection in the previous chapter. It fully explains the question concerning salvation. Verses 1-10 first speak of our condition before we believed in the Lord. Second, these verses tell what Christ has accomplished; third, they explain how we can obtain what Christ has accomplished; and fourth, they speak of what we should do after we have obtained what Christ has accomplished. We will now look at this portion verse by verse.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR CONDITION BEFORE BELIEVING</H2><P>Verse 1 says, "And you, though dead in your offenses and sins." The last chapter calls to our attention the surpassing greatness of His power and the might of His strength. Chapter two starts off by letting us know what kind of persons we were before we were saved. If we want to see what salvation is, and if we want to grow spiritually, it is most important for every one of us to know what kind of persons we were originally. The Bible not only says that we were sinners who committed sin and did evil; it also says that we were dead! We always think that we are just sinners and that all we need is improvement. However, we do not realize that we are dead persons who cannot be improved.</P><P>What is a dead person lacking? Life. We were dead in our offenses and sins. It was not just that we were so evil, committing sins; we were also short of life. Death includes two things: first, it has no life; and second, it cannot produce life. Thus, because of what we were, we could never be like God. Only with life is there the possibility of growth, power, and organic unity. Because we did not have the life of God, we were dead to the holiness, power, and glory of God; we could not be holy, powerful, and glorious as He is. Only a living one can live; no dead one can live. Originally, we were dead. Unless we received life, it would be impossible for us to have a holy living.</P><P>God said we were dead. Let me ask, is our death like wood or rock? No, dead wood or rock stays the same all the time. The death of our being, however, decays and corrupts. We become more and more rotten. God does not want us to improve, because we are dead. We should not try to improve a corpse. We do not have the strength to do good. We cannot overcome the world. We cannot resist temptations, because we are dead.</P><P>What kind of death is this? This is not physical death; it is not ordinary death. It is a death that dies in offenses and sins. Offense in the original language means a slight overstep. For example, in running a race, alongside the track there are straight lines to set the boundaries. Overstepping these lines a little will constitute a violation of game rules, and one will be disqualified from the race. This slight overstepping is called an offense. Sins are filthy and dirty things. Offenses are not as serious as sins. All through our lives we live between these two-offenses or sins. Not committing sins, not loving the world, and not being moved by temptation were beyond our power to control because we were dead in offenses and sins.</P><P>The Lord Jesus also said that man is dead. "Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life. Truly, truly, I say to you, An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live" (John 5:24-25). The Lord said that when a sinner is saved, not only will he have eternal life and escape condemnation, but he will also pass from death into life. The Lord also told us that a sinner is not merely a sinner; he is a dead person. This is why He said that the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God.</P><P>Because one is dead, he has absolutely no hope for God's holiness, righteousness, power, and glory. There is no possibility for him to attain these things. Since we know that man is dead, the first thing to overcome is death. We are not afraid of sin, but we are afraid of death. Medical doctors all know that there are poisons in many kinds of food. But a man with an active life is not afraid of the poisons. His concern is not how to get rid of the poison, but how to have a strong life that fights off the poison. Sin will not die, but a vigorous life can overcome sin.</P><P>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He never committed a sin. Was it because He had an especially good family? Or was it because He had an especially good environment? Was the society at the time especially good? Or was it because the world did not tempt Him or Satan did not test Him? We know that none of these was the case. It was not because the Lord did not meet any difficulties. Rather, the Lord had the life of God, and sin and evil could not touch Him. This is why we are not afraid of sin but are afraid of death. Sin will not die, but we can overcome it with life.</P><P>Ephesians 2:2 says, "In which you once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit which is now operating in the sons of disobedience." Verse 1 speaks of death, and verse 2 of our walk. Verse 1 speaks of the original condition of man-death,  verse 2 of what is worked out by man.</P><P>In which denotes the offenses and sins in verse 1. Originally, man took offenses and sins as a way to walk. We have to be clear. We were dead in offenses and sins and had no power and life; therefore, we walked in offenses and sins. The world advises us to cultivate and improve ourselves. So we thought that if we prayed more and read the Bible more, we would overcome sin. But because we were dead, we had no way but to walk in offenses and sins.</P><P>The Bible says we have three enemies: (1) the world, (2) Satan, (3) and the flesh. In this verse, two enemies are mentioned-the world and Satan. The next verse mentions the flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WORLD</H2><P>According to the age of this world can be translated "according to the fashion of this world." This shows us that man is driven around by the world. Is it not true that we like to follow fashion? Sins differ from age to age. Every generation has its own sins; likewise, every period has its own sins. When we were dead in our offenses and sins, we were fond of fashions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SATAN</H2><P>"The ruler of the authority of the air" is the devil. The earth is for man, and the air is for the devil. The Lord once compared the devil to the birds in the air. "The ruler" is "the spirit which is now operating in the sons of disobedience." "The sons of disobedience" are the people of the world. The Bible mentions the sons of light and the sons of the kingdom of God. The sons are especially qualified by these adjectives. They are "the sons of light" because they do things in the light and "the sons of the kingdom of God" because they are going to inherit the kingdom. Thus, to say "the sons of disobedience" means that the wills of these people are against God.</P><P>It is very easy to commit a sin. One does not have to fast for three days and three nights in order to sin. He does not have to try hard or exercise his will. Because there is an evil spirit moving in the heart of man, it becomes very easy to commit a sin.</P><P>This verse helps us to realize what we were originally: "according to the age of this world," we loved the world;  and "according to the ruler of the authority of the air," we obeyed the devil. </P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FLESH</H2><P>Ephesians 2:3 says, "Among whom we also all conducted ourselves once in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest." Verse 1 says, "you," and verse 2 also says, "you." But when we come to verse 3, it says "we." Paul included himself. He did not want to mislead the Ephesians into thinking that only the Gentiles and the Ephesians were portrayed in verses 2 and 3 and that Paul, being an apostle, Jew, and Pharisee, was thus different. Paul wanted others to see that even an apostle and a Jew was by nature the same as the Gentiles, dead in his offenses and sins.</P><P>What were we doing among the sons of disobedience? Not only did we love the world and obey the devil, but we also "conducted ourselves once in the lusts of our flesh." Conducted ourselves in the original language implies activity. Originally, man's moving to and fro from morning until evening was just the activity of the flesh.</P><P>Doing in the original means "satisfying." Doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts means satisfying the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts. The desires of the flesh are on the outward things, and the desires of the thoughts are in the mind. When we were doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, we were trying to satisfy ourselves both outwardly and inwardly.</P><P>Brothers and sisters! We have to see clearly that our destination was determined: We "were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest." According to our nature, we were the same as the rest. Hence, our destination was also the same as the rest-children of wrath, waiting for the judgment and wrath of God! If this is all we have, how miserable we are! But thanks be to God that there are two words after this that turn the tide: "but God."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S SALVATION IN CHRIST</H2><P>Ephesians 2:4 says, "But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us." Oh! I was dead in my offenses and sins and could not overcome the temptation of the world, the enticing of Satan, and the corruption of the flesh. But God has a way, brothers and sisters. Please remember, it does not say, "But I." This would mean me setting my will, rejecting sin, and trusting in the Lord in this or that way. Rather, it says, "But God." Praise the Lord! We have, "But God!" God is rich in mercy! Because of His great love with which He loved us, He came to save us.</P><P>Verse 5 says, "Even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)." This is the great love with which He loved us. Christ died and rose again after three days. It was the life of God in Christ that quickened Christ. The stripes on Christ's back, the thorns on His head, and the nail wounds on His hands and feet were all healed; only scars were left. What doctor is there who can heal such a severe wound and heal it so quickly? No one. Christ was made alive this way because He has the life of God. When we were dead in our offenses and sins, God gave us life, in the same manner that the life of God was given to Christ to make Him alive from the dead. So to be saved is to have the life of God enter into a dead person and make him alive.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, do you think it is difficult to be free from sins and evil? Do you think it is difficult to deny the world? Do you think it is difficult to withstand Satan? There are examples of people being taken over by the devil. When the Lord told the disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders, chief priests, and scribes and be killed, Peter said, "God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!" (Matt. 16:22). The Lord turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan!" (v. 23). Peter, after being taken over by Satan, began to demonstrate a fear of suffering. Judas betrayed the Lord because Satan got into his heart (Luke 22:3). Ananias and Sapphira kept back part of the money because Satan had filled their heart-they loved the good name of consecration, yet they were unwilling to have a complete consecration themselves (Acts 5:3). We consider many things to be very, very difficult for only one reason: we are dead in our offenses and sins.</P><P>Even when we were like this, God made us alive together with Christ! In the same way that God put life into Christ and made Christ alive, He is also putting life into us and making us alive. When the temptation comes, there is no need for us to struggle. We have to realize that death is reigning and that only life can overcome it. For instance, if we are going to lose our temper, we should not tell ourselves how we should strive to control it; rather, we should tell the Lord, "Lord, may Your life fill me." Brothers and sisters, to overcome sin requires the law of the Spirit of life, not our own righteousness. We put righteousness against sin and life against death. But God overcomes death with life; He also overcomes sin with life. "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." There is a difference between sin and death; however, to overcome both sin and death, we only need life.</P><P>Ephesians 2:6 says, "And raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus." Brothers and sisters, Christ has redeemed us not only that we may receive a new life, but also that we may be raised up. What is the difference between being made alive in verse 5 and being raised up in verse 6? Do we know the difference? Being made alive and being raised up have no difference in what we gain practically; however, being made alive and being raised up are very different in their meaning. Verse 5 says God made us alive together with Christ. We were dead in our offenses and sins, and God gave us life which made us alive. Verse 6 says He raised us up with Christ. God made us to die with Christ so that we would be dead to sin. Therefore, God raised us up with Christ so that we would live to Him. The Bible speaks of our two relationships to sin: we were dead in sins (Eph. 2:1), and we have died to sin (Rom. 6:2). Dead in sins means that even though we are alive, we are dead to everything but sin, only loving what is sinful and evil. It is like a person who enjoys smoking opium; he smokes opium all day long. His every thought is filled with opium. We say that this kind of person is dead in opium. Dead to sin means that we have broken off the relationship with sin. Sin can no longer tempt us because we are dead. If the man who used to enjoy opium does not enjoy it anymore, he is like a dead person to opium; the opium can tempt him no longer. Those who are dead in sins need to be made alive together with Christ; those who are dead to sin need to be raised up together with Christ.</P><P>Thanks and praise be to God! We have obtained all of these things. We have been made alive together with Christ, and we have been raised up together with Christ. God has made us alive together and raised us up together with Christ. Not only so, He has also seated us together with Christ in the heavenlies.</P><P>Ephesians 2:1-3 tells us we were in three kinds of conditions when we were dead in offenses and sins: (1) according to the age of this world, (2) according to the ruler of the authority of the air, and (3) in the lusts of our flesh. God has redeemed us and has overcome Satan in Christ Jesus. He has given us resurrection life to conquer the flesh, and He has seated us in the heavenlies to overcome the world. God's salvation enables us to overcome these three enemies: the flesh, Satan, and the world. If we are seated in the heavenlies, then we are in complete victory.</P><P>We have been made alive together, raised up together, and seated together with Christ in the heavenlies. I would like for you to pay attention to the most important point: you have been made alive together with Christ, you have been raised up together with Christ, and you have been seated together with Christ in the heavenlies. Someone might say to you that you should be raised up together with Christ. But let me tell you: you have already been raised up together with Christ. Someone might encourage you to seek after an ascended life, but let me tell you: you are already seated in the heavenlies. When Christ was made alive, we were made alive together with Him. When Christ was raised up, we were also raised up together with Him. When Christ was seated in the heavenlies, we were seated with Him in the heavenlies. We thank God that together we have obtained all these things!</P><P>If you are tempted this afternoon to lose your temper, you may think that victory over temptation is not by struggling but by life, and in so thinking you may pray to God, "O God, please make me alive, raise me up, and seat me in the heavenlies." Are you right in doing so? If you do this, I tell you, you do not yet understand God's salvation at all.</P><P>What is salvation? Salvation is God's accomplishment for us. God has already made me alive together with Christ, raised me up together, and seated me together with Him in the heavenlies. I do not have to ask God to make me alive, to raise me up, or to seat me in the heavenlies. He has already done this. This is faith. Faith is to believe that what God has done is true. Unbelief is to think that you ought to do something. Psychological illusion is to imagine things that are not as though they were; but faith is to see the unseen things. Just because we cannot see them does not mean that they do not exist.</P><P>Therefore, in Christ we have been made alive, have been raised up, and have been seated in the heavenlies. When temptation comes, we should speak boldly, "You cannot touch me, for I have been raised up." When the world comes, we should speak boldly, "I have ascended to the heavenlies." This is salvation. This is not struggle. Lest the Ephesians would misunderstand, after the words, "Even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ," Paul immediately followed with an explanation: "By grace you have been saved." In verse 8 he purposely mentioned again, "By grace you have been saved." What is the meaning of this? For what reason did he say this? There was a good reason. Paul was afraid that we would think that to live is very difficult. We might not know how we can live and how we can get this life. He said that this matter is God's doing. It is by grace-not that I want to be made alive, but God has made me alive; not that I want to be raised up, but God has raised me up; not that I want to sit in the heavenlies, but God has seated me in the heavenlies. What God has prepared for us is all by grace. The first half is God's doing; the second half only needs our believing. Believing is not by feeling; if it is by feeling, it is bound to fail. Today we have to remember this well: salvation involves at least these three parts: (1) to be made alive together with Christ, (2) to be raised up together with Christ, and (3) to be seated together with Christ in the heavenlies.</P><P>Verse 7 says, "That He might display in the ages to come the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus." This verse unfolds the goal of His salvation. What is the kindness of God toward us? It was mentioned before: that when we were dead in sins, God made us alive together with Christ, raised us up together, and seated us together in the heavenlies. "The ages to come" are the countless generations in the future; this is for a demonstration to the angels. When has there been a person who has died and come back alive? But the kindness God has toward us through Christ has made dead persons alive.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MEANS OF SALVATION</H2><P>Verse 8 says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God." Being saved is the experience of Ephesians 2:5-6. By what means does salvation come? By grace. Romans 11:6 says, "But if by grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace." What does this tell us about grace? There is no need for you to do anything. Otherwise, grace is no longer grace.</P><P>Grace can save us from the temptations of the world, the enticing of Satan, and the lusts of the flesh. This is all God's work. The foundation of God's work is the grace of God, but it is through faith. The channel of this grace is faith. For example, electrical wire is for the transmission of electricity. Grace is like electricity, and faith is like the electrical wire. "By grace" indicates that it is God's work. "Through faith" indicates that faith is the channel through which grace flows.</P><P>What are we to have faith in? Thank and praise God! He has made us alive together with Christ, He has raised us up together with Christ, and He has seated us together with Christ in the heavenlies. This is not a psychological illusion. It is not just something we say with our mouth. It is a speaking by faith of what God has accomplished in Christ. Do not for a single moment let Satan say to you that you have not been made alive. You should say, "I have been made alive." Do not let the world say to you that you have not ascended to the heavenlies. You should say, "I am seated in the heavenlies." Brothers and sisters, in the same way that you were saved, even so today, you who are so weak and incapable, God's Word assures you that you have been crucified, raised up, and seated in the heavenlies. If you believe in what God has done, everything will be accomplished.</P><P>However, there is one problem, that is, the question of faith. For instance, I would ask you whether you believe that you have been made alive, raised up, and ascended? You may say that you believe. But by the afternoon, when a temptation comes, if you only say with your mouth, "I have been made alive, I have been raised up, I have ascended," it will not work at all. You will become helpless. It seems as if all the faith is gone. What should you do? Thanks be to God! Although you cannot believe, His grace can work to such an extent that you can believe-"this not of yourselves"; it is "the gift of God." Not only is salvation not of ourselves, even this faith is not of ourselves; it is the gift of God. There is a basis in the Bible for saying that God gives us faith. Second Corinthians 4:13 says, "And having the same spirit of faith." According to the original language, this phrase may be translated, "We, having received the same spirit of faith." Philippians 1:29 says, "Because to you it has been graciously granted on behalf of Christ not only to believe into Him." This shows us that we can believe because grace grants us to believe.</P><P>Does this mean that God is believing for us? No. How can we then believe? It is God who loves us and works in us until we can believe. God is changing our nature, and God is giving us a clear revelation so that we can believe. At least we should have a faith that asks God to make us believe.</P><P>Ephesians 2:9 says, "Not of works that no one should boast." We cannot even do a little bit of good. It is all by grace. We can boast of nothing. Brothers and sisters, our worst trouble is that we all want to try. We all hope that we can do well. We must believe in what Christ has accomplished, that we are separated from the world and that we have a separated life. Salvation is not of works. If one depends on works even a little, he will surely fail because the position he stands on is wrong. Please remember that you were dead, and that there is no ability in you to accomplish the righteousness and holiness of God. You must have faith in what God has accomplished. You should also know that even this "faith" is given to you by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PURPOSE OF SALVATION</H2><P>Verse 10 says, "For we are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them." In our natural state we make a big mistake, a hateful mistake. Formerly we thought that salvation was of works; now we think that since salvation is by grace and we are saved, we do not have to care for anything anymore. It is as if we do not even have to pray. All we have to do is just go to sleep and let Christ win the victory for us. As a result, we simply become lazy persons. The previous mistake is to consider justification and sanctification as something of works; the latter mistake is to think that once we are saved we do not have to do anything. But Paul says that God has saved us for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.</P><P>The word masterpiece, according to the original language, is used twice in the New Testament. It means the best in a lifetime. For example, among the paintings of a painter, the best one in his life is his masterpiece. The phrase "we are His masterpiece" indicates that we are His best; there cannot be any better. God has made us alive together, raised us up together, and seated us together with Christ.</P><P>Where did God create this masterpiece? In Christ Jesus. This shows us that when the Lord was made alive, God put us in Him. When the Lord resurrected and ascended, God also put us in Him. The creation here is the same as the new creation in 2 Corinthians 5:17.</P><P>Man says, "If I do good, I will obtain salvation." But God says, "Since you have obtained salvation, you should do good." Doing good works comes after having been raised up and ascended to the heavenlies; you do good works because you are already God's masterpiece. You must do good works, pray, read the Scriptures, and witness to others. However, if you think you will make your life better by doing these, you are wrong. Rather, by confessing that you already have a good life, you go about doing good. One should first believe that he is sanctified, then he goes about doing good. Some people fall into the danger of saying, "Christ has done everything. Hence, I do not have to do anything." This is wrong. Rather, we should say, "Since Christ has done it, therefore I should do it." Paul said, "For which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power" (Col. 1:29). Paul was striving because of the operation which operated in him in power. The more there is the inward operation, the more there will be the outward striving. God's thought is higher than our thought. We should not lean toward any one side. We should not depend on works for salvation, and neither should we do nothing just because we are saved by grace.</P><P>Ephesians 2:10 says, "Which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them." "Walk" here is in contrast to "in which you once walked" in verse 2. Because we were dead, we walked according to the dead; because we are alive, we walk according to the living. First, we die, then we commit sins; first, we are made alive, then we walk. You should say boldly, "I am able now because I have been made alive." Have you believed in Jesus as your Savior? If you have, you have already passed from death into life. Now you can walk.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, we have to believe that we have obtained salvation and that we can go about doing good works. May God bless us and His word, so that we may walk in what God prepared beforehand. We should pray more diligently, read the Scriptures more diligently, and offer up ourselves more diligently. May God bless us that we may be willing and walking for the accomplishment of His good will.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CONSCIENCE OF THE BELIEVERS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 18</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 John 3:20-21</H1><P>After the spirit of a believer has been regenerated, his conscience is enlivened. The precious blood of the Lord Jesus cleanses his conscience, causing his conscience to be pure and keen and enabling it to follow the will of the Spirit to do His work. The work that is done in man by the renewing and sanctifying Spirit and the work that is done by his conscience are related and joined one to another. If the believers are to be filled with the Spirit, be sanctified, measure up to God's will, and fully follow and walk in the Spirit, then they should pay attention to the voice of their conscience. If they do not allow their conscience to occupy the place that it should, then they will fall into the position of following and walking in the flesh. Faithfully dealing with the conscience is the first step of sanctification. Following and walking according to the conscience are the marks of true spirituality. If a fleshly believer does not let his conscience do a thorough work, he has no way to get into the spiritual realm. Even though he and other people may consider him spiritual, his spirituality is still without foundation. If sin and everything which is not according to God's will, including everything that is unbecoming of the saints, are not dealt with according to the voice of the conscience, then the spiritual foundation is not well laid. Regardless how many spiritual ideas are being built on top, they will all fall apart.</P><P>Our conscience testifies to us whether or not we are right toward men and God, whether or not what we do, think, or say measure up to God's will, and whether or not we are without rebellion to Christ. When the Christian life is progressing, the witness of the conscience and the witness of the Spirit are almost the same. When the conscience is fully governed by the Spirit, it gets sharper day by day so that it harmonizes more with the voice of the Spirit. Moreover, the Spirit speaks through the conscience. This is exactly what the apostle Paul meant by, "My conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit" (Rom. 9:1).</P><P>If our own conscience says we are not right, then surely we are wrong. If our conscience condemns us of our sin, we must repent immediately. We must not use something to cover up or bribe our conscience, since "if our heart blames us, it is because God is greater than our heart" (1 John 3:20). Would God not condemn us more? The rebuking of our conscience says we are wrong. When our heart condemns us, God will most certainly condemn us. God's holiness can never be lower than the standard of our conscience. Therefore, if our conscience tells us that we are wrong, then we must be wrong.</P><P>Since we are wrong, what shall we do? If the act has not yet been committed, we should immediately stop. If it has been done, we should repent, confess our sin, and ask for the cleansing of the precious blood. It is pitiful that believers today do not practice this. When their conscience rebukes them, they try to bribe their conscience, seeking to make peace with their conscience in order to avoid any further rebuke. Under this condition, a believer always uses two methods. The first is reasoning with his conscience. He tries to explain with reason the cause for his actions. The believer thinks that if his reasons are acceptable, then his action must be according to God's will, and his conscience can be at rest. Little does he realize that the conscience is like the intuition; it does not reason. The conscience knows God's will through the intuition. If a thing is not truly God's will, the conscience will condemn it. The conscience only speaks on behalf of God's will; it does not care for reason. A believer should not do something just because it is reasonable. He should only obey the will of God revealed in his intuition. Whenever the believer disobeys the prompting of the intuition, the conscience begins to speak and condemn him. The explanation of the believer's reason may satisfy his mind, but it is not enough to satisfy his conscience. If something condemned by the conscience is not removed, the conscience will not stop condemning it through any explanation. At the beginning the conscience is the witness only of what is right and wrong. After a believer's spiritual life has grown, the conscience will not only be a witness to things that are right or wrong but also a witness to things that are from God or not. Therefore, many things that are good according to man's eyes will still be condemned by the conscience if they are not from God's revelation but are from the believer's motivation.</P><P>The second way in which the believer seeks to make peace with his conscience is that he endeavors to do many other things to comfort the conscience. On the one hand, he does not want to obey the voice of the conscience and follow its guidance to please God; on the other hand, he is afraid of being condemned by the conscience because that condemnation makes him feel ill at ease. For this reason, he plans to do many good works. He tries to use the good works to replace God's will. He does not obey God, but he explains that what he has done is as good as what God has instructed. It may even be better, nobler, broader in range, higher in yield, richer in use, and deeper in influence than God's instruction. The believer thinks that this kind of good work is even better. However, regardless of what he does and how people evaluate it, in God's eyes there is no spiritual usefulness at all. It is not a matter of how much fat or how many burnt offerings there are, but a matter of how much obedience to God we have. If God reveals in spirit that something should be removed, regardless of how good your intention, how fatted your cattle and lambs may be, and how much value your gold and silver have, all of these will not move God's heart. The voice of conscience must be obeyed. Otherwise, regardless of how good your work is, God will never be pleased. Even if the sacrifices are many times more than God's demand, they will not cause the voice of the conscience to be silenced. The conscience only demands our obedience; it does not require us to serve God in an extraordinary way.</P><P>Therefore, let us deceive ourselves no more. If we want to walk in the Spirit, we have to listen to the leading of the conscience. Do not flee from the inner rebuking! Rather, listen carefully. If we want to walk constantly in the Spirit, we need to listen humbly and submissively to the reproving of the conscience. The believer should not make a sweeping confession, thinking that his mistakes are too many to enumerate. A vague confession will not give the conscience the opportunity for a thorough work. The believer should let the Holy Spirit reveal to him through the conscience all his sins one by one. He should humbly, quietly, and obediently allow the conscience to rebuke and condemn him of all his sins one by one. He should accept the rebuking of the conscience and be willing to eliminate everything that is against God, according to the thought of the Holy Spirit. Do you dare let the conscience inspect your life? Do you dare let the conscience tell you the real condition of your whole life? Are you willing to let the conscience lay out before you your living and behavior detail by detail according to God's thought? Are you willing to let the conscience operate on all your sins? If you dare not and are not willing, if you are filled with fears and reservations within, then you still have many more things in your life which need to be condemned and put on the cross; you have not obeyed yet. This shows that in many matters you have not completely obeyed God; you have not walked in full harmony with the Spirit. This also shows that there is not a thorough fellowship between you and your God; there are still many barriers in between. Thus, you cannot say to God, "There is no barrier between You and me."</P><P>Accepting the rebuking of the conscience, without condition and reservation, and willingly and absolutely following the conscience's revelation show whether or not our sacrifices to God are complete, whether or not we really hate sins, and whether or not we have an honest desire to do God's will. Many times we want to obey God; we want to walk in the Spirit; we want to be persons pleasing to God. Now is the time to test this willingness, to see if it is true or false, complete or defective. If we are still entangled with our sins and are not completely cut off from them, I am afraid that all our spirituality is unreal. If a believer cannot fully follow the conscience, he is not walking in the Spirit at all. Before a man has accepted the authority of the conscience, besides the spirit of imagination prompting him, the real Spirit is always pleading with him to listen to the conscience. If the believer feels condemned within and does not let himself be judged in God's light by repenting and having a thorough dealing, his spiritual life cannot have any real progress. You can tell whether a believer's consecration and work are real by merely observing whether or not he is fully obedient to the Lord --obedient to the Lord's command and the Lord's reproof.</P><P>After a believer allows his conscience to start functioning this way, he should not stop there. After one sin has been dealt with, he should go on to deal with other sins. He should go on step by step until all his sins are dealt with clearly. If a believer deals with his sins faithfully and follows his conscience faithfully, the heavenly light will shine in him more and more clearly. He will discover the sins that he neglected before. Day after day he will become clearer about the law which is written in his heart by the Holy Spirit, and he will be enabled to read and to recognize it. Thus, the believer will know what holiness, righteousness, pureness, and uprightness are. Formerly he was confused concerning these things, but now they are deeply engraved upon his heart. This is a great help to the intuition. It will increase its keenness in knowing the intention of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, while the believer's conscience is rebuking him, he should say to God, "I am willing to obey." He should let Christ be his Lord of life once more! He should be willing to be taught and trust in the teaching of the Holy Spirit. If the believer faithfully follows the conscience, the Holy Spirit will come and help him.</P><P>The conscience is the window of the believer's spirit. Heavenly light shines through this window, making the believer's spirit and whole being full of light. Likewise, the believer's whole being and spirit look upon the heavenly light through this window. Every time our thought, word, and behavior are wrong and unbecoming of the behavior of saints, the heavenly light shines in through the conscience to expose our mistakes and condemn our sins. If we let the conscience do its work, obey it, and deal with condemned sins, more heavenly light will shine next time. If we do not confess our mistakes or deal with sins, the stain of sins will remain, and our conscience will be defiled (Titus 1:15) because we do not follow the teaching of God's light. In this way one sin piles upon another, one scar adds to another, and the spiritual window becomes darker and darker day after day. It becomes harder and harder for the light to shine through, until the believer loses all sense of remorse in arbitrary sinning. His conscience is suppressed, and his intuition is numbed by sins. The more a believer becomes spiritual, the keener his conscience becomes. There is surely no believer so spiritual that he does not need to confess. If the conscience is dull or, even worse, insensitive, then the person must be fallen spiritually. Great knowledge, hard work, a stimulating emotion, and a firm will cannot replace the keenness of the conscience. If the believer does not pay attention to his conscience but only pursues the improvement of his mind and emotion, he is retrogressing in his spiritual path.</P><P>The degree of satisfying the conscience can be increased or decreased. If a believer gives room to his conscience to work, his spiritual window will become brighter and brighter. If the believer does not care for his conscience's voice but uses reasons and other works to supersede the requirement of the conscience as previously mentioned, the conscience will speak again and again. But after repeated attempts, it will stop speaking. The voice will become lower in each attempt until eventually there will be no more speaking. Each time the believer disregards his conscience's voice, his spiritual life is wounded. If the believer lets his spiritual life be wounded time after time, sooner or later he will fall into a position of being absolutely in the flesh. The hatred for sins and aspiration for victory, which previously characterized this believer's heart, will be gone. If we do not turn our face toward the conscience's rebuking, we will not know how important it is to listen to the conscience's voice in walking in the Spirit.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CIRCUMCISION</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 18</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Col. 2:10-13; Gen. 17:1, 9-14, 22-23</H1><P>We have read Colossians 2:11: "In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ." This verse makes us realize one thing: Christians are circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands. This is to say that one portion of the inheritance in Christ is the circumcision in Christ. In order that no one miss the meaning of circumcision, we should turn to Genesis 17 where the matter of circumcision was first mentioned in the Bible. If we understand what is there, we will understand Colossians 2:11.</P><P>Before speaking of circumcision, we need to know some history about Abraham. In Genesis 17, Abraham was ninety-nine years old (v. 1). Prior to this, before he was eighty-six years old, God promised Abraham that he would be granted a son. Not only would he have a son, but he would be a father of a nation as well. Abraham, knowing that he was becoming old and that Sarah was past the age of child-bearing, did not have the slightest hope. Therefore, Sarah suggested that he take Hagar as a concubine. They wanted to help God with their flesh, thinking that by so doing they could bring forth a son. Abraham took Sarah's word, and at the age of eight-six, he brought forth a son, Ishmael (16:16). In this situation, what did God do? God did not want man to act in this way. God did not want Abraham and Sarah to help by the flesh. Since they depended so much on the flesh, God left them in the cold. During a period of thirteen years, from eighty-six to ninety-nine years of age, there was nothing worth recording, that is, Abraham had no fellowship with God. Abraham, at the age of eighty-six, still had the strength to do something; by the age of ninety-nine, he had no more strength. There was no more hope. God brought him to such a point before He came to make a covenant with him, that all the males should be circumcised. One year after the making of the covenant, Sarah brought forth Isaac. First circumcision came; then Isaac came. Without circumcision, there could be no Isaac.</P><P>From this background we can understand why God instituted circumcision. What God did was contrary to Abraham's doing. At the age of eight-six, Abraham could still use the strength of the flesh and the method of man. At the age of ninety-nine, he had lost even the slightest hope in himself. If anything was to be done, it would have to be done by the Almighty God. The first time the term Almighty God is used in the Bible is in Genesis 17:1. By this time Abraham was able to realize that unless the Almighty God did something, man was totally powerless. This is the meaning of circumcision. Now let us look at the aspects of circumcision one by one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PUNISHMENT OF UNCIRCUMCISION</H2><P>Verse 14 says, "And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant." You must remember that God cannot reckon those who are uncircumcised as His people, nor can He have any dealings with them. They cannot be reckoned as the descendants of Abraham, nor can the covenant of Abraham reach them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NATURE OF CIRCUMCISION</H2><P>Verse 12 says, "And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations." Circumcision is to cut off a piece of skin from man. Please consider: when God sees that a man is born, why would He want to cut off a piece of skin from him? Is not the birth of the child the creation of God? Yes. Since God gave life to the child, why does He want man to do an additional work of cutting off a piece of skin? Why would God not cause the child to be born circumcised? Why is it necessary for man to do the circumcision? What does it mean that circumcision is to be done on the eighth day? We know that the eighth day is the day of the Lord's resurrection. Being circumcised on the eighth day means putting off the lusts of our flesh through the resurrection of Christ. The meaning of circumcision is to put off the lusts of the flesh.</P><P>Why did God not ordain man to be circumcised on the day of his birth, rather than on the eighth day? Here we see the difference between creation and redemption, the difference between the natural and the resurrected. We all understand the gospel. Does a man become a Christian by receiving spiritual life right after he is born? According to the Bible, a child born of even the best couple still needs regeneration. This is because a person born naturally only has the power of God's creation in him; he does not have the power of God's redemption in him. Man has been created by God, but man does not have the resurrection life, the life of God. The most adorable thing in the whole world is a newborn baby. A child that is just born is the most undefiled. However, on the eighth day, if he is not circumcised in Christ, he will be cut off.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, perhaps you are naturally very nice, meek, and without any entanglement of sin. Perhaps you feel that your morality is better than others. But if you are not circumcised, you are not one of God's people. If a newborn child needs to be circumcised, how much more do you and I need the same? Eight days after a child is born, he has to be circumcised. What about you and I, who have been on this earth for more than ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years? We do not know how much filth our hands have touched and how much mud our feet have touched. Even more we need to be circumcised on the eighth day! None of us can see God according to our natural condition. Without circumcision, regardless how many sermons we have heard, we will still eventually perish. According to man's natural condition, we are destined to perish.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE NEED CIRCUMCISION?</H2><P>Verse 12 says, "And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed." Who needs to be circumcised? Two kinds of people need circumcision: those who are born in the house and those bought with money. Whether born or bought, all have to be circumcised. Thank and praise God that we were both born of God and bought by God. We were not only bought by God, but also born of God.</P><P>First Peter 1:18 and 19 say, "Knowing that it was not with corruptible things, with silver or gold...but with precious blood, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ." First Corinthians 6:20 says, "For you have been bought with a price." This tells us that we were bought by God.</P><P>John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit," and 1 John 3:9 says, "Everyone who has been begotten of God..." These verses tells us that we are born of God.</P><P>We thank and praise God that although He did not make a covenant with us Gentiles, we all have the possibility of being circumcised. Exodus 12:48 says, "And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the Lord, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land." This tells us that a stranger can also be circumcised. Today, if there is anyone here who has not believed in the Lord, if you are willing to be circumcised, you can be the same as the people of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CIRCUMCISION</H2><P>The significance of circumcision is to put off the lust of the flesh. No one can serve God by the flesh. The Lord said that the flesh profits nothing (John 6:63). Romans 8:7 says that the flesh is enmity against God. If we want to serve God, have a share of the covenant, and do the works of God, we must put off the flesh.</P><P>What is the meaning of the flesh? The flesh is what man has by his birth, what man has originally before he believes in the Lord. Whether it is good or bad, the flesh has to be circumcised because it is not subject to God, neither can it be. Even if the flesh does good, it still cannot please God. If we, who have believed in the Lord, want to please God, we have to be circumcised in the heart. The descendants of Abraham were circumcised in the body; we need to be circumcised in the heart. Being circumcised in the heart is not only found in the New Testament; it is found in the Old Testament as well.</P><P>Jeremiah 4:4 says, "Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah, / And remove the foreskins of your heart." A filthy heart cannot see God. Brothers and sisters, let me ask you a most straightforward question: Are all your hearts clean and without any filthiness? Many people have pride, jealousy, and filthiness in their heart. Without cutting these off, they cannot see God. Someone with an unclean heart cannot see God. An unholy one cannot see God. Perhaps your outward behavior is quite good. Yet inwardly, you love the world, and in your heart you commit the sins which the immoral commit. Are you inwardly envious of others' houses, cattle, servants, or wives? If these are not put off from your heart, you cannot participate in God's covenant.</P><P>Jeremiah 9:25-26 says, "Behold, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when I will punish all those who are circumcised and yet uncircumcised...for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart." All the nations are uncircumcised in their bodies. All those of the house of Israel are circumcised in their bodies, but uncircumcised in their hearts. These people will be cut off by God. Today we do not care for a circumcision in the past. We are concerned about are our hearts. Brothers and sisters, our hearts are most difficult to overcome. Outwardly we can deceive others, but inwardly we are rotten. The uncircumcised in heart cannot draw near to God. Today it is not a matter of how we are outwardly, but of how we are inwardly.</P><P>Deuteronomy 10:16 says, "Circumcise then the foreskin of your heart." The meaning here is to remove the filth of your heart.</P><P>Deuteronomy 30:6 says, "And Jehovah your God will circumcise your heart." This means the same as the foregoing verse, that is, to cut off the filth of the heart.</P><P>The foregoing verses of the Old Testament lay considerable stress on the circumcision of the heart. There is even more emphasis in the New Testament. Romans 2:28 and 29 are most apparent. They clearly tell us that circumcision is not outward in the flesh but inward of the heart. It is not in the letter but in the spirit. What God spoke to Abraham was only the circumcision of the flesh. Today God has gone a step further. Now all must be circumcised in the heart. Whoever is uncircumcised in the heart cannot participate in the covenant of Abraham. The apostle Paul wrote the book of Galatians to show us that we have a share in the covenant of Abraham. God's promise to Abraham was prior to the law. What we receive came before the law. If any pride or envy is in our hearts and if they are not put off, we have no share in the covenant of Abraham. Instead, we will be cut off.</P><P>When we talk about the meaning of circumcision, if we just stop here, we are preaching the law and not the gospel. Thank and praise God that we have the gospel; we have a way to put off the lust of our heart.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRISTIANS BEING CIRCUMCISED IN CHRIST<br>WITH A CIRCUMCISION NOT MADE WITH HANDS</H2><P>Colossians 2:11 says, "In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ." Hallelujah! We thank and praise God because this verse tells us that we were circumcised in Christ. If it said that we are to be circumcised, then it would be wrong and it would be the gospel of hell. God's Word says were. I hope that we would underscore the word were even more. It is not soon to be, but were. It is in Christ that we were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands. What does this mean? This is God's work! We do not know how filthy our hearts are! But on the day of Christ's death, all the filth was crucified on the cross and cut off. This is not the work of others' hands or the work of our own hands. It is Christ who enables us to put off the filth of the lust of the flesh. This is the gospel!</P><P>Brothers and sisters, according to your natural condition, you are filthy. If you say that you do not consider yourselves as being that bad, you are deceiving yourselves. What does 1 John 1:8 say? "If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us." Self-deceived ones are the biggest liars in the world. A big liar lies to others, but a bigger liar lies to himself. We are really dirty and full of sins. We think that by willing, by vowing, by a few more prayers, or perhaps by some more Bible reading, we will be all right. However, these things will not make us victorious. Perhaps you have not committed filthy sins up till now; therefore, you may feel that you are victorious. But let me tell you: you have not yet gained victory. Brothers and sisters, victory does not depend upon how you exercise your will or pray or how you read the Bible. Victory depends upon the fact that God crucified your filth on the day of Christ's death. This is the gospel! Today, will you believe it or not? Perhaps you do not feel any change or any peace. However, I ask you to just believe. As long as you believe, you are victorious.</P><P>You should take note that the victory is in Christ and not in you. What is in you is still old. The victory is only in Him. You need to join yourselves to Him. He is the vine, and you are the branches. He is the Head, and you are the members. It is of God that you are in Christ. On the cross, Christ not only redeemed you and gave you eternal life, He also crucified the evil I on the cross. In Him, everything has been accomplished. This is the gospel!</P><P>God is not doing anything for you today. He has accomplished everything in Christ. If from today on you do not look at yourself anymore but only at Him, then you will say, "God! I thank and praise You!" This is the gospel! Do not be mistaken! It is not that you must crucify yourself. Nowhere in the New Testament does it tell you to crucify yourself. Instead, the Bible says you have been crucified, you have been circumcised, and everything has been accomplished. Brothers and sisters, the question today is whether or not you believe. Can you say that you have been circumcised on the day of Christ's crucifixion? If you believe, this fact will become your experience.</P><P>You may look at yourself and ask why you are still the same, when the gospel you heard says that you have been circumcised. At this moment, Satan will come to tempt. He will say that you are just the same as you have always been and have not changed at all. He will say that the words God said about your circumcision are probably not true! Unconsciously, your faith begins to waver! Many think that, in order to overcome temptation and be above any contamination of sins, it is best if God can give them a proof in their hearts, so that they can feel that they are much better than they were before. However, let me tell you that there is no better proof than the Word of God. If you believe the Word of God, that is the proof. The biggest proof is what God has said, more than whether you become better or feel better! Therefore, brothers and sisters, God's Word says that we have been circumcised in Christ with a circumcision not made with hands. If you believe it, that is good enough. Many will not believe the Word of God without first seeing a change in themselves. This is a big mistake. It is not faith. When you begin to waver in the midst of your daily problems, you should believe that the Word of God is still true. Regardless of your experience, it does not make the Word of God untrue, nor does it make it more true. If you think that what you have heard today is right and that you have really been circumcised because you are a little more patient, or if you think that you have really been circumcised once you have overcome temptation, then let me tell you that this is not faith. It is symptom watching; it is an introspection of your own experience. If this is the case, you will surely fail. It is my experience that whether I feel good or bad, if I believe the Word of God, I can be as firm as a mountain. My feet are upon a rock, and nothing can move me.</P><P>If you consider that you are all right and still have some self-confidence, you will stumble. If you truly believe God's Word, considering whatever God says of you to be true, the inexhaustible power of God will be manifested in you, enabling you to overcome temptations and sins that were previously insurmountable. You will realize that this is not your work but the work of God. You will see all the filth fall away, even as a piece of skin falls away from those who are circumcised in the flesh.</P><P>God has accomplished everything in Christ. Whether you feel it or not is not the question. What is important is believing that you are circumcised because God said you have been circumcised in Christ. There is no need to hold on to anything. God cares for the faithfulness of His Word more than your desire for victory. Just take care of believing, and God will take care of success. Many young believers want to hold on to victory by their own strength, but once temptation comes, they fail. Satan then tells you that even after believing you are still the same as you were formerly. Once you consider that this is right, you will be discouraged. If there is a hero of faith who, from the time he believes to the time he experiences, will stand still and hold fast to the attitude that "God said, and it is so," then God will gain the glory. In all the circumstances which are contrary to the Word of God, if you still believe in the Word of God, God will gain the glory. Although there is a cloud above you, the sun above the cloud is still there. Although the circumstance is dark, God's Word is still true. If you believe in God's Word in any circumstance, no cloud can be above your head; your sun will be real. Not believing in God's Word is the biggest sin in the whole world.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, today the gospel preached and the message delivered are that you can be victorious. If you cannot be victorious, it is because of your lack of faith. If you still have lust, it is not that Christ has not accomplished salvation, but it is that you do not want it; you refuse to open to it and do not believe. The fact is that you still harbor filth. Christ has accomplished salvation. If there is a sinner who is not saved, it is not because Christ has not saved him or not shed His blood to redeem him. It is because the sinner is unwilling to believe. If you go home and are not able to manifest the Word of God, then your understanding is merely mental; you do not really have faith. If you are seeking, are willing, and believe the Word of God, glorious days will soon be here. While walking on the earth, you will only see the sun; there will be no clouds. May God give us faith. May we all believe the Word of God today. When we believe, we will immediately obtain.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>PHILIPPIANS 3:3</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 18</H2><P>If we allow the Holy Spirit to do a deeper work through the cross, the circumcision we received will become more real each day. "For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh" (Phil. 3:3). The confidence in the flesh has been lost because of the circumcision not made with hands. Here the apostle reckons boasting "in Christ Jesus" as the center of all things. He points out the danger to us on the one hand, and the guarantee on the other. Confidence in the flesh easily ruins our boasting in Christ Jesus, while worshipping in spirit causes us to gain the blessing of life and truth. The Holy Spirit exalts the Lord Jesus and humbles the flesh. If we want to boast in Christ and want Him to boast in us, if we want to glory in Christ Jesus in our experience, we must, on one hand, receive the circumcision of the cross and, on the other hand, learn to worship in the Holy Spirit. There is no need for strife because strife is the work of the flesh. There is no need for methods because methods are only necessary when the flesh is employed. It is absolutely a matter of having no confidence in the flesh, regardless of how nice or capable we are. We should believe only in the Holy Scriptures and submit only to the Lord. If there is faith and submission, the flesh will be humbled, stay in its cursed position, and lose its power. May God be gracious to us so that we will look down on ourselves more and more, rely less and less on ourselves, and realize more and more deeply how absolutely useless we are. May we have absolutely no confidence in the flesh. This is the real death. Without death, we will not have this experience.</P></body></html>
