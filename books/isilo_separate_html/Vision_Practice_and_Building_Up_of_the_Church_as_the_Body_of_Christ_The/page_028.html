and Not Imposing Our Practice on Others</h2>
<p>To say these things is easy, but it is not easy to put them into practice. This word is very simple, but the matter itself is very complicated. We may illustrate this with the cup in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting. Concerning the cup, there are two problems. The first is how many cups there should be. Should we have one big cup or many small cups? The second problem is the content. Should it be juice or wine? In the United States there are many people who are addicted to alcohol. In their physical body there has been a chemical change that requires them never to contact actual wine. Therefore, some prefer to use grape juice in the Lord&rsquo;s table. However, others may say that according to history the ancient Jews used grapes to make wine, not juice; thus, it is not possible that the Lord Jesus used juice on that night. Suppose a brother comes to us to speak about this matter. What attitude must we take? The best way is to check with the seven ones. The problem of how to serve the cup is not included in the seven ones. Therefore, we can be liberal in this matter. If a matter is not among the seven ones, it is right to be general.</p>
<p>We need to learn to be liberated from our opinion. We all have our own opinion in spiritual things. If our opinion is to have one cup, it will be hard to go along with those who want many cups. This may cause us to dig in the Scriptures until we find Luke 22:17, which says, &ldquo;Take this and divide it among yourselves.&rdquo; Then we may say, &ldquo;See? This means that we should start with one big cup and then divide it into many cups.&rdquo; Someone may raise another argument, pointing out that since medical science is so advanced, we all know that we spread germs when we drink from one cup. The one who is in favor of many cups will have many things to say, and the one whose opinion is in favor of one cup will have more arguments to give. We should realize that underneath the arguments is our favorite practice. We must be liberated from our favorite practice. If we are in favor of one cup, we need to be liberated. It is better to learn the lesson to go along with the brother who is in favor of many cups. At the same time, he should also learn to go along with those who favor one cup. Eventually, we will all go along with the Lord. Then we will be liberated. Do not insist on one cup or on many cups. Again, to say this is easy, but to practice it is not easy. This is not a small matter.</p>
<p>There are many items that are subject to argument. Many people argue about the Trinity. Some say that we should not teach that the Son is both the Father and the Spirit. If we do not say this, however, what should we do with Isaiah 9:6, which tells us that a Son is given, but His name is called Eternal Father. Moreover, what should we do with 1 Corinthians 15:45, which says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,&rdquo; and 2 Corinthians 3:17, which says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; You must give me the liberty to say that, according to these verses, the Son is the Father and the Spirit. However, I also must not demand that others speak in the way I do. Others should not demand me to speak one way, and I should not insist that they speak another way.</p>
<p>It is the same with the gift of speaking in tongues. If a brother speaks in tongues, we should not oppose him. Before the Lord, I must admit that I do not like to speak in tongues. I had this experience in the past, but now I do not want it any more. Nevertheless, if someone speaks in tongues, I will not oppose him, and if I do not speak in tongues, he should not oppose me. It is too much for anyone to impose speaking in tongues on those who do not practice it. If you like to eat English muffins, then eat them. I prefer another kind of bread. If you eat your muffin, and I eat my bread, neither of us should oppose the other. None of these matters are included in the seven ones. Speaking in tongues is not among the seven ones, and particular truths concerning the Trinity are also not clearly stated in the seven ones. We all need to learn this lesson.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Liberal Attitude toward Others<br />
for the Sake of the Oneness</h2>
<p>Our attitude must be liberal, and we should not be divided. Nevertheless, to practice the oneness is not very easy. When some came among us with the practice of speaking in tongues, I begged them not to insist on or impose this practice. I said, &ldquo;If you want to speak in tongues, then do it, and if others do not want to speak in tongues, let them not do it. If you impose this on others, you will cause a division.&rdquo; At that time only about twenty percent of the saints agreed with speaking in tongues. I told those certain ones that to insist on their practice would frighten away the eighty percent. Then only those who agree with speaking in tongues would be left. What then would be the need to come together to practice the church life? They might as well have stayed where they had been before. Eventually, some stopped meeting with us because we would not impose speaking in tongues.</p>
<p>Many brothers can testify that I was not bothered by their practice. We could go along even with their playing of the tambourine. However, they should have taken care of others&rsquo; feeling. This is not any person&rsquo;s meeting. It is a meeting of the church, and the church includes all the believers. We need to bear the responsibility in this matter. We should not be persons who insist on a practice. We need to be liberated from all these things. Unless something is actually sinful, we can go along with it, because all these items are not touched by the seven ones.</p>
<p>Do not think that this is a small matter. We need to know the proper teaching concerning many different matters. However, knowing the teaching is one thing, but our attitude is another. According to Romans 14, the apostle Paul was very clear about the keeping of days and the eating of foods. However, his attitude was very liberal. He did not tell people what was right and what was wrong. As far as teaching was concerned he was very clear, but as far as attitude was concerned he was liberal. We know that baptism by immersion is proper, for example, but if someone insists on baptizing by sprinkling, we will not fight with him. If he feels the peace to do it, he can do it. We are liberal in this matter because the method of baptism is not included in the seven ones. In order to keep the oneness we need to drop certain things. If we do not drop them, we will cause divisions. We may be one with those who do not agree with immersion. However, they may not be at peace, always thinking of how to convince us to go along with sprinkling. We should not be this way. We have no intention to convince others to go along with us, so they likewise should not try to convince us.</p>
<p>We must be very liberal, while always keeping the oneness and holding the mystery of the faith. We must be willing to sacrifice our lives to keep the faith, but as for other matters we need to be liberated. If we do this, we will have the oneness. Otherwise, we may say that we have oneness, but our real oneness will be in doubt. On the one hand, we strictly hold the mystery of the faith that God is the Triune God who was incarnated as a man to mingle Himself with us through His redemption. Even to the sacrifice of our lives we must hold to this. As to other things, however, we must be liberal. All the divisions, denominations, and sects come from holding to things other than the seven ones.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> </body></html>
