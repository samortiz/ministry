   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE GREATER SOLOMON</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Following the Lord's reference to Jonah, He spoke of Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to historical sequence, Solomon preceded Jonah.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But here, according to spiritual sequence, Jonah precedes Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What Jonah typifies of the Lord Jesus comes first; what Solomon typifies of the Lord Jesus follows.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jonah typifies Christ as the resurrected One; Solomon typifies Christ as the One in resurrection with wisdom to accomplish God's eternal purpose, to build up God's house, the temple, and to rule over God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our Christ is firstly today's Jonah, and secondly today's Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is the resurrected One, and He is the One in resurrection with wisdom to build God's house and rule over God's kingdom, thus accomplishing God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What we need is not signs or miraculous things, but the resurrected Christ as our resurrection life to build up God's house, to fulfill God's purpose, and accomplish God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE LORD'S PRESENT RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am really happy with the Lord's grace shown in the church in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some dear ones have come to our meetings and after staying for some time have made the following comment: "It is really strange you people do not speak in tongues, yet your meetings are more living than the meetings of those who speak in tongues."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They never believed that people who do not speak in tongues could have such living meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The dear one who made this observation in Los Angeles also made the same observation in the church in Houston.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Even we who speak in tongues," he said, "do not have such meetings."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus never cares for any forms, ways, or traditions the Lord Jesus only cares for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now the age of the doctrines and gifts is over.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not mean that today we do not have the doctrines or the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all know that the Lord's recovery began with Martin Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The unique item of the Lord's recovery at that time was the matter of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can say now and I believe we are all clear concerning this that the age of the recovery of justification by faith is over.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This does not mean that we do not need justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Following Martin Luther, the matter of sanctification by faith was also recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you read the history of the Lord's recovery, you will realize that at a certain period many of the Lord's servants, including John Wesley, paid their full attention to the matter of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The matter of sanctification or holiness was fully recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A little later, the matter of the inner life was also recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These are all various stages or ages of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first stage of His recovery was that of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was followed by item after item, age after age.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was at the end of the last century and the beginning of this century that the Pentecostal experience was also recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is difficult to trace its origin: some say it began with the Welsh revival in 1903 and 1904; others say it began earlier than this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In any case, the Lord accomplished a definite recovery through the so-called Pentecostal movement.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To some, the term "Pentecostal" does not have a good connotation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But it is a scriptural term, a good term; it is something of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In that recovery there were undoubtedly many genuine miraculous manifestations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But we all must realize that just as the stage of justification by faith is over, so also is the age of the recovery of the Pentecostal movement over.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This does not mean, however, that we do not need the Pentecostal experience or the things related to it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What we mean is that the Lord is going on to accomplish a further recovery, a recovery of Christ, the Spirit, and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the age of such a recovery.</S>
