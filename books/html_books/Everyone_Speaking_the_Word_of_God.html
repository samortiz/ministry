<h2 class="head1">IN THE OLD TESTAMENT&mdash;MOSES DESIRING<br />
THAT ALL THE LORD&rsquo;S PEOPLE WERE PROPHETS</h2>
<p>I have read the Bible for many years, but not until recently did I discover that in the book of Numbers in the Old Testament there is the concept that everyone must speak the word of God, or that everyone may speak the word of God, or, we might say, that everyone is able to speak the word of God. In summary we might say that one who is saved, one who serves the Lord, has the qualification, the right, the ability, and also the responsibility and burden to speak the word of God.</p>
<p>In Numbers 11 Moses felt that the responsibility on him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt into Canaan was too heavy (v. 14). God then told him, &ldquo;Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel...and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation&rdquo; (v. 16). Moses obeyed, and out of the seventy persons, sixty-eight came before the tabernacle. Then the Spirit fell upon all of them, and they were moved to speak. The original text says that they were all prophets (v. 29), but the Chinese Union Version of the Bible did not dare to translate it this way. The sixty-eight persons all became prophets, and all were speaking for God. Meanwhile, the Spirit also rested upon the two who remained in their own tents, and they prophesied in the camp. Some saw it and were jealous and told it to Joshua, Moses&rsquo; helper. Then Joshua came to beseech Moses and said, &ldquo;My lord Moses, forbid them&rdquo; (v. 28). Moses rebuked him immediately saying, &ldquo;Enviest thou for my sake?&rdquo; (v. 29). Then he spoke this sentence, &ldquo;Would God that all the Lord&rsquo;s people were prophets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I saw this verse, there was a strong response within me, because several years earlier in America I had the boldness to tell people that every one of them could be an apostle, a prophet, an evangelist, a shepherd, and a teacher. I gave examples showing that even the teenage sisters could be such persons. For instance, suppose your grandparents are not yet saved and you go home and tell them, &ldquo;Grandpa, I have now received the best blessing.&rdquo; Then you begin to speak the gospel to him and also to your grandmother. Finally, if the two older folks are touched and receive the Lord, are you not then an evangelist? Suppose your grandparents live in the countryside where there is no church, and you thus preach the gospel to them and they are saved. Then, suppose you bring a few brothers with you and go to them and baptize them, and you tell the two of them to begin to meet there. By doing this you establish a church there. Are you not therefore an apostle? And if you continue to go to them to speak to them, then you are a prophet. Furthermore, if you teach them, you become a shepherd and a teacher. In this way, you have all the four jobs in one person. It is risky for me to speak in this way. Praise the Lord, now I have found a solid ground in the Old Testament, and now I can be bold.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE NEW TESTAMENT&mdash;<br />
ALL BEING ABLE TO PROPHESY ONE BY ONE</h2>
<p>Paul also spoke this kind of word. In 1 Corinthians 14:31 Paul said, &ldquo;You can all prophesy one by one.&rdquo; The Chinese Union Version says, &ldquo;All may prophesy.&rdquo; The Greek has both meanings: &ldquo;all may&rdquo; means also &ldquo;all can.&rdquo; However, &ldquo;may&rdquo; refers to right, and &ldquo;can&rdquo; refers to ability. This word in Greek includes the right and also the ability. The Chinese Union Version translated this word &ldquo;may&rdquo;; our Recovery Version renders it &ldquo;can.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">OUR MOUTH SPEAKING THE WORD OF GRACE</h2>
<p>We have already seen that God desires all men to come to the full knowledge of the truth (1 Tim. 2:4); this is God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire. A second desire of God&rsquo;s heart is that we would speak for Him. Everyone must speak. Everyone &ldquo;may&rdquo; and everyone &ldquo;can&rdquo;; that is, everyone has the right and the ability. We cannot say that we do not have the ability. God created us with vocal cords and a tongue, and with two lips and a mouth full of teeth. These are not only for our eating but also for our speaking. But we fail God according to His creation because we continually speak senselessly, criticizing, lying, and spreading rumors.</p>
<p>In America I incurred the displeasure of the sisters by saying to them, &ldquo;Sisters, you have a particular characteristic: when you are on the telephone, you seem to be glued to the phone, and you are not able to put it down.&rdquo; In this way we have wasted our time in gossiping. We must thank the Lord that He created man with a mouth, and that, in creating man, He did it in a very fine and complex way in order that man can speak. That the mouth can speak and produce sounds is truly a miracle. Furthermore, the male speaks in a strong voice and the female speaks in a beautiful voice. But God did not create the mouth for us to speak idle words. The Bible says that &ldquo;every idle word which men shall speak, they shall render account concerning it in the day of judgment&rdquo; (Matt. 12:36). I would like to warn the sisters that their words on the telephone are all recorded, and one day God will play them back for them to listen to. This is not a joke; therefore, we must be warned.</p>
<p>Our mouths must speak the words of grace as the Lord Jesus did. Out of His mouth came forth the words of grace (Luke 4:22). Ephesians 4:29 tells us, &ldquo;Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good...that it may give grace to those who hear.&rdquo; Grace may flow out of our mouth; this is the word of God. Brothers and sisters, let us use the time we waste in telephone conversations to call someone we know and preach the gospel to him. We must also visit our relatives to speak the word of the Lord, to speak the truth, and to speak the gospel to them. Not only in the meetings, but also in our daily life, we must speak everywhere and at every time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF THE BELIEVERS&mdash;<br />
DOING THIS VOLUNTARILY AND RECEIVING A REWARD</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy 4:2 Paul said, &ldquo;Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season.&rdquo; Moses in the Old Testament said, &ldquo;Would God that all the Lord&rsquo;s people were prophets.&rdquo; Paul in the New Testament also said, &ldquo;You can all prophesy one by one.&rdquo; Again Paul said, &ldquo;Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel...if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward&rdquo; (1 Cor. 9:16b-17a). You may say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you quoted the Scripture improperly; in 1 Corinthians 9:16-17 Paul was talking about preaching the gospel, not about speaking God&rsquo;s word.&rdquo; Actually to preach the gospel is to speak God&rsquo;s word. Paul did not say that if he did not preach the gospel, he would have woe, or he was about to have woe; rather, he said that woe was already &ldquo;to&rdquo; him.</p>
<p>Please consider your own experience. After you were saved, time after time when you came to the meeting, were there not many times when you felt that you should speak, but after some consideration you eventually did not speak? Every time that you felt to speak but did not speak, did you not feel miserable after the meeting? I myself have had this experience; often when I was moved to speak but did not speak, after I went home I suffered for three days and three nights, and I was very disappointed. But if I spoke immediately when I was moved to speak, I felt comfortable after speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Desire Being That We Speak</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire is that we speak, and the most pleasing thing to God is our speaking. Parents love to hear their children speak, and whenever the children speak, the sound of their speaking is pleasant, even if they do not speak well. Similarly, in the meetings whenever the newly saved ones speak, the sound of their speaking is very pleasant. Even if they do not speak well, they still sound pleasant.</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, try to be silent from morning till evening. If you do, you will commit a gradual suicide. Speaking is so healthful! I am not a physician or a nutritionist; I say this completely from human experience. Sixty percent of my health comes from speaking for the Lord. When I do not speak for the Lord, I cannot sleep well; I become deflated and have no joy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking with the Lord<br />
and Speaking for the Lord<br />
When You Are Angry</h2>
<p>We all know that none of us is without anger, for we are all human. Human beings are not wood and stone. Then, how can we not be angry? If an angry person is not able to release his angry words, he will burst. My doctor told me that every time a person speaks in anger, he destroys more of his blood cells than when he has a cold. However, when a person is angry but does not speak, he may not destroy many blood cells; but if he keeps silent a number of times and then gets ulcers in his stomach, what shall he do?</p>
<p>We, the saved ones, have a most excellent way, that is, to speak with the Lord and to speak for the Lord. You may say, &ldquo;Speak for the Lord? My husband makes me angry, the children are gone to school, and no one is at home. Then to whom should I speak?&rdquo; It is wrong for you to say this, because you have many objects to speak to. The cats and dogs are your objects; the birds are also your objects; and the grass and the flowers are also your objects. First, you must speak to the Lord. Then you must speak to the cat, to the dog, to the birds, and to the flowers: &ldquo;Little flowers and little grass, I really love you. I can be angry, but you cannot. But you must know that you do not have the Lord&rsquo;s life. I have the Lord&rsquo;s life. Hallelujah!&rdquo; Speak to them. I am not joking.</p>
<p>What shall we Christians do when we are angry? Shall we be angry at our wives? Shall we lose our temper at our children? No. The best channel through which to let out our anger is our Lord. He will never be angry at you and will never blame you. You may say, &ldquo;O Lord! Look, I am angry again. O Lord, You see that the wife You gave me is so unreasonable; she forces me to be angry.&rdquo; I am not joking; every time you speak this way to the Lord, your anger will be gone.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking to Be Healthy</h2>
<p>We must see a principle, a fundamental, a law: you must speak if you want to be healthy. You will be the most healthy person if you speak unceasingly each day. But you must speak the word of the Lord. When you speak the Lord&rsquo;s word, you have joy. People may oppose you, but everyone has a conscience within him; there is an element of fairness in the human heart. A brother who once worked in the telegraph company spoke Jesus whenever he met his colleagues; that is, he spoke for God. Then the others looked down at him, saying in a derogatory way that he was Jesus. But when they had difficulties or when they needed someone to take care of certain important documents for them, they all came to him. Whenever these colleagues faced difficulties, the gospel they had heard operated in them.</p>
<p>Therefore, you must know that the most healthy way is to speak for God. Speaking not only makes your heart happy, but it also is beneficial to your body. This is because human physical health needs deep breathing. When your mouth is closed, you do not breathe deeply, but when your mouth is open, even though you may not intend to do so, you will still breathe deeply. This morning I spoke for more than an hour in the first session, and now I am speaking again for another hour. Even though I did not try to breathe deeply, I have breathed deeply already. If I am tired, I will have a nap this afternoon. Then, tonight after dinner I will come to speak again, and when I am exhausted by speaking, I will go home quickly to sleep again. In living this way surely I will sleep well and be healthy. You sisters who shut your mouth and do not speak, let me advise you that this will damage your health. But you must not gossip or talk idly; rather, you must speak the Lord&rsquo;s word anytime and everywhere. When you speak the Lord&rsquo;s word, the more you speak, the happier you will be; the more you speak, the healthier you will be.</p><h2 class="head1">ALL SPEAKING THE WORD OF THE LORD<br />
AT ALL TIMES</h2>
<p>In Taipei we have more than four thousand brothers and sisters in the meetings. This number may not be large compared to the total population, but if over four thousand brothers and sisters all speak the word of the Lord in every place, this will be a tremendous matter. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth&rdquo; (Acts 1:8). We are the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses; therefore, we are those who speak. The members of our family, our relatives, our friends, and our neighbors are our Jerusalem. We must speak every day, even if our audience is weary of hearing it. Perhaps one day if some calamity befalls them, they will remember what we have said to them. If the four thousand brothers and sisters in Taipei speak every day and everywhere, after ten years would they not have saturated Taipei with their speaking?</p>
<p>However, if we only have a big meeting where one person speaks and the rest listen, when you bring your relatives or friends to such a meeting, they will say, &ldquo;What is the difference? When we go to other places, they also do the same thing, and the pastor speaks even better than you do. He is eloquent, his voice is clear and loud, and his knowledge is not inferior to yours&mdash;he is better than you.&rdquo; If we meet in this way, it is not easy to subdue them. But if they come to our meeting and everyone speaks&mdash;the young ones speak, the older ones speak, the brothers speak, and the sisters also speak&mdash;then they will be amazed and will surely be moved.</p>
<p>When I came back to Taiwan this time, a brother told me that a certain one was invited to a small group gathering, and when he saw everyone speaking there, he was very surprised and said, &ldquo;You are really wonderful!&rdquo; Therefore, when we gather together, we all must be able to speak. We must be able not only to speak, but also to speak with truth, with weight, not with nonsense, and to speak golden and precious things in every word. This, of course, will astonish people and move them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING TO GO ON IN THE WORD<br />
OF THE LORD AND TO PRAY</h2>
<p>Therefore, we must exercise to do two things. First, we must exercise to go on in the word of the Lord. Many of you have a college education, and your vocabulary and expression are with a collegiate style. This has not been acquired in two or three days. It has required at least four years, or eight semesters, of a college environment under the influence of the proper textbooks, instruction, and teachers. After four years you then have the collegiate style and character. You have not only the style but also the deposit within you. If during the present changing of the system every one of us is faithful and everyone endeavors, if everyone labors in the Word and prays conscientiously, I believe that after three or four years all the brothers and sisters among us will have the bearing of a spiritual collegiate. At that time, you will not only be willing and able to speak, but you also will have things to speak about. You will have something real, and you will not merely say, &ldquo;It is so good to believe in the Lord Jesus. If you believe in Him, you will have peace and joy. I used to provoke my wife to anger, but now I do not throw chopsticks anymore.&rdquo; Because most people today are somewhat philosophical in their thinking, they do not like to listen to such things. You must preach to them the truths in the Bible as the gospel.</p>
<p>Last year when I was in Texas, two or three hundred Chinese, many of them having Ph.D. degrees, were invited to the meeting. I preached the gospel to them, speaking to them a message entitled &ldquo;The Triune God Dispensing Himself into the Tripartite Man.&rdquo; They listened with interest and were fascinated while I spoke to them. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we have dug out the fundamental truths and even the deep and mysterious things in the Bible, and we have also put them into print. My only fear is that the brothers and sisters may not have the heart for these things, and even if they do have the heart, there is no way if they do not labor. I hope that among the hundred of you in this meeting, at least sixty, including the older ones, are digging into the study of the Bible. Do not say that you are already sixty years old; a sixty-year-old is still very young. If you learn a little more, you will still have twenty useful years for the Lord. In summary, we all must labor on the Word of the Lord.</p>
<p>We cannot take the old way of Christianity. The old way of Christianity is to put the responsibility of speaking for the Lord completely on the pastors. Many Christians think that the pastors are the ones who have studied and that speaking is their job. Thus they spend money to hire a pastor to give them a sermon on Sunday. This is completely wrong. We must tear this down and stir up every one of our brothers and sisters. Each one loves the Lord, each one loves the Word of the Lord, and each one is willing to labor in order to study the Word. In your study you may read a book of the Bible such as the Gospel of Matthew, or you may read about a topic such as justification by faith.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT ONLY KNOWING THE TRUTH,<br />
BUT ALSO BEING ABLE TO TEACH THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>Today the important biblical truths have been made clear in our publications, but what I fear is that we all may say that we have already heard these things. For instance, we have a set of books called <em>Sixty Topics of Important Truths in the Bible.</em> I spoke the contents of these books in Taipei for the first time thirty-six years ago. At that time many were helped, and I believe that many of you have read these books. But I am afraid that you read them as you would read a newspaper. You may know some of the truths in these books, but you have not gone deeply into them.</p>
<p>The fact that you have read much does not mean that you are thoroughly clear. You are not thoroughly clear until you have spoken a certain matter at least once. Only when you are able to teach them have the contents of a book entered into you. Therefore, I hope that every one of you brothers and sisters would not only know the truth but also be able to teach the truth. To speak the truth you must speak it convincingly, reasonably, attractively, and movingly. All these printed materials are present among us, volume after volume. Not to speak of other books, but just in the Life-studies alone there are over twelve hundred messages comprising more than twelve thousand pages. These messages are all available. In these messages the meanings of all the basic and important truths are made very clear.</p>
<p>At present I have two heavy burdens within me. One of them is to change the system and to not merely have large meetings as before. Eighty to ninety percent of this change of the system is to adopt the modern educational system. The modern educational system consists of six years of elementary school, three years of junior high school, three years of high school, four years of college, and two years of graduate school. This system has resulted from the practices of many nations through six thousand years of human history. Therefore, virtually every nation on earth uses this educational system. This is certain, and this is an established principle.</p>
<p>At the present time we have brought many to salvation, but how will we educate them after they are saved? How will we train them and build them up? This has become a big problem. I received telephone calls and letters from you saying that a few weeks ago you had a gospel week here in Taipei. Everyone went out to preach the gospel, and 1,104 persons were baptized. This is good, but what will you do after they are baptized? Merely to bring them together to meet after their baptism surely will not be adequate. Therefore, we must take the opportunity to educate them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREPARING TEACHING MATERIALS<br />
FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS</h2>
<p>I feel that we have the materials, but we still need to prepare lessons for teaching, and we still need to write textbooks. There are many riches in the Life-studies, but they are not yet teaching materials. You have been through school, and I believe that some of you have been teachers. Concerning a subject such as mathematics, for example, material may be available, but there is still a need for someone to write textbooks delineating all the important points and methods. Someone must decide what material to cover in the six years of elementary school and what to cover in junior high. Then more material must be added in high school, and still more must be added in college. Additional topics in the field of mathematics must be added continually. Likewise, there is no lack of material among us, but we must still write textbooks, yet we must not write them in a general way.</p>
 <p>In the past we were like a family in which all the members ate from one large pot. Those among us who had been saved for fifty-eight years and those who had been saved for only eighteen days all ate from the same pot. We even boasted about this, but after eating in this way, the old ones departed and the young ones did not grow. Before many of you were born our number was greater than it is today. We cannot do this kind of work any longer. No matter what, we must change the system, because we can no longer make progress under the present system. Therefore, this is a heavy burden upon me.</p>
<p>I do not have sufficient time to accomplish the task of preparing lessons for teaching; therefore, I must produce many brothers and sisters to do it. We have all the materials, but we still need to put out instructional materials, that is, to put out textbooks. The Life-studies and the other publications are library books; we may use them as references, and the students may also read them. We must do it this way for the long run.</p>
<p>According to my observation, preaching the gospel is not a problem. At present the problem is how to nurture those who are saved through the preaching of the gospel. We must not only nurture them but also educate them. But how should we educate them? This has become a big problem at present, and this is where we failed in the past. I hope that you all realize that from now on there are no so-called co-workers and elders among us as a separate class of believers. Our hope is that everyone will be a prophet, everyone will be an apostle, everyone will be a gospel preacher, everyone will be a teacher, and everyone will be a shepherd. Everyone must speak. From now on we must have the organic function of all the members.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, to carry out the spiritual education on different levels is very difficult, because in Taipei there are the church as a whole, the different meeting halls, and the small groups. How, then should we divide into levels? We cannot rigidly follow the secular educational system, beginning from elementary school and dividing clearly into elementary, junior high, high school, and college. To establish a school, one must first build the school with classrooms and offices. Then there is a need for workers and teachers, and also for students and textbooks. Having all these elements, a school can flourish and be successful. In my observation, having enough &ldquo;students&rdquo; is not a problem to us, but where and how to educate them constitutes a big problem.</p>
<p>I am a student of the Bible. I have thought about these things all day and have searched through all the Scriptures, but I have not found any hints. In the Bible, there are only a few places which speak of the meetings and of how the saints met in the New Testament. It is right to say that they met in small groups from house to house (Acts 2:46; 5:42), but the spiritual revelation did not continue from that point. How were the three thousand or the five thousand people who were saved in Acts educated? I could not find the answer.</p>
<p>We are all members of a family, and we must face this real situation. This is indeed a great need. In this one year I believe that in the gospel work of the church in Taipei, at least two or three thousand were baptized, but where should we put these two or three thousand? How should we arrange them, and how should we educate them? This has become a great problem. We must enlarge our view.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LABORING ON THE WORD OF THE LORD<br />
AND LEARNING TO SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>In summary, the training is laying the ground work in these few days. First, whether you were saved long ago or are newly saved, you brothers and sisters must labor on the word of the Lord. In this modern age we all must learn English, for without learning English it is very difficult to do anything. In the same way, we all must learn the word of the Lord, for without learning the word of the Lord the church has no way to go on. Second, regardless of how we divide into levels or what lessons are used for instruction, we all must learn to speak the word of the Lord. The basic thing is that everyone must seek after the Word of the Lord and learn to speak the word of the Lord. If you continue to practice, in the future you will be useful to the Lord. This will not require a long time. Perhaps after a year, everyone will be occupied in speaking the Lord&rsquo;s word. Then, when someone is saved, you will be able to speak to him. This is a heavy burden within me.</p>
<p>Today we all must hurry to catch up. We have labored for many years, yet we still do not have this foundation. Hence, it is as if we are beginning from nothing. We must realize this situation and pour out all our effort; then the Lord will have a way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
AND SPEAKING THE WORD OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 6:4; 4:31; 8:4; 2 Tim. 4:2</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman" start="2">
<li>Prayer and speaking the word of God&mdash;Acts 6:4.</li>
<li>Being filled with the Holy Spirit and speaking the word of God&mdash;Acts 4:31.</li>
<li>Speaking the word of God everywhere&mdash;Acts 8:4.</li>
<li>Speaking the word of God at all times&mdash;2 Tim. 4:2.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is easy to say that everyone must speak the word of God, but it is not easy to do this. Therefore, in this training we have three lines: (1) The Full Knowledge of the Word of God, (2) Everyone Speaking the Word of God, and (3) Meeting to Speak the Word of God. To understand the Word of God you must first have some deposit within you. Today you may only understand the Word of God a little, but tomorrow you will understand a little more. One year later, and then two years later, you will understand still more. After a long time of study to understand the Word of God, you will have some deposit within you. It is like going to school. You cannot begin school today and then graduate next week. You must first spend six years of study in order to have the elementary school education gradually deposited into you. Then you must study in junior high, high school, college, and graduate school. You must not only have the will to study from elementary school to graduate school, but you must also spend eighteen years in order to have an adequate deposit within you. Then, because you already have something deposited within you, you will be able to meet the situation.</p>
<p>It is the same with the Word of the Lord. If we read it often, even daily, and also pray-read it often, month after month and year after year, we will have an accumulation of the Word within us. I hope that when you speak God&rsquo;s word to others, you will not just tell them that the Word of God is very good, and that the word in your church is the richest of all. I hope that you will not merely tell people that previously you were not able to speak, but now you are able; that formerly you were dumb, but now you open your mouth; that previously you had no boldness, but now you have boldness; or that previously you had no eloquence, but now you have eloquence. You may speak like this for a long time, yet you are still only &ldquo;introducing the ball&rdquo;; you have not yet &ldquo;played the ball.&rdquo; People might listen to you the first time, but the second time they will not be happy to listen. You must have the ball in your hand, and you must also know how to play the ball. Furthermore, you must play the ball in the way of an exhibition that others can see.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A SOLID EDUCATION<br />
AND A CLEAR PRESENTATION OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>Therefore, this training would first encourage and guide you to understand the Word of God, to be educated daily in the Word of God, and to be saturated daily with the Word of God. Formerly you had only the Life-study Messages; we had not made them into textbooks. Therefore, the education you received was not that solid. Just as in learning mathematics, it is not adequate merely to listen to lectures; you must have a textbook in order to receive a solid education. The truth among us is indeed rich, but it is just piled up in a heap. We have seriously considered this situation, and we have decided to use the materials in our publications to put out textbooks, level by level.</p>
<p>This training is to encourage you to learn the word of God in the Bible systematically and solidly. Thus, it will be easy for you to speak for the Lord, and you will have something to give to others. Moreover, when you speak to someone you must know what type of person he is, on what level he is, and what kind of word he needs. Then you should speak that kind of word to him. Applying the words of a Chinese proverb, do not be afraid that he will not appreciate the value of your &ldquo;merchandise,&rdquo; but be confident that by comparing your &ldquo;goods&rdquo; with others&rsquo;, he will realize which is better. You only need to bring out the good things, to present to him a few big &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo; from the Word of God. Once he sees them, he will be attracted. This is the way to preach the gospel, and this is also the way to speak to the brothers and sisters in the denominations. Do not merely say that our church is very good, that our way is right, that here we have light, life, and truth, and that they must come quickly to meet with us. The more you speak this way, the more people will not be convinced. You must bring out and show them something precious from the Word of God.</p>
<p>About six months ago in Austin, Texas, a college girl, who was a fervent Christian meeting with a denomination, heard some erroneous rumors concerning us. One day a saint among us read to her a portion of a Life-study Message from Genesis. Upon hearing this portion, she felt that it was precious, and she asked for a copy of the message. After she finished reading one message, she read another and was greatly attracted. As a result of this, she came to a meeting. Not long ago I received a letter from her thanking me.</p>
<p>If you have something precious that you want people to buy, you must bring it out and show them. When you have a clear knowledge of the truths and have stored them within you, at the proper time you can present them. Sometimes you may not know how to present them; at those times you may bring with you the Recovery Version and also one or two Life-studies. You may simply turn to a footnote and read it to someone. For instance, in 2 Corinthians 13 there is a long footnote on the Triune God (note 14<sup>1</sup>). If your father is a Christian and does not yet agree to your taking the way of the recovery, do not argue with him. Find an opportunity to speak to him. You may say, &ldquo;Dad, I have here a paragraph that speaks about the benediction given at the end of each of your meetings. Let me read it to you.&rdquo; I believe that he will be attracted before you finish reading one third of it. Because of this note, your father will be attracted. We, the salesmen, must be trained. Do not say that others&rsquo; merchandise is poor. What businessmen avoid the most is saying that the merchandise of others is poor. The more you depreciate the merchandise of others, the more people will not buy yours. You need to present your treasure to people.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYER AND SPEAKING THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>Now you have the treasure&mdash;the Word of God. To know God&rsquo;s word as the Spirit, you must have sufficient prayer. In Acts 6:4 the twelve Apostles said, &ldquo;But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.&rdquo; Without prayer, your speaking of the word of God will not be effective. You may have the word of God, but you need to be a man of prayer. I am not advising you to fast, to pray without eating or sleeping for three days and three nights. Rather, I mean that you must be a person who prays regularly. One who prays regularly is one who has fellowship with the Lord.</p>
<p>Whenever you feel that you have sins, you must deal with them properly. Whenever you feel that you have touched the world and have been defiled by the world, you must be cleansed in a good way. Whenever you feel that the Lord has a demand upon you and you have not responded adequately, you must also deal with it. You must always be a person who has fellowship with the Lord. Even when you speak to others, you must speak in the spirit of prayer. Whether you are speaking to your father or to your mother&mdash;no matter to whom you are speaking&mdash;you must have a spirit of prayer, and you must be a person of prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT<br />
AND SPEAKING THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>You must also experience being filled with the Spirit. This truth has been very much confused in Christianity. However, among us in these recent years, this biblical truth has been made very clear.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking with the Simplest Words<br />
the Seven Great Matters<br />
Accomplished by the Lord Jesus</h2>
<p>From the incarnation to the ascension and the pouring out of the Holy Spirit, the Lord Jesus accomplished seven great matters. First, He became flesh, bringing God into man (John 1:1, 14). Second, He passed through human living, living the life of a man on this earth (Phil. 2:8). This is a tremendous matter. For thirty-three and a half years He lived out God in human living. Third, with seven statuses He accomplished an all-inclusive death on the cross, dealing with sin (John 1:29), sins (1 Pet. 2:24), Satan (Heb. 2:14), the world (John 12:31), the old creation (Col. 1:15; Heb. 2:9), the old man (Rom. 6:6), and the flesh (Rom. 8:3) on the cross, and also annulling the ordinances and rituals of the law and the differences among human societies (Eph. 2:14-15). Finally, through His death He released the divine life (John 12:24). Fourth, He resurrected from the dead, bringing all of us into resurrection (Eph. 2:5-6), that is, bringing man into God. Moreover, in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Fifth, on the day of resurrection He returned to the disciples and breathed the Spirit of resurrection into them to be their life and essence (John 20:22). Sixth, after forty days He ascended to the height (Acts 1:9; Eph. 4:8) and was made Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36). He was given to be Head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:22), He was enthroned (Heb. 12:2) and crowned (Heb. 2:9), and He became the King of kings and Lord of lords (Rev. 19:16). Seventh, as the Spirit of Pentecost, who is also the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, He was poured out upon the disciples, that is, upon His Body (Acts 2:1-4). These seven great matters are the complete gospel in the New Testament. Once a person believes into the Lord Jesus, he immediately enters into Him and is united with Him, and immediately these seven things which He accomplished become his.</p>
<p>I hope that the young people will learn to use the most simple words to speak these seven great matters which the Lord Jesus has accomplished. Speak about Christ&rsquo;s becoming flesh, about His being conceived of the Holy Spirit and mingled with humanity in a virgin&rsquo;s womb to be brought forth as the One who is both God and man, the God-man. He is the complete God and also a perfect man. He has the element of God and the element of man. In this way He brought the God who was outside of man into man, and God and man became one.</p>
<p>Then, He lived a human life on this earth, a life which was God living in man. Indeed He became a man, but it took thirty years for Him to completely live out the fashion of a man (Phil. 2:8). It was easy for Him to become flesh, taking only nine months to accomplish this. But for Him to be acknowledged as a real man, He needed thirty years. It may seem to us that in those thirty years He did nothing and accomplished nothing. Little do we know that He accomplished a great matter. In thirty years&rsquo; time He lived out the fashion of a man. This is not a simple matter. Every day He was in a poor carpenter&rsquo;s home living a human life. He was God being a man, completely working out the fashion of a man. This is a tremendous matter. It is a pity that the translators of the Chinese Union Version did not make this clear in their translation. It should have been made clear that in the thirty years of the Lord&rsquo;s human living He was found in fashion as a man by men, living out the fashion of a man before men. Certainly He was God in the flesh, but was He able to be found in fashion as a man in His living? Yes, He was able. He spent thirty years&rsquo; time to be found in fashion as a man. After thirty years neither His mother, nor the husband of His mother, nor His brothers and sisters could deny that He was a man.</p>
<p>After this He went to the cross, and with seven statuses He accomplished the all-inclusive death. He solved the problems of sin, sins, Satan, the world, the old creation, the old man, the flesh, all the ordinances of the law, and all the differences in mankind between nations, between races, between societies, and between ranks in society. He solved all the different problems. Finally, He released the eternal life of God.</p>
<p>Think about it. If your parents or relatives are fervent Christians but are not for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and you were to go to them, presenting to them the all-inclusive death accomplished by Christ in His seven statuses, they surely would be attracted. You could show them a Life-study from the Gospel of Luke (Message Fifty-three) and give them a testimony. You must not only be able to speak about this matter, but you must also have the experience. You might pray, &ldquo;Lord, I thank You and praise You. Today all my sins are washed away by Your blood, the power of sin and death is ended, and the world is finished because it has already been judged. Satan is destroyed and has no authority over me.&rdquo; When your parents hear this, they will know that you have received such a great salvation. They will have to confess within themselves, &ldquo;After taking this path for five or six years, this child is surely different from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In America I spoke a little on this matter in a conference held in the Bay Area. After I finished, one after another of the young people stood up and testified, &ldquo;When I first took the way of the church, my parents opposed it very much. But after five years my parents saw the change in my living, and they became willing to know the reason for this change.&rdquo; At that meeting at least ten to twenty brothers and sisters gave their testimonies. Eventually, one by one, the parents in these homes all turned this way. This is the reason that in the past years when the recovery was vigorously opposed in the United States, instead of being shaken, it became brighter. The reason for this is that we have published many books and have made them available to the public. Furthermore, there are at least six or seven thousand living witnesses.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Learning the Truth Thoroughly and<br />
Seeking the Presence of the Economical Spirit</h2>
<p>I hope that you all will learn the truth. Learn the truths thoroughly and experience them. Then, first influence your family and be a living witness before them. In the United States there are many sisters who have taken the way of the recovery and have been opposed by their husbands. Eventually, because of the truth among us, those husbands have had a turn. The United States is a top nation, and a top Christian nation as well. The educational level is high, and nearly everyone has a general knowledge of Christianity. Many in the denominations are very zealous. Gradually, a number of them have seen their own wives, their own children, or their own husbands take the way of the recovery, and through them they have been able to read our books. Hearing their relatives speak and seeing the testimony in their living, they have been turned. There are many cases like this.</p>
<p>To gain people in the United States is not as easy as it is in Taiwan. Here in your going out to preach, thus far you have gained more than eleven hundred new converts. But more than half of the two hundred million Americans already profess to be Christians. The Catholic Church alone has approximately fifty million members, about one fourth of the total population. Besides the Christians there are also the Moslems and the Jews. Therefore, it is not easy to preach the gospel in the United States. But we still have advanced because the recovery of the Lord is a recovery of life and truth, and no one can stop this. I hope that you will use all your effort to learn the truth. To learn the truth is not a matter of learning a few words; you must learn it thoroughly. Moreover, when you are going to speak the word of God, you need to pray. At the same time you must have the faith, asking the Spirit of the Lord&mdash;not the essential Spirit but the economical Spirit, the poured out Spirit&mdash;to be with you, just as in Acts 4:31, &ldquo;And as they were beseeching, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING THE WORD OF GOD<br />
EVERYWHERE AND AT ALL TIMES</h2>
<p>Having the foregoing points, what follows is easy: speaking everywhere and speaking all the time. The several thousand from Jerusalem who were scattered abroad through persecution preached the word of God everywhere (Acts 8:1-4). Paul told Timothy to preach and to speak in season and out of season. When you read 2 Timothy 4:2, you must remember that these words follow the words spoken at the end of chapter three, &ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed,&rdquo; and that Timothy had known the sacred writings from a babe (vv. 15-16). It was after these words that Paul told Timothy to preach the Bible which he had known from a babe, and to preach what he had gained from the Bible. Furthermore, he needed to preach everywhere, to preach at all times, and to preach to everyone.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
AND SPEAKING THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>In the previous message I indicated first that in order to speak for God, prayer is indispensable. Second, I said that to speak for God also requires the filling of the Holy Spirit, which is the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. We have already mentioned that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, or the filling of the Holy Spirit, is a matter accomplished by the Lord. It is the last of the seven great accomplishments of the Lord. We have believed in the Lord, and we all have faith; therefore, we need to enjoy these seven great accomplishments of the Lord.</p>
<p>I have been speaking for the Lord for more than fifty-three years. I cannot say that every time I speak for the Lord I am filled with the Holy Spirit or have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, but I can tell you that many times I knew that indeed I had the filling of the Holy Spirit; this was undeniable. We do not pay much attention to outward miracles; however, in the past when I spoke for the Lord, such things as miracles and wonders did occur. Nevertheless, we do not like to emphasize these things.</p>
<p>We all should realize that the Lord in whom we believe is the Lord who accomplished these seven great items: as God He was incarnated; He passed through human living; His all-inclusive death solved all our problems; He was resurrected, and He caused us to be resurrected together with Him in order that we might be regenerated; then He became the life-giving Spirit and breathed Himself into us; He ascended to the height and was made both Lord and Christ; and as the outpoured Spirit, who is also the Spirit of power, the economical Spirit, He poured Himself upon us, the church.</p>
<p>Today, the One in whom we believe is such a Lord. Let us enjoy all that He has accomplished. When you exercise to speak the word of God to others, you must believe that you have the Spirit within you and that you also have the Spirit upon you. You have the Spirit of life, the essential Spirit, within you and the Spirit of power, the economical Spirit, upon you.</p><h2 class="head1">SPEAKING TEN MAJOR CATEGORIES<br />
OF THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>Praise the Lord! We pray, and we believe that we have the Spirit of power upon us. We also speak the word of God to others at all times and in every place. Then, what kind of word should we speak? There are ten major categories of the word of God: the word of grace, the word of truth, the word of the gospel, the word of life, the healthy word, the edifying word, the good word, the word of righteousness, the word of knowledge, and the word of wisdom. First, the word of grace and the word of truth are a pair. Second, the word of the gospel and the word of life are another pair. Third, the healthy word and the edifying word are also a pair. The good word and the word of righteousness are the fourth pair, and the word of knowledge and the word of wisdom are the final pair. Altogether these constitute ten categories of the word of God.</p>
<p>To speak the word of God to people is to speak these ten major categories of the word. This does not mean that besides these there are no other categories of God&rsquo;s word; rather, it means that on the whole, these are what people need the most today. Both believers and unbelievers need the grace of God and the truth of God; they also need the gospel and life. They need the healthy word and the edifying word; furthermore, they need the good word, the word of righteousness, the word of knowledge, and the word of wisdom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Word of Grace and the Word of Truth</h2>
<p>Let me give you a simple explanation. The Lord Jesus is the Word of God. John 1:1 and 14 say, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; Read footnotes 14<sup>5</sup> and 17<sup>1</sup> on John 1:14 and 17 in the Recovery Version. Those footnotes explain clearly that grace is God coming to be enjoyed by us. The Lord Jesus is God. When He became flesh, He brought God to man, and the God whom He brought is grace. When God is enjoyed by us, He is grace. At the same time, when this God is realized by us, He is reality, which is the proper meaning of the word &ldquo;truth.&rdquo; The word truth in Greek means reality. God is grace and God is reality. When God is enjoyed by us, He is grace, and when God is realized by us, He is reality.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Word of the Gospel and the Word of Life</h2>
<p>The third category is the word of the gospel. The gospel is the Lord Jesus Himself. Acts 5:42 clearly says, &ldquo;They did not cease...bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;bringing the good news&rdquo; is a form of the verb <em>euaggelizo</em>, which carries the connotation of preaching the gospel. Hence, the word in Acts 5:42 may be rendered &ldquo;preaching the gospel,&rdquo; indicating that the gospel is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. Romans 1:1, 3 speaks of &ldquo;the gospel... concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; Thus the gospel is the Son of God. Therefore, to speak the word of the gospel is to speak the Lord Jesus. The more we speak the Lord Jesus, the more we speak the word of the gospel.</p>
<p>It is a pity that very few Christians labor on the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus is a wonderful Person, and His name is called Wonderful (Isa. 9:6). He is God and He is man; He is the complete God and He is also a perfect man. Why do we say that He is the complete God? Because God is triune&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). Jesus is not only the Son, but He is also the Father (John 14:7-11; 10:30), and He is also the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). He is God who became flesh (John 1:1, 14). This God is not only God the Son, but He is also God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. He is the entire and the complete God.</p>
<p>God became flesh by entering into the womb of Mary. Therefore, in His conception there were both the divine element and the human element. He obtained the divine element through the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:18, 20) and the human element through Mary. Conception requires two elements; one element alone cannot cause conception. For conception to take place there must be two elements. The Lord Jesus has these two elements: one is divine, and the other, human. Therefore, the One who was born was a God-man. He was truly God and also truly man. You must believe and thoroughly understand these things. Then when you speak to people, you will surely impress them.</p>
<p>One of the major points of the gospel is life. John said, &ldquo;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld, and our hands handled concerning the Word of life&rdquo; (1 John 1:1). Here the Word of life denotes the Lord Jesus. When you read the context you will see that the Word of life is the Lord Jesus Himself. If you have not labored and have not learned, how can you speak? I am only giving you an outline here, but you must spend time regularly to dig out from the Bible the word of grace, and you must also spend time to dig out the word of truth. You must also dig out the word of the gospel, which is the word concerning the Lord Jesus, and also the word of life. Store all these kinds of words within you, and when you speak to people, use them according to the situation.</p><h2 class="head2">The Healthy and the Edifying Word</h2>
<p>Now we come to the healthy word. Some words are not healthy, but all healthy words contain life, and health pertains to life. No one would say that a house is healthy, for a house does not have life and therefore has nothing to do with health. If you desire to speak healthy words, you must have life. Healthy words surely are words with life. You must realize that in all the healthy food we eat there is the element of life. The things you eat must have an organic nature in order to make you healthy and supply you with life.</p>
<p>When Paul wrote 1 Timothy, the church had entered into a dangerous period. He knew that some had come out teaching differently; therefore, in chapter one he said to Timothy, &ldquo;I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently&rdquo; (v. 3). For the believers to receive the different teachings would be like their eating stones or lumps of coal; these things are not nutritious. Paul also said, &ldquo;Laying these things before the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus&rdquo; (4:6). To be a good minister, first you yourself must eat nutritious and healthy food, and second, you must supply others with what you have eaten. Sometimes we talk at length with people, and we even quote verses from the Bible, but these things may all be husks. We must give people healthy food. Sometimes we do not need to talk so much; simply to give people an &ldquo;egg&rdquo; or a &ldquo;glass of milk&rdquo; would be good enough.</p>
<p>In 1948 I went to Foochow to hold a conference. After the first meeting I was given a glass of Foochow orange juice. Although I was very tired from speaking, after drinking that glass of Foochow orange juice I was immediately refreshed. I told Brother Nee, &ldquo;Your Foochow orange juice is really wonderful.&rdquo; Therefore, when you go out to speak, you must exercise to give people &ldquo;a glass of Foochow orange juice.&rdquo; Do not give them a large piece of &ldquo;sweet potato&rdquo;; that may not be as nutritious. You must learn to experience the words of God; they are nutritious.</p>
<p>Some of you have heard me preach for thirty-six years. I have preached in Taiwan for thirty-six years, but not until recently did I mention to you the seventy weeks in Daniel chapter nine. Why did I not mention this before? Because there is not much nutrition in the seventy weeks. Therefore, even though I mentioned this recently, I was not very interested in it. When I was young I met with the Brethren. They taught this matter daily. While I was with them, for years I experienced very little spiritual growth because the things I &ldquo;ate&rdquo; were not healthy enough. If I were to speak to you for a year concerning the seventy weeks, you would all die spiritually because you would all be eating unhealthy food. Therefore, we must exercise to select from the Bible words rich in nutrition, healthy words. These healthy words are the words of the Lord Jesus (1 Tim. 6:3).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must speak words which edify people. Ephesians 4:29 says, &ldquo;Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for needful building up, that it may give grace to those who hear.&rdquo; Grace is God Himself. Words which contain God are good words, and they will build up people. You young people often like to pry into other people&rsquo;s business. This does not build up people, and this does not dispense God into people. Older people even the more like to inquire about others&rsquo; business. This is a trap and a snare. Here I am not only speaking the truth, but I am also speaking about our experience. We do not know how many times we have been entangled by Satan&rsquo;s snare. By being entangled in this way, we hurt others and we also hurt ourselves.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Good Word and the Word of Righteousness</h2>
<p>It is most difficult to speak about the good word and the word of righteousness. We might guess that the good word refers to some lovely or beautiful words spoken by the Lord Jesus; perhaps this is what is meant by the good word. This may be somewhat close, but it is still not adequate. The word of righteousness is the most difficult to understand. The book of Hebrews speaks of these two categories, the good word and the word of righteousness (6:5; 5:13). In this book Paul advised the Hebrew believers not to remain in the good word but to go forward to the word of righteousness. He likened the good word to milk and the word of righteousness to solid food.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Word of Knowledge and the Word of Wisdom</h2>
<p>You all can differentiate between the word of knowledge and the word of wisdom. These are the two kinds of words mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12:8. The deeper and higher word is the word of wisdom; the shallower and lower word is the word of knowledge. The words written by Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter one are somewhat general; thus they are the word of knowledge. They speak in a general way about the Lord Jesus&rsquo; dying for us, His accomplishing redemption for us, and His relationship with us. These are the words of general spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>However, in chapter two Paul said, &ldquo;But we speak wisdom... God&rsquo;s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which God predestined before the ages for our glory&rdquo; (vv. 6-7). This is deep. This wisdom is the deep and mysterious things of Christ, which are also the deep and mysterious things of God (v. 10). In chapter three Paul speaks on the deep and mysterious things. In verse 9 he said, &ldquo;You are God&rsquo;s farm, God&rsquo;s building.&rdquo; What grows on a farm are vegetables. How can vegetables become building materials? Paul also said, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow&rdquo; (v. 6). These words seem shallow and easy to understand, but their meaning is very deep. These are words of wisdom. However, to speak concerning the crucifixion of Jesus, concerning verses such as John 3:16, &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,&rdquo; and concerning the fact that we all are sinners&mdash;these are words of knowledge. But whenever life is mentioned, that is something deep and mysterious. In 1 Corinthians, from chapters three through ten what is spoken are words of wisdom; it is deep and mysterious. In 6:17 Paul said that we the believers have become one spirit with the Lord; this is very difficult to speak about, and this is not shallow or easy to understand. We need to labor properly upon words such as these.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<h2 class="head1">TWO CATEGORIES OF THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>In this message we will consider in more detail two categories of the word of God, the good word and the word of righteousness. These two categories of the word are recorded in the book of Hebrews. All those who read the Bible know that the book of Hebrews is very mysterious. It is almost as mysterious as the Gospel of Matthew, which is second only to Revelation. There are three books in the New Testament that are difficult to explain and to understand. The first is Revelation, the second, the Gospel of Matthew, and the third, Hebrews.</p>
<p>The book of Hebrews speaks of two categories of the word of God. One category is the good word (6:5), and the other is the word of righteousness (5:13). From these verses we can understand that the good word is very good and very kind, whereas the word of righteousness is very strict and very just. Therefore, the good word is by nature more shallow, whereas the word of righteousness is deeper; the good word is low, whereas the word of righteousness is high.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Good Word of God&mdash;for the Initial Stage<br />
of the Gospel of Salvation</h2>
<p>Hebrews 6:1 says, &ldquo;Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us be brought on to maturity.&rdquo; Earlier, in 5:12 it also says that whereas the Hebrew believers ought to have been teachers, they had need again for someone to teach them what are the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God, and had become those who had need of milk and not of solid food. These two verses show us that, on the one hand, the Hebrew believers needed to leave the word of the beginning of the Christ and be brought on to maturity; on the other hand, they were still babes who could only drink milk and were not able to eat solid food. The Hebrew believers were still at &ldquo;the word of the beginning of the Christ.&rdquo; This word of the beginning is the good word.</p>
<p>Therefore, Hebrews 6:4-5 speaks of those who are saved, who have become partakers of the Holy Spirit and have tasted the good word of God and the works of power of the coming age, and have tasted of the heavenly gift of grace. Grace is a gift given to us by God at the time we believed. This heavenly grace is the eternal life. At the time we were born of God, we also received the nature of God (2 Pet. 1:4). We also obtained the sonship (Gal. 4:5) and the law of life (Rom. 8:2). In us there is a function of life. Just as when a person is born, he has the human life, nature, and function as earthly gifts, as soon as we are reborn of God and are saved, we obtain the heavenly life, nature, and sonship, and also the heavenly life function and the law of life, as heavenly gifts. We all have tasted these things, and they have caused us to rejoice.</p>
<p>Not only so, we have the Holy Spirit within us. It is not that after we are saved and speak in tongues, we receive the Holy Spirit. Neither is it that when we advance and grow in life, we have the Holy Spirit. At the time that we were born again, at the time that we were saved, we received the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38; Rom. 8:9; Gal. 3:2). Furthermore, we have also tasted the word of the beginning of the Christ, that is, the good word, telling us that we should repent and believe so that we may be forgiven of our sins and receive cleansing, peace, and joy. This good word, which we heard as the gospel, includes many items. It says that we are fallen and sinful, but that God loves us, causing Him to send His Son, who became flesh for us, to be our Savior. He lived on earth for more than thirty years and finally went to the cross to die for us, solving the problem of our sins. Because His death was accepted by God, He was resurrected from the dead and became the means for us to believe, obtain forgiveness, and be justified. We heard these things when we first heard the gospel. This is the good word. Thank the Lord that we have tasted the good word of God.</p>
 <p>Not only so, we have tasted the works of power of the coming age. An accurate understanding of this phrase, based on the original text, would be to interpret it as the power to perform miracles in the coming age, that is, the power to cast out demons, to heal, and to do all kinds of miracles. Among us there are surely some who were healed of their sicknesses at the time they were saved. Over fifty years ago, when we preached the gospel, there were also cases of casting out demons. However, after we came to Taiwan, we were not as willing to touch such things.</p>
<p>In addition, there have also been cases of healing among us. Yet we have not placed much emphasis on miraculous healing but rather on the healing of life in God&rsquo;s grace. Remember that Hebrews chapter six clearly states that these works of power are not of this age but of the coming age.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the good word is the initial word of the gospel, which refers to the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus. He became flesh, passed through the human life on earth, was nailed to the cross, and died for us, accomplishing redemption. All these things were accomplished on the earth. Even the resurrection from the dead occurred on the earth; therefore, it is part of the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus. The Hebrew believers received what this ministry had accomplished. But later, the Judaizers crept in. They said that because the law was ordained by God in the Old Testament, because the offering of sacrifices was ordained by God, and that because the building of the temple was also blessed by God, all these things should not be given up. The Hebrew believers may have considered this and thought, &ldquo;That is right. How can we say that what our forefathers had was all wrong? Of course, we should believe in Christ. We also have tasted the good word of God. But we should not give up the old things. Let us go back to Judaism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this background, Paul wrote this Epistle in order to tell the Hebrew believers, &ldquo;The good word which you have tasted is only the beginning. As for the things of the Old Testament, they cannot even be called the beginning. They were only types and figures, without reality. The oxen and sheep were types, and even the temple was a type. Those types were perfected and fulfilled when the Lord Jesus came. They are now out of date. Let them go! If you go back to the things of Judaism after you have believed in the Lord and have tasted the good word of God, you are going backward. You have already entered elementary school and have graduated from it; why are you going back to kindergarten? You should leave elementary school and enter into junior and senior high school.&rdquo; This is the meaning of Paul&rsquo;s word. That is why Hebrews 6:1 says, &ldquo;Leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ....&rdquo;</p>
<p>We should leave the word of the beginning of the Christ and go on to the word of righteousness. What is the word of righteousness? We must remember that the good word is the gospel for our salvation, not for our maturity; therefore, it has nothing to do with our receiving a reward or suffering punishment. This is the &ldquo;elementary school,&rdquo; and it has nothing to do with whether we enter into the kingdom at the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. However, after we have been saved, we should not stop there; even the more we should not go backward by going back to Judaism. We should go forward and come to the word of righteousness.</p><h2 class="head2">The Word of Righteousness&mdash;<br />
for Our Maturing, Receiving the Reward,<br />
and Entering into the Kingdom</h2>
<p>The book of Hebrews conveys to us the word of righteousness. The word of righteousness tells us that this resurrected Christ has ascended to the heavens and is now serving as the Minister in the better tabernacle in the heavens. He is our great High Priest, the Mediator of the new covenant, carrying out His heavenly ministry and infusing us with the fullness of the heavenlies, with His ascension, resurrection, and life, making us heavenly persons on earth. This ministry will bring us to maturity. If we are willing to go on in this way, receiving the heavenly ministry of Christ, we will certainly reach maturity. When the Lord comes, He will give us the reward and we will enter into the kingdom. If we do not reach maturity, however, we need to realize that our God is a consuming fire and that we may be burned by His righteous judgment. This is the word of righteousness.</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, simply speaking, the good word is the series of accounts in the Gospels concerning the Lord Jesus&rsquo; ministry from His birth to His resurrection, which is for our salvation. We all have tasted this word. It does not require us to pay a price, to seek after the Lord, or to grow in life. The good word is freely given to us as a gift.</p>
<p>But after we are saved, we need to go on as 6:1 says: &ldquo;Leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us be brought on to maturity.&rdquo; How can we become mature? We need to listen to the word of righteousness. The resurrection of Christ was not the end but the beginning of His heavenly ministry. He ascended to the heavens to be the better Minister to serve us in the better tabernacle in the heavens, supplying us with His heavenly life. He is the great High Priest in the heavens who intercedes for us. He is also the Mediator of the new covenant, who is executing all the bequests and blessings of the new covenant into us, causing us to grow and mature. When He comes back, we will either receive the reward and enter into the kingdom, or we will suffer punishment (not eternal perdition). This kind of word is not the good word but the word of righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Whole Book of Hebrews<br />
Being the Word of Righteousness</h2>
<p>The whole book of Hebrews is the word of righteousness. Now I would like to speak to you concerning each chapter in a simple way according to my understanding.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Chapter One</h2>
<p>Chapter one speaks of this Jesus Christ, our Savior, as the One who was incarnated, passed through human living, died, and was resurrected, becoming our Redeemer and causing us to be saved. He is God the Creator on the earth. He is also the Son of God, the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory, and the express image of God&rsquo;s substance (v. 3). He was resurrected from among the dead, becoming the firstborn Son of God, and will return with the status of the firstborn Son (v. 6). Such a One, of course, is much higher than the angels, who are revered in Judaism. He is far superior to the angels (v. 4). The angels are only our servants (v. 14).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Chapter Two</h2>
<p>Chapter two also says that this One is the Son of God, but because He became incarnated, taking a human body of flesh and blood, He was temporarily made a little inferior to the angels (v. 7). While He lived on this earth, He passed through all kinds of trials and temptations (v. 10). Through His death He redeemed us from our sins and did away with the Devil, who had the power of death (v. 14). Then He was resurrected. In resurrection He produced many brothers to become His church (v. 12). Later, He ascended and was crowned with glory and honor (v. 9). Now He is sitting in the heavens. He will come again in glory, bringing all His brothers into glory (v. 10). Today He is such a High Priest, far superior to the angels. This chapter speaks of Him who is the God-man, the mysterious One.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Chapters Three and Four</h2>
<p>Chapter three speaks of Him as the Apostle sent by God, as typified by Moses and Joshua. Both Moses and Joshua were apostles sent by God, bringing God among men. But Moses cannot compare with Him. Moses was part of the house, but He is the One who built the house; therefore, He is superior to Moses (3:2-3). Although Joshua typified Him, Joshua did not bring man into the real rest (4:8-9). It is the real Joshua who brings us into the eternal rest. The name Joshua in the Hebrew language is Jesus in Greek. The real Joshua is our Lord Jesus. Therefore, in chapters three and four we can see that He is God&rsquo;s Apostle who comes from God and brings God to man (3:1). He is far superior to Moses and Joshua.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Chapters Four through Seven</h2>
<p>The last part of chapter four through chapter seven forms another section, which speaks of Christ as the High Priest typified by Aaron and by Melchisedec. Aaron&rsquo;s priesthood was according to the dead law of letters and ordinances (5:1-4; 7:18-19a). Furthermore, because he was one who would die, his order was too low. But Jesus Christ, the God-man, became a High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec, according to the power of an indestructible life, not according to the law of letters (7:15-17). He has no beginning and no ending (7:3); He lives forever and is always living to intercede for us (7:25). As such a High Priest, He is far superior to Aaron. He is the Apostle who brings God to us, and He is the High Priest who brings us to God.</p><h2 class="head3">Chapter Eight</h2>
<p>The first part of chapter eight says that this Apostle from God has enacted a new covenant for us. This covenant is more excellent than the old covenant. After shedding His blood for this covenant, He, in resurrection and ascension, has become the Executor of this covenant; therefore, He is the Mediator of the new covenant (v. 6). In this new covenant our sins are truly forgiven, and we have also received the divine life and the law of life (vv. 10-12). Therefore, this covenant is far superior to the old covenant established through Moses.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Chapters Nine and Ten</h2>
<p>In chapters nine and ten we see that Christ established the new covenant by offering up Himself as the better sacrifice and by shedding the better blood (9:12-23; 10:12). Furthermore, He offered Himself through the eternal Spirit (9:14). Therefore, what He offered was an eternal sacrifice, and what He accomplished was an eternal redemption (9:12). This redemption saves us from the outer court to the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>In the old covenant, the way of the Holy of Holies was not yet manifested; except for the priests, those under that covenant could only enter the outer court. But as soon as the better sacrifice was accomplished, the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies were opened to us. Today we are no longer in the outer court; we have entered into the Holy of Holies. The hymn which says, &ldquo;I have passed the riven veil&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #551), speaks of this matter. Today we are no longer in the outer court; we have passed through the second veil of the tabernacle. The first veil was the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle in the Old Testament, and the second veil covered the ark of testimony in the tabernacle. We have passed through two layers of veils. Now we are in the Holy of Holies, that is, we are living in the presence of God. Therefore, this sacrifice is the better sacrifice, and the blood which Christ shed is the better blood, which has eternal efficacy.</p>
<p>In chapter ten, the author of Hebrews encourages us to enter into the Holy of Holies, because a new and living way has been opened for us (vv. 19-22). We can therefore enter boldly into the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>In chapters one through ten we can see that Christ is more excellent than the angels. Furthermore, He is far superior to Joshua, and He is superior to Aaron. The new covenant which He enacted is also superior to the old covenant set up by Moses. The heavenly ministry He has today is also superior. He is the heavenly great High Priest and the Mediator of the new covenant. In all these aspects Christ is superior.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Chapter Eleven</h2>
<p>When he comes to chapter eleven, the author of Hebrews shows us a superior way. This superior way is to go on not by sight, but by faith; therefore, it is the way of faith. Faith is the substantiating of things hoped for and the conviction of things not seen (v. 1). We do not walk according to the way of Judaism, which is outward, by sight. We walk in the way of faith, not by our outward sight, but by faith.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Chapter Twelve</h2>
<p>Chapter twelve tells us that since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, we should take the way of faith as they did (v. 1). It also tells us that we now have come to Mount Zion. Today some Christians hope to go to heaven, but Paul tells us that we have come to Mount Zion, to the holy city, New Jerusalem. How wonderful! Hebrews 12:22-24 records eight items to which we have come. We have come to Mount Zion, to the New Jerusalem, to the church, to the angels, to Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant, to His blood, to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of those who were saved in the Old Testament. We have come, and we are together with them. Paul does not say that we will be together in the future but that we are all here now. Since we are here, we need to run the race. If we run well, we will receive the prize in the future.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Chapter Thirteen</h2>
<p>Following this, in chapter thirteen there is a conclusion. Since now we are in God&rsquo;s presence in the Holy of Holies and are also running the race which has been set before us, we need to go outside the camp (v. 13). We must come out of religion, go out of the camp of Judaism, and come to Jesus Christ, bearing His cross and suffering the shame which He suffered. All these are words of righteousness.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Christians rarely hear these words of righteousness. Instead, they generally quote some verses from the book of Hebrews, such as 13:8, which says, &ldquo;Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and forever.&rdquo; Their understanding of this verse is that Jesus performed miracles before, and He can perform miracles today. Yesterday He could heal; today He can also heal. Yesterday He could cast out demons; today He can also cast out demons. How superficial this is!</p><h2 class="head2">The Two &ldquo;Becomings&rdquo; of Christ</h2>
<p>I have spoken in the past concerning the two &ldquo;becomings&rdquo; of Christ. The first &ldquo;becoming&rdquo; is &ldquo;the Word became flesh&rdquo; (John 1:14), and the second &ldquo;becoming&rdquo; is &ldquo;the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:45). I declared these truths strongly and published them in print. Then some opposing ones said, &ldquo;Witness Lee has spoken wrongly. Jesus never changes. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and forever.&rdquo; They spoke this strongly. However, the Bible does not say that He is the same eternally, but that He is the same &ldquo;yesterday, and today, and forever.&rdquo; He rose from the dead and became the life-giving Spirit; that was &ldquo;yesterday.&rdquo; He also ascended, and that is &ldquo;today.&rdquo; When He comes in the future, that will be &ldquo;forever.&rdquo; Therefore, He is the same yesterday, today and forever. But when He, as the eternal God, became flesh, He did change. In eternity He was God, not having the flesh. Through nine months, from Christ&rsquo;s conception to His birth, God became a man. This God was a baby in a manger. Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;Unto us a child is born...his name shall be called...The mighty God, The everlasting Father.&rdquo; In eternity He was the mighty God; in the manger He was a child. How great this change was!</p>
<p>But that was not the only change He underwent. After thirty-three and a half years, He was nailed to the cross and suffered death, was buried, and was resurrected on the third day. He resurrected bodily from the dead and became the life-giving Spirit. This was another great change. Since resurrection is &ldquo;yesterday,&rdquo; ascension is &ldquo;today,&rdquo; and the future is &ldquo;forever,&rdquo; it is true that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. But He has undergone two great changes since eternity past&mdash;His incarnation and His resurrection&mdash;and both changes have been accomplished.</p>
<p>Today believers in general also pick up another verse from the book of Hebrews, that is, 7:25: &ldquo;He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, seeing He is always living to intercede for them.&rdquo; Their understanding is that Jesus as the High Priest intercedes for us and is able to save us to the uttermost in everything, healing those who are ill and keeping those who are experiencing great difficulties. They do not see that this High Priest desires to give us a heavenly salvation, that He is carrying out the heavenly ministry in the heavenly tabernacle to supply us with the heavenly life (8:2), and that this heavenly life is in the life-giving Spirit. He dispenses Himself as the life-giving Spirit into us from the heavens, causing us to receive the supply of life, enabling us to rejoice when we are ill and to praise Him when we are in trouble. What a wonderful salvation this is!</p>
<p>This is the word of righteousness. It speaks of the ministry of the Lord Jesus in His ascension as the life-giving Spirit, to transmit the all-inclusive supply into our spirit, just as electricity is transmitted into a building. The lights and electrical appliances in a building depend on the supply of the electrical current from the power plant. Today the Lord Jesus in the heavens is the &ldquo;power plant.&rdquo; We are the &ldquo;lamps,&rdquo; shining because of His supply.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Miracles but the Enjoyment of Grace</h2>
<p>We believers are weak persons, but in one respect we are different from others. Our sicknesses may not be healed, but we have sufficient grace. Paul&rsquo;s ministry was full of healing power. Whenever he prayed and laid hands on people, they were healed of their sicknesses (Acts 19:11-12). But in his body there was a sickness which was like a thorn pricking him. He prayed to the Lord three times to remove this thorn from him, but the Lord said, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:7-9). The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;If I were to take away this thorn from you, you would not need Me anymore, and you would not enjoy My grace. Therefore, I am leaving the thorn here to remind you to enjoy Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, Paul&rsquo;s spiritual son, Timothy, had a stomach illness. Paul did not pray to the Lord to heal him. On the contrary, he told Timothy, &ldquo;No longer drink water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent weaknesses&rdquo; (1 Tim. 5:23). If I were there, I surely would say, &ldquo;Paul, now you have become weak and have lost your faith. You see how full of faith and full of power you were in Acts. Why do you not send for Timothy and lay hands on him that he may be healed?&rdquo; Not only so, 2 Timothy 4:20 also records that Trophimus, one of Paul&rsquo;s co-workers, was sick. But neither did Paul lay his hands on Trophimus and pray for him. Paul himself had a thorn in his flesh, Timothy had a stomach illness, and Trophimus was sick. But none of them received a miraculous healing. Was it that Paul had fallen behind and lost the power he had at the beginning? Not at all. Paul, Timothy, and Trophimus experienced life much more through these sufferings. Therefore, in 1 Timothy 6:12 Paul spoke of laying hold on the eternal life.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we need to see that it is not miracles that make us mature in life. Those in the charismatic movement depend too much on miracles. This is altogether wrong. They do not see that God granted miracles to every apostle, whether it be Peter, John, or Paul, at the beginning of their ministry; but the more they advanced in age, the less those kinds of miracles were seen in their ministry. Eventually they all were martyred. When Peter was put into prison as a young man, an angel came to open the prison door and lead him out (Acts 12:5-11). But when he was in his old age, the angel did not come; instead, he was nailed to a cross. When John was old, he was exiled to the island of Patmos (Rev. 1:9). Paul was martyred. But even when Paul&rsquo;s head was about to be cut off, he was still rejoicing. This is actually the greatest miracle. This is life, and this is grace.</p>
<p>John 2:23-25 says that many in Jerusalem saw the miracles that Jesus did and believed in His name, but the Lord did not entrust Himself to them. John chapter six records that the Lord fed the five thousand with five loaves and two fishes. But after the Lord was resurrected, those five thousand disappeared. Eventually, only one hundred and twenty believers remained, gathering in a small room in Jerusalem. When the five thousand were fed, they came to look for the Lord again the next day. But the Lord did not perform a miracle. He said, &ldquo;Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides to eternal life...I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes in Me shall by no means ever thirst&rdquo; (vv. 27, 35). The Lord told them that He could be eaten. But they said, &ldquo;This is a hard word; who can hear it?&rdquo; (v. 60). From that time on, many of His disciples drew back and walked no longer with Him (v. 66). Because the Lord Jesus did not perform miracles, they drew back. But Peter said, &ldquo;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life&rdquo; (v. 68).</p>
<p>Today in our ministry, I prefer not to perform miracles, but rather to preach the words of eternal life, supplying men with eternal life. This is not the good word but the word of righteousness. Praise the Lord, the word of righteousness will decide whether we will share the glory with Him in His kingdom. If we receive this word, He will give us the reward, and we will receive the kingdom when He comes; but if we do not receive it, He will reject us, and we will suffer loss outside the kingdom. Therefore, this is the word of righteousness, not the good word.</p><h2 class="head2">Five Warnings in the Book of Hebrews</h2>
<p>Because the book of Hebrews speaks these words of righteousness in every section, it issues serious warnings according to these words. There are five warnings.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The First Warning</h2>
<p>The first two chapters tell us that Christ is the complete God and a perfect man, far superior to the angels, becoming our great salvation. Based on this word, the first warning, in 2:3, says, &ldquo;How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?&rdquo; According to the context of the whole book of Hebrews, &ldquo;how shall we escape&rdquo; does not refer to eternal perdition, but to the receiving of the righteous punishment at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (cf. 2 Cor. 5:10).</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Second Warning</h2>
<p>Chapters three and four speak of Christ as the Apostle sent by God, who is far superior to Moses and Joshua, in order to bring us into the rest of the coming kingdom. Based on this word, the second warning is issued in the section from 3:7 to 4:13, saying, &ldquo;Do not harden your hearts&rdquo; (3:8), so that you will not provoke God&rsquo;s wrath and be unable to enter into the rest of the coming kingdom. This righteous word does not mean that the saved persons can still perish forever and miss the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s eternal rest; rather, it means that if we neglect the righteous word of God and allow an evil heart of unbelief or the sins of a hardened heart to deceive us (3:11-12), when the Lord comes we will not enter into the millennial kingdom and enjoy the rest of reigning with Him in the kingdom. This is only a punishment during the coming age of the millennial kingdom, not the perdition that issues in the loss of rest for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Third Warning</h2>
<p>Chapters five through seven speak of Christ as our heavenly High Priest who is far superior to Aaron, supplying us with the heavenly life, saving us to the uttermost according to the power of this indestructible life, and bringing us into the riches of His heavenly ministry. Based on this word, the writer issues the third warning in the section from 5:11 to 6:20, encouraging us to leave the word of the beginning of the Christ (the gospel) and to be brought on to maturity; otherwise we will be near a curse and receive the punishment of burning (6:1, 8). This serious and righteous word does not mean that we who have been enlightened, have tasted the heavenly gift, have participated in the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word, may still perish and be burned by the consuming fire of the lake of fire. Rather, it means that if we neglect the Lord&rsquo;s grace after having been saved by grace, we will surely receive the Lord&rsquo;s punishment as a kind of fire to purify us during the period of righteous reward or punishment, the coming millennial kingdom. This is a dispensational punishment, not the eternal perdition of the lake of fire.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Fourth Warning</h2>
<p>Chapter eight through the first half of chapter ten speaks of how the Lord offered Himself as the eternal sacrifice, accomplished an eternal redemption, established the new covenant with His own blood, ascended to the heavens as the Mediator of this new covenant, and is now supplying us with all the blessings of the new covenant as the heavenly Minister in the heavenly tabernacle. Then in 10:19-39 the fourth warning is issued, which urges us to come forward into the Holy of Holies where Christ is, to enjoy the riches of His heavenly presence, but never to draw back and return to the old religion, signified by Judaism; otherwise, we will surely receive the Lord&rsquo;s righteous judgment and suffer His punishment. This solemn and righteous word, of course, does not mean that we who are saved by grace may perish forever; rather, it means that after we receive the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, if we do not come forward to enter into the realm of the Lord&rsquo;s ascension and enjoy all the riches of His heavenly ministry, when He comes back we will surely receive His severe dealing and punishment. This, again, is a dispensational punishment, not eternal perdition.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Fifth Warning</h2>
<p>After speaking of the witnesses of faith in chapter eleven, in chapter twelve the fifth warning admonishes us to run the race that is set before us, lest we fall from grace (vv. 1-2, 15); otherwise, we will not be able to escape punishment, because our God is a consuming fire (v. 29). According to the proper meaning of this book, such a warning, of course, cannot refer to eternal perdition, but points to the righteous punishment that God will give to some of His children during the dispensation of the kingdom.</p><h2 class="head1">APPROACHING PEOPLE, HELPING PEOPLE,<br />
AND KNOWING PEOPLE</h2>
<p>The seventh point under &ldquo;Everyone Speaking the Word of God&rdquo; is &ldquo;Approaching People, Helping People, and Knowing People.&rdquo; If you desire to speak to people, you must approach them. Upon seeing people on the street, you should not just shout from afar, &ldquo;Come, it is good to believe in Jesus!&rdquo; If you desire to speak to someone, you should approach him and come to where he is.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Following the Leading of the Spirit<br />
to Approach People</h2>
<p>The gospel preaching of Philip in Acts 8 is a very good example of following the leading of the Spirit to approach people. He was sent by an angel of the Lord to travel on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. While he was in the desert, an Ethiopian man, a eunuch, was returning from worshipping God in Jerusalem. He sat in his chariot reading Isaiah 53. At that time, the Spirit of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, &ldquo;Approach and join this chariot&rdquo; (v. 29). Philip then ran to the eunuch and heard him reading the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, and asked him, &ldquo;Do you really know what you are reading?&rdquo; (v. 30). The eunuch said, &ldquo;How can I unless someone guides me?&rdquo; And he asked Philip to come up to the chariot (v. 31). Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from the scripture, &ldquo;He was led as a sheep to slaughter...&rdquo; (v. 32; cf. Isa. 53:7), he brought the good news of Jesus to him (vv. 32-35).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Helping People to Understand the Bible</h2>
<p>When we speak, we need to approach people and we also need to help people. If we help people to know the Bible, explaining the Bible to them, people will be saved. Suppose that when the Holy Spirit was leading him, asking him to approach the eunuch, Philip did not have the understanding of the Bible. He would have heard the eunuch reading the Scriptures, and he would have asked, &ldquo;Do you really know what you are reading?&rdquo; The eunuch would have said, &ldquo;How can I unless someone guides me?&rdquo; Then Philip would have said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know either; let both of us pray together.&rdquo; After the prayer, they still would not have understood. The eunuch would have returned to his Gentile land, and Philip would have returned to his own land. His chance to speak to the eunuch would have been gone.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, is this often the case with you? Your classmate may open a chapter of the Bible and ask you, &ldquo;My classmate, aren&rsquo;t you a Christian? What does this portion of the Scriptures say?&rdquo; You may say, &ldquo;I am sorry, I don&rsquo;t know either. Why don&rsquo;t you go with me on Sunday to listen to the preaching?&rdquo; That classmate may say, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you listened for a long time? If you do not understand, neither will I understand if I go to listen. Therefore, I do not want to listen.&rdquo; This is the pitiful situation today.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom.&rdquo; The word should dwell in us to such an extent that we understand Isaiah 53, John 4, Genesis 1, and every chapter of the Bible. Only in this way will people respect us. Otherwise, if we try to bring people to listen to a preacher and they will not go, we will become useless. If we all can be like Philip, we can approach people and help people understand the words of the Scriptures at school, in the office, in the barber shop, at home, or in any place.</p>
<p>Now we want to go one step further. No matter where you go, bring with you a small Bible or small cards with printed Bible verses. When you have your hair cut, you can let the barber cut your hair and at the same time read and speak to him. If you speak to one hundred people and one is saved, it will be worth all your effort. In one year, if you bring in one, another brings in one, and every brother and sister brings in one, the number in the church will increase one hundred percent. Therefore, you need to approach people and help people to understand the Scriptures.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing People</h2>
<p>When you speak to people, you need to know people. I firmly believe that on that day, as soon as Philip looked at the man in the chariot, he knew that he was an Ethiopian and that he was a high-ranking officer. After speaking a few more sentences to him, Philip knew his character. When you speak to people, do not be like a robot or like a recorded message, unable to know people. When you talk to a person, after looking at him you should have some understanding of his character and his mood. By looking at him, you will know that he has something that makes him sorrowful, or something that makes him happy. Based on these points, his character and his mood, you will know what his needs are.</p>
<p>The Bible is too rich. We need to be familiar with the Bible, to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly in all wisdom, so that we can give people a proper word. It may be suitable to read to one person the story of the prodigal son in Luke 15. It may be suitable to read to another the words of Romans 2, telling him that although we Gentiles do not have God&rsquo;s law, there is a conscience in us. Whatever we do, our conscience in our innate nature is always weighing our actions, either condemning or justifying them. You need to look at the situation. If the person is a beggar on the roadside, you should have one kind of gospel word for him. If he is a college professor, you should have another word from the Bible to give to him. In this way you will be able to hit the mark.</p>
<p>Surgeons use many instruments when they operate; therefore, it is very difficult to be a surgical nurse, knowing what instrument the surgeon will need at a particular time, without making mistakes. When we talk to people about the Bible, we also need many &ldquo;instruments,&rdquo; and we need to know what their functions are.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope you can see that for everyone to speak the word of God, you need to pray, to be filled in the spirit, and at the same time to learn to speak the proper words. When you speak, you need to be filled with the riches of the words of the Bible and the experiences of life. You need to know the person you are speaking to. You need to approach people, help people, and know people, and to deal with each kind of person with a certain kind of word. In this way, you will never miss the mark, and you will be certain to be successful. If this is the case, the church here surely will be propagating, and the number surely will increase. Thus, there will be a church in Taipei, a genuine golden lampstand, shining brightly.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

	</ol></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING FOR THE OPENING AND<br />
SPREADING OF THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>In this message we come to the point of the word of God increasing, multiplying, and prevailing. First, we need to pray for the word of God, asking God to open a door for His word. The churches on the whole island of Taiwan really need to receive this burden and pray for this matter. Not only do the unbelievers need a door to be opened among them; even many Christians in the denominations, especially those in the Catholic Church, need God to open a door among them, because they themselves have closed the door. Because they lack enlightenment, they have fallen into darkness, thinking that they already know the truth but not actually understanding it. Today the Lord has opened His Word not for us only, but for all the Christians, even for the people of the whole world. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, open the door for us.&rdquo; Paul asked the believers to pray &ldquo;that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ&rdquo; (Col. 4:3).</p>
<p>Second, Paul said, &ldquo;Pray concerning us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified&rdquo; (2 Thes. 3:1). Running is a matter of the way. Once the door is opened, there is still the need to have a way. Ordinarily, people walk on the way first and then go through the door. But according to the Bible, we first must go through the door, and then we can walk on the way (Matt. 7:14). As soon as the door is opened, the way is wide open to let the word of God run and be glorified.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF GOD INCREASING AND MULTIPLYING</h2>
<p>Acts 12:24 says, &ldquo;The word of God grew and multiplied.&rdquo; This growth and multiplication of the word took place in three stages in the book of Acts. The first stage was during the ministry of Peter. During this time Acts 6:7 says that &ldquo;the word of God grew.&rdquo; The second stage was at the time when Peter&rsquo;s ministry was coming to an end. Although Peter was put into prison, God released him from that prison, and as a result &ldquo;the word of God grew and multiplied&rdquo; (Acts 12:24). The last stage was in Paul&rsquo;s ministry. While Paul was in Ephesus, he prevailed greatly in the struggle for the truth. Therefore, Acts 19:20 says, &ldquo;So the word of the Lord grew mightily and was strong.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF GOD PREVAILING</h2>
<p>In Revelation 19 the Lord Jesus coming down out of heaven appears as a general fighting a battle. He is riding on a white horse, and His name is called &ldquo;The Word of God&rdquo; (Rev. 19:11, 13). The word of God that we speak today is the Lord Jesus. Eventually, as we continue to speak, our speaking will cause the Lord Jesus to come forth. When the Lord comes, He comes as a warrior, a general. On His garment and on His thigh the name &ldquo;King of kings and Lord of lords&rdquo; is written (Rev. 19:16). He is fighting for His kingdom.</p><h2 class="head1">SPEAKING THE WORD OF GOD BEING TO TESTIFY<br />
HOW THE PERSON, LIVING, AND WORK<br />
OF JESUS CHRIST IS THE TESTIMONY OF GOD</h2>
<p>Today our speaking for the Lord is our testifying for the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s testimony and the word of God cannot be separated. The word of God speaks concerning the Lord, that is, concerning the Lord&rsquo;s person, living, and work. However, many Christians today cannot speak concerning the person of the Lord. They cannot speak concerning the fact that the Lord was God in eternity past, and that He was then conceived of the Holy Spirit in the womb of Mary and was born of Mary, having both the divine element and the human element. These two elements were mingled together to become one person. Therefore, Christ&rsquo;s person is both God and man; He is the God-man. Most Christians cannot speak a word like this.</p>
<p>Although today we have the Life-study Messages, when we speak for the Lord it is difficult for us to give an adequate presentation. We are like a person who tries to draw a tiger, but his drawing looks like a dog. Therefore, we need much exercise. There is a northern Chinese proverb which says that people may cook with Peking rice and white flour, yet the outcome depends on the skill of the cook. Peking rice is the best rice. Because it was served to the emperor, it was therefore called Peking rice. White flour is also the best flour. The meaning of this proverb is that two people may use Peking rice and white flour, but when one cooks it, it is so tasty, yet when the other cooks it, it is burned. Therefore, we need to be diligent to exercise ourselves in speaking for the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING IN DIFFERENT LEVELS</h2>
<p>We will soon begin to write the truth lessons. They will probably be divided into six levels, with each level having fifty-two topics. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day we will gather together those who have been saved this year and last year, and teach them the lessons in the first level. This will be the first level meeting. At this point we have not yet determined who among those saved for more than two years should attend the meetings for the second, third, and following levels.</p>
<p>When we begin to practice this, we will probably combine the second level with the first, the fourth level with the third, and the sixth level with the fifth. At the beginning we will have only these three levels. After two to three years, we will have six levels going on simultaneously. In this way, the ushers in the meeting halls will be very busy. For example, in hall one in the church in Taipei, each person will be given a name tag. As soon as one enters the hall, an usher will say, &ldquo;The first level class is on the second floor, and the second level class is on the third floor.&rdquo; The classes will be divided in this way. We will no longer meet according to our former way, which was like all of the members of a family, from the little child to the grandfather, eating from one big pot. The result of our eating in that way was that after a while, many stopped coming to the meetings.</p>
<p>We all know that we baptize many people every year, but not many of them remain. If you only allow a little child to eat from the big pot and do not feed him with milk, how can he live? Therefore, we need to greatly reconsider our way. We all need to put out a great effort, for it is not a simple matter to change our way.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei is a big church. On the membership record there are over ten thousand members. But those who regularly attend the meetings number less than four thousand, which, roughly speaking, is one third of the total. There are another two-thirds who do not come to the meetings. We have the first name, last name, and telephone number of all those on record. But up to the present time, we have not done well in the matter of visiting the saints.</p>
<p>Many Americans dare not have too many children. After having two children they do not have any more so as to not invite more trouble for themselves and their children. But in preaching the gospel, we cannot be like this. In the United States, it is not a simple thing for an upper-class family to have a child. They have to prepare much for the child, unlike some poorer families who may crowd the entire family into three rooms. The upper-class families provide one room and one bed for each child. They bring them up properly, teach them properly, and care for them properly. From an economic point of view, this is very logical. But from the standpoint of the gospel, this practice is against God&rsquo;s will. Rather, the higher birth rate of the poorer people is very much according to the Scripture. However, it is wrong to neither feed the children nor teach them properly. In the same way, if we produce new believers, yet eventually we do not feed or teach them properly, this is not right.</p>
<p>Therefore, we need to change our system. But I am not certain as to when we will be able to change the system and when we will finish compiling the truth lessons. I have released so many messages, but now there is a need to select portions from these materials and to teach them properly in six levels. All those who are saved want to know the truth, but if they cannot understand the truth lessons, after a few times they will not want to come. Therefore, we should present the lessons to them well. The more they understand, the tastier the lessons will become. This will attract them, and they will also bring others with them.</p>
<p>We need to pray concerning this matter. In the future, many brothers and sisters will be needed to teach the truth lessons, because we will not teach them in a big meeting for everyone, but the meetings will be divided into levels. Perhaps there will be at least three classes on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning: one class from 8:00 A.M. to 9:30 A.M., another class from 9:30 A.M. to 11:00 A.M., and another class from 11:00 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. Probably there will need to be one class in the afternoon and another class in the evening. This will be a schedule of five classes on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, with each class being divided into three levels. Therefore, as soon as we begin this practice, the task of teaching the truth lessons will be a very heavy burden. Furthermore, in the long run, after we have taught these six levels, what will we do for the seventh level?</p>
<p>Some among us have been meeting with us for thirty-six years. If we had been meeting according to all these levels, how many times would they have been through the levels? All these are problems to be dealt with in the future. The older ones who have heard the messages for more than thirty years will not want to listen to the beginners&rsquo; lessons. As soon as they hear that we are covering the beginners&rsquo; lessons, they may say, &ldquo;Forget it! I shall stay home and rest.&rdquo; Similarly, the newly saved ones, if they are not able to understand after having listened to the messages a few times, may also say, &ldquo;I do not want to go.&rdquo; As a result, only the angels will come. Therefore, I hope that all of us will be diligent. Although we do not have any formal theology, the truth lessons are our theology. Although the lessons have not been written, the material is more than abundant.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>We have said that everyone needs to speak the word of God. How can we speak? We must pray to be filled with the Holy Spirit, and we must experience life. Then what kind of word should we speak? We need to speak the word of grace, the word of the truth, the word of the gospel, the word of life, the healthy word, the edifying word, the good word, the word of righteousness, the word of knowledge, and the word of wisdom. We must speak at least these ten kinds of words.</p>
<p>However, we must not only speak; we must also read. If we only speak, we will eventually run out of words and have nothing more to say. Therefore, we need to read the Bible. I often thank God for the Bible. If there were only the Holy Spirit on the earth today, and if there were no Bible, men would be in total darkness and confusion. But we praise the Lord that there is the Bible. It is no wonder that all those who loved the Lord in the past generations treasured the Bible. The Bible has been translated into many languages. Nearly every written language has its version of the Bible. This is the Lord&rsquo;s doing because the Bible is so important.</p>
<p>However, merely to have the Bible in our hands is not sufficient; we still need to read, study, and get into it. We cannot read it in a superficial way; we need to read and get into it deeply. Therefore, I will also give you some principles on how to read the Bible. First, we must interpret it according to the literal meaning; then we must pray-read it with our spirit, entering into it to eat it and to drink it. We must also breathe in the spirit and the life that are in it, going beyond the words and phrases to explore its depths and to receive life and revelation. We must also take care of the context, and we must use the entire Bible to interpret the Bible.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to realize that we are not the first ones to read the Bible, but we are the followers of those who have gone before us. There are many who have walked this way. What they have practiced can benefit us. The wisest way is to learn from the past experiences of others and to see what others have said. A person may not know whether certain goods, in themselves, are inferior or superior, but when he compares one kind of goods with another, by comparison the superior ones are manifested. Therefore, we need to learn from the theologians and theological books of the past. But when we do our research, we must have the Brethren theology as the foundation of our understanding of the Bible, and we must match it with the line of the inner life. We must absolutely accept the Calvinist view of predestination, and we also need to know that the Arminian doctrine of human responsibility is absolutely not according to the Bible and cannot be accepted. Finally, we need to have the truth of the kingdom to balance us. We must not take those verses which warn of receiving punishment or reward in the coming kingdom, and say that they mean that those who have been saved can still go to hell and perish. This is wrong.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Five Warnings in the Book of Hebrews</h2>
<p>There are five warnings in the book of Hebrews. If we read these five warnings superficially, they seem to say that it is possible for a believer to perish again. For example, the first warning, in 2:3, says, &ldquo;How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?&rdquo; Many preachers use this verse to preach the gospel. They say, &ldquo;This &lsquo;so great a salvation&rsquo; is the salvation of the cross, the salvation of Jesus&rsquo; death for you. If I preach this to you and you neglect it, how can you escape? You will surely be judged and go to hell.&rdquo; To borrow this verse in this way may be acceptable, but strictly speaking, it is not the meaning of the words here.</p>
<p>Hebrews chapter one says that Jesus is God, the Creator, the Son of God, the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory, and the express image of God&rsquo;s substance (vv. 2, 3, 6, 8). It also says that He has passed through death and resurrection and has become the firstborn Son of God (vv. 5-6). Then chapter two says that this One is not only God but also a man (vv. 5-9). He became flesh, taking on a body of flesh and blood. He then died on the cross and did away with sin and Satan (v. 14). Then He resurrected from the dead, producing His brothers, who are the church (vv. 12, 17a). He also ascended to the height and was crowned with glory and honor (v. 9). Now He is sitting in the heavens, and He will come again, bringing all those who believe in Him into glory (v. 10). How great a salvation this is!</p>
<p>This word of such a great salvation was not spoken to sinners, but to those Hebrew believers who had believed and were saved. Since they had been saved, they should have come out of Judaism. But they were influenced by Judaism and desired to return to it again. To return to Judaism was to forsake this Christ, who is such a God-man. He is God, having so many aspects according to Hebrews chapter one, and He is also a man, having so many aspects according to Hebrews chapter two. This warning was written to ask the Hebrew believers, &ldquo;How can you forsake such a wonderful One? How can you neglect so great a salvation? If you neglect such a Christ and return to Judaism, how can you escape? God will surely punish you for this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Judaism was originally set up by God, it became a traditional religion which forsook God. How can we say this? Was not the Lord Jesus God? He became flesh and came to dwell among the Jews. But Judaism rejected Him and finally cast Him outside the city of Jerusalem, to the hill of Golgotha, to be nailed to the cross. Thus Judaism totally rejected God.</p>
<p>God Himself passed through many processes. He was incarnated, passed through human living, died, resurrected, and released His life, completely accomplishing His redemptive work. He not only did away with the negative things, but He also released the life within Him in order to enter into man, thus causing man to be regenerated and become a new creation. This is the beginning of God&rsquo;s salvation. This God-man redeemed us and gave us so great a salvation. We should not leave Him and go back to Judaism; this would be a sin. This is a proper interpretation of this verse, showing that we should not take verses like this out of context.</p>
<p>The second warning begins in chapter three of Hebrews (3:7&mdash;4:13). This chapter says that we have a great Apostle, the Savior, Jesus. He is superior to Moses and to Joshua. He desires to bring us into the coming rest which God has ordained, and that rest is the kingdom. When the millennial kingdom comes, we who are following the Lord will all enter into rest. Today we are like the Israelites in the wilderness. It was Joshua who brought them across the river Jordan to enter the land of Canaan as their rest. However, that was only a type. Joshua is the Hebrew equivalent of the Greek word Jesus. Today our Joshua is Jesus, who is bringing us through today&rsquo;s wilderness. One day when He comes again, He will set up His kingdom, and He will bring us into the kingdom to be kings in the kingdom with Him. Then we will enjoy the rest. While they journeyed, many Israelites fell in the wilderness and thus were not able to enter into the rest of Canaan. Therefore, we also need to be careful. We can see that many Christians today are falling. Therefore, there is such a warning not to come short of the promised rest.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking until the Lord Jesus Comes Again</h2>
<p>Following these two warnings, there are three more warnings in the book of Hebrews. These are described in a very detailed way in the Life-study of Hebrews. When you read it, you will be clear concerning these warnings. We thank and praise the Lord that we are all rising up to speak. If all the saints in Taipei and all the saints in Taiwan continue to speak, eventually there will have to be a result. The word of God will grow and prevail. We need to speak until the Lord Jesus comes again.</p></body></html>
