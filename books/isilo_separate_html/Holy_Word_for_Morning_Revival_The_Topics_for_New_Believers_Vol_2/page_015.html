<li>Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!<br />
The Christ who&rsquo;s all within me lives.<br />
With Him I have been crucified;<br />
This glorious fact to me He gives.<br />
Now it&rsquo;s no longer I that live,<br />
But Christ the Lord within me lives.</li>
<li>Oh, what a joy! Oh, what a rest!<br />
Christ now is being formed in me.<br />
His very nature and life divine<br />
In my whole being inwrought shall be.<br />
All that I am came to an end,<br />
And all of Christ is all to me.</li>
<li>Oh, what a thought! Oh, what a boast!<br />
Christ shall in me be magnified.<br />
In nothing shall I be ashamed,<br />
For He in all shall be applied.<br />
In woe or blessing, death or life,<br />
Through me shall Christ be testified.</li>
<li>Oh, what a prize! Oh, what a gain!<br />
Christ is the goal toward which I press.<br />
Nothing I treasure, nor aught desire,<br />
But Christ of all-inclusiveness.<br />
My hope, my glory, and my crown<br />
Is Christ, the One of peerlessness.</li>

<h2 class="head3u">Hymns, #501</h2>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>O glorious Christ, Savior mine,<br />
Thou are truly radiance divine;<br />
God infinite, in eternity,<br />
Yet man in time, finite to be.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God mingled with humanity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives in me my all to be.</li>
<li>The fulness of God dwells in Thee;<br />
Thou dost manifest God&rsquo;s glory;<br />
In flesh Thou hast redemption wrought;<br />
As Spirit, oneness with me sought.</li>
<li>All things of the Father are Thine;<br />
All Thou art in Spirit is mine;<br />
The Spirit makes Thee real to me,<br />
That Thou experienced might be.</li>
<li>The Spirit of life causes Thee<br />
By Thy Word to transfer to me.<br />
Thy Spirit touched, Thy word received,<br />
Thy life in me is thus conceived.</li>
<li>In spirit while gazing on Thee,<br />
As a glass reflecting Thy glory,<br />
Like to Thyself transformed I&rsquo;ll be,<br />
That Thou might be expressed thru me.</li>
<li>In no other way could we be<br />
Sanctified and share Thy vict&rsquo;ry;<br />
Thus only spiritual we&rsquo;ll be<br />
And touch the life of glory.</li>
<li>Thy Spirit will me saturate,<br />
Every part will God permeate,<br />
Deliv&rsquo;ring me from the old man,<br />
With all saints building for His plan.</li>
