Some have the standing without the ability, and others have the ability without the standing. Perhaps a brother who is very keen and much improved in the Lord has had two marriages before he was saved. He is really one with the Lord and among all the brothers he is the most improved in the spirit. But how could he get rid of that blot on his history? It is always there, and because of the standard of the church, it is evidently not good for one with such a background to take the lead.<p>Some may say that others then should take the lead. But perhaps he who has the standing is just like plain water: he is neither sweet nor salty; he cannot do anything. If you ask him to take the lead, he simply cannot do it. So we need more mercy and grace, with more experience in life. These two brothers must work together. The one with the most improvement in the spirit must realize that though he has such an amount of spiritual ability, he has apparently lost the standard. He must realize where he stands and be faithful to the Lord in a covered way to be one with his brother. He must be faithful to God&#8217;s grace and never take the lead, for he realizes his standing has been lost. If he would take it, he would damage the church and lower the standard of the church. He must therefore in faithfulness to the Lord do whatever he can to support his brother and be one with his brother.<p>The plain brother, then, must realize that though he has the standing, he is not capable of bearing the responsibility. Though he may be willing, yet he does not have the ability; so he needs the other brother. These two brothers must therefore become one. This is not so easy. They really need the mercy and grace of the Lord with much experience in life. If the one who is spiritual and improved in the spirit considers the brother in the lead and says that he is not qualified, the whole church life is gone. He must be one with his brother.<p>We all must realize that we are definitely in a kind of abnormal situation today. We all must look to the Lord for more experience in life. Today, in this time of abnormality, scarcely one among us is much qualified and equipped. Hence, several need to be one. A brother may have the standing and that is all. If he must make a decision, he must come to two other brothers. If he must say something, he will not know what to say; therefore, he must come to these two brothers and pray with them. He becomes their mouth, and they become his light-the three become one. This is the remedy for today&#8217;s abnormal situation.<p>Moreover, we should not make the government in the churches so legal. We should not say that since these are the elders, let them do the job right or resign! This is wrong. If we have this attitude, it will damage the church life. We must realize that though the present leading ones may not be so qualified, we should not be so legal. They are still the leading ones; so let them take their position. We should do all we can to support them. There is no need for a change; we should do everything we can to help them.<p>And the leading ones must realize that they are not so capable. They should not make the situation so legal in such a way that everything must be in their hands. This is also wrong. Here we need the mercy and grace of the Lord.<p>Everyone among us must be faithful to the Lord, and everyone must learn that we do need the government in the church. I may be more capable than all those who are in the government, yet I realize that under the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty I am not in the government. Therefore, I become so submissive to the government. Though the leading ones in the government are not as qualified as I may be, yet I do whatever I can to support them. I should not have any thought that some day the Lord will remove the present leading ones, and I will be one of the leaders. No, I should be submissive to the present government and support it. This is the attitude we should take.<p>The leading ones must realize that they should not control anything in the church in a legal way. This does not mean to surrender the order, but it does mean that there is no legality. Everyone is in grace. For instance, in some places, the leading ones think that because they are the leaders, they must start the meeting; if the leaders have not yet arrived at the meeting, no one should start. If some of the others begin the meeting, the leaders become angry. They like to hold everything so legally in their hand. This is wrong.<p>Then there are others who say that the leading ones restrict the Holy Spirit. They feel that everybody can do anything they like according to the Holy Spirit; therefore, they do not need leaders. This also is wrong.<p>I have been so happy with our meetings here in Los Angeles. We do not have any regulations in our meetings. Everyone is free to start the meeting, but there is no kind of disorder. I believe that this is right. If you say that there is no government, I will say strongly that there is a government. If you say that the church in Los Angeles is out of control and everybody is so free, I will say that the church in Los Angeles is very much under control. But if you say that there is a government with a certain kind of control, I will not admit this. There is no control. I will say a hundred times that no one controls.<p>What I mean is this: We do have a government here, but we do not have a legal government. We do not like to have anything legal, neither do we like to have anything in disorder. We like everything to be in order. We like everything to be in order, but not with legality. This requires more and more grace.<h2 class=head1>A CHANGE IN LIFE</h2><p>If we all have learned the lesson of grace, wherever we go, we will simply go to the church on the proper ground. Then when we get into that local church, we will submit ourselves to the situation and not question anything. By the Lord&#8217;s leading we will do our best to minister life to others and support the government of the church. This will build up the church and give ground to the Lord for Him to do something more.<p>When King David was young, he was in an abnormal situation. But he learned the lesson, and this paved the way for the Lord to come in. Therefore, the Lord was able to put him into the position of king. If we have the grace and learn the lesson of life, someday the Lord will put the responsibility on our shoulders. He will bring us into the government of the church. But this must be the sovereign move of the Lord, not something brought about by our manipulation.<p>In the church, any replacement or change in the government may cause a loss. We do not need an outward change, but we do need a change in life. Perhaps in the church in certain places, the leading ones are not as qualified and as living as you are. But you must be faithful to the Lord to minister life, submit yourself to the leading ones, and do whatever you can to support and help the present government. This will minister more life to the whole church, and this life will bring about a change in life. Perhaps after a few more years, spontaneously some of the present leaders will be moved by the Lord. Then in life you and some others who are experienced in life will be put into the leading position by the Lord. It will not be something done by human hands, but by the sovereign, divine hand. It will be something in life, and it will not cause any damage to the church life.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> </body></html>
