   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 24:"And when he began to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To "owe" speaks of the believers' indebtedness to God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We do not know if the "ten thousand talents" is gold or silver, but we know that it is an enormous amount.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The slave can never pay back the whole sum.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One gold talent equals 1,152 ounces of gold; one silver talent equals 1,152 ounces of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, ten thousand talents equals 1,152 times 10,000 which equals 11,520,000 ounces.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Believers owe debts in relation to God , while sinners commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What the believers owe in their daily life may be more than this amount.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this reckoning, the Lord must have suffered quite a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 25:"But since he did not have the means to repay, the master commanded him to be sold, as well as his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This does not mean that the master actually wanted the man to sell his wife, children, and all that he had; it indicates that God wants to deprive man of all that he has.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 26:"Then the slave fell down and worshipped him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you all."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Four matters are included here: 1 repentance he fell down ; 2 humility he worshipped ; 3 asking for mercy "be patient with me" ; 4 making a vow and a consecration "repay you all" .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 27:"And the master of that slave was moved with compassion and released him and forgave him the loan."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"Moved with compassion."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was because the slave repented, humbled himself, and asked for mercy, not because the slave was willing to pay back the debt.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The master knew perfectly well that the slave could not repay; therefore, he forgave him the debt.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Released him" means set him free; this means that this takes place in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the setting free and the exemption from debt were in the coming age, the Lord's righteousness would be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the present age God not only has patience toward us but also wipes away all our debts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's grace always surpasses man's expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 28:"But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, and he took hold of him and began to choke him, saying, Repay me what you owe."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Went out" means to depart from God's reckoning of our account or to depart from the days of discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The "fellow slave" is another slave, one who is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"A hundred denarii" is a small sum; it denotes a small shortcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After a man sins, if he has not confessed his sin thoroughly before God, he will not have a deep impression of his wrong even though he has repented.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why after a short while this slave quickly forgot the matter and became violent with his fellow slave.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This slave repented first out of anxiety and not because he realized the hopelessness of his debt; he still hoped to pay back the debt.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, although he was humble and although he repented, the impression was not deep.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After a short while he quickly forgot the Lord's great mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>David was also like this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He did not know his own sin and condemned the rich man in Nathan's parable.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 29:"Then his fellow slave fell down and begged him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The debt was small, and his fellow slave made the same repentance, showed the same humility, asked for mercy, and vowed his vow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 30:"But he would not; instead, he went away and threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although this one's plea for mercy was the same as his, he could not remember his own pleading at the beginning and his receiving mercy, for at that time all his pleading was out of his anxiety and not out of a realization of the desperateness of his debts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"Threw him into prison."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means to deal with the matter according to the law and to forget about grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although he did it according to righteousness, righteousness could not be applied to this case because he could not annul the mercy he himself had received at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If he had not received mercy at the beginning, then it would seem lawful for him to cast others into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But after he had received mercy, it became a matter of righteousness for him to show mercy to others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 31:"Then his fellow slaves, seeing what had taken place, were greatly grieved and came and explained fully to their master all that had taken place."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The prayers of the saints reach God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 32:"Then his master called him to him and said to him, Evil slave, all that debt I forgave you, because you begged me."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This verse can refer to this life, in which case it means that God takes a person away from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This verse can also refer to the coming age, in which case it refers to God's judgment in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 33:"Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave even as I had mercy on you?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord rebuked him for forgetting the mercy he had formerly received.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This verse is the center, focus, and lesson of this parable.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verse 34:"And his master became angry and delivered him to the torturers until he would repay all that was owed."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His master was not breaking his promise.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because of righteousness, he made void his former mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"Repay all" means to fulfill the punishment of the one thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 35:"So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 35 is the summary.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verses 21 and 22 are the introduction.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verses 23-34 are the parable.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Here, in the summary, it applies the lesson to men of the present age.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>From this we see that this parable concerns matters of the present age.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"From your hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>So many times one forgives in his face, by his mouth, or in his conduct, but not "from the heart."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord stresses the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If a believer does not forgive others, he will be cast into prison and will not be released until he repays all that he owes.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, a believer who does not forgive others should not ask to be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There should not be a believer who is so stubborn as to refuse to move his head, speak to others, or communicate with others.</S>
