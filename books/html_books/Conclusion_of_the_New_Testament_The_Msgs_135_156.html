This stage begins with God&#8217;s calling; it includes the believers&#8217; being sanctified, their repenting and believing, and their being baptized, joined to the processed Triune God, redeemed, made a new creation, and saved; and it ends with the clearing of the past. Now we are ready to go on to the second stage of God&#8217;s full salvation, the progressing stage.<h2 class=head1>B. IN THE PROGRESSING STAGE OF GOD&#8217;S FULL SALVATION, THE STAGE OF TRANSFORMATION</h2><p>The second stage of God&#8217;s full salvation, the progressing stage, is the stage of transformation. This stage is composed of freedom from sin, sanctification, growth in life, transformation, building up, and maturity. The sanctification in this stage is mainly dispositional, although there is still an amount of positional sanctification. In this stage of transformation God is freeing us from the dominion of indwelling sin-the law of sin and death-by the law of the Spirit of life through the effectiveness of the death of Christ working subjectively in us (Rom. 6:6-7; 7:16-20; 8:2). In the second stage God is also sanctifying us by His Holy Spirit (Rom. 15:16), with His holy nature, through His discipline (Heb. 12:10) and His judgment in His own house. The element, the substance, God uses to sanctify us is His holy nature.<p>In the progressing stage of salvation God is also causing us to grow in His life (1 Cor. 3:6-7). He is transforming us by renewing the inward parts of our soul by the life-giving Spirit (2 Cor. 3:6, 17-18; Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23) through the working of all things (Rom. 8:28). He is building us together into a spiritual house for His dwelling (1 Pet. 2:5; Eph. 2:22), and He is maturing us in His life (Rev. 14:15) for the completion of His full salvation.<p>In the first stage of God&#8217;s full salvation we are delivered from God&#8217;s condemnation and from eternal perdition. In the second stage we are being delivered from the power of sin, the world, the flesh, the self, the soul (the natural life), and individualism. Therefore, in this stage we are in the process of being delivered from many negative things. The goal of this deliverance is that we would have maturity in the divine life for the fulfilling of God&#8217;s eternal purpose.<h2 class=head2>1. Experiencing and Enjoying the Processed Triune God in His Triune Dispensing</h2><p>The first matter in the progressing stage of God&#8217;s full salvation is experiencing and enjoying the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing. By the end of the first stage we have been saved and have cleared the past, and we are ready to go on in our Christian life. However, this going on is not in the way of doing things but in the way of experiencing and enjoying what we have already received. In the initial stage of God&#8217;s salvation, we received the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-and now we are ready to go on by experiencing and enjoying the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing. Ever since we were saved the Triune God has been dispensing His being with all His divine elements into us for our experience and enjoyment.<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 speaks clearly concerning the experience and enjoyment of the Triune God: &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&#8221; This verse indicates that we experience and enjoy God the Father in His love, Christ the Son in His grace, and the Spirit in His fellowship. The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as life to us for our enjoyment (John 1:17; 1 Cor. 15:10), the love of God is God Himself (1 John 4:8, 16) as the source of the grace of the Lord, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God for our experience and enjoyment. The love of God, that is, the love of the Father, is the source; the grace of Christ, that is, the grace of the Son, is the flowing out of the love of the Father; and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the flowing into us of the grace of the Son together with the love of the Father for us to experience and enjoy.<p>The fellowship of the Holy Spirit within us is the transmitting of the grace of the Son into us, and the grace of the Son within us is simply the practical tasting and enjoying of the love of the Father. The love of the Father is the source, the grace of the Son is the manifestation, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the transmission, transmitting the grace of the Son with the love of the Father into us. The result is that we experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing.<p>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit are not three separate matters but three aspects of one thing, just as the Lord, God, and the Holy Spirit are not three separate Gods but three &#8220;hypostases...of the one same undivided and indivisible&#8221; God (Philip Schaff). The love of God is the source, since God is the origin; the grace of the Lord is the course of the love of God, since the Lord is the expression of God; and the fellowship of the Spirit is the impartation of the grace of the Lord with the love of God, since the Spirit is the transmission of the Lord with God for our experience and enjoyment of the Triune God. The Triune God with His grace, love, and fellowship is experienced and enjoyed by the believers through the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity. Second Corinthians 13:14, therefore, is a strong proof that the trinity of the Godhead is not for the doctrinal understanding of systematic theology but for the dispensing of God Himself in His trinity into His chosen and redeemed people.<p>In this divine dispensing we simultaneously experience and enjoy grace, love, and fellowship. While we enjoy the fellowship of the Spirit, we also have the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God. The more we live in the fellowship of the Spirit, the more we shall have the grace of Christ, and the more we have the grace of Christ, the more we shall enjoy the love of God. The fellowship of the Holy Spirit brings in the grace of Christ, and in the grace of Christ we have the love of God. Therefore, the love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit are experienced and enjoyed by the believers simultaneously in the divine dispensing.<h2 class=head3>a. Experiencing and Enjoying God as the Father in His Love</h2><p>In experiencing and enjoying the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing, we experience and enjoy the Father in His love. Whatever the Father does in His dispensing and moving in us is in love and is based on love. Love is the source of the Father&#8217;s dispensing. Thus, when we experience and enjoy the Triune God, we experience and enjoy the Father in His love.<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 speaks of the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. We may say that this verse refers to the divine flow. God the Father is the source of the divine flow, God the Son is the course, and God the Spirit is the flow itself reaching us. This flow of the Triune God is out of love, through grace, and by fellowship. The point we would emphasize here is that in experiencing and enjoying the Triune God we experience and enjoy the Father with His love as the source of the divine flow. In the progressing stage of God&#8217;s salvation, we are experiencing and enjoying the Father, the source of the divine Trinity in His love as the source of the divine flow.<p>The New Testament says clearly that God is love (1 John 4:8, 16). The expression &#8220;God is love,&#8221; like &#8220;God is light&#8221; (1 John 1:5), and &#8220;God is Spirit&#8221; (John 4:24), is used not in a metaphoric sense but in a predicative sense. These expressions denote and describe the nature of God. In His nature God is Spirit, love, and light. Spirit denotes the nature of God&#8217;s person; love, the nature of God&#8217;s essence; and light, the nature of God&#8217;s expression. Both love and light are related to God as life, which life is of the Spirit (Rom. 8:2). God, Spirit, and life are actually one. God is Spirit, and Spirit is life. Within such a life are love and light. When this divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when this divine light shines upon us, it becomes truth.<p>In His nature God is Spirit, love, and light. We need to be impressed with the fact that Spirit denotes the nature of God&#8217;s person; love, the nature of God&#8217;s essence; and light, the nature of God&#8217;s expression. In our enjoyment of the Father we enjoy Him mainly in His love as the nature of His essence. When this love flows forth, it immediately becomes grace, and this grace comes with Christ (John 1:17). Hence, love is of the Father, and grace is of the Son. Our emphasis in this message is the believers&#8217; experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in His love.<p>Concerning God&#8217;s love, Paul says in Romans 5:5, &#8220;The love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.&#8221; From the day we believed in the Lord Jesus, the love of God has been poured out in our hearts. This is not merely a matter of feeling. On the contrary, something substantial, something essential, has been poured out into our hearts. This means that, as believers, deep in our hearts we have something of the divine essence, and this is God the Father as love. In other words, God as love is the divine essence that has been poured out into our hearts. Therefore, the pouring out of the love of God into our hearts is a matter of the essence of God. Because we have been regenerated, we have love as the nature of God&#8217;s essence within us. Because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts, the heart of every believer is a heart of love. In our experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in His love, we experience and enjoy the dispensing of love as the nature of God&#8217;s essence into our hearts.<h2 class=head4>(1) As Their Father</h2><p>The believers experience and enjoy God as their Father. Galatians 4:6 says, &#8220;Because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!&#8221; Romans 8:15 tells us that we &#8220;have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father.&#8221; &#8220;Abba&#8221; is an Aramaic word, thus a Hebrew, that means father; and &#8220;Father&#8221; is the translation of the Greek word pater. When the two terms &#8220;Abba&#8221; and &#8220;Father&#8221; are put together, the result is a deep, sweet sense, a sense that is exquisitely intimate. &#8220;Abba, Father&#8221; is sweetness intensified. This term was first used by the Lord Jesus in Gethsemane while praying to the Father (Mark 14:36). The combination of the Hebrew title with the Greek expresses a stronger affection in crying to the Father. Such an affectionate cry implies an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and the begetting Father.<p>Romans 8:15 and Galatians 4:6 are parallel verses. Romans 8:15 says that we who have received a spirit of sonship cry in this spirit &#8220;Abba, Father,&#8221; whereas Galatians 4:6 says that the Spirit of God&#8217;s Son is in our heart crying &#8220;Abba, Father.&#8221; This indicates that our regenerated spirit and the Spirit of God are mingled as one. Whether the Spirit cries or we cry, we both cry together. When He cries &#8220;Abba, Father,&#8221; we cry with Him. When we cry &#8220;Abba, Father,&#8221; He joins with us in our crying. The Spirit cries in our crying because the Spirit of the Son of God dwells in our spirit.<p>The sense we have when calling &#8220;Abba, Father&#8221; is sweet and intimate. How tender and sweet it is to call God &#8220;Abba, Father!&#8221; Such an intimate calling involves our emotion as well as our spirit. The fact that the Spirit of sonship in our spirit cries &#8220;Abba, Father&#8221; from our heart proves that we have a genuine relationship in life with our loving Father. We are His real sons.<h2 class=head4>(2) Over Them, through Them, and in Them</h2><p>In Ephesians 4:6 Paul speaks of the &#8220;God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.&#8221; The word &#8220;all&#8221; refers to all believers. The thought of the Trinity is implied here. &#8220;Over all&#8221; refers mainly to the Father; &#8220;through all,&#8221; to the Son; and &#8220;in all,&#8221; to the Spirit. God the Father can be in three positions, above all, through all, and in all, because God is triune. Even God the Father is triune. The Father&#8217;s position is above all, the Son&#8217;s position is through all, and the Spirit&#8217;s position is in all. Therefore, God the Father possesses all the positions of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. He is above all as the Father, He is through all in the Son, and He is in all as the Spirit. From this we see that God the Father is related to the believers in a triune way. His way to be with us is triune.<p>From experience we know that the Father&#8217;s triune way to be with the believers is the triune dispensing. As we fellowship with the Lord, we may sense that the very God with whom we are fellowshipping is above us and overshadowing us. At the same time we have the sense that this loving One is not only overshadowing us but is also passing through us. As we continue our fellowship with Him, we also have the sense that this very One is dwelling in us. His overshadowing, passing through us, and dwelling in us are all for the divine dispensing. This means that God dispenses Himself into us in a triune way by overshadowing us, by passing through us, and by dwelling in us. As we experience and enjoy this dispensing, we sense God the Father in three directions-over us, through us, and in us.<p>Whenever the Father comes to us, He does not come alone but with the Son. Furthermore, when the Son comes to us with the Father, the Son comes as the Spirit. The Father comes in the Son, and the Son comes as the Spirit with the Father. Hence, when the Father comes, the Son and the Spirit also come. God the Father visits us, but He always visits us in the Son, who visits us as the Spirit. This means that the Three of the Trinity-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-visit us in a triune way, in a threefold way, for the divine dispensing.<h2 class=head4>(3) Seen by Them Who Are Pure in Their Hearts</h2><p>The One who is over us, through us, and in us can be seen by us. &#8220;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God&#8221; (Matt. 5:8). To be pure in heart is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God&#8217;s will for God&#8217;s glory (1 Cor. 10:31). If we are pure in heart in seeking God, we shall see God. Seeing God is a reward to the pure in heart.<p>It is impossible, of course, to see God with our physical eyes. However, we can see Him with our spirit and with a heart that is pure and single. If we have an open spirit and a pure heart, we shall see God. To see God is an experience and an enjoyment. When we see Him, He dispenses Himself into us, infusing Himself into our being.<h2 class=head4>(4) Near to Them Who Draw Near to Him</h2><p>God the Father is not only seen by those who are pure in heart but is also near to those who draw near to Him. James 4:8a says, &#8220;Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you.&#8221; God is visible, yet we need to be pure in heart. Likewise, God is near to us, yet we need to draw near to Him. If we do not draw near to Him, He will not draw near to us in our experience. His drawing near to us depends on our drawing near to Him.<p>From experience we know that whenever we draw near to God under the redeeming blood of Christ, we have the sense that God is near to us. He draws near to us that we may experience Him and enjoy Him. By drawing near to us God shows His love to us or His sympathy for us. In drawing near to us He also comforts us, encourages us, and strengthens us. Sometimes we may have the sense that God is near to us in order to wipe away our tears. To those who draw near to God the Father He is near in order to love, sympathize, comfort, encourage, strengthen, and sustain. In this way the believers experience and enjoy God as the Father in His love.<h2 class=head4>(5) Worshipped by Them by His Spirit</h2><p>God the Father is worshipped by the believers by His Spirit (Phil. 3:3). If we worship God the Father in a religious way by rituals, we shall not be able to touch Him. But whenever we worship Him by the Spirit, we have the sense that we are touching Him and that we are brought out of ourselves and into the heavens. As we worship God the Father by His Spirit, something of the living God, the One we worship by the Spirit, is wrought into our being. This is an experience and an enjoyment of God the Father that is unforgettable. We, the believers in Christ, experience and enjoy the very God whom we worship by His Spirit.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(20)</h1><p>In the progressing stage of God&#8217;s full salvation, the stage of transformation, the believers experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing. First, they experience and enjoy God as the Father in His love. In this message we shall consider more aspects of this experience and enjoyment of God the Father.<h2 class=head4>(6) Giving Grace, Even Greater Grace, to Them, Those Who Are Humble</h2><p>God as the Father in His love gives grace, even greater grace, to the believers, those who are humble. James 4:6 says, &#8220;He gives greater grace; wherefore it says, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.&#8221; According to the context, to be proud here means to be proud toward God. Being proud before God causes Him to resist us. To be humble is also toward God, and this causes Him to give us grace, as He desires.<p>We need to learn to draw near to God (James 4:8) to receive greater grace. Instead of being proud and resisting God, we should receive in meekness the implanted word (James 1:21). Someone who is proud cannot receive God&#8217;s implanted word. If we are humble, we shall receive the implanted word, and we shall also receive greater grace.<p>First Peter 5:5b also says, &#8220;God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;resist&#8221; is a strong word for an army preparing to resist the enemy. Peter uses this word to show how strong God is in resisting those who are proud. The Greek word rendered &#8220;proud&#8221; here literally means showing above (others). To be proud is to show ourselves above others. God resists the one who lifts himself above others and regards himself as better than others. Instead of being proud and showing ourselves above others, we should be humble.<p>God gives grace to the humble. This grace refers to the Triune God Himself as the life supply being multiplied in the humble believer. This is the multiplied grace (1 Pet. 1:2), the varied grace (4:10), and all grace (5:10). The believers have received the initial grace, yet this grace needs to be multiplied in them that they may participate in all grace. The varied grace of God is the rich supply of life, which is the Triune God ministered into us in many aspects (2 Cor. 13:14; 12:9). God gives Himself as grace, as life supply, to humble believers.<p>The Greek word for &#8220;humble&#8221; in 1 Peter 5:5 also means lowly, as in Matthew 11:29, where the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I am meek and lowly in heart.&#8221; To be proud is to be high, but to be humble is to be low. If we would humble ourselves in the church life, we need to become lowly. Instead of uplifting ourselves, we should always keep ourselves low. Then we shall be in a position to receive the Triune God as our life supply. We shall receive the grace, even the greater grace, God gives to humble believers.<p>In the foregoing message we pointed out that in order to see God we need to be pure in heart (Matt. 5:8). This means that being pure in heart is the condition, the term, for seeing God. Likewise, there are conditions for having God draw near to us and for Him to be worshipped by us. In order for God to draw near to us, we need to draw near to Him (James 4:8a), and in order for God to be worshipped by us, we need to worship Him by His Spirit (Phil. 3:3). In like manner, there is a condition that we need to fulfill in order for God to give us grace, and this condition is that we must be humble. When we are truly humble before God, we shall receive His grace, even His greater grace.<h2 class=head4>(7) Coming, with the Son, to Them and Making an Abode with Them</h2><p>God the Father not only gives grace to the believers, but He comes to them with the Son and makes an abode with them. In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; The Father does not come to visit us temporarily; He comes to stay, having no intention of leaving. The Father&#8217;s intention in coming to us with the Son is to make an abode with us. The Father with the Son takes the believers as His abode and makes the believers an abode to Him. This means that the Father&#8217;s visitation makes us His abode, and it makes Him our abode. Eventually, we and He, He and we, become a mutual abode.<p>The Father cannot come to us by Himself to make an abode with us. Rather, He comes to us with the Son and by the Spirit. When the Father comes to us, He brings the Son, and the Son as the Spirit accompanies the Father. Thus, the three of the Godhead come together. The Father comes with the Son, and the Son accompanies the Father as the Spirit. Then the Father dwells in us with the Son as the Spirit. This is the Triune God coming to make an abode with us.<h2 class=head4>(8) Abiding in Them</h2><p>After coming to us with the Son, the Father abides in us. The Father&#8217;s intention in coming to us is to abide in us, to stay with us forever.<p>First John 3:24 says, &#8220;He who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And in this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.&#8221; If we keep the Lord&#8217;s commandments by living in the divine reality, we shall abide in Him, and He in us. We abide in the Lord; then He abides in us. Our abiding in Him is a condition for His abiding in us (John 15:4). We enjoy His abiding in us by our abiding in Him.<p>The second part of 1 John 3:24 tells us that &#8220;we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;by the Spirit&#8221; modifies &#8220;we know.&#8221; The Spirit here is more inclusive than the Spirit of God and the Holy Spirit. The Spirit refers to the Spirit who was not yet (John 7:39) before Christ&#8217;s glorification. Now, after the resurrection of Christ, the Spirit is here. Therefore, we know that we abide in the Lord and He abides in us by the Spirit whom He has given to us.<p>First John 4:13 says, &#8220;In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given us of His Spirit.&#8221; The words &#8220;in this&#8221; mean in the fact that God has given us of His Spirit we know that we abide in Him and He in us. The Spirit whom God has given to dwell in us (James 4:5; Rom. 8:9, 11) is the witness in our spirit (Rom. 8:16) that we dwell in God and He in us. The abiding Spirit, that is, the indwelling Spirit, is the element and sphere of the mutual abiding, the mutual indwelling, of us and God. By Him we are assured that we and God are one, abiding in one another, indwelling each other mutually.<p>In verse 13 John indicates that we may know that we abide in God and that He abides in us. To abide in God is to dwell in Him, remaining in our fellowship with Him, that we may experience and enjoy His abiding in us. This is to practice our oneness with God according to the divine anointing by a living that practices His righteousness and love. It is all by the operation of the all-inclusive compound Spirit, who dwells in our spirit.<p>We know that we abide in God and that God abides in us because He &#8220;has given us of His Spirit.&#8221; In Greek &#8220;of&#8221; literally means &#8220;out of.&#8221; God has given us out of His Spirit. &#8220;Out of His Spirit&#8221; is an expression which implies that the Spirit of God, whom He has given to us, is bountiful and without measure (Phil. 1:19; John 3:34). By such a bountiful, immeasurable Spirit we know with full assurance that we are one with God and that we abide in Him and He in us.<p>First John 4:15 goes on to say, &#8220;Whoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.&#8221; God the Father sent His Son to be the Savior of the world with the purpose that men may believe in Him by confessing that Jesus is the Son of God, so that God may abide in them and they in God. Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God. He becomes one with God in the divine life and nature. In our preaching of the gospel we need to tell others that if they believe in the Lord Jesus, confessing that He is the Son of God, God will come into them to abide in them, and they will abide in God.<p>First John 4:16 continues, &#8220;And we have known and have believed the love which God has in us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.&#8221; To abide in love is to live a life that loves others habitually with the love which is God Himself so that He may be expressed in us. To abide in God is to live a life which is God Himself as our inward content and outward expression so that we may be absolutely one with Him. God abides in us to be our life inwardly and our living outwardly. Thus, He may be one with us in a practical way. If we abide in the love which is God Himself, then we abide in God, and God abides in us.<p>Whereas John in his writings uses the word &#8220;abides,&#8221; Paul in his writings uses the word &#8220;dwells&#8221; (Rom. 8:11) and even speaks of Christ making His home in our hearts (Eph. 3:17). Concerning God&#8217;s abiding in us, Paul&#8217;s writing is even stronger than that of John, for Paul tells us that the Triune God desires to settle down, to make His home deep down, in our hearts.<p>As God the Father abides in us, we experience and enjoy Him as the loving One, as the One who is the source of love. God as the Father in His love comes to us and abides in us in order to dispense Himself into us.<h2 class=head4>(9) Imparting to Them His Great Power Which He Wrought in Christ</h2><p>While God the Father imparts Himself to us, He imparts to us His great power which He wrought in Christ. This is &#8220;the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead, and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies&#8221; (Eph. 1:19-20). The surpassing great power of God toward us is according to the operation of the might of His strength which He wrought in Christ. God&#8217;s power toward us is the same power that operated in Christ. This means that as the Body we participate in the power that operates in the Head.<p>The great power that operated in Christ first raised Him from among the dead. This power has overcome death, the grave, and Hades. Because of God&#8217;s resurrection power, death and Hades could not hold Christ (Acts 2:24).<p>The surpassing greatness of God&#8217;s power has also seated Christ at God&#8217;s right hand in the heavenlies, &#8220;far above all rule and authority and power and lordship, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is coming&#8221; (Eph. 1:21). God&#8217;s right hand, where Christ has been seated by the surpassing great power of God, is the most honorable place, the place with supreme authority. The ascended Christ has been seated far above all rule, authority, power, and lordship in the entire universe. Christ has been seated far above everything, both in this age and in the coming age.<p>Ephesians 1:22 tells us that God &#8220;subjected all things under His feet.&#8221; This indicates that the great power that operated in Christ has subjected all things under His feet. For Christ to be far above all is one thing, and for all things to be subjected under His feet is another. The former is Christ&#8217;s transcendency, whereas the latter is the subjection of all things to Him. Here we see the subduing power, the power to subdue all things.<p>Ephesians 1:22 also tells us that God gave Christ &#8220;to be Head over all things to the church.&#8221; This means that God&#8217;s great power that operated in Christ gave Him to be the Head over all things to the church. It was through God&#8217;s surpassing great power that Christ received the headship in the universe. As a man, in His humanity with His divinity, Christ was raised up from the dead, was seated in the heavenlies, had all things subjected to Him, and was given to be the Head over all things. All this took place through God&#8217;s great power which He wrought in Christ. This power is fourfold: resurrection power, transcending power, subjecting power, and heading-up power.<p>Now God as the Father in His love is imparting this fourfold power to the believers. The more we fellowship with Him and allow Him to abide in us, the more this power is infused and transfused into our being. At certain times we may be troubled, burdened, depressed, and oppressed. Nevertheless, if we spend time with our loving Father, we shall be strengthened through His imparting His great power into our being. Then we shall be uplifted and raised up from depression and from the suppression of the enemy. This is our experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in the triune dispensing.<h2 class=head4>(10) Operating in Them Both the Willing and the Working for His Good Pleasure</h2><p>God also operates in the believers both the willing and the working for His good pleasure. Philippians 2:13 says, &#8220;It is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.&#8221; The book of Philippians shows us the way to experience Christ. This verse tells us that for us to experience Christ, God operates in us both the willing inwardly and the working outwardly so that we may live Christ as our life for God&#8217;s good pleasure. The Greek word rendered &#8220;operates&#8221; here means energizes. The indwelling God energizes us from within to be the source, power, strength, and energy for us to experience Christ.<p>In 2:13 Paul tells us that God operates in us &#8220;both the willing and the working.&#8221; This willing must take place in our will. This indicates that God&#8217;s operation begins from our spirit and spreads into our mind, emotion, and will. God&#8217;s operating to will in us involves not only our spirit but also our will. Therefore, God&#8217;s operation must spread from our spirit into our will. As God operates the willing within us, He carries out His working. This corresponds to Romans 8, where we see that God works not only in our spirit but also in our mind and eventually in our physical body (vv. 6, 11). We will in our will, and we work in our body. God operates in us from our spirit, through our will, and then in our physical body.<p>God&#8217;s operating in us is for His good pleasure. His good pleasure is the heart&#8217;s desire of His will (Eph. 1:5) that we may reach the climax of His supreme salvation.<h2 class=head5>(a) Superabundantly above All That They Ask or Think</h2><p>God&#8217;s operating in the believers is superabundantly above all that they ask or think. In Ephesians 3:20 Paul says, &#8220;To Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us.&#8221; Strictly speaking, &#8220;ask or think&#8221; here refers to the spiritual things related to the church, not to material things. For these spiritual things we need not only to ask but also to think. We may think more than we ask. God fulfills not only what we ask for the church but also what we think concerning the church, and God is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think for the church.<p>Our asking and thinking should be focused on God&#8217;s economy to dispense Himself into us to produce the church as the expression of Christ. When our asking and thinking concern the church, God will always do superabundantly above all that we ask or think. We need to ask and think concerning Christ making His home in our hearts (Eph. 3:17) and concerning the church being filled unto all the fullness of God (v. 19). If we ask and think in this way, then whatever we ask or think concerning the church will be answered, and it will be answered superabundantly.<h2 class=head5>(b) According to the Power Which Operates in Them</h2><p>God&#8217;s operating superabundantly above all that the believers ask or think is according to the power which operates in them. Ephesians 3:20 speaks of the power which operates in the believers. This is inward power, as mentioned in Ephesians 1:19, and it is God&#8217;s resurrection power, not His creating power. God&#8217;s creating power makes the material things in our environment (Rom. 8:28), whereas His resurrection power accomplishes the spiritual things for the church within our inward being.<p>God&#8217;s ability to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us, as revealed in Ephesians 3:20, is different from His ability in creation. Paul&#8217;s concept here is related not to what God does outside of us but to what He does inside of us. For this reason, he specifically mentions &#8220;the power which operates in us.&#8221; This is the inward power, the resurrection power, according to which God operates in the believers both the willing and the working for His good pleasure. As we experience and enjoy God as our loving Father, He will operate in us superabundantly above all that we ask or think. Sometimes His operation may be limited by our little faith. However, at other times God may disregard the smallness of our faith and operate in us beyond our faith and superabundantly above all that we ask or think.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(21)</h1><p>In this message we shall consider some finer matters related to the believers&#8217; experiencing and enjoying God as the Father in His love.<h2 class=head4>(11) Making Them Live Together with Christ by His Power</h2><p>In 2 Corinthians 13:4b Paul says, &#8220;We shall live together with Him by the power of God toward you.&#8221; This indicates that God makes the believers live together with Christ by His power. Paul followed the pattern of Christ, willing to be weak in the organic union with Him, that he might live with Him a crucified life. In this way Paul lived together with Christ by the power of God.<p>We may think that our living together with Christ involves only Christ and us. Actually, our living together with Christ is not by us but by the Father&#8217;s power. Because the Father always wants to glorify the Son, to magnify Him, the Father lives in us to enable us to live together with Christ. By His power the Father enables us to live together with Christ.<h2 class=head4>(12) Reconciling Them, as Believers Living in the Natural Life, to Him</h2><p>God the Father reconciles us, as believers living in the natural life, to Him. In 2 Corinthians 5:19 Paul says, &#8220;God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not accounting their offenses to them, and putting in us the word of reconciliation.&#8221; In verse 20 he goes on to say, speaking to the believers, &#8220;On behalf of Christ, then, we are ambassadors, as God entreating through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God.&#8221; In verse 19 it is the world that is reconciled to God; in verse 20 it is the believers, who have already been reconciled to God, who need to be reconciled to God further. This clearly indicates that there are two steps for us to be fully reconciled to God. The first step is as sinners to be reconciled to God from sin. For this purpose Christ died for our sins (1 Cor. 15:3) that they may be forgiven by God. This is the objective aspect of Christ&#8217;s death. In this aspect He bore our sins on the cross that they might be judged by God upon Him for us. The second step is as believers living in the natural life to be reconciled to God from the flesh. For this purpose Christ died for us-the persons-that we may live to Him in the resurrection life (2 Cor. 5:14-15). This is the subjective aspect of Christ&#8217;s death. In this aspect He was made sin for us so that we might be judged and done away with by God in order that we may become the righteousness of God in Him (v. 21). By these two aspects of His death, He has fully reconciled God&#8217;s chosen people to God.<p>These two steps of reconciliation are clearly portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle. The first veil is called the screen (Exo. 26:37, lit.). A sinner was brought to God through the reconciliation of the atoning blood to enter into the Holy Place by passing this screen. This typifies the first step of reconciliation. The second veil (Exo. 26:31-35; Heb. 9:3) still separated him from God, who is in the Holy of Holies. This veil needed to be rent that he may be brought to God in the Holy of Holies. This is the second step of reconciliation. As believers we have been reconciled to God, having passed through the first veil and having entered into the Holy Place. Yet, because we still live in the flesh, we need to pass the second veil, which has been rent already (Matt. 27:51; Heb. 10:20), to enter into the Holy of Holies to live with God in our spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). This is what Paul means by saying, &#8220;Be reconciled to God.&#8221;<p>In the Old Testament, when a sinner came to God, he first had to come to the altar to have his sins forgiven through the blood of the sin offering. After experiencing the forgiveness of sins, he could enter the Holy Place. This is the first step of reconciliation, the step by which a sinner begins to be reconciled to God. This is the situation of most genuine Christians today. They have been reconciled to God in part through the cross upon which Christ died as our sin offering, where He shed His blood to wash away our sins. When we believed in Him, we were forgiven by God, reconciled to God, and brought back to Him. Formerly we went astray from God, but through repentance we returned to Him and have been reconciled to Him. However, we have been reconciled to God only partly.<p>Although the believers have been saved and reconciled to God partly, they still live in the flesh; that is, they live in the soul, in the natural life. The veil of the flesh, of the natural man, still separates them from God. This means that their natural being is a separating veil. Therefore, they need the second step of reconciliation, the step in which the separating veil of the flesh is crucified so that the believers may enter into the Holy of Holies.<p>The blessings of God can be found in the Holy Place, but God Himself is in the Holy of Holies. In order to have God Himself, we need to be reconciled further by Him and come into the Holy of Holies. This is full reconciliation, which brings us not only out of sin but also out of the flesh, the natural man, the natural being. Then we are brought to God and become one with Him.<p>Part of God the Father&#8217;s finer work in us is to reconcile us to Him in the second step. As those who have been reconciled to Him in the first step, we love the Lord and serve Him. However, we may love and serve Him in a natural way. Furthermore, we may be very active in the church life, but our living in the church is natural. This means that we live and have our being in a natural way. Therefore, God the Father works to reconcile us to Him in a fuller, deeper way. He exposes our natural life and unveils our real situation to us so that we may condemn our natural being and apply the cross subjectively. Then as our natural man is crossed out, we experience the second step of reconciliation. In this step the veil of our natural man is rent so that we may be in the Holy of Holies, living in God&#8217;s presence.<h2 class=head4>(13) Making Them His Righteousness in Christ</h2><p>God the Father also makes the believers His righteousness in Christ. Second Corinthians 5:21 says, &#8220;Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf, that we might become God&#8217;s righteousness in Him.&#8221; Eventually, those who have been brought back to God in the Holy of Holies will experience and enjoy Him in the triune dispensing to such an extent that they will even become His righteousness in Christ. Righteousness issues from God for His administration (Psa. 89:14; 97:2; Isa. 32:1), which is Christ to be our righteousness (Phil. 3:9; 1 Cor. 1:30), making us God&#8217;s righteousness in Him, not merely righteous before God. Through His redemption, man as a sinner, even as sin, is made God&#8217;s righteousness.<p>The phrase &#8220;in Him&#8221; in 2 Corinthians 5:21 means in union with Christ, not only positionally but organically in resurrection. We were enemies of God (Col. 1:21) by becoming sin, which came from the one who rebelled against God. Christ was made sin for us by becoming one with us through incarnation. God condemned Him in the flesh as sin for us, through His death, that we might be one with Him in His resurrection to be God&#8217;s righteousness. In the organic union with Christ, those who have been brought back thoroughly to God are made the righteousness of God. They not only become righteous; they are the righteousness of God. This means that they not only become righteous persons, but they become righteousness itself.<p>God desires to have a people on earth who are not only righteous persons; He wants a people, who, in the sight of God, the Devil, the angels, and the demons, are the very righteousness of God. To be made righteous before God is one thing; to be made God&#8217;s righteousness is another thing. Now we may enjoy God as the Father in His love to such an extent that in Christ we become God&#8217;s very righteousness.<h2 class=head4>(14) Sanctifying Them</h2><p>In the progressing stage of God&#8217;s full salvation, the stage of transformation, the believers may also experience and enjoy God as the Father in His love as He sanctifies them. This sanctification is not outward and positional but inward and dispositional. This dispositional sanctification involves our entire being and causes us to become a sanctified entity, a totality of the Father&#8217;s sanctification.<h2 class=head5>(a) In His Word</h2><p>The Father sanctifies the believers in His word. In John 17:17 the Lord Jesus prayed to the Father, &#8220;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.&#8221; The Father&#8217;s word carries with it the Father&#8217;s reality. For example, when the word says, &#8220;God is light,&#8221; it conveys God as light. Hence, it is the reality, the truth.<p>God&#8217;s living word works in the believers to separate them from anything worldly, separating them from the world and its occupation unto God and His purpose, not only positionally but also dispositionally. This is what it means to be sanctified by the Father&#8217;s word as the truth, the reality. This sanctification changes not only our position but also our disposition, our inward being.<h2 class=head5>(b) Wholly in Their Spirit, Soul, and Body</h2><p>The Father sanctifies the believers wholly in their spirit, soul, and body. First Thessalonians 5:23 says, &#8220;The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221; The word &#8220;sanctify&#8221; here means to be set apart; it is to be separated unto God from all things common or profane. The word &#8220;wholly&#8221; means entirely, thoroughly, to the consummation. God the Father sanctifies us wholly, so that no part of our being, either of our spirit or soul or body, will be left common or profane.<p>God not only sanctifies us wholly but also preserves our spirit, soul, and body complete. &#8220;Wholly&#8221; is quantitative; &#8220;complete&#8221; is qualitative. In quantity God sanctifies us wholly; in quality God preserves us complete, that is, He keeps our spirit, soul, and body perfect. Through the fall our body was ruined, our soul was contaminated, and our spirit was deadened. In God&#8217;s full salvation our entire being is saved and made perfect and complete. For this, God is preserving our spirit from any deadening element (Heb. 9:14), our soul from remaining natural and old (Matt. 16:24-26), and our body from the ruin of sin (1 Thes. 4:4; Rom. 6:6). Such a preservation by God and His thorough sanctification will sustain the believers to live a holy life unto maturity.<h2 class=head4>(15) Giving Life to Their Mortal Bodies by the Indwelling Spirit</h2><p>Romans 8:11 says, &#8220;If the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&#8221; Here we see that God the Father gives life to our mortal bodies by the indwelling Spirit. Romans 8:10 says that our spirit is life because of righteousness, and verse 6 tells us that the mind set on the spirit is life. Furthermore, if the Spirit dwells in us, making His home in us, God the Father will give life to our mortal bodies. When we put together verses 10, 6, and 11, we see that not only is our spirit life and our mind life if it is set on the spirit, but life may also be given to our mortal bodies by God the Father through the indwelling Spirit. First, our spirit becomes life through regeneration. Then if we are faithful to set our mind on our spirit, our mind also will become life. This will open the way for God through the Spirit to give life to our mortal bodies. This indicates that our entire tripartite being can become life or receive the supply of the divine life.<p>Those who are experienced in the Lord care much more for the Father&#8217;s giving life to their mortal bodies than for so-called miraculous healing. They pay their full attention to the matter of the inner life supply. Such believers are deep and care for the inward working of the loving Father. Spontaneously, the Father imparts the divine life through His indwelling Spirit into their weak, mortal bodies. This is not a matter of outward, miraculous healing; it is a matter of the inward strengthening in life to swallow up the death factor, the death element, in a believer&#8217;s body. The imparting of life to our mortal bodies is part of the Father&#8217;s finer and deeper work in the believers.<h2 class=head4>(16) Revealing to Them through the Spirit What He Has Prepared for Them- the Deep Things concerning Christ</h2><p>As the Father operates in the believers, sanctifying them and imparting life to them, He reveals to them through the Spirit what He has prepared for them-the deep things concerning Christ for their experience. Paul refers to these things in 1 Corinthians 2:9, where he says, &#8220;Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, and which have not come up in man&#8217;s heart, how much God has prepared for those who love Him.&#8221; Here we see that to realize and participate in the deep and hidden things God has ordained and prepared for us requires us not only to believe in Him but also to love Him. To love God means to set our entire being-spirit, soul, and body, with the heart, soul, mind, and strength (Mark 12:30)-absolutely on Him, that is, to let our entire being be occupied by Him and lost in Him, so that He becomes everything to us and we are one with Him practically in our daily life. In this way we have the closest and most intimate fellowship with God. It is thus we are able to enter into His heart and apprehend all its secrets (Psa. 73:25; 25:14). Thus, we not only realize but also experience, enjoy, and fully participate in these deep and hidden things of God.<p>In 1 Corinthians 2:10 Paul, referring to these deep and hidden things, says, &#8220;God has revealed them to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.&#8221; God reveals the deep and hidden things to us through the Spirit, for these things have not been seen by man&#8217;s eyes, heard by man&#8217;s ears, nor have they come up in man&#8217;s heart. This means that man has no idea concerning them, no thought of them. They are altogether mysterious, hidden in God, and beyond human understanding. But God has revealed them to us through the Spirit, who searches all things, even the depths of God. When our entire being becomes one with God through loving Him in intimate fellowship, He shows us, in our spirit through His Spirit, all the secrets of Christ as our portion.<p>First Corinthians 2:10 says that the Spirit searches all things. The Greek word translated &#8220;searches&#8221; includes active research and implies accurate knowledge not in discovering but in exploring. The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation.<p>The depths of God refer to the deep things of God, which are Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion, foreordained, prepared, and given to us freely by God. Therefore, to know the depths of God is to know Christ as our portion. Christ is the center of God&#8217;s economy, the portion given to us by God for our enjoyment. Christ, the all-inclusive and extensive One, is truly the depths of God. Through the Spirit, God the Father reveals to us the deep things concerning Christ.<h2 class=head4>(17) Giving Them Growth in Life</h2><p>As we experience and enjoy God the Father in His love, He gives us growth in life. In 1 Corinthians 3:6 and 7 Paul says, &#8220;I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow; so that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One who makes to grow, God.&#8221; Planting, watering, and making to grow are all related to the matter of life. This indicates clearly that the believers are God&#8217;s farm to grow Christ (v. 9). The ministers of Christ can plant and water. God is the only One who can make to grow. As far as the growth in life is concerned, all the ministers of Christ, whether a planter or a waterer, are nothing, and God is everything. For this reason, in 3:6 and 7 Paul emphasizes the fact that it is God alone who makes to grow.<p>We may plant and water, but we have neither the ability nor the substance to cause others to grow. Growth comes from God alone. Whenever He comes in, He causes us to grow. Since it is God who makes to grow, we must leave the matter of growth to Him. Our responsibility is to plant and water, not to help others grow. If we try to help others grow, we overstep our responsibility. It is beyond our capacity to cause the believers to grow. None of us can produce growth in others. Not even Paul was able to make the saints grow. He was very clear that we can plant and water, but only God gives the growth.<p>Although planting and watering are important, the greatest need is growth. We can plant and water, but God alone makes to grow. As far as the growth in life is concerned, God is everything. Because only God can make to grow, in our planting and watering we must be one with the Triune God. This means that we need to carry out the planting and watering in the organic union with the Lord. Then whenever we plant and water, He will plant in our planting and water in our watering. As a result, we shall have the full assurance that when we plant and water, God will make to grow. Thus, after planting and watering, we should be at rest and not try to help others grow. Growth is not of us; it is altogether of God. Through the church life and our watering, God will supply the believers and enable them to grow in life.<h2 class=head4>(18) Strengthening Them, according to the Riches of His Glory, with Power through His Spirit into the Inner Man, That Christ May Make His Home in Their Hearts through Faith</h2><p>The Father also strengthens the believers, according to the riches of His glory, with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in their hearts through faith (Eph. 3:16-17). The inner man is our regenerated spirit with God&#8217;s life as its life. It is our spirit regenerated by the Spirit of God (John 3:6), indwelt by the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:11, 16), and mingled with the Spirit of God (1 Cor. 6:17). The Father strengthens our entire being into our inner man, into our regenerated spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit, that Christ may make His home, settle Himself deep down, in our hearts through faith. This is the Father&#8217;s finer work in us, and this is a much deeper experience in the Triune God.<p>In Ephesians 3:16 the word &#8220;strengthened&#8221; is modified by four phrases: &#8220;according to the riches of His glory,&#8221; &#8220;with power,&#8221; &#8220;through His Spirit,&#8221; and &#8220;into the inner man.&#8221; First, the believers are strengthened according to the riches of the Father&#8217;s glory. Glory is the expression of God. The Father strengthens us for the purpose of His expression. Second, the Father strengthens us with power, the resurrection power which operates in us (3:20). Furthermore, the Father strengthens us by the indwelling Spirit. Finally, the Father strengthens us into our inner man in order that we may experience Christ unto all the fullness of God.<p>The goal of the Father&#8217;s strengthening us into the inner man is that Christ may make His home in our hearts. When we were saved, Christ came into our spirit. Now we need to give Him the opportunity to spread Himself throughout all the parts of our inner being. As the Father strengthens us into the inner man, the door is opened for Christ to spread in us, to spread from our spirit into every part of our mind, emotion, and will. The more Christ spreads within us, the more He settles down in us and makes His home in us. This means that He occupies every part of our inner being, possessing all these parts and saturating them with Himself. As a result, we are filled with Christ unto all the fullness of God.<h2 class=head4>(19) Making Them His Poem</h2><p>Ephesians 2:10a says, &#8220;We are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;workmanship&#8221; here may also be rendered &#8220;masterpiece.&#8221; The Greek word poiema means something which has been made, a handiwork, or something which has been written or composed as a poem. This indicates that God is making the believers His poem. Poetry does not consist only of poetic writing; any work of art that expresses the maker&#8217;s wisdom and design may be considered a poem. We, the church, the masterpiece of God&#8217;s work, are the highest poetry, expressing God&#8217;s infinite wisdom and divine design.<p>Writers, composers, and artists often attempt to achieve a masterpiece, an outstanding work. God created the heavens and the earth, but neither the heavens nor the earth is God&#8217;s masterpiece. Likewise, God created man, but not even man is God&#8217;s masterpiece. Only one item of God&#8217;s work in this universe is His masterpiece, His poem, and this poem is the church.<p>Ephesians 2:10 says that we are God&#8217;s workmanship, God&#8217;s poem, &#8220;created in Christ Jesus.&#8221; As the masterpiece of God&#8217;s work, we are an absolutely new item in the universe, something newly originated by God. We have been created by God in Christ through regeneration to be His new creation (2 Cor. 5:17). God&#8217;s poem is absolutely new because it is the mingling of God and man. God&#8217;s masterpiece is the working of Himself into man and the constituting of man into oneness with Himself to produce a marvelous poem.<p>The church is God&#8217;s poem to express God&#8217;s wisdom and design. According to Ephesians 3:10, God&#8217;s manifold wisdom will be made known through the church. Hymns express the wisdom of the hymn writers. In the ages to come, in the millennium and in eternity, there will be a unique hymn, the church, which expresses the wisdom and design of God. When we see the New Jerusalem, we may extol God for the beauty, wisdom, and design manifested in this marvelous production. The New Jerusalem will be God&#8217;s poem, His masterpiece. Today as the believers experience and enjoy God the Father in His love through the triune dispensing, He makes them His poem.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(22)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover more aspects of the experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in His love.<h2 class=head4>(20) Giving Grace to Them according to the Operation of His Power, to Preach the Unsearchable Riches of Christ as the Gospel, and to Bring to Light What Is His Economy of the Mystery Hidden in Him, That Is, to Have the Church</h2><p>The Father gives grace to the believers according to the operation of His power, to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel, and to bring to light what is His economy of the mystery hidden in Him, that is, to have the church (Eph. 3:7-10). God&#8217;s giving grace to the believers is a matter of His dispensing Himself into them, and this dispensing is according to the operation of His power. Because Paul received such an inner dispensing of God as grace, he could preach the unsearchable riches of Christ, and he could bring to light the mystery hidden in God. Through God&#8217;s dispensing Himself into us as grace, we also are able to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel and bring to light God&#8217;s economy of the mystery hidden in Himself. This mystery is to have the church.<p>In Ephesians 3:7 Paul says, &#8220;I became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God, which was given to me according to the operation of His power.&#8221; The grace of God is God Himself, especially as life, partaken of and enjoyed by us, whereas the gift of grace is the ability and function produced out of the enjoyment of the grace of God. Hence, grace implies life, and the gift is the ability that comes out of life.<p>The grace in 3:7 is nothing less than God Himself given to us, gained by us, and enjoyed by us. In Christ and through Christ we receive God, and God becomes our enjoyment. Therefore, grace is God Himself as our enjoyment. Dispensing this grace into others is our ministry according to God&#8217;s economy. Because we partake of God as our enjoyment, we can dispense Him as grace into others.<p>In 3:7 Paul tells us that grace was given to him according to the operation of God&#8217;s power. This is the power of the resurrection (Phil. 3:10), which operates within the apostle and all the believers (Eph. 1:19; 3:20). By such an inward operating power of life, the gift of grace was given to the apostle, that is, produced in him. As members of Christ, we all have the power of God operating within us to produce a certain ability. This ability is the gift that makes us ministers to impart God as grace to others.<p>In 3:8 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the nations the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.&#8221; This indicates that all the saints can receive such grace as was given to the Apostle Paul. As to the person of Paul, he was the least among the apostles (1 Cor. 15:9), but as to his ministry he was not behind the chiefest apostles (2 Cor. 11:5; 12:11). Yet, as to the grace he received, he was less than the least of all saints. This implies that all the saints can receive the grace which Paul received. This can be compared to all the members of our physical body, however small they may be, receiving the same life blood, but the ability (gift) that comes out of the life blood differs with the members. All the members of the Body of Christ can have the same grace of life as Paul, but their gifts are not the same as Paul&#8217;s.<p>According to 3:8, the grace is given that we may preach the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel. Our ministry is not to present doctrine nor simply to teach the Word in letters. Our ministry is to preach Christ with His unsearchable riches to others.<p>The preaching of the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel is for the producing of the church. The church as the Body of Christ is brought forth out of the unsearchable riches of Christ, not out of doctrines or systems of organization. As the Body of Christ the church can be brought forth only out of the untraceable riches of what Christ is.<p>In Ephesians 3:9-10 Paul continues, &#8220;And to bring to light what is the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things; in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the church the multifarious wisdom of God.&#8221; God&#8217;s mystery is His hidden purpose. His purpose is to dispense Himself into His chosen people. Hence, there is the dispensation (economy-arrangement, plan) of the mystery of God. This mystery was hidden in God from the ages, that is, from eternity and through all past ages, but now it has been brought to light to the New Testament believers.<p>The church mentioned in verse 10 is produced out of the unsearchable riches of Christ spoken of in verse 8. When God&#8217;s chosen people partake of and enjoy the riches of Christ, these riches constitute them the church, through which God&#8217;s multifarious wisdom is made known to the angelic rulers and authorities in the heavenlies. Hence, the church is God&#8217;s wise exhibition of all that Christ is.<h2 class=head4>(21) Making Them Sufficient for the New Testament Ministry</h2><p>As the Father dispenses Himself into the believers as grace to enable them to preach the all-inclusive Christ and to make known the mystery hidden in God, He makes them sufficient for the New Testament ministry. This sufficiency is of God the Father by His dispensing.<p>In 2 Corinthians 3:5 Paul says, &#8220;Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to account anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;sufficient&#8221; also means competent, qualified, fit, worthy. The word for &#8220;sufficiency&#8221; also means competency, qualification. Here we see that the living God Himself is the sufficiency, competency, and qualification of the ministry for God&#8217;s New Testament economy to dispense Christ into God&#8217;s chosen people for the building up of Christ&#8217;s Body. We ourselves are of no account, and what we can do is likewise of no account. Only the Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit constituted into us is sufficient to carry on the ministry of the New Testament.<p>In 2 Corinthians 3:6 Paul, speaking of God, goes on to say, &#8220;Who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, not of letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;made&#8221; also means enabled, qualified, made competent. The phrase &#8220;not of letter&#8221; modifies ministers; it does not modify covenant. By &#8220;letter&#8221; Paul means the written code of the law. The Spirit is the Spirit of the living God, with whom the apostle ministers Christ into the believers. The apostolic ministry for the New Testament is not of dead letters like the Mosaic ministry for the Old Testament but of the living Spirit, who gives life.<p>We should not think that only the apostles are sufficient for the New Testament ministry. We all are ministering ones, and God has made us competent to minister. God has made us competent ministers not of a covenant of letters but of a covenant of the Spirit. Therefore, we all need to have, and we all can have, a share in the New Testament ministry. In order to have this ministry, we need to have the experience of being constituted of the living Spirit. Then we shall be ministers not of letter, doctrine, or theology; instead, we shall be ministers of the living Spirit. This is a matter of the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity.<h2 class=head4>(22) Leading Them in Christ&#8217;s Triumphal Procession in Their Ministry and Manifesting through Them the Fragrance of Christ</h2><p>God the Father leads the believers in Christ&#8217;s triumphal procession in their ministry and manifests through them the fragrance of Christ. In 2 Corinthians 2:14 and 15 Paul says, &#8220;Thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and manifests through us the savor of the knowledge of Him in every place; for we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing.&#8221; Here Paul uses the metaphor of a triumphal procession. Often after a general of the Roman army had won a victory, he would march through the capital with his captives in a procession to celebrate his victory. Paul uses this metaphor to illustrate how Christ is the victorious general and how Paul and all believers are His captives. God is leading a triumphal procession of Christ&#8217;s captives to celebrate Christ&#8217;s victory.<p>The Greek verb rendered &#8220;leads us in triumph&#8221; as used in 2:14 means &#8220;to lead a man as a captive in a triumphal procession; the full phrase means, to lead captive in a triumph over the enemies of Christ....God is celebrating His triumph over His enemies; Paul (who had been so great an opponent of the gospel) is a captive following in the train of the triumphal procession, yet (at the same time, by a characteristic change of metaphor) an incense-bearer, scattering incense (which was always done on these occasions) as the procession moves on. Some of the conquered enemies were put to death when the procession reached the Capitol; to them the smell of incense was an odor of death unto death; to the rest who were spared, an odor of life unto life&#8221; (Conybeare). God always leads the apostles in such a triumphant way for their ministry. God&#8217;s leading is actually His dispensing of Himself into the apostles.<p>As Paul and his co-workers traveled in the Gentile world for the preaching of the gospel, they were moving in Christ&#8217;s triumphal procession. This was the result of the Father&#8217;s dispensing. Through the Father&#8217;s intimate dispensing, the dispensing of Himself in love, He enables the believers to preach the high gospel of the unsearchable riches of Christ and to make known the hidden mystery, which is God&#8217;s intention to have the church, He makes them sufficient for the New Testament ministry, and He leads them in Christ&#8217;s triumphal procession in their ministry.<p>In 2 Corinthians 2:14 Paul also likened himself and his co-workers to incense-bearers scattering the savor of the knowledge of Christ in His triumphant ministry as in a triumphal procession. The apostles are such incense-bearers in their ministry of Christ as well as captives in the train of His triumph. Concerning the phrase &#8220;the savor of the knowledge,&#8221; Vincent says, &#8220;According to the Greek usage, savor and knowledge are in apposition, so that the knowledge &#8221;of Christ is symbolized as an odor communicating its nature and efficacy through the apostle&#8217;s work.&#8221;<p>In verse 15 Paul says, &#8220;We are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing.&#8221; The apostles, being permeated with Christ, became a fragrance of Christ. They are not merely a sweet savor produced by Christ, but Christ Himself is the savor being exhaled in their life and work to God, both in those who are being saved, as a savor of life to life, and in those who are perishing, as a savor from death to death (v. 16).<p>The apostles were a fragrance of Christ to God because they were saturated and permeated by Christ and with Christ. When they spoke to others, the Christ of whom they were constituted came forth out of their being as a sweet fragrance to God for His enjoyment. This should also be our experience today. While we are speaking for Christ, He should come forth as a sweet fragrance out from our being. God enjoys this fragrance. This also is a matter of the Father&#8217;s intimate dispensing.<h2 class=head4>(23) Having Mercy upon Them</h2><p>As the believers experience and enjoy God as the Father in His love, He has mercy on them. Paul&#8217;s experience in Philippians 2 indicates that the Father&#8217;s having mercy on us is also a matter of His dispensing. In verse 25 Paul told the Philippians, &#8220;I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, but your apostle and priestly minister to my need.&#8221; This reveals that Epaphroditus was intimately related both to the Philippians and to Paul. He was their apostle, one sent with a commission, and he was a priestly minister to Paul&#8217;s need, for in ministering to Paul&#8217;s physical need he served as a priest. In verse 26 Paul says of Epaphroditus, &#8220;He was longing after you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.&#8221; However, Paul did not exercise his healing gift. Instead, he experienced and enjoyed the Father&#8217;s mercy in His dispensing. For this reason, in verse 27 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;Indeed he was sick, very near to death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but also on me that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.&#8221; At the juncture where Epaphroditus was very near to death, God had mercy on him and also on Paul. Epaphroditus was healed gradually, not by a miracle but by God&#8217;s mercy. Thus, Paul did not say, &#8220;God performed a great miracle,&#8221; but said, &#8220;God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but also on me.&#8221; From this we see that Paul and his fellow workers were continually under the dispensing of the loving God. They enjoyed healing as a mercy from God. If it were not for God&#8217;s mercy, Epaphroditus would have died. But through God&#8217;s mercy he lived, and Paul could send him to the Philippians. This mercy is a matter of the dispensing of the divine element into the believers.<p>Those who experience a miraculous healing may not enjoy God&#8217;s dispensing. Even though such ones are healed, there is no change in their life, no change in their being. However, the healing experienced by Epaphroditus was a mercy from God in His dispensing. This means that the healing of Epaphroditus was God&#8217;s mercy dispensed into him and also into Paul. After this dispensing, neither Epaphroditus nor Paul was the same. This is indicated by Paul&#8217;s tone in these verses. The tone in which Paul expresses himself here indicates that he was a divine person. Paul and Epaphroditus were under the divine dispensing, and this dispensing caused them to become divine.<h2 class=head4>(24) Encouraging, Comforting, Them through Christ That They May Encourage, Comfort, Others</h2><p>God the Father also encourages, comforts, the believers through Christ that they may encourage, comfort, others (2 Cor. 1:4-5; 2 Thes. 2:16-17a). God&#8217;s encouraging is His comforting, His dispensing. Through His encouraging He dispenses Himself into us. Some divine element is dispensed into us with which we can encourage, comfort, others. It is not adequate to comfort a troubled believer simply by speaking words of encouragement. In order to encourage others and comfort them, we need to impart to them the divine element which we have received of God, and this element will become in them the element of encouragement and comfort.<p>In 2 Corinthians 1:3 and 4 Paul says, &#8220;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions and God of all encouragement; who encourages us in all our affliction, that we may be able to encourage those who are in every affliction through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged by God.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;compassions&#8221; also means mercies, pity, sympathy. Encouragement is slightly different from comfort and consolation and has the sense of being cheered. Such a title as the Father of compassions and God of all encouragement is ascribed here to God because 2 Corinthians is a book of comfort and encouragement.<p>In verse 4 Paul says that we encourage those in affliction through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged by God. First we must experience the encouragement of God. Then we shall be able to encourage others with the encouragement we have experienced of God. Hence, we are encouraged so that we may be able to encourage others. This requires experience. When we are experienced, we have the spiritual capital necessary for encouraging others.<p>This encouragement, this comfort, is related to God&#8217;s dispensing. We are encouraged by God, comforted by Him, through His dispensing. God is dispensing Himself into us, and this dispensing is His encouraging, His comforting.<p>As indicated by the record in 2 Corinthians, while Paul and his co-workers were suffering for the sake of the gospel, the Triune God was dispensing Himself into them, and this dispensing became their encouragement and comfort. Furthermore, through their experience of being encouraged through the divine dispensing, they had the riches with which to comfort others. Their comforting of others was also a matter of dispensing. As the apostles were encouraging the saints, they were dispensing into them the riches of the Triune God that they themselves were enjoying.<p>In 1:5 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;Because even as the sufferings of the Christ abound unto us, so through the Christ our encouragement also abounds.&#8221; The sufferings here are not the sufferings for Christ but Christ&#8217;s own sufferings as shared by His disciples (Matt. 20:22; Phil. 3:10; Col. 1:24; 1 Pet. 4:13). &#8220;The Christ&#8221; in 2 Corinthians 1:5 is a designation of the condition of Christ, not a name (Darby). Here it refers to the suffering Christ who suffered afflictions for His Body according to God&#8217;s will. The apostles participated in the sufferings of such a Christ, and through such a Christ they received encouragement. Through Christ they experienced the divine riches and thereby were able to dispense the Triune God into others who were suffering for the Lord&#8217;s sake. Today we also may enjoy the divine dispensing for our encouragement and comfort and then dispense the divine riches into others for their encouragement and comfort.<h2 class=head4>(25) Guarding Their Hearts and Thoughts in Christ</h2><p>Philippians 4:7 says, &#8220;The peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.&#8221; This guarding of our hearts and thoughts is a matter of the Father&#8217;s intimate dispensing. Through the divine dispensing the peace of God guards our hearts and thoughts in Christ Jesus. The peace of God is actually God Himself as peace (v. 9), infused into us through our fellowship with Him by prayer. This peace is the counterpoise of troubles and the antidote to anxiety (John 16:33).<p>Bad news or difficult situations may cause us to worry or to be anxious. We find the antidote to this anxiety when we pray, practice communion with God, and enjoy the Father&#8217;s dispensing in His love. Then spontaneously, even unconsciously, the peace of God is transfused into our inner being. This transfused peace becomes the counterpoise of trouble and becomes the antidote to anxiety. From experience we know that through prayer we receive the antidote to anxiety when the peace of God is infused into us. Having the peace of God as the counterpoise to our troubles does not mean that the troubles will disappear. The troubles remain, but we have a counterpoise. Furthermore, the poison of anxiety is still within us, but we have an antidote-the peace of God transfused into our being through our fellowship with God in prayer. When we enjoy God as our peace, we are made calm within.<p>In Philippians 4:7 Paul says that the peace of God will guard our hearts and our thoughts in Christ Jesus. The Greek word rendered &#8220;guard&#8221; may also be translated &#8220;mount guard over.&#8221; The God of peace patrols or stands guard before our hearts and thoughts in Christ. The heart is the source, and the thoughts are the issue. The peace of God guards both our hearts and our thoughts. This means that in Christ Jesus the peace of God patrols as a guard who goes back and forth before our hearts and our thoughts. The peace of God which patrols within our inner being in such a way keeps us calm and tranquil. Even though we may have many troubles and much anxiety, nothing will disturb us. From experience we know that the peace of God infused into us through His dispensing keeps us calm. This is truly an experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in His love.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(23)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover more aspects of the believers&#8217; experiencing and enjoying, in the progressing stage of God&#8217;s salvation, God as the Father in His love.<h2 class=head4>(26) Taking Care of Their Necessities</h2><p>The Father takes care of the believers&#8217; necessities. In Matthew 6:32 the Lord Jesus, referring to the necessities of life, says, &#8220;All these things the nations are seeking; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.&#8221; The believers have the life of their heavenly Father, and they also have the Father Himself to care for their material needs, so that they need not be anxious about them. Their heavenly Father is the source of their strength and supply. Hence, they need not be weak or lacking in anything.<p>In Matthew 6:33 the Lord goes on to say, &#8220;Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.&#8221; The Father&#8217;s kingdom is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today and the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the coming age. The Father&#8217;s righteousness is the righteousness by keeping the new law of the kingdom, as mentioned in Matthew 5:20 and 6:1. Since the believers seek first the kingdom and righteousness of their heavenly Father, not only will His kingdom and His righteousness be given to them, but also all their necessities will be added.<p>As God the Father takes care of our necessities, we enjoy His dispensing. We trust in Him for our needs, and He cares for us. What we enjoy is not mainly the Father&#8217;s outward provision but His inward dispensing. As He takes care of our material needs, He dispenses His element into us. Then we experience the divine dispensing through the Father&#8217;s care for our physical necessities.<h2 class=head4>(27) Not Letting Them Be Tempted beyond What They Are Able, but with the Temptation Making the Way Out That They May Be Able to Endure It</h2><p>First Corinthians 10:13 says, &#8220;No temptation has taken you except that which is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not let you be tempted beyond what you are able, but will with the temptation make also the way out, that you may be able to endure it.&#8221; Some believers may think that temptations are too strong to be resisted. But here Paul points out that no temptation has taken us except that which is common to man. He also says that God is faithful and will not allow us to be tempted beyond what we are able to bear, but with the temptation will provide a way out so that we may be able to endure it. This is a word of promise and of encouragement. However, it leaves the responsibility for being tempted with us, not with God. When we are tempted, we should never blame God for the temptation. According to this verse, the responsibility for being tempted rests with us. At the same time, we may be encouraged to know that the faithful God will provide a way out for us. God&#8217;s not letting us be tempted beyond what we are able and providing a way out so that we may be able to endure temptation is also a matter of His dispensing.<p>Whenever we are tempted, we may stand on 1 Corinthians 10:13 and say, &#8220;Lord, You will not let me be tempted beyond what I am able, but with the temptation You will make the way out so that I may be able to endure it.&#8221; When we pray to the Lord in this way, telling Him that He knows how much we can endure, He will make a way out by His dispensing that we may be able to endure temptation.<h2 class=head4>(28) Disciplining Them That They Might Partake of His Holiness</h2><p>The Father disciplines the believers that they might partake of His holiness. Referring to the Hebrew believers&#8217; suffering of persecution, Hebrews 12:5-11 considers this persecution as God the Father&#8217;s discipline of the believers, who are God&#8217;s genuine sons (v. 7). &#8220;Whom the Lord loves He disciplines and scourges every son whom He receives&#8221; (v. 6), and all the believers as God&#8217;s sons have become partakers of the Father&#8217;s discipline (v. 8). As sons of God, we should respect the Father as a discipliner and be much in subjection to Him who is the Father of our spirits, so that we may live (v. 9). The Father disciplines us for our profit that we might partake of His holiness (v. 10), which is the characteristic of His holy nature. This is God our Father&#8217;s work in dealing with us as His sons. His work of making us holy is related to the Spirit&#8217;s transformation work (2 Cor. 3:18), which is carried out through the divine dispensing inwardly and the environmental dealings outwardly.<p>The Father&#8217;s disciplining of the believers involves His dispensing. As He disciplines us, He dispenses His holy nature into our being. Thus, through this dispensing we become partakers of His holiness.<p>Hebrews 12:11 goes on to tell us that &#8220;indeed all discipline for the present does not seem to be a matter of joy but of grief; but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it.&#8221; The Father&#8217;s discipline is for holiness resulting in righteousness and peace. God&#8217;s discipline not only makes us to partake of His holiness but also yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness. Peace is the fruit of righteousness (Isa. 32:17). Holiness refers to the inward nature, whereas righteousness refers to the outward behavior, that is, to be right outwardly both with God and man so that in such a situation of righteousness we may enjoy peace as a sweet fruit, a peaceable fruit of righteousness.<p>If we have not been permeated inwardly with God&#8217;s holy nature, we cannot have the proper righteousness in our outward behavior. First, God works His holy nature into us. Then in our outward behavior we shall have the peaceable fruit of righteousness as the issue of inward holiness. In our practical experience, therefore, holiness is first, righteousness is second, and peace is third.<h2 class=head4>(29) Guarding Them from Stumbling and Making Them without Blemish</h2><p>By the divine dispensing the Father guards the believers from stumbling and makes them without blemish. Jude 24 says, &#8220;To Him who is able to guard you from stumbling, and to set you before His glory without blemish in exultation.&#8221; Here the writer indicates clearly that although he has charged the believers to endeavor in the things mentioned in verses 20 through 23, yet only God our Savior is able to guard them from stumbling and to set them before His glory without blemish in exultation. Glory here is the glory of the great God and our Savior, Christ Jesus, which will be manifested at His appearing (Titus 2:13; 1 Pet. 4:13) and in which He will come (Luke 9:26). The preposition &#8220;in&#8221; here means in the element of, and &#8220;exultation&#8221; signifies the exuberance of triumphant joy (Alford).<h2 class=head4>(30) Judging Them First</h2><p>The Epistle of 1 Peter speaks of the Christian life under the government of God, which is carried out by God&#8217;s judgment. In His governmental judgment God judges the believers first. For this reason, 1 Peter 4:17 says, &#8220;It is time for the judgment to begin from the house of God; and if first from us, what will be the end of those who disobey the gospel of God?&#8221; According to the context, the sufferings the believers undergo in fiery persecution are used by God as a means to judge them that they may be disciplined, purified, and separated from the unbelievers and not have the same destiny as unbelievers. Hence, such disciplinary judgment begins from God&#8217;s own household. God&#8217;s house, or household, is the church composed of the believers (1 Pet. 2:5; Heb. 3:6; 1 Tim. 3:15; Eph. 2:19). From this house, as His own house, God begins His governmental administration by His disciplinary judgment over His own children, that He may have a strong ground to judge, in His universal kingdom, those who are disobedient to His gospel and rebellious to His government. This is for the establishment of His kingdom.<p>The judgment in 4:17 is not for condemnation to eternal perdition. It is a judgment for discipline, a dispensational discipline to purify our life. This judgment is a fiery ordeal, a burning furnace (v. 12), to purify us and remove any dross. We can be compared to gold, but we still have a certain amount of dross from which we need to be purified. No teaching or fellowship can accomplish this purification. The disciplinary judgment of the burning furnace is necessary to carry it out. Therefore, God puts the believers into a burning furnace, into fiery ordeals, to burn away the dross. This is regarded by Peter as a judgment in God&#8217;s governmental dealing with the believers.<p>We need to be deeply impressed from 4:17 that judgment begins with the household of God. This is God&#8217;s governmental administration carried out by His disciplinary judgment over His own children. Today all of us are under God&#8217;s judgment. God is not only gracing us, giving us grace; He is also judging us. This is the reason we have many sufferings. We have sufferings because God is judging us. On the one hand, God is gracing us to live a life that suits His righteousness under His judgment. On the other hand, He judges anything that does not match His government. Therefore, in this age we the believers are under the daily judgment of God. However, even God&#8217;s judging the believers is a matter of His dispensing.<h2 class=head4>(31) Crushing Satan under Their Feet</h2><p>Romans 16:20 reveals that God crushes Satan under the feet of the believers: &#8220;The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.&#8221; To the believers, even the crushing of Satan is a matter of God&#8217;s dispensing.<p>According to the context of Romans 16, the crushing of Satan by God is related to the church life. If we are not in the church and do not practice the church life, it will be difficult for us to have Satan crushed under our feet by God. The church life is the strongest means by which God overcomes Satan. Whenever we are separated from the church, we become a prey for Satan, for it is difficult for us to fight Satan individually. But when we are in the church and are one with the Body, Satan is under our feet, and through the divine dispensing we enjoy God as the God of peace in the church life.<p>The Greek word rendered &#8220;your&#8221; in 16:20 is plural; this points to the Body. God will crush Satan under the feet of the Body. Romans 16 does not refer to the Body in a universal sense, but refers to the local and practical expression of the Body. This indicates that Satan can be crushed only under the feet of the practical expression of the Body in the local churches. It is only when we have a proper local church as the practical expression of the Body that Satan is crushed under our feet.<p>Both the Body and the divine life are crucial in God&#8217;s crushing of Satan under the believers&#8217; feet. Life is nothing less than the Triune God dispensed into us to be our content. According to the book of Romans, life and the Body are one; they are inseparable. If there were no life, then there could be no Body. Life is the content, and the Body is the expression. The practical expression of the Body in the local churches is possible only through the divine life. We may have the experience of redemption and salvation, but if we do not experience the dispensing of God into us as life, it will be impossible to have the practical expression of the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is built up with Christ as life. God crushes Satan under our feet by the divine life and by the Body.<p>It is significant that the One who crushes Satan under our feet is the God of peace. The God of peace and the peace of God are one. When God is dispensed into us, peace is dispensed into us also, for the genuine peace we enjoy is God Himself. We trust in God, and He crushes Satan under our feet. As God crushes Satan under our feet in the church life, we have the peace of God as a token of this victory over him. Through the divine dispensing, both the crushing of Satan and the peace of God are experienced by the believers in the church life.<h2 class=head4>(32) Answering Their Cry and Avenging Them</h2><p>The believers experience and enjoy God as the Father in His love by His answering their cry and avenging them. The parable of persistent prayer in Luke 18:1-8 indicates this. The unrighteous judge (vv. 6-7) refers to the righteous God, and the widow (v. 3) signifies the believers. In a sense, the believers in Christ are a widow in the present age because their Husband Christ (2 Cor. 11:2) is absent from them. The believers in Christ also have an opponent, Satan the Devil, concerning whom we need God&#8217;s avenging. We ought to pray persistently for this avenging and not lose heart.<p>This parable indicates the suffering we have from our opponent during the Lord&#8217;s apparent absence. During His apparent absence, we are a widow, and our opposer is troubling us all the time. While our opposer is persecuting us, it seems that our God is not righteous, for He allows His children to be unrighteously persecuted. Throughout the centuries thousands upon thousands of faithful followers of the Lord Jesus have suffered unrighteous persecution. Even today we are still undergoing unrighteous mistreatment. Our God seems to be unrighteous, since He does not immediately come in to judge and vindicate. When our Husband is apparently absent and we are left on earth as a widow, temporarily our God seems to be an unrighteous judge. Although He appears to be unrighteous, we still must appeal to Him, pray persistently, and bother Him again and again. Eventually, God will answer our cry and avenge us. &#8220;God, shall He not by all means carry out the avenging of His chosen ones, who cry to Him day and night; and yet He is longsuffering over them? I tell you that He will carry out their avenging quickly&#8221; (vv. 7-8a).<p>On the one hand, this parable indicates that the Judge, the righteous God, is sovereign. As the sovereign Lord, He judges whenever He chooses. On the other hand, this parable indicates that we need to bother the Lord by praying persistently, knowing that He will answer our cry and avenge us. Even the Father&#8217;s answering and avenging is a matter of His dispensing. As He answers our cry and avenges us against our enemy, He dispenses Himself into us that we may experience and enjoy Him in His love.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(24)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover the remaining aspects of the believers&#8217; experiencing and enjoying God as the Father in His love.<h2 class=head4>(33) Fulfilling Their Every Good Pleasure of Goodness and Work of Faith in Power</h2><p>Second Thessalonians 1:11 speaks of God fulfilling &#8220;every good pleasure of goodness and work of faith in power.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;good pleasure&#8221; also means delight. As believers in Christ, we have the aspiration of doing good, that is, of doing God&#8217;s will. This is our good pleasure, our delight, and we are happy to do it. However, although we have this good pleasure, without God&#8217;s power we do not have the ability to accomplish what we are glad to do. But God in His power fulfills for the believers every good pleasure of goodness and work of faith. The move of God in His power produces the environment needed for the fulfillment of our good pleasure and the carrying out of the work of our faith. This also is a matter of God&#8217;s dispensing.<h2 class=head4>(34) Perfecting, Establishing, Strengthening, and Grounding Them</h2><p>God&#8217;s dispensing also includes His perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding the believers (1 Pet. 5:10b; Rom. 16:25; 2 Thes. 2:17b). First Peter 5:10 says, &#8220;The God of all grace, who called you into His eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground you.&#8221; In this verse &#8220;all grace&#8221; refers to the riches of the bountiful supply of the divine life in many aspects ministered to us in many steps of the divine operation on us and in us in God&#8217;s economy. The initial step is to call us, and the consummate step is to glorify us. Between these two steps are God&#8217;s loving care in His perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding us. In all these divine acts, the bountiful supply of the divine life is ministered to us as grace in varied experiences. The God of such grace will, through His dispensing, perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground the believers.<p>The word &#8220;Himself&#8221; in 5:10 indicates God&#8217;s personal activity in the work of grace. The Greek word rendered &#8220;perfect&#8221; literally means restore. It implies repairing, adjusting, putting in order again, mending, perfectly joining together, thoroughly equipping, well furnishing, and thus, perfecting, completing, educating. In Greek the word &#8220;establish&#8221; literally means to set fast, to confirm. The same word was used by the Lord Jesus in His charge to Peter in Luke 22:32. The meaning of &#8220;strengthen&#8221; is very close to that of establish. Literally, the Greek word rendered &#8220;ground&#8221; means to lay a basis for. It is a derivation of the word that means foundation. Hence, it is to ground solidly, as in Matthew 7:25, Ephesians 3:17, and Hebrews 1:10.<p>There is progress in these four divine acts of grace. Perfecting leads to establishing, establishing to strengthening, and strengthening to grounding in the God of all grace-the Triune God in His dispensing as the solid foundation. First God perfects us, perhaps through the suffering of persecution. Then after perfecting us God establishes us. When we are established, we no longer wander, and we are no longer changeable. After God establishes us, He strengthens us, empowers us, and eventually grounds us in Himself as the Triune God.<p>In Romans 16:25 Paul says, &#8220;Now to Him who is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which has been kept in silence in times eternal.&#8221; Here we see that it is according to the gospel and the preaching of the Lord Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept in silence in times eternal, that the God who is of power establishes us. This indicates that God&#8217;s establishing of us is a great matter.<p>In Romans 16 the believers&#8217; need is no longer salvation or sanctification; it is to be established. Everything has been accomplished, and we need only to be established. We are not established according to doctrines or dispensational truths but according to the gospel, the preaching of Christ, and the revelation of the mystery. All believers need to be rescued from divisive doctrines and practices and be established by the pure and full gospel of God, by the preaching and ministering of the living and all-inclusive Christ, and by the revelation of God&#8217;s mystery. Only the pure gospel, the living Christ, and God&#8217;s revealed mystery can establish us and keep us in oneness for the church life.<h2 class=head4>(35) Raising Them Up and Presenting Them to Himself</h2><p>Through the divine dispensing God also raises the believers up and presents them to Himself. In 2 Corinthians 4:14 Paul says, &#8220;Knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you.&#8221; This indicates that the apostles considered themselves dead persons, for they were always being delivered unto death for the Lord&#8217;s purpose. Their only hope was in the God who raised up the Lord Jesus and who would also raise them up. They lived with this kind of faith.<p>In 2 Corinthians 1:9 Paul testifies of his experience of being raised up by God: &#8220;We ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have confidence in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead.&#8221; Literally, the Greek word translated &#8220;sentence&#8221; means answer or response. When the apostles were under the pressure of affliction, despairing even of life, they may have asked themselves what the issue of the suffering would be. The answer, or response, was death. According to their estimation, they were dying. This was a self-insight that led to a particular vital decision. It caused them to have no confidence in themselves. As far as they were concerned, there was no way out. Their confidence was in God, who raises the dead.<p>The experience of death ushers us into the experience of resurrection. Resurrection is the very God who, through His dispensing, resurrects the dead. The working of the cross terminates the self that we may experience God in resurrection. The experience of the cross always issues in the enjoyment of the God of resurrection.<h2 class=head4>(36) Fashioning, Shaping, Preparing, Making Them Fit, for Their Mortal Body to Be Swallowed Up by Life</h2><p>God fashions, shapes, prepares, makes the believers fit, for their mortal body to be swallowed up by life (2 Cor. 5:4b-5a). In 2 Corinthians 5:4b Paul says, &#8220;That what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.&#8221; Here &#8220;what is mortal&#8221; denotes our mortal body (2 Cor. 4:11; Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 15:53). To have our mortal body swallowed up by life is to have it transfigured by resurrection life swallowing up the death in our mortal body (1 Cor. 15:54). Our fallen, mortal body is a great burden to us. Under the weight of this burden, we groan that we would be clothed with a transfigured body. When we are raptured, transfigured, and clothed with the heavenly, spiritual, and resurrected body, then that which is mortal will be swallowed up by life.<p>In 2 Corinthians 5:5 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;Now He who has wrought us for this very thing is God, who has given to us the pledge of the Spirit.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;wrought&#8221; can also be translated fashioned, shaped, prepared, made fit. God has wrought us, fashioned us, shaped us, prepared us, made us fit, for the very purpose that our mortal body may be swallowed up by His resurrection life. Thus, our entire being will be saturated with Christ. God has given us the Spirit as the pledge of this wonderful and marvelous part of His complete salvation in Christ.<p>God prepares us for our mortal body to be swallowed up by life by dispensing Himself into us. Eventually the Christ who dwells in us will grow in us and saturate our entire being. This is the preparation for Christ&#8217;s saturating our body. On the one hand, when we are transfigured, we shall be clothed with a spiritual body outwardly. On the other hand, transfiguration means that the indwelling Christ is saturating our body and swallowing up the element of death in it. He has been sown into our spirit and heart, and now He is saturating our soul. Then one day He will spread from the soul into the body and saturate the body. When our body has been saturated in full, it will become a new body.<p>The One who fashions, shapes, prepares, makes us fit for this is God. The Spirit is the guarantee that God will accomplish this. The Spirit is Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of God. Therefore, actually God has put Himself into our being as the guarantee that He will change our body so that we shall be entirely conformed to Christ in resurrection.<p>We may believe, according to 2 Corinthians 5:4, that our mortal body will be swallowed up by life. However, we still need to see that for this purpose God needs to shape us. God&#8217;s fashioning of us for the future in which our mortal body will be swallowed up by life is also God&#8217;s dispensing. We need to pray, &#8220;Lord, prepare me, make me fit, for the day when my mortal body will be swallowed up by life and transfigured.&#8221; Eventually, our body will be transfigured into the form of Christ&#8217;s glorious body. Today God is shaping, fashioning, us for this by dispensing Himself into our being.<h2 class=head4>(37) Making Them His Inheritance of Glory</h2><p>Through His dispensing God the Father is making the believers His inheritance of glory. Paul in Ephesians 1:18b speaks of &#8220;the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;in&#8221; may also be rendered &#8220;among.&#8221; God&#8217;s inheritance is in and among the saints. We, the saints, are God&#8217;s inheritance. What we are by nature, however, cannot be God&#8217;s inheritance. God does not desire to inherit our nature, our flesh, our natural being. He desires to inherit all that He has dispensed into us of Himself. Therefore, whatever God has dispensed into us of Himself becomes His inheritance.<p>God&#8217;s inheritance in and among the saints is an inheritance of glory. The riches of the glory in 1:18b are the many different items of God&#8217;s attributes, such as light, life, righteousness, holiness, and love, expressed in different degrees. Since glory is God&#8217;s expression, the riches of His glory are the riches of God&#8217;s expression. First, God has made us His inheritance (Eph. 1:11) as His acquired possession (v. 14) and gave us to participate in all He is, all He has, and all He has accomplished as our inheritance. Consummately, all these become His inheritance in the saints for eternity. This will be God&#8217;s eternal expression, which is His glory with all its riches to express Him to the uttermost universally and eternally (Rev. 21:11).<p>Ephesians 1:11 says, &#8220;In whom also we were made an inheritance.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;were made an inheritance&#8221; means to choose or assign by lot. Hence, this clause literally means we were designated as a heritage. We were made an inheritance to inherit God&#8217;s inheritance. On the one hand, we were made God&#8217;s inheritance for God&#8217;s enjoyment; on the other hand, we were made to inherit God as our inheritance for our enjoyment. According to our natural being, we are not worth anything, but in Christ we have been made God&#8217;s inheritance. It is by having the Triune God dispensed into us and wrought into us that we are constituted into an inheritance. As God&#8217;s element is wrought into our being, we become His inheritance in reality. Therefore, we are still in the process of being made God&#8217;s inheritance in full.<p>It is God Himself within us who constitutes us His inheritance of glory. If God is not dispensed into us and wrought into us, we cannot become His inheritance. The believers become precious to Him by being saturated with the divine essence. Only in this way can poor sinners become God&#8217;s special treasure. In this universe God is the only One who is precious. Now this precious God of matchless worth is dispensing Himself into us to make us His inheritance of glory. Our enjoyment of God as our inheritance consummates in our being made His inheritance. We enjoy God. Then our enjoyment of Him makes us His enjoyment.<p>God is in the process of dispensing Himself into us little by little. Whatever God dispenses of Himself into us becomes His inheritance. Eventually, God will inherit us. Actually, He will inherit Himself in us. The enjoyment of God as our inheritance is the dispensing of God into us. The result of this dispensing is that He is making us His inheritance of glory for His enjoyment.<p>We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that in our natural being we cannot be God&#8217;s inheritance, for in our natural being there is no glory. But from the time we were saved, God has been working to transform us, giving us Himself as our enjoyment, our inheritance. The more we enjoy Him and participate in Him, the more He dispenses His element into our being. Then, more and more, we become His inheritance, and the more of His glory we have. Eventually, we shall be fully saturated with Him and constituted of Him as our inheritance, and this enjoyment and constitution will make us His inheritance. Hence, we are God&#8217;s inheritance not in ourselves or by ourselves but by His being our inheritance through the divine dispensing. Then our enjoyment of Him in the divine dispensing will consummate in our being God&#8217;s inheritance for Him to enjoy eternally. Ultimately, the New Jerusalem, a mutual dwelling place for God and His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people, will be a mutual enjoyment, for in the New Jerusalem we shall enjoy the Triune God as our eternal inheritance, and He will enjoy us as His eternal inheritance. This consummation will be the issue of God&#8217;s dispensing Himself into us and constituting us of Himself.<h2 class=head4>(38) Leading Them as His Many Sons into Glory</h2><p>Hebrews 2:10 tells us that God is &#8220;leading many sons into glory.&#8221; These many sons are the many brothers of Christ the Firstborn in Romans 8:29. The last step of God&#8217;s great salvation is to bring His many sons into glory, that is, to bring them into His expression.<p>Romans 8:29 and 30 tell us that God&#8217;s work of grace upon us began with His foreknowing, continued through His predestination, calling, and justification, and will end with His glorification. This will be accomplished by the Lord&#8217;s coming back (Phil. 3:21), at which time we shall appear with Him in glory (Col. 3:4). This glorification of the sons of God, as the goal of God&#8217;s salvation, will be manifested in fullness in the New Jerusalem for eternity (Rev. 21:11, 23).<p>Through regeneration the life of glory was dispensed into us, and now we have a seed of glory within us. This seed, this life of glory, is Christ in us, the hope of glory (Col. 1:27). Eventually, this seed will blossom, and thereby we shall be brought into glory. Actually, the glory into which God is leading us is the glory which He has already given us (John 17:22). Although glory has been given to us already, it is still necessary for God to bring us into it.<p>God&#8217;s leading the believers as His many sons into glory will be the ultimate consummation of the divine dispensing. This means that the dispensing of the Triune God will consummate in our being brought into God&#8217;s glory. If we see this, we shall depend not on teaching but on God&#8217;s dispensing. Mere teaching cannot bring us into God&#8217;s glory. It is only by the divine dispensing that we shall be constituted into God&#8217;s inheritance and eventually brought into His glory. This dispensing will cause the seed of glory within us to grow until it blossoms. The blossoming of the seed of glory will be our glorification. Hence, the divine dispensing will cause us to be glorified. May we all see that our loving Father is dispensing Himself into us and that through His dispensing He is bringing us into His glory.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(25)</h1><p>We have seen that in the progressing stage of God&#8217;s full salvation, the stage of transformation, the believers experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing. The believers experience and enjoy God as the Father in His love. In this message we shall begin to consider the believers&#8217; experiencing and enjoying Christ as the Son in His grace.<h2 class=head3>b. Experiencing and Enjoying Christ as the Son in His Grace</h2><p>According to the New Testament, grace is what Christ is to us for our enjoyment (John 1:16-17). Grace is actually Christ the Son dispensed into our being for our enjoyment in our experience. Thus, grace is not mainly the work the Lord Jesus does for us; grace is the Triune God in the Son dispensed into us and experienced as our enjoyment. In brief, grace is Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9) experienced and enjoyed by us through the divine dispensing.<p>John 1:17 says that grace came through Jesus Christ. In our experience we realize that this grace is Christ Himself. When Christ is enjoyed by us in the divine dispensing, that is grace.<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 speaks of the grace of Christ: &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&#8221; The love of God the Father is the source, the fount, and the grace of Christ is the flow, the expression, of the love of God. Therefore, the love of God is the source, the grace of Christ is the flow, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the transmission of the flow with the source. Grace is actually the Triune God embodied in Christ and transmitted into our being through the Spirit for our experience and enjoyment. This grace issues out from the Father&#8217;s love and is transmitted into us by the Spirit.<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 is our basis for saying that the believers may experience and enjoy Christ as the Son in His grace. The dispensing of the Father is in love, and the dispensing of the Son is in grace. Grace issues from, comes out of, the divine love. The divine love as the source is with the Father. When this love comes with the Son, it becomes grace. This is the reason John 1:17 tells us clearly that grace came with Jesus Christ. Grace, however, is not separate from love. Actually, love and grace are one reality in two stages, or in two aspects. With the Father we experience and enjoy the divine love, and with the Son we experience and enjoy the divine grace. As we experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing, we experience and enjoy Christ as the Son in His grace.<h2 class=head4>(1) As Their Portion</h2><p>As the believers experience and enjoy Christ as the Son in His grace, they enjoy Him as their portion. In Colossians 1:12 Paul speaks of Christ as &#8220;the portion of the saints.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;portion&#8221; here may also be translated &#8220;lot.&#8221; Paul used this term with the Old Testament record of the allotting of the good land to the children of Israel as the background. Each of the twelve tribes received an allotment of the good land, which is an all-inclusive type of Christ. Today the believers have Christ as their portion. As our portion, our lot, Christ is everything to us for our experience and enjoyment.<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:2 is the expression &#8220;our Lord Jesus Christ...theirs and ours.&#8221; Christ as the all-inclusive One belongs to all the believers, for He is the portion given to us by God. We have been called by the faithful God into the fellowship of this Christ who is ours (1 Cor. 1:9). The fact that Christ is ours means that He is our portion. All the believers have Christ as their unique portion. We have been called into the fellowship, that is, into the participation and enjoyment, of this portion.<p>As the believers&#8217; portion, Christ has many aspects. He is God (Titus 1:3; 3:4), the Redeemer (Rom. 3:24), the Passover (1 Cor. 5:7), the Savior (Titus 1:4), wisdom (1 Cor. 1:30), righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30), life (Col. 3:4), the Sanctifier (Heb. 2:11; 13:12a), sanctification (1 Cor. 1:30), the redemption of our body (1 Cor. 1:30), the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), the freeing and transforming Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17-18), the door to leave the fold (John 10:9a), the pasture (John 10:9b), the Shepherd (John 10:11), the vine (John 15:1), the abiding place (John 15:4a), the all-inclusive One with the unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8), spiritual food (1 Cor. 10:3; John 6:48, 57b), the rock flowing with the spiritual drink (1 Cor. 10:4), light (John 1:4; Eph. 5:14), the way (John 14:6), the reality (John 14:6), the hope of glory (Col. 1:27), peace (Eph. 2:14; John 14:27; 16:33), joy (John 15:11; 17:13; Phil. 3:1; 4:4), rest (Matt. 11:28-29), the feast (Col. 2:16-17), the new moon (Col. 2:16-17), the Sabbath (Col. 2:16-17), the armor (Eph. 6:11, 13-17), the One living within the believers that they may live Him (Gal. 2:20; John 6:57b; Phil. 1:21), the One being formed within them (Gal. 4:19), the One making His home in their hearts (Eph. 3:17), the One magnified in them (Phil. 1:20), the One empowering them (Phil. 4:13), the treasure of excellent power (2 Cor. 4:7), the depths of God (1 Cor. 2:10), a model (1 Pet. 2:21), the Author and Perfecter of faith (Heb. 12:2), the Captain of salvation (Heb. 2:10), the Forerunner (Heb. 6:20), the Apostle (Heb. 3:1), the High Priest (Heb. 4:14; 7:26), the Husband (2 Cor. 11:2), the Bridegroom (John 3:29), the Head (1 Cor. 11:3), the Lord (Rom. 14:8; Eph. 1:17), the Master (Lord-Eph. 6:9), Master (Sovereign Lord-2 Pet. 2:1; Jude 4), the Friend (John 15:15), the Brother (Rom. 8:29; John 20:17; Heb. 2:11), the Partner (Heb. 1:9; 3:14), the Physician (Matt. 9:12), the Helper (Heb. 13:6), and the Overseer (1 Pet. 2:25). These are the many aspects of Christ (covered in The Conclusion of the New Testament, Messages Fifty through Fifty-seven) as the believers&#8217; all-inclusive portion.<h2 class=head4>(2) Living in Them</h2><p>Christ lives in the believers. Christ is not only our life; He as a person lives in us. Christ became the life-giving Spirit in order that He might live in us. Apart from becoming the life-giving Spirit, it would not be possible for Christ to live in us.<p>For Christ to live in us does not mean that He lives instead of us. In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, &#8220;Christ lives in me.&#8221; Christ lives in us by causing us to live with Him (John 14:19). This means that Christ does not live alone; He lives in us and with us. He lives in us by enabling us to live with Him.<p>Paul&#8217;s word about Christ living in us is definite and emphatic. Paul clearly says that Christ, as a person, lives in us. This Christ who lives in us is the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the Spirit. Now that He dwells in us as the Spirit, we need to learn to let Him live in us and to live together with Him.<h2 class=head5>(a) For Them to Walk in Him</h2><p>Christ as our portion lives in us for us to walk in Him (Col. 2:6b). Our walking in Christ comes out of His living in us. Christ lives in us for the purpose that we may walk in Him.<p>Colossians 2:6 says, &#8220;As therefore you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.&#8221; The word &#8220;walk&#8221; here means to live, to act, to behave, and to have our being. We should live, walk, and act in Christ so that we may enjoy His riches, just as the children of Israel lived in the good land and enjoyed all its rich produce. The children of Israel had the good land as their portion, and they lived, walked, in that land. In our experience today, Christ, our unique portion, should be the good land in which we live and walk.<p>As Paul was writing Colossians 2:6, he must have been considering the picture of the good land in the Old Testament as a type of the all-inclusive Christ. There is a suggestion of this in 1:12, where Paul says that Christ is the portion of the saints. Then in 2:6 Paul tells us to walk in Christ. This implies that Christ is the land, the territory, the realm, in which we may walk. Furthermore, Paul&#8217;s reference to being rooted in Christ in 2:7 may also indicate that he was thinking of the good land. In order for us to be rooted in Christ, He must be our land, our soil. All these are indications that Christ is the good land and that we need to walk and be rooted in Him.<p>In Colossians 2:6 Paul tells us to walk in Christ, but in Galatians 5:16 he charges us to walk by the Spirit. Furthermore, in Romans 8:4 he speaks of walking according to spirit. These verses indicate that the good land for us today is the all-inclusive Spirit who indwells our spirit. This all-inclusive Spirit is the all-inclusive Christ as the processed Triune God. After being processed, the Triune God is the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit for us to experience and enjoy. Today this all-inclusive Spirit who is Christ Himself indwells our spirit to be our good land and lives in us that we may walk in Him as our all-inclusive land.<p>To walk in Christ is to enjoy His living in us, and His living in us is a matter of the divine dispensing. As Christ lives in us, He dispenses the riches of the processed Triune God into our being.<h2 class=head5>(b) For Them to Be Saved in His Life</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s living in us is also for us to be saved in His life. &#8220;If, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life&#8221; (Rom. 5:10). This verse speaks of both the reconciling death of Christ and the saving life of Christ. Although we have been saved already through Christ&#8217;s death, we still need to be saved in His life. On the one hand, we have been saved from hell and the judgment of God. This was accomplished once for all through the death of Christ on the cross. On the other hand, we still need to be saved in Christ&#8217;s life from many subjective problems.<p>To be saved in Christ&#8217;s life is actually to be saved in the person of Christ Himself. As long as we are in Him, we are in the process of being saved in His life. To live in Christ is to be saved in His life. As Christ lives in us, dispensing Himself into our being, we live in Him and are saved in His life. Christ lives in us to save us continuously in His life.<h2 class=head5>(c) For Them to Live through Him by Eating Him as the Bread of Life</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s living in the believers is also for them to live through Him by eating Him as the bread of life. The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I am the bread of life&#8221; (John 6:48), and &#8220;He who eats Me shall also live because of Me&#8221; (v. 57b). The bread of life is the life supply in the form of food. Christ is not only life to us; He, as the bread of life, is our life supply to sustain our spiritual life in Him. Hence, as He lives in us, we live through Him by eating Him as the bread of life.<p>If we eat Christ as the bread of life, we shall live through Him. Eating is to take food into us to be assimilated into our body organically. Hence, to eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life. Then we live through Him whom we receive.<h2 class=head5>(d) For Them to Live with Him</h2><p>In 1 Thessalonians 5:10 Paul says that Christ &#8220;died for us that, whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with Him.&#8221; The Lord Jesus died for us not only that we may be saved from eternal perdition but also that, through His living in us, we may live together with Him. We may live together with Him whether we watch or sleep, that is, whether we live or die. On the one hand, the Lord Jesus is away from us and we are awaiting His coming back; on the other hand, He is with us (Matt. 28:20), and we can live together with Him (Rom. 6:8). Therefore, in the divine dispensing Christ&#8217;s living in us is for us to live with Him.<h2 class=head5>(e) For Them to Live Him</h2><p>In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, &#8220;Christ lives in me,&#8221; and in Philippians 1:21a he says, &#8220;To me to live is Christ.&#8221; This indicates that Christ lives in us that we may live Him. You may have heard of living for Christ, living out Christ, and living by Christ but not of living Christ. To live by Christ and for Christ and to live out Christ are all somewhat different from simply living Christ. Adding a preposition changes the denotation. If we are living by Christ, we are still doing the living. To live Christ means that Christ is our life (Col. 3:4). When we live, He lives. When He lives, we live. We do not merely live out Christ, live by Christ, live with Christ, live in Christ, and live for Christ-we live Christ. Christ&#8217;s living in us is for us to live Him.<p>On the one hand, Christ lives in us; on the other hand, we should live Christ. This means that inwardly Christ is our life and outwardly Christ is our living. We and Christ thus have one life and one living. Christ&#8217;s life is our life, and our living is Christ&#8217;s living. Therefore, we and Christ live as one.<p>To live Christ is not merely to live a holy life, and it is not simply to be spiritual and victorious. To live Christ is to live a person. This is to live a life that is Christ Himself. Because Christ lives in us, we, through the divine dispensing, should live Him and thereby be one with Him both in life and in living. Day by day we need to practice living Christ, taking Him as our life and person. This is the Christian life.<p>The central thought in the Bible is that Christ should be our life and that we should live Him. The goal of being a Christian, therefore, is to live Christ. This is the destiny God has ordained for us in His economy. Today the processed Triune God is dispensing Himself into us so that we may take Christ as our life, our life supply, and our person in order to live Him.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(26)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover more aspects of the believers&#8217; experiencing and enjoying Christ as the One living in them.<h2 class=head5>(f) For Them to Have Him Formed in Them</h2><p>Christ lives in the believers for them to have Him formed in them. In Galatians 4:19 Paul says, &#8220;My children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you.&#8221; To have Christ formed in us requires transformation. According to the book of Galatians, Christ has been revealed in us (1:16), He is now living in us (2:20), and He will be formed in us. To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ grown in us in full. First, Christ was born into us at our regeneration, now He lives in us in our Christian life, and He will be formed in us at our maturity.<p>Paul&#8217;s word about Christ being formed in the believers implies that we are being constituted of Christ. Christ is living in us, He is being formed in us, and He is becoming our constitution. To have Christ formed in us is a living, organic matter. Christ is now living in us so that we may be constituted of Him organically. He intends to constitute our whole being-our mind, emotion, and will-of Himself. Eventually, our whole being will be constituted of the element of Christ. This means that He will constitute every part of our soul so that we may have His form, His image, in every part of our being.<p>For Christ to be formed in us means that His element is being constituted into us. In other words, His constitution is becoming our constitution. This is not merely a matter of the element of Christ being within us but of having the element of Christ constituted into us. To be constituted of Christ in this way involves a process of organic transformation and formation.<p>The word &#8220;formed&#8221; in Galatians 4:19 corresponds to the word &#8220;image&#8221; in 2 Corinthians 3:18, where Paul tells us that we are being transformed into Christ&#8217;s image. This image is a form. Christ must be formed in us so that we may express Him by being in His image. As the living One, He with His element is working within us organically, constituting Himself into our being so that we may have His form and express His image.<h2 class=head5>(g) For Them to Magnify Him</h2><p>Christ lives in the believers for them to magnify Him. Paul said, &#8220;Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death&#8221; (Phil. 1:20). In Paul&#8217;s bodily sufferings Christ was magnified, that is, shown or declared great (shown to be without limitation), exalted, and extolled. Therefore, to magnify Christ is to express Christ without limitation. It is to show to the whole universe that the Christ who lives in us and whom we live is unlimited. Paul, even when mistreated in prison, could display the unlimited greatness of Christ. Paul was happy in the Lord, and in his happiness he showed forth the immeasurable Christ he experienced and enjoyed. In this way Paul expressed, exhibited, exalted, and extolled Christ. He was a living witness of Christ, testifying of His ability, power, patience, love, and wisdom, all without measure. While Paul was in prison, he expressed the greatness of Christ in an enlarged way.<p>The word &#8220;magnify&#8221; means to make something large to our sight. We may wonder how Christ can be magnified since He is already universally great. According to Ephesians 3:18, the dimensions of Christ-the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth-are immeasurable, for they are the dimensions of the universe. Although Christ is vast, extensive, and immeasurable, in the eyes of unbelievers He may be virtually nonexistent. Therefore, in our daily living we should magnify Christ, making Him great in the eyes of others. We need to let others see Christ in the way of enlargement, in the way of magnification. According to the human concept, Christ is limited. But when others see us living Christ, they will realize that He is not limited.<p>As believers, we should be a magnifying glass in relation to Christ so that others may see Christ magnified through us. As Christ lives in us and is formed in us, we shall live Him. Then Christ will be magnified in us.<h2 class=head5>(h) For Them to Boast in Him</h2><p>Christ lives in the believers also that they may boast in Him. In Philippians 3:3 Paul says, &#8220;We are the circumcision, who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.&#8221; Those who are the circumcision here are the New Testament believers, the ones genuinely circumcised by Christ&#8217;s crucifixion. They are absolutely different from the Judaizers. They serve as priests by the Spirit of God, not by the ordinances of law; they boast in Christ, not in the law; and they have no confidence in the flesh but have their confidence in the Spirit. The Judaizers did evil things and even boasted in them, whereas the true believers boast in Christ. They glory and rejoice in Him. The word &#8220;boast&#8221; implies not only boasting but also rejoicing and glorying. Our boasting, glorying, and rejoicing are not in our outward deeds, not in our behavior or conduct, but in Christ alone. The Judaizers had confidence in the flesh, whereas the true believers in Christ have no confidence in the flesh. As a result of our experience and enjoyment of Christ&#8217;s living in us, we boast in Him.<h2 class=head5>(i) For Them to Be Found in Him</h2><p>Christ lives in the believers for them to &#8220;be found in Him&#8221; (Phil. 3:9a). Paul&#8217;s earnest desire was to be found in Christ. In the past Paul was fully in the Jewish religion under the law and was found by others in the law. But at his regeneration he was transferred from the law and his former religion into Christ, and he became &#8220;a man in Christ&#8221; (2 Cor. 12:2). Now he desired to be found in Christ by all who observed him-the Jews, the angels, and the demons. This indicates that he aspired to have his whole being immersed in Christ and saturated with Christ so that all who observed him could discover him in Christ. We also should aspire to be found by others in Christ. To be found in Christ actually means to be observed, seen, or discovered in Christ by others.<p>Before Paul was transferred into Christ, He lived in the law and under the law. He was a person altogether encased by the law, enveloped by it and fully boxed in by it. But one day he was transferred out from under the law into Christ. Henceforth, whenever others observed him, they could tell that he had become a person in Christ. Paul was not in culture, philosophy, or religion. He was a person who lived in Christ, and his aspiration and expectation were that he would be found in Christ by others.<p>It is one thing to have a doctrinal understanding of being found in Christ; it is quite another thing to be found in Christ in our daily living. Where we are when others observe us indicates the realm in which we live. If we live in our culture or in our good behavior, we shall be found in culture or in our behavior by others. In whatever realm we live, that is where we shall be seen, observed, and discovered by others.<p>To be found in Christ means that He is our unique expression. Because Paul could be found in Christ, Christ was his expression. In every aspect and from every angle, only Christ could be seen upon him. Paul&#8217;s aspiration was that Christ would be his only expression. He did not want to be found in his natural virtues or in culture or religion. Likewise, we should aspire to be found not in our natural virtues but in Christ.<p>If we would be found in Christ, we need to be watchful moment by moment, continually on the alert to live in Christ. If we are not alert, we shall immediately be distracted from Christ and live in something other than Christ. Our living may be very good, but in our experience we are not in Christ. We should live in Christ and become those who are in Christ in a practical way in our experience. Then when others see us or observe us, they will find us in Christ. We shall not be found in our own virtues-we shall be found in Christ and in Him alone. The more we live Christ, the more we shall be found in Him.<h2 class=head5>(j) For Them to Gain Him by Counting All Things Loss and Refuse</h2><p>Christ lives in us for us to gain Him by counting all things loss and refuse. In Philippians 3:7 and 8 Paul says, &#8220;What things were gains to me, these I have counted loss on account of Christ. But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them refuse that I may gain Christ.&#8221; The Greek word for &#8220;gain&#8221; in verse 8 means to secure, to obtain, to lay hold of. According to the Greek, the noun form of the word gain is in verse 7 and the verbal form is in verse 8. Therefore, Darby translates verse 8 this way: &#8220;That I may have Christ for my gain.&#8221; To gain Christ is to gain His very person. Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead (Col. 2:9) and the reality of the shadows of all positive things (Col. 2:16-17). To gain Him is to experience, enjoy, and take possession of His unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8).<p>In order to gain Christ, we need to count as loss the things that were once a gain to us. We need to count every gain as loss for Christ. There is no comparison between any gain and Christ. If we make such a comparison, we shall count everything loss. The reason we regarded certain things as gain in the past was that we did not know Christ. But once our eyes were opened to see Christ, we began to realize how foolish it was to keep those other things.<p>Because Paul had this vision, he could say, &#8220;What things were gains to me, these I have counted loss on account of Christ.&#8221; These are the things mentioned in verses 5 and 6. The things that were gains to him Paul counted loss on account of Christ. All the different gains were counted as one loss by Paul because they all issued in one thing, that is, in the loss of Christ. All the things which were once gains to Paul hindered him and held him back from participating in Christ and enjoying Him. Hence, on account of Christ, all the gains were a loss to him. Paul counted as loss on account of Christ not only the things of his former religion but all other things as well.<p>We may think that the things in 3:8 refer to worldly, material things. In a sense, this understanding is partly right. However, to interpret Paul&#8217;s word in this way is not very practical. According to verses 5 and 6, Paul&#8217;s concept is not mainly related to material things. It is true, of course, that worldly, material things occupy people and keep them from experiencing Christ. However, Paul realized that the things which really frustrate people from experiencing Christ are mainly the things of religion, philosophy, and culture. If we get into Paul&#8217;s spirit and thought in Philippians 3, we shall realize that as he was writing he was thinking of religion, philosophy, and culture when he spoke of &#8220;all things.&#8221; The &#8220;all things&#8221; in verse 8 must certainly include the three categories of religious, philosophical, and cultural things. If we would drop our religion, philosophy, and culture, we would truly abandon everything. By dropping these three categories of things, we would automatically drop the worldly, material things, which are actually dominated by religion, philosophy, and culture. Although it is easy to overcome the influence of material things, it is very difficult to overcome religion, philosophy, and culture. We cannot experience Christ if we count as loss only the worldly, material things. In order to gain Christ, we need to count all things as loss, including the things of religion, philosophy, and culture.<p>Like Paul, we should not only count all things loss on account of Christ but also count all things refuse. The Greek word for &#8220;refuse&#8221; in 3:8 refers to dregs, rubbish, filth, what is thrown to the dogs; hence, dog food, dung. There is no comparison between such things and Christ. The more we count all things loss and refuse on account of Christ, the more we shall gain Christ for our experience and enjoyment.<h2 class=head5>(k) For Them to Know Him and the Power of His Resurrection and the Fellowship of His Sufferings</h2><p>Philippians 3:10a indicates that Christ lives in us for us &#8220;to know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings.&#8221; The word &#8220;know&#8221; here is equal to &#8220;experience.&#8221; To know Christ means to experience Him, to enjoy Him, to participate in Him, and to partake of Him. To know Christ is thus to apprehend Him by experiencing Him. We know Christ in order to gain Him. To have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ (v. 8) is by revelation, but to know Christ is by experience-to have the experiential knowledge of Him, to experience Him in the full knowledge of Him. First we receive the revelation of Christ, and then we seek the experience of Christ-to know and enjoy Him in an experiential way.<p>To know Christ is a result of being found in Him. All the words between &#8220;be found in Him&#8221; in Philippians 3:9 and &#8220;to know Him&#8221; in verse 10 describe in what condition Paul aspired to be found in Christ. He was willing to suffer the loss of all things and count them to be refuse that he might gain Christ and be found in Him to know Him. According to Paul&#8217;s concept, if we would know Christ, we must first be found in Him. Moreover, to be found in Him requires that we count all things loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ and then suffer the loss of all things and count them to be refuse. Only when we have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, a vision of the supreme preciousness and surpassing worth of Christ, shall we be willing to let go of everything else and count those things as refuse. Then we shall gain Christ and be found in Him. We shall be those who live in Christ and who are found by others in Christ. Being found in Him, we shall surely know Him.<p>We seek to know not only Christ but also the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings. &#8220;To know Him&#8221; refers to knowing Christ in a general way. But knowing the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings are details related to knowing Christ. Actually to know Christ is to know the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings.<p>Christ today is in resurrection. He is no longer natural and no longer in the flesh-He is in resurrection, and the reality of resurrection is the Spirit. Christ is now in resurrection as the pneumatic Christ, as the life-giving Spirit. Since He is the pneumatic Christ in resurrection, it is in resurrection that we meet Him and experience Him.<p>Christ and His resurrection are one. Christ Himself is the power of His resurrection, and the Spirit as the reality of the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection is Christ in resurrection. We need to experience this power that we may gain Christ. Because Christ is now in resurrection, we cannot know Him experientially unless we know the power of His resurrection.<p>Christ&#8217;s resurrection power is not an outward physical power; it is an inward, intrinsic power. As such, it is a life power. Christ has manifested in His resurrection the intrinsic power of the divine life. This is the power of His resurrection. By experiencing the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection we obtain Christ in reality. The more we experience the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, the more we obtain Him.<p>The process of obtaining Christ, as revealed in Philippians 3:10, is to know Him by knowing the power of His resurrection. However, if we would know the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, we must share in His sufferings and know the fellowship of His sufferings. The participation in Christ&#8217;s sufferings-&#8220;the fellowship of His sufferings&#8221;-(Phil. 3:10; Matt. 20:22-23; Col. 1:24) is a necessary condition for the experience of the power of His resurrection (2 Tim. 2:11) by being conformed to His death. Paul was pursuing to know and experience not only the excellency of Christ Himself but also the life power of His resurrection and the participation in His sufferings. With Christ the sufferings and death came first, followed by the resurrection. With us the power of His resurrection comes first, then the fellowship of His sufferings and conformity to His death. We first received the power of His resurrection. Then by this power we are enabled to participate in His sufferings and live a crucified life in conformity to His death. Such sufferings are mainly for producing and building up the Body of Christ.<p>In a very real sense, Christ&#8217;s sufferings have not yet been completed. Consider Paul&#8217;s word in Colossians 1:24: &#8220;Now I rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church.&#8221; As the Head, Christ&#8217;s sufferings for the accomplishment of redemption are complete, but the sufferings of Christ for the producing and building up of the Body are not yet finished. Such sufferings are also called &#8220;His sufferings.&#8221; Furthermore, in Colossians 1:24 Paul regarded his own sufferings as the filling up of what is lacking of Christ&#8217;s sufferings for His Body. For this reason, Paul indicates in Philippians 3:10 that we still need to share in Christ&#8217;s sufferings. The sufferings of Christ for His Body are still going on, and we need to share in them. When Christ was on earth, He suffered. As those who follow Him, we must share in His sufferings for His Body. If we would know Christ by experiencing the power of His resurrection, we must share His sufferings.<p>There is a difference between those sufferings which are for our transformation and those which are for the Body. Paul&#8217;s word in 3:10 does not refer to suffering for transformation. If we compare 3:10 with Colossians 1:24, we shall see that the sufferings about which he is speaking in 3:10 are those which make up the lack of Christ&#8217;s afflictions for the Body. It is when we suffer for the Body that we experience the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection.<p>In order to experience Christ, we must be in the power of His resurrection. We cannot be in our natural life. The more we know the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, the more we shall participate in the sufferings of Christ and thereby have the fellowship of His sufferings. To know Christ in these aspects is truly to experience Him and enjoy Him.<p>It is crucial for us to realize that Christ is in resurrection. When we experience Christ in His resurrection, we are infused with all the elements of resurrection, and this infusion enables us to partake of His sufferings for the Body. In other words, we must have the dispensing of Christ&#8217;s resurrection so that we may experience His cross, His death. It is by knowing Christ&#8217;s resurrection that we experience His death. The following stanza from a hymn written by A. B. Simpson indicates this:<p class=hbody>&#8217;Tis not hard to die with Christ<br>When His risen life we know;<br>&#8217;Tis not hard to share His suff&#8217;rings<br>When our hearts with joy o&#8217;erflow.<br>In His resurrection power<br>He has come to dwell in me,<br>And my heart is gladly going<br>All the way to Calvary.</p><p class=hbody>Hymns, 481</p><p>Whereas Christ first passed through death and entered into resurrection, we first enjoy His resurrection and then we experience His death. The more we know His resurrection, the more we shall be put into His death to share in the fellowship of His sufferings.<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:9 Paul speaks of being called by God into the fellowship of His Son. All believers desire to enter into the fellowship of the Son of God. However, in Philippians 3:10 Paul speaks of the fellowship of Christ&#8217;s sufferings, something in which we are not naturally inclined to share. But the more we experience Christ&#8217;s sufferings, the more we shall gain Christ. In other words, the more we experience the cross, the more we experience Christ. God gives us the cross, and the cross gives us Christ. We all need to have more experience of these things.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(27)</h1><p>We have seen that, in the progressing stage of God&#8217;s full salvation, Christ lives in the believers for them to walk in Him, to be saved in His life, to live through Him by eating Him as the bread of life, to live with Him, to live Him, to have Him formed in them, to magnify Him, to boast in Him, to be found in Him, to gain Him by counting all things loss and refuse, and to know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings. Now we need to see that Christ lives in us for us to be conformed to His death.<h2 class=head5>(l) For Them to Be Conformed to His Death</h2><p>In Philippians 3:10 Paul says, &#8220;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.&#8221; This expression indicates that Paul desired to take Christ&#8217;s death as the mold of his life. Christ&#8217;s death is a mold to which we are conformed in much the same way that dough is put into a cake mold and conformed to it. Paul continually lived a crucified life, a life under the cross, just as Christ did in His human living. Through such a life the resurrection power is experienced and expressed. The mold of Christ&#8217;s death refers to the continual putting to death of His human life that He might live by the life of God (John 6:57). Our life should be conformed to such a mold-dying to our human life in order to live the divine life. Being conformed to the death of Christ is the condition for knowing and experiencing Him, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.<p>Christ&#8217;s death took place throughout His life on earth. As He was living, He was also dying, dying to the old creation in order to live a life in the new creation. This is the meaning of &#8220;His death&#8221; in Philippians 3:10. Being conformed to Christ&#8217;s death should be our experience day by day. Daily we must put our natural life to death and not live according to it. If we put to death our natural life, we shall have the consciousness that we have another life, the divine life, within us. Once our outward natural life is put to death, the inner divine life will be released. Then in our experience we shall be conformed to Christ&#8217;s death.<p>There are four important matters in 3:10: to know Christ, to know the power of His resurrection, to know the fellowship of His sufferings, and to be conformed to His death. Actually, being conformed to Christ&#8217;s death is related to knowing both the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings. The words &#8220;being conformed&#8221; indicate how we may know the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings. By being conformed to the death of Christ we experience the power of His resurrection and enter into the fellowship of His sufferings.<p>Being conformed to Christ&#8217;s death is the base of the experience of Christ. If we are not conformed to the death of Christ, we do not have the base for the experience of Christ. In order to experience Christ, we must be conformed to His death. But to be conformed to the death of Christ, we must have the fellowship of His sufferings. By participating in Christ&#8217;s sufferings, we are ushered into a position to experience the power of His resurrection. Then, when we experience the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, we know Him.<p>As we partake of Christ&#8217;s sufferings for the Body, we are conformed to His death. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He lived a crucified life. He continually put His natural life to death. By living such a crucified life He was alive to God and lived Him. When we are willing to suffer for Christ and His body, we also shall live only to Him. Then we shall truly be conformed to His death, for we shall share in His death. Day by day we shall experience the power of His resurrection. This is the way to know Christ in an experiential way. By knowing Christ in this way, experiencing Him in the power of His resurrection, we obtain Him.<p>We need to be conformed to the death of Christ because we are natural, of the old man, and of the self. In Christ&#8217;s death the natural man is killed, the old man is crucified, and the self is nullified. The form of Christ&#8217;s death does not bear any indication of the natural man, the old man, or the self. This means that as we are participating in Christ&#8217;s death, His death will shape us, will conform us, to the form of His death. This shaping by Christ&#8217;s death will deal with our natural life, our old man, and our self. This means that in Christ&#8217;s death our natural man with the natural life, the old man, and the self are continually put to death. In Christ&#8217;s death, therefore, there is not any activity of the natural life, of the old man, or of the self. However, if we behave in our natural man, in our old man, or in the self, we do not bear the image of the death of Christ. In order to bear this image, we need to be conformed to Christ&#8217;s death.<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that Christ&#8217;s death is a form, a mold, and that we are the &#8220;dough&#8221; that is placed into this mold. In the form, the mold, of Christ&#8217;s death there is no natural man, old man, or self. All these are ruled out by the mold of the death of Christ. To be molded, formed, in this way is to be conformed to Christ&#8217;s death. The more we experience this, the more we know Christ, His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.<h2 class=head5>(m) For Them to Be Delivered from Every Evil Work</h2><p>In 2 Timothy 4:18a Paul says, &#8220;The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto His heavenly kingdom.&#8221; Here &#8220;every evil work&#8221; denotes persecution. Paul suffered many persecutions, and he regarded those persecutions as evil works. However, Paul had the assurance that the Lord Jesus would deliver him from every persecution, from every evil work.<p>Furthermore, Paul was assured that the Lord would save him &#8220;unto His heavenly kingdom.&#8221; The heavenly kingdom is the kingdom of our Father (Matt. 13:43), the kingdom of the Father (Matt. 26:29), the kingdom of Christ and of God (Eph. 5:5), and the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (2 Pet. 1:11), which will be a reward to the overcoming saints. It equals the crown of righteousness in 2 Timothy 4:8, and it is an incentive to the believers to run the heavenly course. Paul had the assurance to make the triumphant declaration that he would be saved into this heavenly kingdom.<p>Since Paul was martyred and martyrdom is certainly an evil work, we may wonder whether the Lord actually delivered Paul from every evil work. Yes, Paul was delivered from every evil work, including the evil work of martyrdom. Martyrdom ushered Paul into the heavenly kingdom, and this ushering into the heavenly kingdom was a deliverance. The deliverance Paul enjoyed from his martyrdom was the entering into the heavenly kingdom. Hence, martyrdom for Paul was a deliverance. Likewise, the sufferings through which we pass are also a deliverance in that suffering delivers us into something higher.<p>On the one hand, Paul was assured that the Lord would deliver him from every evil work. On the other hand, he was ready for martyrdom. This is indicated by 2 Timothy 4:6: &#8220;I am already being poured out, and the time of my departure is at hand.&#8221; To Paul, his martyrdom was a deliverance, for it ushered him into the heavenly kingdom, and in his martyrdom he experienced the divine dispensing. At no other time does the Lord dispense Himself into His believers as much as when they are martyred. Whenever a believer is being martyred out of love for the Lord, the Lord infuses, dispenses, all His riches into such a martyred one.<h2 class=head5>(n) For Them to Enjoy His Sufficient Grace and His Power to Tabernacle over Them</h2><p>Christ lives in the believers for them to enjoy His sufficient grace and His power to tabernacle over them. This was Paul&#8217;s experience in 2 Corinthians 12. Paul suffered from a &#8220;thorn in the flesh&#8221; (v. 7), and he entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from him (v. 8). However, the Lord said to him, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness&#8221; (v. 9). Accepting the Lord&#8217;s word, Paul could say, &#8220;Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me&#8221; (v. 9). Instead of removing the thorn, the Lord supplied Paul with the sufficient grace to enable him to endure the suffering. Then in Paul&#8217;s experience this grace became the power that is made perfect in weakness.<p>The grace mentioned in 2 Corinthians 12:9 is not something done by the Lord or given by the Lord. It is the Lord Himself within us, supporting us, energizing us, and strengthening us to meet the situation. This is a living grace, a real grace, and it is nothing less than Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God dispensed into our being for our enjoyment in our experience. Therefore, we need to learn not to expect to receive something outwardly or to have something done by the Lord for us, but expect simply to enjoy the Lord Himself as grace.<p>The Greek word translated &#8220;tabernacle&#8221; in 2 Corinthians 12:9 is episkenoo, a compound verb composed of epi and skenoo. Skenoo, meaning to dwell in a tent, is used in John 1:14 and Revelation 21:3. Episkenoo here means to fix a tent or a habitation upon. It portrays how the power of Christ, even Christ Himself, dwells upon us as a tent spread over us, overshadowing us in our weaknesses.<p>Sufferings and trials are often the Lord&#8217;s ordination for us so that, through the divine dispensing, we may experience Christ as grace and power. In his experience Paul realized that the Lord&#8217;s grace became power spread over him like a tent. Hence, this grace-power became a dwelling place for Paul in his sufferings. As Paul was suffering, he could dwell in the tabernacle spread over him. This tabernacle, this tent, sustained him, supported him, maintained him, and kept him.<p>To show forth the perfectness of Christ&#8217;s power, our weakness is needed. For this reason, Paul would most gladly boast in his weaknesses, that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him. Grace is the supply, and power is the strength, the ability, of grace. Both are actually the resurrected Christ Himself, who is now the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us for our enjoyment.<h2 class=head5>(o) For Them to Be Able to Do All Things in Him Who Empowers Them</h2><p>Christ lives in the believers for them to be able to do all things in Him who empowers them. Paul says, &#8220;I can do all things in Him who empowers me&#8221; (Phil. 4:13). To be empowered by Christ is to be made dynamic inwardly. Christ dwells in us (Col. 1:27), and He empowers us, makes us dynamic, from within, not from without. By such inward empowering, Paul could do all things in Christ.<p>Paul was a person in Christ (2 Cor. 12:2) and he desired to be found in Christ by others (Phil. 3:9). In 4:13 he declared that he could do all things in Christ, the One who empowered him. This is an all-inclusive and concluding word of Paul&#8217;s experience of Christ. It is the converse of the Lord&#8217;s word concerning our organic relationship with Him in John 15:5, &#8220;Apart from Me you can do nothing.&#8221; As long as we have Christ and are in Him, we can do all things in Him.<p>In Philippians 4:13 we find the secret to which Paul refers in verse 12, &#8220;The secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to be in want.&#8221; In chapter three Paul testified that he pursued Christ in order to gain Him and be found in Him. Now in 4:13 Paul says that he is in Him. In Christ as the One who empowers him Paul could do all things. Christ was his secret of sufficiency. By being in Him Paul could do all things in Him.<p>The &#8220;all things&#8221; in Philippians 4:13 refer to the things mentioned in verse 12 and to the virtues listed in verse 8. This means that the application of verse 13 is limited by the context of verses 8 through 13. By the empowering of Christ we can live a contented life (vv. 11-12) and be true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, and well-spoken of. This means that we are persons in Christ, who empowers us to live out every kind of virtue. This is to live Christ, to magnify Christ in His virtues.<p>We need to realize that Paul&#8217;s word about Christ as the empowering One specifically applies to Christ&#8217;s empowering us to live Him as our human virtues and thereby to magnify Him in His unlimited greatness. The six virtues mentioned in 4:8 are actually the image of God. God created man in His image, that is, in His attributes of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. The fact that man was made in the image of God means that he was made in the form of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. The six items, whatever is true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, and well-spoken of, are in these four divine attributes of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. This is the real virtue, for it is the expression of Christ. Christ empowers the believers to live Him and magnify Him in all these virtues.<p>To live a life of all these virtues is much more difficult than doing a Christian work. Many can preach the gospel, teach the Bible, and even establish churches, but they are not able to live this kind of life, a life full of the virtues of being true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, and well-spoken of. In order to live Christ as our human virtues for the expression of the divine attributes, we need to be empowered by the indwelling Christ.<p>If we would experience Christ as the empowering One enabling us to do all things in Him, we need to let Him live in us (Gal. 2:20), be formed in us (Gal. 4:19), make His home in us (Eph. 3:17), and be magnified in us (Phil. 1:20). If we, fail to do these things, He will not have the way to empower us. But when Christ lives in us, is formed in us, makes His home in us, and is magnified in us, the way is prepared for Him to empower us. Then, empowered by the indwelling Christ, we shall be able to do all the things spoken of in Philippians 4:8 through 12.<h2 class=head5>(p) For Them to Have Him Making His Home in Their Hearts</h2><p>Ephesians 3:17a indicates that Christ lives in the believers for them to have Him making His home in their hearts. Our heart is composed of the three parts of our soul-the mind, the emotion, and the will-plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit. Through regeneration Christ came into our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), and now we should allow Him to spread Himself into every part of our hearts. The heart is the totality of our inward parts and the center of our inward being. Therefore, when Christ makes His home in our hearts, He controls our entire inward being and supplies and strengthens every inward part with Himself.<p>The Greek word rendered &#8220;make home&#8221; in Ephesians 3:17 is the word for house plus a prefix that means &#8220;down.&#8221; This indicates that Christ wants to make His home deep down in our being. As we are strengthened into the inner man, the way is opened for Christ to spread in us, to spread from our spirit to every part of our mind, emotion, and will. The more Christ spreads within us, the more He settles down in us and makes His home in us. This means that He occupies every part of our inner being, possessing all these parts and saturating them with Himself.<p>For Christ to make His home in our hearts means that He settles Himself in our mind, emotion, will, and conscience. In order for this to take place, Christ must occupy every part of our being. We may compare our heart to a house with many rooms. One room is the mind, and other rooms are the emotion, the will, and the conscience. We have believed in the Lord Jesus, and we have Him within us, but He still needs to make His home in our heart. Although we have Christ in us in a general way, we may not have Him in us in a particular way, saturating our mind, emotion, will, and conscience. Christ desires to make His home in our heart, to occupy every part of our inner being. Our inner being, therefore, needs to be saturated, possessed, occupied, and filled with Christ.<p>If Christ has made His home in our heart, occupying every room of our inner being, we shall be strong. Too many times, however, we are not strong in our spiritual life. The reason is that we have Christ in us only in a general way. We may have received Christ into a corner of our &#8220;living room,&#8221; but have not given Him the liberty to spread in us. The result is that we are weak. We have Christ, but we are weak because we are not saturated with Christ. We are short of the divine dispensing into our mind, emotion, will, and conscience to saturate our entire being. But if we have been thoroughly saturated with Christ through the divine dispensing into every part of our inward being, we shall be strong. We shall truly be one with the Lord.<p>Although Christ desires to spread from our spirit to all the parts of our heart, we may not always be willing for Him to spread into our mind, emotion, or will. For this reason, Paul prayed to the Father that He would strengthen us according to His power by His Spirit into our inner man (Eph. 3:16) so that Christ may make His home in our hearts. This indicates that by being strengthened in this way we shall be willing to let the indwelling Christ spread into all the parts of our being and to take over each part. This is Christ making His home in our hearts.<h2 class=head5>(q) For Them to Be Rooted and Grounded in His Love</h2><p>Ephesians 3:17b indicates that Christ lives in the believers for them to be rooted and grounded in His love. To be rooted and grounded in Christ&#8217;s love involves a deep and practical experience of the divine dispensing.<p>Being rooted and grounded in love is related to our being God&#8217;s farm and God&#8217;s building (1 Cor. 3:9). As God&#8217;s farm we need to be rooted for growth, and as God&#8217;s building we need to be grounded for building up. Thus, in Ephesians 3:17b Paul has in mind the matters of life and building. In speaking of our having been rooted and grounded, Paul indicates that the experience of Christ is for life and building. As those who have Christ making His home in our hearts, we must have both the life and the building. All that we experience of Christ must be for this.<p>Paul specifically says in 3:17b that we are rooted and grounded in love. In order to experience Christ, we need faith and love (1 Tim. 1:14). Faith enables us to receive and realize Christ, and love enables us to enjoy Him. Both faith and love are not ours but His. His faith becomes our faith to believe in Him, and His love becomes our love to love Him. The love in which we are rooted and grounded is the divine love realized and experienced by us in a practical way. With such a love we love the Lord, and with that same love we love one another. In such a love we grow in life and are built up in life. Paul&#8217;s thought here regarding the relationship between the experience of Christ and the matters of life and building is surely deep and profound.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(28)</h1><p>In previous messages we covered many aspects of the believers&#8217; experiencing and enjoying Christ as the Son in His grace. In this message we shall cover four other matters related to this and then go on to consider the believers&#8217; experiencing and enjoying the Spirit as the consummation of the divine Trinity in His fellowship.<h2 class=head5>(r) For Them to Apprehend His Breadth, Length, Height, and Depth</h2><p>Christ lives in the believers for them to apprehend His breadth, length, height, and depth. In Ephesians 3:18 Paul speaks of being &#8220;strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;apprehend&#8221; means not only to know but also to grasp, to lay hold of intensively. In order to grasp the dimensions of Christ we need all the saints, for we apprehend these dimensions not individually but corporately.<p>In Ephesians 3 Paul prayed that we would be strengthened into our inner man with the result that Christ would make His home in our hearts and thereby occupy, possess, permeate, and saturate our whole inner being with Himself. In this way we are filled with Christ and we become strong to apprehend the dimensions of Christ.<p>The dimensions of Christ are the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth-the dimensions of the universe. We can measure the distance from one point in the universe to another, for example, from the earth to the moon, but we cannot measure the universe itself. Only God knows the measurements of the universe. Now the very dimensions of the universe are also the dimensions of Christ. This indicates that Christ is our real universe, for His dimensions are the dimensions of the universe.<p>In our experience of Christ we first experience the breadth of what He is and then the length. This is horizontal. As we advance in Christ, we experience the height and the depth of His riches. This is vertical. First we experience Christ spreading as the breadth and the length, and later we experience Him rising up as the height and then descending as the depth. Eventually our experience of Christ becomes three dimensional, like a cube.<p>If we have only the length of Christ, without any breadth, our experience will be a &#8220;line,&#8221; that is, an experience that is long and narrow to an extreme. Our experience of Christ, however, should have not only one dimension, like a line, but two dimensions, like a square, and then three dimensions, like a cube. If we have only a line experience of Him, this line will continue until it reaches an extreme. But if we experience Christ properly and normally as the breadth and the length, we shall be kept from going to an extreme.<p>In order to experience Christ in His universal dimensions, we need the church life. We need to experience Christ with all the members of the Body. As we experience the dimensions of Christ in the church life, we find that His breadth and length are immeasurable. Christ is immeasurable in His spreading forth. As we experience Christ in His spreading, we come to see that the dimensions of the universe are the very dimensions of Christ.<p>After we experience the breadth and length of Christ, we begin to experience the height of Christ and then the depth. The proper understanding of the experience of the height and depth of Christ is contrary to our natural concept, which places depth before height. But in the experience of Christ we first ascend and then we descend. This means that before we can have the depth, we must have the height. The spiritual experiences of the depth of Christ come from the experiences of the height of Christ.<p>In our experience of Christ we should go on from two dimensions to three. Our experience of Christ in the church must be cubical, three dimensional, with many lines going back and forth in all three directions. When we experience Christ in such a three-dimensional way, we become solid. Because Christ is the universal &#8220;cube,&#8221; our experience of Him needs to be cubical. As we go back and forth and up and down in our experience of Christ, we eventually have a solid, cubical experience of Him.<h2 class=head5>(s) For Them to Know His Knowledge-surpassing Love</h2><p>Christ lives in the believers for them to know His knowledge-surpassing love. In Ephesians 3:19a Paul says, &#8220;To know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ.&#8221; The love of Christ surpasses knowledge; yet we can know it by experiencing it. According to our mentality, the love of Christ is knowledge-surpassing. Our mind is not able to know it. But in our spirit we can know the love of Christ through our experience.<p>The love of Christ is actually Christ Himself. Just as Christ is immeasurable, so His love also is immeasurable. We should not regard the love of Christ as something belonging to Christ. This love is Christ. Because Christ is immeasurable, His love is knowledge-surpassing; yet we can know it in our spirit, not by knowledge but by experience. If we compare what we have experienced thus far of the immeasurable love of Christ to all there is to experience, it is like comparing a raindrop to the ocean. Christ in His universal dimensions and in His immeasurable love is like a vast, limitless ocean for us to experience.<h2 class=head5>(t) For Them to Be Filled with Him in His Unsearchable Riches and Immeasurable Dimensions unto All the Fullness of God</h2><p>Christ lives in the believers for them to be filled with Him in His unsearchable riches and immeasurable dimensions unto all the fullness of God. Ephesians 3:19b says, &#8220;That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&#8221; Some translations say, &#8220;filled with all the fullness of God.&#8221; According to this rendering, the fullness of God would have to be the element, the essence, with which we are filled. But this is a mistaken understanding of this verse. Here Paul is saying that we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God, that is, we shall be filled to be the expression of God. The Greek word translated &#8220;unto&#8221; in verse 19 means &#8220;resulting in.&#8221; Our being filled with the riches of Christ results in the fullness of God, the full expression of God. As Christ makes His home in our hearts, we are filled not with all the fullness of God but unto all the fullness of God. Eventually, we shall be filled with the processed Triune God to such an extent that we shall become His full expression.<p>When Christ makes His home in our hearts and when we are strong to apprehend with all the saints the dimensions of Christ and to know by experience His knowledge-surpassing love, we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God. All this fullness dwells in Christ (Col. 1:19; 2:9). Through His indwelling Christ continually imparts the element of God into our being. We can be filled with the Triune God to such a measure and can attain to such a standard, even unto all the fullness of God. In this way we fulfill God&#8217;s intention that the church should be His expression.<p>When the riches of Christ are in God Himself, they are His riches. But when these riches are expressed, they become God&#8217;s fullness (John 1:16). Thus, when we speak of the fullness of God, we imply that the riches of all that the Triune God is have become His expression. The fullness in Ephesians 3:19 does not mean the riches; it denotes the expression, the manifestation, of the riches. For example, when you fill a cup with water, it is not until the water fills the cup to the brim and overflows that you can see the fullness of the water. The overflow is the fullness of the water. That overflow as the fullness of the water is the expression of the water. We need to be strengthened through the Spirit into our inner man so that Christ may make His home in our hearts to fill us to the brim and even overflow from our inner being. When we are filled up to such an extent that Christ overflows from within us, we become the fullness of God.<p>In the New Testament the fullness is the expression through the completeness of the riches. This is the reason that in Ephesians 3:8 Paul speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ but in 1:23 and 4:13 speaks of the fullness of Christ. The riches of Christ are the various aspects of what Christ is, and the fullness of Christ is the result, the issue, of our enjoyment of these riches. As we enjoy the riches of Christ, these riches are assimilated into our being metabolically. Then they constitute us into the fullness of Christ, into the Body of Christ, the church, as His expression. Therefore, the fullness of Christ in 1:23 is the very fullness of God in 3:19. The fullness of God is the issue of the believers&#8217; being constituted metabolically through their experience of the riches of Christ.<p>When we get into the depths of 3:19, we see that the fullness of God is the church and that the church is metabolically constituted in us through our experience and enjoyment of the riches of Christ. In order to assimilate Christ metabolically, we need to be strengthened into our inner man. We also need Christ to make His home in our hearts, that is, to occupy, possess, and metabolically saturate every part of our inward being with all that He is. Then we shall become strong to grasp Christ experientially in His universal dimensions both horizontally and vertically. Along with this, we shall know through our experience the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ. When we have experienced Christ to such an extent, we shall be filled with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God as His expression. Therefore, being filled unto the fullness of God is the outcome, the result, of the deeper, higher, and richer experiences of Christ described in Ephesians 3. This is the dispensing of the processed Triune God into our entire being that we may become His expression.<h2 class=head5>(u) For Them to Be Built Up in Him</h2><p>The last aspect of the believers&#8217; experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son in His grace is that He lives in them for them to be built up in Him. In Colossians 2:7 Paul says, &#8220;Having been rooted and being built up in Him.&#8221; As we grow in Christ, we are being built up in Him. The building up here is not the building up with the saints. Rather, the meaning of &#8220;being built up in Him&#8221; is that we ourselves need to become built up. The building up of the Body depends on the individual and personal building up of all the members. If a particular member has not been built up, it will not be possible for him to be built up in the Body. To be built up in the Body we must first be built up ourselves. When we have become built-up members, we shall then be able to be built up with others in the Body. Therefore, the building up in 2:7 is not that of the Body corporately but that of the building up of the members individually. In Ephesians 4:16, on the contrary, we have the building up of the Body in a corporate way.<p>It is significant that in Colossians 2:7 Paul puts being rooted and being built up together. The reason for this is that being rooted is for growing, and growing is genuine building. Growth is not only for the building-it is actually the building itself. For example, the more a tree grows, the more it builds itself up by absorbing into itself nourishment from the soil. As those who have been rooted in Christ, we need to remain in our spirit absorbing the rich nourishment of Christ. As we absorb this nourishment, we shall grow, and by this growth we shall be built up. Then it will be possible for us to be built up with others in the Body.<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that the words &#8220;being built up&#8221; in 2:7 do not refer in a direct way to the building up of the Body of Christ. Rather, this expression denotes an increase in our spiritual stature, which can be compared to a person&#8217;s increase in stature as he grows physically. The only way a child can grow physically is by assimilating nourishing food. In the same way, we grow spiritually by assimilating the rich nourishment of Christ. This is what it means to be built up in Christ, as mentioned in 2:7.<p>If we are lacking in spiritual stature, it is of no avail to speak of the building up of the Body. In Ephesians 4:13 Paul says, &#8220;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&#8221; The Body of Christ has a stature, and this stature has a full measure. We all need to grow until we arrive at the full measure of the stature of the Body of Christ. For us to be built up does not first mean that we are built as the church, the Body. It means that we are built up in the Lord and experience an increase of stature. Hence, in Colossians 2:7 to be built up actually means to grow up. First we are rooted into Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit, and then we grow up in Him. We build ourselves up by growing up. Our being built up depends on our assimilating into our being the riches of Christ as the soil. Having assimilated these riches into us, we shall grow and be built up. When we are fully grown, we shall be built up. Therefore, to be built up simply means to grow up. Our growth depends on how much nourishment we assimilate into us by being rooted in Christ. Because we are rooted in Him, we absorb into us the riches of the all-inclusive Spirit. Then we grow with the nourishment we derive from these riches, thus enjoying Christ as our divine grace.<h2 class=head3>c. Experiencing and Enjoying the Spirit as the Consummation of the Divine Trinity in His Fellowship</h2><p>In the progressing stage of God&#8217;s full salvation the believers experience and enjoy the Spirit as the consummation of the divine Trinity in His fellowship. The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. However, this is not the Triune God apart from the process through which He has passed. The Spirit is the Triune God after He has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Having passed through this process, the Triune God is now the consummate Spirit for the believers&#8217; experience and enjoyment.<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 speaks of &#8220;the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; The love of God the Father is the source, and the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is the flow, the expression, of love. The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is a matter of communication, transportation, transmission.<p>Love is the source, grace is the flow, and fellowship is the transmission of the flow with the source. Therefore, we have the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit-the full enjoyment of the Triune God. In the divine dispensing of the processed Triune God, the grace of the Lord, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Spirit are for our experience and enjoyment.<h2 class=head4>(1) As the Reality of Christ for Their Enjoyment</h2><p>John 14:17-20 indicates that the Spirit is the reality of Christ for the believers&#8217; enjoyment. Because Christ Himself is reality (John 14:6), when He was with the disciples, reality was with them. However, this reality was only among them, not in them. Therefore, the Lord Jesus told the disciples that it was expedient for them that He go away (John 16:7). The purpose of His going was for Him to have a change from the form of the flesh to the form of the Spirit. As soon as this change had been accomplished, His reality would become the reality of the Spirit, and the Spirit would become the Spirit of reality. Then this Spirit of reality would come to abide in the disciples. The Lord Jesus said in John 14:17, &#8220;Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.&#8221; Because the Spirit of reality has come into us, the reality of Christ now abides in us.<p>The Spirit as the reality of Christ includes all that the Spirit is in His person and symbols. With respect to His person, the Spirit is the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:15b, 35; Matt. 1:18, 20; John 20:22; Rom. 15:16), the Spirit of God (Matt. 3:16; Rom. 8:9), the Spirit of the Father (Matt. 10:20), the Spirit of the Lord (Luke 4:18; 2 Cor. 3:17), the Spirit of the Son of God (Gal. 4:6), the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9; 1 Pet. 1:11), the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7), the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19), the Lord Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18), the Spirit of the living God (2 Cor. 3:3), the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), the Spirit of grace (Heb. 10:29), the Spirit of reality (John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 4:6), the Comforter (the Paraclete, John 14:16), the Spirit of power (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:8), the Spirit of glory and of God (1 Pet. 4:14), the eternal Spirit (Heb. 9:14), the seven Spirits (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6), and the Spirit (John 7:39; Acts 6:3; Gal. 3:2; Rev. 2:7; 22:17).<p>The symbols of the Spirit include a dove (Matt. 3:16; John 1:32), the fine woman seeking the lost treasure of God (Luke 15:8), clothing (Luke 24:49), the wind (pneuma, John 3:8), the living water (John 4:11, 14; 7:38-39), the breath (John 20:22), a rushing violent wind (Acts 2:2), the gift (Acts 2:38; 10:45), the firstfruit (Rom. 8:23), the cloud (1 Cor. 10:1-2), the spiritual drink (1 Cor. 10:4), the compound ointment (2 Cor. 1:21; 1 John 2:20, 27), a seal (2 Cor. 1:22; Eph. 1:13; 4:30), a pledge (2 Cor. 1:22; 5:5; Eph. 1:14), the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne of God (Rev. 4:5), the seven eyes of the Lamb (Rev. 5:6), and the river of water of life (Rev. 22:1).<h2 class=head4>(2) Working in Them, upon Them, and for Them</h2><p>As the consummation of the divine Trinity in His fellowship, the Spirit works in, upon, and for the believers. The Spirit regenerates the believers (John 3:5-6), gives them life (2 Cor. 3:6c; John 6:63), saves them by renewing them (Titus 3:5), frees them by His law of life from the law of sin and death (Rom. 8:2), gives life to their mortal bodies (Rom. 8:11), puts to death the practices of their bodies (Rom. 8:13), supplies them with His bountiful supply (Phil. 1:19), leads them to live a life as sons of God (Rom. 8:14), washes, sanctifies, and justifies them (1 Cor. 6:11; Rom. 15:16; 2 Thes. 2:13; 1 Pet. 1:2), transforms them (2 Cor. 3:18), and indwells them (Rom. 8:9, 11; 1 Cor. 3:16; 2 Tim. 1:14). The Spirit is the means for the believers to know that God abides in them and they in God (1 John 3:24b; 4:13). The Spirit fills the believers inwardly (Acts 13:52; 6:3, 5), teaches them (Luke 12:12), guides them into all the reality (John 16:13), searches and reveals to them all the things concerning Christ as the depths of God (1 Cor. 2:10-11), teaches them spiritual words for spiritual communication (1 Cor. 2:13-14), speaks in them (Matt. 10:20), speaks with them (1 Cor. 7:40), comforts them (Acts 9:31), gives them joy (Rom. 14:17; 1 Thes. 1:6), empowers them to abound in hope in God (Rom. 15:13), gives them love (Rom. 15:30; Col. 1:8), pours out God&#8217;s love in their hearts (Rom. 5:5), and mingles with their spirit in their faith (2 Cor. 4:13). The Spirit is the means for God the Father to strengthen the believers into their inner man that Christ may make His home in their hearts (Eph. 3:16-17). By the Spirit the believers live and walk (Gal. 5:16, 25). The Spirit fights for them against the flesh (Gal. 5:17), bears the fruit of life in many aspects in their life (Gal. 5:22-23), longs within them unto envy for God against worldliness (James 4:4-5), and is the sword for them to fight against the powers of darkness and the evil things (Eph. 6:17). The Spirit is not to be grieved by the believers (Eph. 4:30), quenched by them (1 Thes. 5:19), or insulted by them (Heb. 10:29). As the means for the believers to pray (Jude 20), the Spirit helps them in their weaknesses (Rom. 8:26a), intercedes for them with groanings (Rom. 8:26b), and infuses His according-to-God mind into them in their prayer (Rom. 8:27). The Spirit is the means for the believers to guard the good deposit (2 Tim. 1:14), and unto Him they sow and of Him they reap in their life (Gal. 6:8). The Spirit confesses to the believers that Christ came in the flesh (1 John 4:2) and testifies together with the water and the blood that Christ is the Son of God (1 John 5:5b-9). The Spirit is the means for the believers to take Christ as their righteousness by faith (Gal. 5:5). He witnesses with their spirit that they are the children of God (Rom. 8:16), cries with their spirit, &#8220;Abba, Father&#8221; (Gal. 4:6; Rom. 8:15), bears witness in their conscience (Rom. 9:1), anoints them (2 Cor. 1:21; 1 John 2:20, 27), seals them (2 Cor. 1:22; Eph. 1:13; 4:30), and pledges in them (2 Cor. 1:22; 5:5; Eph. 1:14). The Spirit is the firstfruit (foretaste) of the believers&#8217; divine inheritance (Rom. 8:23) and also the access for them to contact the Triune God (Eph. 2:18). The Spirit is partaken of by the believers (Heb. 6:4), and He is the fellowship-the participation in the enjoyment-of the Triune God to them (2 Cor. 13:14) and the oneness of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:3-4). The Spirit frees the believers from the letters of the law (2 Cor. 3:17), shows them the way of the Holy of Holies (Heb. 9:8), and testifies to them the law of life of the new covenant (Heb. 10:15-16). The Spirit is the means for the believers to serve-worship-God (Phil. 3:3). The Spirit rests upon the believers as glory when they are reproached (1 Pet. 4:14) and vindicates the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16). As the consummation of the Triune God, the Spirit is for the believers to be baptized into the divine Trinity (Matt. 28:19). The Spirit comes, falls, upon them as power (Acts 1:8; 10:44), fills them outwardly (Acts 2:4; 4:8, 31), and is the element of the new covenant (2 Cor. 3:6) and of the ministry of the new testament (2 Cor. 3:8). The Spirit gives the believers utterance to speak in different tongues (Acts 2:4) and witnesses of the resurrected and exalted Christ (Acts 5:32). The Spirit is also the power for the apostles to preach the gospel of Christ to the nations (Rom. 15:18-19) and with power is demonstrated in the apostles&#8217; preaching (1 Cor. 2:4; 1 Thes. 1:5). The Spirit is the means for the believers to speak for Christ (1 Cor. 12:3) and for them to prophesy (Acts 11:28). He gives them direction (Acts 8:29, 39; 13:2), tells them the things to come (Acts 20:23; 21:11; 1 Tim. 4:1), sends them out to spread the gospel (Acts 13:4), works together with the apostles and elders to resolve the problem of keeping the law (Acts 15:28), guides the apostles by forbidding them and not allowing them (Acts 16:6-7), establishes the elders in the churches (Acts 20:28), distributes gifts to the members of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:4; Heb. 2:4), manifests Himself in each one of the members of the Body of Christ through different gifts (1 Cor. 12:7-11), operates the gifts in each one of the members of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:11), warns the believers (Heb. 3:7-8), speaks to the churches (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 14:13), and speaks with the church (Rev. 22:17). All these are in the fellowship of the all-inclusive, consummated, life-giving, and indwelling Spirit.<p>After a person is saved and clears the past, he is ready to experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing. As believers, we experience and enjoy God as the Father in His love, Christ as the Son in His grace, and the Spirit as the consummation of the divine Trinity in His fellowship. Verse after verse in the New Testament indicates that the processed Triune God is dispensing Himself into us in a triune way. The processed Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-is dispensing the divine element into our being, and this element makes us holy, spiritual, and victorious and causes us to be transformed. We all need to see the vital matter of the experience and enjoyment of the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(29)</h1><p>In the progressing stage of God&#8217;s full salvation the believers not only experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing but also experience God&#8217;s redemption continuously.<h2 class=head2>2. Experiencing God&#8217;s Redemption Continuously in Being:</h2><h2 class=head3>a. Forgiven of Their Sins</h2><p>The believers experience God&#8217;s redemption in being forgiven of their sins. For God to forgive us of our sins means that He releases us from the offense of our sins.<p>God&#8217;s forgiveness is continuous, and we need it moment by moment. We should not think that once we have been saved we no longer need God&#8217;s forgiveness. As long as we are living on earth in the old creation we need God&#8217;s redemption daily. Whenever we contact Him, we should sense that we need His forgiveness.<p>Our sin, the indwelling sin in our nature (Rom. 7:17), has been taken care of by Christ as our sin offering (Lev. 4; Isa. 53:10; Rom. 8:3; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 9:26). Our sins, our trespasses, have been taken care of by Christ as our trespass offering (Lev. 5; Isa. 53:11; 1 Cor. 15:3; 1 Pet. 2:24; Heb. 9:28). After our regeneration we still need to take Christ as our sin offering, as indicated in 1 John 1:8, and as our trespass offering, as indicated in 1 John 1:9.<p>Some Christians claim that sin has been eradicated from the believers. The Bible, however, does not teach that sin has been eradicated from our being. First John 1:8 says, &#8220;If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.&#8221; To say that we do not have sin is to say that we do not have indwelling sin within our nature. In his first Epistle, John inoculates the believers against this false teaching. First John 1:7-2:2 deals with the believers&#8217; sinning after regeneration. This sinning interrupts their fellowship with God. If after regeneration the believers do not have sin in their nature, how could they sin in their conduct? Even though they sin only occasionally, not habitually, their sinning is an adequate proof that they still have sin working within them. The apostle&#8217;s teaching here condemns today&#8217;s teaching of perfectionism, the teaching that a state of freedom from sin is attainable or has been attained in earthly life. The apostle&#8217;s teaching also annuls the erroneous teaching of the eradication of the sinful nature, which, by misinterpreting the word in 3:9 and 5:18, says that regenerated persons cannot sin because the sin in their nature has been totally eradicated. To say that, because we have been regenerated, we do not have sin is self-deceiving. It denies the actual fact of our own experience and thus causes us to lead ourselves astray. We should not say that we no longer have sin. Sin, after our regeneration, still remains in our flesh, in our sinful nature.<p>On the one hand, the Bible reveals that our old creation has been crucified with Christ. On the other hand, in practicality our old creation, our old man, is still with us, and we are still very much under its influence. Only when our body has been transfigured, redeemed, will we be able to say that sin is no longer with us. But while we are still living in the old body sin remains with us, and, perhaps unwillingly or subconsciously, we may become entangled with it and stained by it. Therefore, every moment we need the cleansing blood of Jesus to be applied to our actual situation.<h2 class=head4>(1) Through Their Confessing of Sins</h2><p>The believers experience God&#8217;s redemption in being forgiven of their sins through their confessing of sins. First John 1:9 says, &#8220;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&#8221; Confession here denotes the confession of our sins, our failures, after regeneration, not the confession of our sins before regeneration. Even though we have been saved and regenerated and are under the transformation of the Holy Spirit, it is still possible for us to sin. Since we can still sin after we are saved, we need to confess our sins. Our confession is needed for God&#8217;s forgiveness. Such forgiveness of God for the restoration of our fellowship with Him is conditional and depends on our confession.<h2 class=head4>(2) According to God&#8217;s Faithfulness in His Word</h2><p>First John 1:9 tells us that God is faithful to forgive us our sins. God is faithful in His word. His word is the word of the truth of His gospel (Eph. 1:13), which tells us that He will forgive us our sins because of Christ (Acts 10:43). If we confess our sins, He, according to His faithfulness in His word, will forgive us. Otherwise, He would be unfaithful.<h2 class=head4>(3) According to God&#8217;s Righteousness in the Cleansing Blood of Jesus His Son</h2><p>God forgives the believers&#8217; sins not only according to His faithfulness but also according to His righteousness in the cleansing blood of Jesus His Son (1 John 1:7). God is righteous in the blood of Jesus His Son. The blood of Christ has fulfilled God&#8217;s righteous requirements so that He may forgive us our sins (Matt. 26:28). Therefore, if we confess our sins, He, based upon the redemption through the blood of Jesus, forgives us, because He must be righteous in the blood of Jesus. Otherwise, He would be unrighteous.<p>Because the Lord Jesus has shed His blood for us, God in His righteousness, in His justice, must forgive us. There is no ground for Him not to forgive us. The Old Testament way for God to forgive His people&#8217;s sins was through the offerings that were types pointing to the coming Christ. But the New Testament way for God to forgive us is for Him to take the ground of Christ&#8217;s death on the cross for our sins. Because the Lord has shed His blood for us, God has the ground righteously to forgive us. If we confess our sins, God, in order to be righteous, must forgive us. This is His righteousness in Christ&#8217;s redeeming act. This act was accomplished on the cross and then preached to us according to God&#8217;s word in the Bible. Because God is righteous, He, with Christ&#8217;s shed blood as the basis, must forgive us our sins.<h2 class=head3>b. Washed</h2><p>The believers experience God&#8217;s redemption not only in being forgiven of their sins but also in being washed, cleansed. First John 1:9 tells us that God cleanses us from all unrighteousness. For God to cleanse us from unrighteousness is for Him to wash us from the stain of our unrighteousness.<p>&#8220;Unrighteousness&#8221; and &#8220;sins&#8221; in 1 John 1:9 are synonyms. All unrighteousness is sin (1 John 5:17). Both unrighteousness and sins refer to our wrongdoings. Sins indicate the offense of our wrongdoings against God and men; unrighteousness indicates the stain of our wrongdoings. The offense needs God&#8217;s forgiveness, and the stain requires His cleansing. Both God&#8217;s forgiveness and His cleansing are needed for the restoration of our fellowship with Him that we may enjoy Him with a good conscience void of offense (1 Tim. 1:5; Acts 24:16).<h2 class=head4>(1) By the Blood of Jesus God&#8217;s Son</h2><p>First John 1:7 says, &#8220;If we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.&#8221; When we live in the divine life, we are under its enlightenment, and it exposes, according to God&#8217;s nature, all our sin, trespasses, failures, and defects, which contradict His pure light, perfect love, absolute holiness, and excelling righteousness. At such a time we sense in our enlightened conscience the need of the cleansing of the redeeming blood of the Lord Jesus, and it cleanses us in our conscience from all sins so that our fellowship with God and with one another may be maintained.<p>The tense of the verb &#8220;cleanses&#8221; in Greek is present and continuous. This indicates that the blood of Jesus the Son of God cleanses us all the time, continuously and constantly. Cleansing here refers to the instant cleansing of the Lord&#8217;s blood in our conscience. Before God, the redeeming blood of the Lord has cleansed us once for all eternally (Heb. 9:12,14), and the efficacy of that cleansing lasts forever before God, needing no repetition. However, in our conscience we need the instant application of the constant cleansing of the Lord&#8217;s blood again and again whenever our conscience is enlightened by the divine light in our fellowship with God.<p>In 1:7 the words &#8220;all sin&#8221; denote every single sin we have committed since we have been regenerated. The sins we commit after regeneration defile our purged conscience and need to be cleansed away by the blood of Jesus in our fellowship with God.<p>It is significant that 1:7 speaks of &#8220;the blood of Jesus His Son.&#8221; The name Jesus denotes the Lord&#8217;s humanity, which is needed for the shedding of the redeeming blood, and the title &#8220;His Son&#8221; denotes the Lord&#8217;s divinity, which is needed for the eternal efficacy of the redeeming blood. Thus, the blood of Jesus His Son indicates that this blood is the proper blood of a genuine man for redeeming God&#8217;s fallen creatures with the divine surety for its eternal efficacy, an efficacy which is all-prevailing in space and everlasting in time. The blood by which we are cleansed is the blood of a wonderful person-the Lord Jesus-who has both humanity and divinity. The Lord&#8217;s humanity qualified Him to have the blood to shed for our redemption. His divinity insures the efficacy of the power of this redeeming blood. The efficacy of the cleansing blood of Jesus is insured forever by His divinity.<h2 class=head4>(2) In the Spirit</h2><p>The believers are washed not only by the blood of Jesus but also in the Spirit. First Corinthians 6:11 reveals that, as believers, we are washed in the Spirit of our God. This washing is subjective and is accomplished in the power and realization of the Holy Spirit. To be washed in the Spirit is actually to experience the dispensing of the Spirit into us. The Spirit dispenses His element into us, and this dispensing of the Spirit is His washing. This washing is inward, subjective, and dispositional.<h2 class=head3>c. Sanctified</h2><p>The believers experience God&#8217;s redemption continuously in being sanctified. Romans 6:19 says, &#8220;Present your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification.&#8221; Sanctification is not only a matter of position, that is, to be separated from a common, worldly position to a position for God, but also a matter of disposition, that is, to be transformed from a natural disposition to a spiritual one. Dispositional sanctification involves a long process, beginning with regeneration, passing through our entire Christian life, and reaching completion at the time of maturity.<p>Romans 6:22 says, &#8220;Having been freed from sin and having been enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.&#8221; This verse speaks of dispositional sanctification in life. Sanctification issues in the riches of life. It brings us into the enjoyment of the riches of the divine life.<h2 class=head4>(1) In the Holy Spirit as the Sanctifying Power</h2><p>The believers are sanctified in the Holy Spirit as the sanctifying power. First Corinthians 6:11 tells us that we are sanctified in the Spirit of our God. The Spirit works in the believers to sanctify them, to separate them entirely for God&#8217;s purpose.<p>Second Thessalonians 2:13 says, &#8220;God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit.&#8221; God has chosen us unto salvation in sanctification, and this sanctification is of the Spirit. For us to be in sanctification means that we are in the process of being made holy. Day by day we are being sanctified in the Holy Spirit as the sanctifying power.<p>Romans 15:16 speaks of the believers being &#8220;sanctified in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This is subjective, dispositional sanctification. The Holy Spirit is continuously working within us to sanctify us, to separate us unto God for His purpose.<h2 class=head4>(2) With Christ as the Sanctifying Life</h2><p>The believers are sanctified with Christ as the sanctifying life. First Corinthians 1:30 reveals that Christ has been given to us from God as our sanctification. This indicates that the sanctifying life in us is the Christ who lives within us to sanctify us continually with His eternal life. With Christ as the sanctifying life we are being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will.<h2 class=head4>(3) In the Word of God as the Truth Conveying the Reality of God the Father&#8217;s Holiness- the Attribute of the Holy Nature of God</h2><p>In John 17:17 the Lord Jesus says in His prayer to the Father, &#8220;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.&#8221; In verse 19 the Lord goes on to say, &#8220;For their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.&#8221; These verses indicate that the believers are sanctified in the word of God as the truth conveying the reality of God the Father&#8217;s holiness-the attribute of the holy nature of God. The Father&#8217;s word carries with it the Father&#8217;s reality. Hence, His word is the reality, the truth. The word, being the truth, works as reality in the believers to sanctify them.<p>God&#8217;s living word works in the believers to separate them from anything worldly, separating them from the world and its occupation unto God and His purpose both positionally and dispositionally. This is what it means to be sanctified by the word of God as the truth, the reality. This sanctification not Only changes our position but also our disposition, our inward being.<p>The word of God as the truth conveys the reality of God the Father&#8217;s holiness, which is an attribute of the holy nature of God. Holiness is not God&#8217;s nature directly. Rather, holiness is an attribute of God&#8217;s nature, which is holy. The holy nature of God is conveyed in His word. Therefore, God&#8217;s word as the truth conveys the reality of God the Father&#8217;s holiness because it conveys the holy nature of God the Father. When we have the word as God&#8217;s reality, this word sanctifies us subjectively. This subjective sanctification is by the Spirit as the sanctifying power, with Christ as the sanctifying life, and in the word as the reality of God the Father&#8217;s holiness. The word carries God&#8217;s holy nature and imparts this nature into our being so that we may be sanctified subjectively.<h2 class=head4>(4) By the Father&#8217;s Discipline That They Might Partake of His Holiness-the Attribute of His Holy Nature</h2><p>Hebrews 12:10 tells us that God the Father disciplines us &#8220;for our profit that we might partake of His holiness.&#8221; This indicates that the believers are sanctified by the Father&#8217;s discipline that they might partake of His holiness-the attribute of His holy nature. To partake of the Father&#8217;s holiness is to partake of the attribute of His holy nature. The Father&#8217;s disciplining us so that we might partake of His holiness is related to the Spirit&#8217;s transformation work (2 Cor. 3:18), which is carried out through the divine dispensing inwardly and the environmental dealings outwardly.<h2 class=head4>(5) Through Their Pursuing of Holiness</h2><p>A number of verses in the New Testament speak of pursuing holiness. Hebrews 12:14 says, &#8220;Pursue peace with all men, and holiness without which no one shall see the Lord.&#8221; The proper Christian life must be a balance between peace and holiness. With God, holiness is an attribute of His holy nature; with us, it is our separation unto God. The implication here is that while we are pursuing peace with all men, we must also pay attention to the matter of holiness before God. Our pursuing peace with all men must be balanced by our holiness before God, our separation unto God, without which no one shall see the Lord and have fellowship with Him.<p>First Peter 1:15 says, &#8220;According to the Holy One who called you, you yourselves also become holy in all your manner of life.&#8221; The Holy One is the Triune God-the choosing Father, the redeeming Son, and the sanctifying Spirit (1 Pet. 1:1-2). The Father has regenerated His elect, imparting His holy nature into them (v. 3); the Son has redeemed them with His blood from the vain manner of life (vv. 18-19); and the Spirit has sanctified them according to the Father&#8217;s holy nature, separating them from anything other than God, that they, by the holy nature of the Father, may become holy in all their manner of life, even as holy as God Himself. We become holy in all our manner of life through the sanctification of the Spirit. This is based on regeneration, which brings us the holy nature of God and issues in a holy life.<p>Second Peter 3:11 says, &#8220;All these things being thus dissolved, what kind of persons ought you to be in holy manner of life and godliness.&#8221; Although all things whether on earth or in the heavens have been reconciled to God through Christ by His blood (Col. 1:20), the heavenly things having been purified by the blood of Christ (Heb. 9:23), they still need to be cleared up by being burned up in God&#8217;s governmental dealing so that they may become new in nature and appearance in God&#8217;s new universe (2 Pet. 3:13). Thus, what kind of persons ought we, the children of the holy God, to be in holy manner of life and godliness; that is, what kind of transformation ought we to have to live a life in the manner of God&#8217;s holy nature and godliness to express Him so that we may be qualified to match His holy government? How wonderful that the divine power has provided us with all things that are needed to live such a life in the holy manner and godliness (2 Pet. 1:3).<p>First Thessalonians 4:3 and 4 tell us that the will of God is our sanctification and that each of us should &#8220;know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor.&#8221; Sanctification refers to a holy condition before God, and honor, to a respectable standing before man. Verse 7 says, &#8220;God has not called us for uncleanness but in sanctification.&#8221; Since God has called us in sanctification, we must always remain in sanctification.<p>Second Timothy 2:21 says, &#8220;If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master, prepared unto every good work.&#8221; Here honor is a matter of nature, sanctified a matter of position, useful a matter of practice, and prepared a matter of training.<h2 class=head4>(6) Through Their Perfecting of Holiness</h2><p>The believers are sanctified also through their perfecting of holiness. In 2 Corinthians 7:1 Paul says, &#8220;Let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.&#8221; Holiness is separation unto God from all things other than Him. Perfecting holiness is to make this separation full and perfect, to have our entire being-spirit, soul, and body-fully and perfectly separated, sanctified, unto God (1 Thes. 5:23).<p>Holy means not only sanctified, separated, unto God; it also means different, distinct, from everything that is common. Only God is different, distinct, from all other things. Hence, He is holy. According to Ephesians 1:4, He chose us so that we would be holy. The way He makes us holy is to impart Himself, the holy One, into us so that our whole being may be permeated and saturated with His holy nature.<h2 class=head4>(7) To Be Sanctified Wholly in Their Body, Soul, and Spirit</h2><p>Finally, for the believers to be sanctified is for them to be sanctified wholly in their body, soul, and spirit. First Thessalonians 5:23 says, &#8220;The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221; The word &#8220;sanctified&#8221; here means to be set apart; it is to be separated unto God from things common or profane. The word &#8220;wholly&#8221; means entirely, thoroughly, to the consummation. God sanctifies us wholly, so that no part of our being, either of our spirit or soul or body, will be left common or profane. God sanctifies us first by taking possession of our spirit through regeneration (John 3:5-6); second, by spreading Himself as the life-giving Spirit from our spirit into our soul to saturate and transform it (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18); and last, by enlivening our mortal body through our soul (Rom. 8:11, 13) and transfiguring it by His life power (Phil. 3:21).<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(30)</h1><p>We have seen that in the progressing stage of God&#8217;s full salvation the believers experience God&#8217;s redemption continuously in being forgiven of their sins, washed, and sanctified. Now we shall see that the believers experience God&#8217;s redemption also in being justified and in being reconciled to God in the second step.<h2 class=head3>d. Justified</h2><p>In the continuous experience of God&#8217;s redemption the believers are first sanctified and then justified. Daily in our Christian life we need to be justified by the righteous God.<h2 class=head4>(1) In the Spirit</h2><p>The believers are justified in the Spirit. First Corinthians 6:11 says, &#8220;These things were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.&#8221; This washing, sanctifying, and justifying are inward and in life. Inwardly the Spirit works to justify the believers in life. First, we are washed from sinful things; second, we are sanctified, separated, unto God; and third, we are justified, accepted, by God.<h2 class=head4>(2) To Be Found in Christ</h2><p>If we would experience God&#8217;s redemption continuously in being justified, we need to be found in Christ. In Philippians 3:9 Paul aspired to &#8220;be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God based on faith.&#8221; This indicates that Paul aspired to have his whole being immersed in Christ and saturated with Christ so that all who observed him could find him in Christ. We also should aspire to be found by others in Christ. To be found in Christ actually means to be observed, seen, or discovered by others in Christ.<p>Being found in Christ is a matter of the practical experience of Christ. We need to live in Christ, remain in Christ, lodge in Christ, speak in Christ, act in Christ, and move in Christ, having our being in Christ. Then whenever an angel or a saint finds us, we shall be found in Christ. Furthermore, being found in Christ is not a once for all matter-it is a daily, even an hourly, matter. Day by day and hour by hour, we need to be found in Christ by those who are watching us.<p>In Philippians 3:9 Paul does not speak merely in a general way but in a very definite way. He says that he did not want to have his own righteousness, but he wanted the righteousness which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God based on faith. &#8220;Not having my own righteousness... but...the righteousness which is of God&#8221; is the condition in which Paul desired to be found in Christ. He wanted to live not in his own righteousness but in the righteousness of God and to be found in such a transcendent condition, expressing God by living Christ.<p>The righteousness which is of God based on faith is that righteousness which is God Himself in Christ lived out of us to be our righteousness through our faith in Christ. Such righteousness is the expression of God who lives in us. It is based on faith because it is on the basis, or condition, of faith. Faith is the basis, the condition, for us to receive and possess the righteousness out of God, the highest righteousness, which is Christ.<p>There is a requirement or condition for being found in Christ, and this condition is that we do not have our own righteousness, which is of the law, but that we have the righteousness which is of God based on faith. It may seem to us at times that we are found in Christ. However, there will be no reality in these times unless we fulfill the condition of having the righteousness of God through the faith of Christ. We need to be found in Christ in the righteousness of God through the faith of Christ.<h2 class=head5>(a) Christ Living Out of Them to Be Their Righteousness</h2><p>The righteousness which is the condition for the believers to be found in Christ is actually Christ Himself living out of them to be their righteousness. Christ is the righteousness by which we are justified by God (1 Cor. 1:30). Day by day we need Christ to be our righteousness. The more we gain Christ and live in Him, the more He as our righteousness will become our expression before both God and man. Then we shall not simply be found in Christ in a general way, but we shall be found in the very righteousness which is Christ Himself lived out of us.<h2 class=head5>(b) Christ Living a Righteous Life in Them</h2><p>As Christ lives Himself out of us, He lives a righteous life in us. In Titus 2:12 Paul tells us that &#8220;we should live soberly and righteously and godly in the present age.&#8221; This indicates that we need to live a righteous life through Christ. This is to live Christ as our righteousness so that we may be found in Him to be justified by God.<h2 class=head4>(3) By Works through Living the Divine Life as the Issue of the Divine Life</h2><p>In the continuous experience of God&#8217;s redemption, the believers are justified by works through living the divine life as the issue of the divine life. James 2:24 says, &#8220;A man is justified by works and not by faith only.&#8221; To be justified by faith is for receiving the divine life (Rom. 5:18); to be justified by works is through living the divine life. Since the living is the issue of life, to be justified by works is the issue of being justified by faith. Abraham&#8217;s offering of Isaac (Gen. 22:9) and Rahab&#8217;s receiving the messengers and thrusting them out (Josh. 2:1, 21; 6:23) are both works which issued from their living faith. A living tree surely brings forth fruit. To be justified by works does not contradict being justified by faith. The latter is the cause, bringing forth the first, and the first is the effect, the outcome and proof of the latter.<p>As we live the divine life, this living will issue in certain works. Then in our living we are justified by our works and not only by our faith. To be justified by faith is mainly objective, but to be justified by works is subjective in that these works are the issue of our living the divine life.<h2 class=head4>(4) To Be Made God&#8217;s Righteousness in Christ by Being Constituted of Christ as the Righteousness of God</h2><p>Eventually, the believers are made God&#8217;s righteousness in Christ (2 Cor. 5:21b). This means that we become righteous not only in our deeds and behavior but in our being. God desires to have a people on earth who are not only righteous persons; He wants a people, who, in the sight of God, the Devil, the angels, and the demons, are the very righteousness of God. To be made righteous before God is one thing; to be made God&#8217;s righteousness is another thing. By being constituted of Christ as the righteousness of God (Rom. 5:19b) we shall be made in Him God&#8217;s righteousness.<p>Second Corinthians 5:21 says, &#8220;Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf, that we might become God&#8217;s righteousness in Him.&#8221; Christ did not know sin in an experiential way by contact or personal experience. Nevertheless, Christ was made sin (not sinful) on our behalf to be judged by God (Rom. 8:3) that we might become God&#8217;s righteousness in Him.<p>Christ died on the cross not only for our sins but also as sin, having been made sin on our behalf by God. We were not only sinful-we were sin itself. We were the constitution of sin, the embodiment of sin. When Christ died for us as our Substitute, God considered Him not only the sin bearer but sin itself. Now in resurrection Christ comes into us as life, and this life lives within us to constitute us into the righteousness of God. In substitution Christ was made sin for us, and now, in His constitution, we become the righteousness of God in Him.<p>The phrase &#8220;in Him&#8221; in 2 Corinthians 5:21 means in union with Christ, not only positionally but organically in resurrection. We were enemies of God (Col. 1:21) by becoming sin, which came from the one who rebelled against God. Christ was made sin for us by becoming one with us through incarnation. When He died on the cross, God condemned Him in the flesh as sin for us so that we might be one with Him in His resurrection to be God&#8217;s righteousness. Therefore, in the organic union with Christ we are made the righteousness of God. This means that we not only become righteous; we are the righteousness of God. We not only become righteous persons; we become the very righteousness of God itself.<h2 class=head3>e. Reconciled to God in the Second Step</h2><p>Second Corinthians 5:19 and 20 indicate that there are two steps for the believers to be fully reconciled to God. The first step is as sinners to be reconciled to God from sin (v. 19). For this purpose Christ died for our sins (1 Cor. 15:3) that they may be forgiven by God. This is the objective aspect of Christ&#8217;s death. In this aspect He bore our sins on the cross and died there for our sins. The second step of reconciliation is as believers living in the natural life to be reconciled to God from the flesh (2 Cor. 5:20). For this purpose Christ died for us-the persons-that we may live to Him in the resurrection life (2 Cor. 5:14-15). This is the subjective aspect of Christ&#8217;s death. In this aspect He was made sin for us so that we might be judged and done away with by God in order that we may become the righteousness of God in Him (v. 21). By these two aspects of His death He has fully reconciled the believers to God.<p>These two steps of reconciliation are portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle in the Old Testament. The first veil is called the screen (Exo. 26:37, lit.). A sinner was brought to God through the reconciliation of the atoning blood to enter into the Holy Place by passing this screen. This typifies the first step of reconciliation. The second veil (Exo. 26:31-35; Heb. 9:3) still separated him from God, who is in the Holy of Holies. This veil needed to be rent that he may be brought to God in the Holy of Holies. This is the second step of reconciliation. In the progressing stage of God&#8217;s full salvation we are reconciled to Him in the second step.<h2 class=head4>(1) As Believers Living in the Natural Life, a Life according to the Flesh</h2><p>Most genuine Christians today have been reconciled to God only in the first step. They have been reconciled to God in part through Christ&#8217;s death on the cross for their sins. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were forgiven by God, reconciled to Him, and brought back to Him. Formerly we went astray from God, but through repentance we returned to Him and have been reconciled to Him. However, we have been reconciled to God only partly. Although we have been saved and reconciled to God in the first step, we still live according to the flesh (2 Cor. 5:16a); that is, we live in the flesh, in the soul, in the natural life. The veil of the flesh, of the natural man, still separates us from God. This means that our natural being is a separating veil. Therefore, we need the second step of reconciliation, the step in which the separating veil of the flesh is crucified so that we may enter into the Holy of Holies. This is full reconciliation, which brings us not only out of sin but also out of the flesh, the natural man, the natural being, so that we may be brought back to God and become one with Him.<p>The second step of reconciliation is much deeper than the first step, for it takes place not in the outer court outside the tabernacle but within the Holy Place inside the tabernacle. Instead of taking place once for all, this kind of reconciliation is continuous. If you consider your experience, you will realize that no matter how long you have been a seeking Christian, you still have the sense deep within that you are separated from God&#8217;s presence by something, mainly by your natural life, your old man, your self. You may be very good, nice, pious, &#8220;holy,&#8221; and &#8220;spiritual,&#8221; yet you know that there is still something separating you from God&#8217;s presence. You are not fully one with God, altogether in harmony with Him. Instead, because you are still separated from Him, you need the second step of reconciliation. You need the application of the subjective death of Christ to your situation. In other words, the subjective death of Christ needs to be applied to your natural life. This application of the subjective death of Christ crucifies your natural life, rending the veil that separates you from God&#8217;s inner presence.<p>If we are sincere and honest with God in our seeking of Him, we shall realize that this is our situation. This is the reason that often we begin our prayer with confession. We may say, &#8220;Father, I confess that I am still separated from You. In a sense, I am with You, but in a deeper sense I am not with You. I am separated from You not by something sinful but by my natural life. Father, forgive me, and grant mercy to me that I may apply the subjective death of Christ to my inward being to such an extent that my natural life will be thoroughly crucified.&#8221; This is to experience the rending of the veil within us so that, through the rent veil of the natural life, we may be reconciled to the inner presence of God the Father.<p>In order that we may be reconciled to God in full, the Father exposes our natural life and unveils our real situation to us. As a result, we condemn our natural being and apply the cross subjectively. Then as our natural man is crossed out, we experience the second step of reconciliation. In this step the veil of our natural man is rent so that we may live in God&#8217;s presence.<h2 class=head4>(2) Through the Death (for the Believers Themselves) of Christ Who Was Made Sin for Them</h2><p>The believers are reconciled to God in the second step through the death of Christ not for the believers&#8217; sins but for the believers themselves. The New Testament reveals that Christ died for our sins and for us. Christ&#8217;s death for our sins is an objective matter, whereas Christ&#8217;s death for us is a subjective matter. In 2 Corinthians 5 Paul does not say that Christ died for our sins; rather, he says that Christ died for us, for our being. &#8220;The love of Christ constrains us, having judged this, that One died on behalf of all; therefore all died; and He died on behalf of all, that those who live may no longer live to themselves, but to Him who died for them and has been raised&#8221; (vv. 14-15). In order to die for the believers themselves, Christ was made sin for them (v. 21a). When Christ died for our sins, He bore our sins. But when Christ died for us, He was made sin for us.<h2 class=head4>(3) By God Entreating through the Apostles as Ambassadors of Christ</h2><p>The believers are reconciled to God in the second step by God entreating them through the apostles as ambassadors of Christ. In 2 Corinthians 5:20 Paul says, &#8220;On behalf of Christ, then, we are ambassadors, as God entreating through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God.&#8221; Here Paul is speaking to the Corinthians, who were still living in their natural life. They were believers, saved ones, and Paul addressed them as saints (1 Cor. 1:2). But although they were saints, they were living in the natural life. Their natural life was a veil separating them from God&#8217;s presence, and it was necessary for this veil to be riven. Hence, as God&#8217;s ambassador Paul beseeched them to be reconciled to God. Paul, an ambassador sent by God, was working with God to reconcile God&#8217;s people, who were still in the natural life, to God in His inner presence, that is, in the Holy of Holies. Here we see that God entreats the believers through the apostles as ambassadors of Christ to be fully reconciled to Himself.<h2 class=head4>(4) To Become God&#8217;s Righteousness in Christ</h2><p>Finally, the believers are reconciled to God in the second step in order to become God&#8217;s righteousness in Christ (2 Cor. 5:21b). Eventually, those who have been brought back to God in the Holy of Holies will experience and enjoy Him in the triune dispensing to such an extent that they will become His righteousness in Christ. This means that, in the organic union with Christ, those who have been reconciled to God in the second step become the very righteousness of God.<p>When we were saved, we went through the process of being forgiven, washed, sanctified, justified, and reconciled. Now in our Christian walk this process needs to be repeated continuously until the redemption of our body. Every day we need to be forgiven, washed, sanctified, justified, and reconciled.<p>The believers&#8217; continuous experience of God&#8217;s redemption is illustrated by the children of Israel&#8217;s offering of the sin offering and the trespass offering. Whenever they offered the burnt offering for God&#8217;s satisfaction, they also had to offer the sin offering and the trespass offering. These offerings were presented morning and evening and also on feast days. Today, as believers in Christ, we need to offer Christ daily as our sin offering and trespass offering. We need Christ as these offerings because we have been stained by the natural life, the old man, the flesh, the lust of the flesh, and worldliness. Therefore, because of our sins and trespasses and because of our sinful nature, we need Christ as our trespass offering and sin offering. Throughout our Christian life we need God&#8217;s forgiveness, washing, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation. While we are enjoying the triune dispensing of the processed Triune God, we need to experience God&#8217;s redemption continuously.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(31)</h1><p>According to the revelation in the New Testament, the first matter in the progressing stage of God&#8217;s full salvation, the stage of transformation, is experiencing and enjoying the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing. We experience and enjoy God as the Father in His love, Christ as the Son in His grace, and the Spirit as the consummation of the divine Trinity in His fellowship (2 Cor. 13:14).<p>Matthew 28:19 strongly indicates that we may experience and enjoy the processed Triune God. In this verse the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; The name here is the sum total of the divine Being and is equivalent to His person. To baptize a believer into the name of the Triune God is to baptize him into all that the Triune God is. Furthermore, the word &#8220;into&#8221; indicates union, the union between the believers and the Triune God. To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to bring them into a spiritual and mystical union with Him. This is an organic union between us, the children of God, and the Triune God. Such a union implies much experience and enjoyment. Therefore, with the truth of the divine revelation as our basis, we can say that the first item of the progressing stage of God&#8217;s salvation is that the believers experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing.<p>This is confirmed by our actual Christian experience. Although we may not have used the words &#8220;experience&#8221; and &#8220;enjoy,&#8221; after we were baptized into the Triune God, we began to experience Him and enjoy Him. For example, we experienced the Father in prayer, enjoying His faithfulness, kindness, and love, which is the source of all the divine blessings. We also experienced and enjoyed Christ the Son as our portion and as the One living in us. Moreover, we experienced the Spirit as the reality of Christ for our enjoyment, and we experienced and enjoyed the Spirit&#8217;s work in us, upon us, and for us. Hence, from both the truth of the Word and our Christian experience we know that we may experience and enjoy the Triune God.<p>As we experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing, we also experience God&#8217;s redemption continuously in being forgiven, washed, sanctified, justified, and reconciled. This is to apply God&#8217;s redemption not occasionally and not only continually-that is, frequently but with interruptions-but continuously-that is, constantly without any interruptions. As we contact God moment by moment, we apply His redemption continuously.<p>First John 1:1-9 indicates that the experience and enjoyment of the Triune God and the continuous application of God&#8217;s redemption is related to a cycle in our spiritual life. This cycle is formed of four crucial things-the eternal life, the fellowship of the eternal life, the divine light, and the blood of Jesus the Son of God. Eternal life issues in the fellowship of the divine life, the fellowship of eternal life brings in the divine light, and the divine light increases the need of the blood of Jesus the Son of God so that we may have more eternal life. The more we have of eternal life, the more of its fellowship it brings to us. The more fellowship of the divine life we enjoy, the more divine light we receive. The more divine light we receive, the more we participate in the cleansing of the blood of Jesus. Such a cycle brings us onward in the growth of the divine life until we reach its maturity.<p>The eternal life we have received brings us into the divine fellowship, and the divine fellowship brings us into the divine light. In the divine light we are exposed and see our defects, shortcomings, and sinfulness. Then, realizing that we need God&#8217;s forgiveness and the cleansing of the blood of Jesus, we make our confession to the Lord. In His faithfulness and righteousness, God forgives us our sins and cleanses us from all unrighteousness. Through this forgiveness and cleansing we are brought deeper into the divine life and into the fellowship of the divine life, and then into a deeper realization of our shortcomings, a deeper confession, and a deeper experience of forgiveness and cleansing. By this cycle, which continues in a deeper way day by day and even moment by moment, we grow in the divine life.<p>The believers&#8217; experience in the progressing of God&#8217;s full salvation is according to this cycle. First, we experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing. Second, we experience God&#8217;s redemption continuously. Third, we enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation. In this message we shall begin to consider this dispensing in the divine transformation for the divine conformation.<h2 class=head2>3. Experiencing the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the Divine Transformation for the Divine Conformation</h2><p>The enjoyment of the Father in His love, of the Son in His grace, and of the Spirit in His fellowship is a matter of God&#8217;s dispensing (2 Cor. 13:14). The enjoyment of the processed Triune God in love, grace, and fellowship is for transformation, and transformation results in conformation. Transformation is a matter of essence, whereas conformation is a matter of form. Christ has a form, an image, and we need to be conformed to His form.<h2 class=head3>a. By Being Transformed</h2><p>The believers enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by being transformed. Second Corinthians 3:18 says, &#8220;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&#8221; To be transformed is to have Christ added into our being to replace what we are so that Christ may increase and our natural life may decrease. As the process of transformation takes place within us, the old element of our natural being is carried away, and the glory, the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit, is added into us to replace the natural element. The process of transformation is both organic and metabolic. It is organic because it is related to life, and it is metabolic because it is related to a process in which an old element is discharged and a new element is added.<p>There is a difference between change and transformation. Transformation involves the process of metabolism. However, something may change in an outward way without any inward metabolic transformation. In the process of metabolism a new element is supplied to an organism. This new element replaces the old element and causes it to be discharged. Therefore, as the process of metabolism takes place within a living organism, something new is added to it to replace the old element, which is carried away. Metabolism thus includes three matters:<p>first, the supplying of a new element; second, the replacing of the old element with this new element; and third, the discharge or the removal of the old element so that something new may be produced.<p>Transformation is a metabolic process, a metabolic change. The Spirit&#8217;s work in transforming us involves a change in our whole being-in life, nature, essence, element, form, and appearance. Transformation is not outward change, correction, or adjustment; transformation is altogether an inward, metabolic change of our being. Therefore, we may define transformation as a divine, spiritual metabolism wherein a new element is added to the old to discharge the old and to produce something new.<h2 class=head4>(1) Having Been Freed from the Bondage of the Law by the Spirit of the Lord</h2><p>As those who are being transformed, we have been freed from the bondage of the law by the Spirit of the Lord. &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:17). According to the context of 2 Corinthians 3, this freedom is the freedom from the bondage of the letters of the Old Testament law, that is, the written code of the Old Testament. At Paul&#8217;s time the Judaizers and those influenced by them were bound by the traditional code of the law. But the Lord Jesus came to release His followers from this bondage, in particular from the Judaic fold that was formed according to the code of the law in the Old Testament. All those who followed the Lord Jesus were freed from that bondage. Later, the Lord appeared to one of the strongest Judaizers, Saul of Tarsus, called him, and brought him out of the bondage of the law. Therefore, in 2 Corinthians 3:17 Paul could say that we have been freed from this bondage by the Spirit of the Lord.<p>We know that we are freed by the Spirit because where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. Now the Spirit of the Lord is with us, and we have full liberty, full freedom, from the bondage of the Old Testament code of the law.<p>The Lord being the Spirit is to free us from regulations, rituals, religious teachings, and traditional doctrines. At Paul&#8217;s time the Jews were under the bondage of circumcision, the bondage of dietary regulations, and the bondage of the Sabbath and other Old Testament regulations. Today, however, is not the age of the law of letters but the age of the Lord Jesus being the pneumatic Christ, the Spirit. Moses, with the letter of the law, put the people under bondage-the bondage of keeping the Sabbath, the bondage of circumcision, the bondage of dietary regulations, the bondage of not contacting Gentiles, and many other bondages. But the Lord being the Spirit is freedom to us. With Him there is no bondage, no Sabbath, no circumcision, and no dietary regulations. Rather, with Him there is full freedom. The Lord is the Spirit, and He is our freedom. When the heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away, and then the Lord as the Spirit gives us freedom. Because the Lord is the Spirit who gives freedom, when the heart turns to Him, the heart is freed from the bondage of the letter of the law.<h2 class=head4>(2) With Unveiled Face</h2><p>Second Corinthians 3:18 speaks of beholding and reflecting &#8220;with unveiled face.&#8221; Here &#8220;unveiled face&#8221; is in contrast to the veiled mind, the veiled heart, in verses 14 and 15. This indicates that our heart has turned to the Lord so that the veil has been taken away (v. 16), and the Lord as the Spirit has freed us from the bondage, the veiling, of the law so that there is no longer any insulation between us and the Lord.<p>Paul&#8217;s word about beholding and reflecting with unveiled face was written with his background in Judaism in mind. Paul knew from his experience that the Jews were veiled by their religion. The veil in 2 Corinthians 3, therefore, refers specifically to religious traditions or traditional religion. The veil on the hearts of the Jews was the old, traditional religion. When they read the Old Testament, their hearts were veiled by religious tradition.<p>In order to be transformed, we need to be mirrors beholding the Lord and reflecting Him. However, if we would be mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord, we must not have any veils over us. Suppose a mirror is proper in every way. It is in the right position with respect to the object it is to behold and reflect. But the mirror is covered with a veil. As long as a mirror is covered with cloth, veiled, it loses its function. The veil keeps the mirror both from beholding and from reflecting. Likewise, if we are veiled, we cannot behold and reflect the Lord&#8217;s glory.<p>We should not assume that we do not have any veils. From experience we know that there are different kinds of veils. Many believers cannot behold and reflect the Lord because they are veiled by religious concepts. In addition to the religious concepts that veil people, every person is veiled by certain natural concepts or ideas. Often these veils are related to the kind of people we are by our natural constitution. Furthermore, we may be veiled by our racial and national character. The various national characters, dispositions, habits, and customs are veils that keep us from beholding and reflecting the Lord. Instead of taking it for granted that we are fully unveiled, we need to look to the Lord and pray for mercy that all the veils will be taken away so that we may behold and reflect the Lord. If we want to be unveiled, we should pray, &#8220;Lord, I want to be completely open, absolutely unveiled. Take away anything that is covering me. O Lord, remove my veils!&#8221; Then with an unveiled face we shall behold and reflect the glory of the Lord and shall be transformed into His image.<h2 class=head4>(3) By Beholding and Reflecting the Glory of the Lord</h2><p>The believers are being transformed by beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord. In 2 Corinthians 3:18 the words &#8220;beholding and reflecting as a mirror&#8221; are the translation of a single word in Greek. The use of this word in 3:18 is metaphorical. On the one hand, a mirror beholds a person or an object. On the other hand, a mirror reflects what it beholds. These are the two aspects of the function of a mirror. Beholding is to see the Lord for ourselves; reflecting is for others to see the Lord through us.<p>The glory in 3:18, the glory of the new covenant, comprises many elements. It is the glory of the Lord as the resurrected and ascended One, the One who is both God and man. This One passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion, entered into resurrection, having accomplished a full redemption, and became a life-giving Spirit. As the life-giving Spirit, the resurrected Christ dwells in us to make Himself and all He has accomplished, obtained, and attained real to us so that we may be one with Him and may be transformed into His image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.<p>We have pointed out that transformation involves metabolism and that metabolism includes the supplying of a new element to replace what is old. This new element is the glory of the Lord, which is actually the resurrected Christ Himself. The resurrected Christ with all His riches is the new element added to us for our transformation. This element, the resurrected Christ with His riches, is the glory of the Lord.<p>Today the glory is the resurrected Christ, and this Christ is the Spirit. This means that the Lord as the glory is the Spirit living in us and dwelling in our spirit. Now that we have the Spirit indwelling our spirit, we need to exercise our spirit more and more by praying, reading the Word, and calling on the name of the Lord. The more we exercise our spirit with an unveiled face, the more we shall behold the Lord. As we are gazing on Him, we shall also reflect Him. While we are beholding and reflecting Him in this way, His element will be added into our being. This new element will replace and discharge the element of our old, natural life, and we shall experience transformation, a metabolic change.<h2 class=head4>(4) Into the Image of Christ</h2><p>In 3:18 Paul tells us that we are in the process of being transformed into &#8220;the same image.&#8221; This is the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ. The &#8220;same image&#8221; means that we are being conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, being made the same as He is.<p>When we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the element of what He is and what He has done. In other words, He dispenses this element into us. The result is that we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence. We are then transformed into His image.<p>The constitution of life involves the life essence, the life power, and the life shape. Every kind of life has these three things-the essence, the power, and the shape. For example, a carnation flower has an essence and a power. Therefore, it is formed into a certain shape. As it grows with the life essence and by the life power, it is shaped into a particular form. It is the same with the divine life. This life has its essence, power, and shape. The shape of the divine life is the image of Christ. Thus, in 3:18 we have the thought of being transformed into the same image, the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ. This means that we shall be shaped into the image of Christ. Based upon this fact and upon Paul&#8217;s use of the word &#8220;transformed,&#8221; we may speak of being metabolically constituted into the image of Christ.<h2 class=head4>(5) From Glory to Glory</h2><p>In 3:18 Paul also tells us that we are being transformed into the same image &#8220;from glory to glory.&#8221; This means that we are being transformed from one degree of glory to another degree. This indicates an ongoing process of life in resurrection. Transformation does not happen once for all; rather, it is gradual, from one degree of glory to another.<p>We need to see that the glory in 3:18 is actually Christ blossoming in resurrection. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was God incarnate. God was concealed within the physical body of the Lord Jesus. Inwardly there was God; outwardly there was the flesh, and with this flesh there was no glory. In John 17:1 the Lord Jesus prayed, &#8220;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&#8221; When the Lord Jesus prayed that the Father would glorify Him, He actually prayed that He would enter into glory through death and resurrection. In Luke 24:26 He asked the two disciples on the way to Emmaus, &#8220;Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?&#8221; When the Lord Jesus spoke these words, He was already in resurrection. Thus, for Him to enter into His glory was for Him to be in resurrection. This verse reveals clearly that Christ&#8217;s resurrection was His glorification.<p>We may use the blossoming of a carnation flower as an illustration of the glory in 2 Corinthians 3:18 being Christ&#8217;s blossoming in resurrection. After a carnation seed is sown into the earth, the seed dies and then it begins to grow up. It sprouts, grows into a plant, and eventually blossoms. This blossoming is the glorification of the carnation seed. Because a carnation seed dies when it is sown into the soil, we may say that its blossoming is its resurrection. Glorification, therefore, is equal to resurrection. Christ&#8217;s resurrection was His blossoming. This blossoming Christ, the resurrected Christ, is glory. Furthermore, this Christ as the glory is the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, we may go on to say that the glory in 3:18 is actually the life-giving Spirit. Now we are in the process of being transformed from this glory to this glory. The more we live and walk in the life-giving Spirit, the more glory is added into our being, and the more we are transformed into the same image from glory to glory. To be transformed from glory to glory far surpasses a mere outward improvement of behavior according to religious or ethical teachings.<h2 class=head4>(6) Even as from the Lord Spirit</h2><p>Finally, we are told in 3:18 that we are being transformed &#8220;even as from the Lord Spirit.&#8221; The word &#8220;from&#8221; here indicates that transformation is proceeding from the Spirit rather than caused by Him. The Lord Spirit may be considered a compound title like the Father God and the Lord Christ. This expression again strongly proves and confirms that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Lord Christ.<p>In order for the Spirit to do His transforming work in us, there is the need for a certain essence to be dispensed into us by the Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit is working in us to transform us in life, nature, essence, element, form, appearance, and every aspect of our being by the dispensing into us of the divine life, nature, element, and essence. This means that the divine life, nature, essence, element, and being are dispensed by the Spirit into our life, nature, essence, element, and being to cause a metabolic change within us. This change is organic, for it is a change in our being by another being, in our life by another life, in our nature by another nature, and in our element and essence by another element and essence. This transformation is from the Lord Spirit.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(32)</h1><p>In the foregoing message we saw that the believers are being transformed, having been freed from the bondage of the law by the Spirit of the Lord. Now, with unveiled face, we are transformed by beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord into the image of Christ from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18). In this message we shall consider three further matters related to transformation. Then we shall go on to consider the believers&#8217; being conformed to the image of Christ.<h2 class=head4>(7) By the Renewing of Their Mind</h2><p>Because we are of three parts-spirit, soul, and body- the Lord in His salvation takes three steps to deal with us: regeneration in our spirit, transformation in our soul, and transfiguration in our body. The Lord starts His salvation from the center by regenerating us in our spirit (John 3:6). When we received Christ, the Spirit of the Lord came into our spirit to regenerate us by imparting Christ into our spirit as life. By this divine act not only was our deadened spirit made alive, but the life of God with its divine nature was put into it. As a result, a change of life began from the center of our being. Now it is the Lord&#8217;s desire that this change of life continue by spreading into our soul so that our mind, emotion, and will may be transformed. Our spirit has been regenerated, but our mind, emotion, and will may still be the same. This means that we have Christ as life in our spirit, but we do not yet have Christ in our soul. We need Him to expand continually from our spirit into our soul till every part of our soul is transformed into His image. Then we shall think as He thinks, love as He loves, and choose as He chooses. We shall have the likeness of the Lord in our practical life because our soul has been thoroughly saturated with His divine element. Therefore, as believers, we need the renewing or the transformation of the soul.<p>Romans 12:2 says, &#8220;Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&#8221; To be conformed to this age means to adopt the modern fashions outwardly; to be transformed is to have an organic element wrought into our being to produce a metabolic change inwardly. We need to be transformed by the renewing of our mind.<p>The mind in Romans 12 is different from the mind both in Romans 7 and Romans 8. In Romans 7 the mind is alone, acting independently. In Romans 8 the mind is dependent, being set on the spirit. The mind, however, should not only be dependent but also be renewed. Romans 12:2 tells us that we need a renewed mind. The mind is renewed not only by outward teachings but by the element of Christ being added to it. When the Lord Jesus spreads Himself from our spirit into our mind, our mind is renewed. Then by the renewing of the mind our soul is metabolically changed. In this way we experience transformation in our soul.<p>It is quite possible for us to be regenerated in the spirit but still be old in the mind, emotion, and will. If our mind remains old, we are not being transformed in the soul. There is no change in our thinking, loving, and choosing. In these things we are the same as unbelievers. The only difference is that we have been regenerated in the spirit and they have not. As far as the soul is concerned, our way of thinking, loving, and choosing is the same as theirs. But if our mind is renewed, our soul will be transformed.<p>Because Christ is in our spirit, when our mind submits to the spirit, it is actually submitting to Christ. This gives Him the opportunity to expand from our spirit into our mind and to permeate, fill, and renew it with Himself. In this way our soul is transformed by the renewing of our mind. After we are renewed in the mind, we shall automatically be renewed in the emotion and in the will, for the mind adjusts the emotion, and the will is influenced by the mind. If our mind is opened to the Lord, the emotion and the will surely will follow. Furthermore, if the mind is saturated and occupied by the Lord, the Lord will certainly take over our emotion and possess our will. It is for this reason we are told in Romans 12:2 that the transformation of the soul is by the renewing of the mind.<h2 class=head4>(8) In the Spirit of Their Mind</h2><p>The believers are being transformed in the spirit of their mind (Eph. 4:23). Between the word regarding the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man (Eph. 4:22, 24), Paul wedges in the thought of being renewed in the spirit of our mind. Based upon the accomplished facts of the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man, Ephesians 4:23 tells us to be renewed in the spirit of our mind. To be renewed is for our transformation to the image of Christ (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18). The spirit here is the regenerated spirit of the believers mingled with the indwelling Spirit of God. Such a mingled spirit spreads into our mind, thus becoming the spirit of our mind. It is in such a spirit that we are renewed for our transformation. In this way our natural mind is conquered, subdued, and put under the spirit. This, of course, implies a process of metabolic transformation. As this process takes place, the mingled spirit enters our mind, takes over our mind, and becomes the spirit of our mind.<p>By the spirit of the mind we are renewed to fulfill in experience what was accomplished in the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man. The putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man are accomplished facts. Now we must experience and realize these facts by being renewed in the spirit of our mind.<p>To be renewed is not to be adjusted, corrected, or improved in a mere outward way. It is to have a new element, the divine element, wrought into us. For something to be renewed means that the old element is replaced by a new element. Our spirit is a renewing spirit because it is indwelt by the living Christ as the renewing element. Because we have the element of newness in our spirit, we can be renewed in the spirit of the mind as the renewing spirit spreads into our mind. The more we turn to the spirit of the mind and walk in the spirit of the mind, the more our mind will be renewed. Then in a practical way the old element is replaced by the new element. The old element, the element of Adam, is discharged, and the new element, the element of Christ, is added to take its place.<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that when our mind is taken over by our spirit, our human spirit becomes the spirit of the mind. In a very real sense, our regenerated spirit, mingled with the Holy Spirit, not only influences our mind but overrules and dominates it. The spirit&#8217;s spreading itself into the mind to take over the mind and thus become the spirit of the mind is for continuous transformation. First, transformation takes place in our mind and then in our emotion and will.<h2 class=head4>(9) To Become Precious Materials- Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones- for the Building Up of the Church</h2><p>As the result of being transformed by the renewing of the mind, the believers become precious materials-gold, silver, and precious stones-for the building up of the church (1 Cor. 3:9b-10, 12a). In 1 Corinthians 3:12 Paul speaks of building &#8220;on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones.&#8221; Gold, silver, and precious stones signify various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God. Gold signifies the divine nature of the Father with all its attributes; silver, the redeeming and life-secreting Christ with all the virtues and attributes of His person and work; and precious stones, the transforming work of the Spirit with all His attributes. These precious materials are the products of our participation in and enjoyment of Christ in our spirit through the Holy Spirit. Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God. With the Triune God we have God the Father as the gold, the redemption and life-secreting of God the Son as the silver, and the transforming work of God the Spirit as precious stones.<p>It is significant that Paul mentions only three categories of precious materials-gold, silver, and precious stones-for these correspond to the Three of the Triune God. Gold, the first of the precious materials mentioned by Paul, refers to the first of the Trinity, God the Father. Gold signifies neither redemption nor transformation; rather, as a precious element, it signifies something that does not change or become corrupt in nature. Gold always remains the same. Hence, in the Bible gold signifies the nature of God the Father. The divine nature, like gold, never changes.<p>In Exodus 30 we see that silver was used to redeem the life of God&#8217;s people. Silver signifies the redemption accomplished by Christ the Son, the second of the Trinity. Therefore, the silver in 1 Corinthians 3:12 refers to the redemption of Christ. According to the New Testament, Christ&#8217;s redemption first terminates us. When Christ died on the cross to redeem us, He terminated us. Whatever Christ terminates, He also redeems, brings back to God. Thus, being brought back to God comes after termination. Furthermore, whatever Christ terminates and redeems He then replaces with Himself. Redemption, therefore, involves termination, being brought back to God, and being replaced with what Christ is.<p>The precious stones are related to the transforming work of the Holy Spirit. Every precious stone is a transformed substance. At one time it used to be some other material, perhaps clay or carbon. Then as a result of intense heat and pressure this material has been transformed into precious stone. Thus, precious stones indicate transformation. According to 2 Corinthians 3:18, we are transformed by the Lord Spirit. This reveals clearly that transformation is the work of the Spirit. Therefore, the third item of the precious materials mentioned in 1 Corinthians 3:12 refers to the third of the Trinity, the Spirit.<p>In experience the precious stones are the totality of gold and silver. When in our spiritual experience we have the nature of God and the redemptive and life-secreting work of Christ, the result will be the transformation of the Holy Spirit. This means that the Spirit transforms us by the divine nature and the cross of Christ. To experience the transforming work of the Spirit is to undergo a metabolic change by the divine life within us.<p>Through the process of transformation we are being constituted of the Triune God-constituted of the Father&#8217;s nature, the Son&#8217;s redemption, and the Spirit&#8217;s transformation. When we receive the Triune God, when we take Him into us by drinking Him and eating Him, when we are transfused with Him and by Him, the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-comes into us to be our element and substance. This causes a metabolic process to take place within us by which a new element is added and an old element is discharged. This is transformation.<p>By the way of implication Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 3 that through growth plants can become minerals. First we have the growth on God&#8217;s farm (v. 9). Then the plants grown on this farm become the precious materials for God&#8217;s building. We are God&#8217;s farm, and this farm produces plants. But as these divine plants grow, their growth brings in transformation. As a result, the plants grown on God&#8217;s farm are transformed to become the materials for God&#8217;s building.<p>The church is a farm which produces gold, silver, and precious stones. This implies that as the plants on God&#8217;s farm grow, they become minerals. The plants, of course, are botanical in nature. But as they grow, they are transformed into minerals. Whatever is grown on God&#8217;s farm will be transformed in nature. Transformation does not involve mere outward change but an inward, organic, metabolic change, a change in which a new element is added into our being to replace the old element. As the current of the divine life flows within us, the divine essence is added to us, the divine essence of the elements of gold, silver, and precious stones. The more this current flows in us, the more we have the increase, the enlargement, of the divine essence. This enlargement causes transformation. Eventually, we not only grow as plants but are transformed into precious materials for God&#8217;s building.<h2 class=head3>b. By Being Conformed</h2><p>Transformation issues in conformation (Rom. 8:29), which is higher than transformation. Transformation is inward and is a matter of essence. Conformation is outward and is a matter of shape. Transformation involves a change in form, whereas conformation involves the shaping of this form into a certain image, the image of Christ. Christ has an image, and we need to be conformed to it. For us to be transformed means that we have a change in form. For us to be conformed means that our form is changed into Christ&#8217;s form, into His image.<p>Sanctification, transformation, and conformation cannot be separated, for they are interrelated. The Lord is sanctifying us and transforming us so that we may be conformed to His image. Conformation comes through transformation, and transformation results in conformation.<h2 class=head4>(1) To the Image of God&#8217;s Firstborn Son</h2><p>The believers are being conformed to the image of God&#8217;s firstborn Son. Romans 8:29 tells us, &#8220;Whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers.&#8221; Hence, we are being conformed not simply to the image of God&#8217;s Son but to the image of God&#8217;s firstborn Son.<p>Christ&#8217;s divine sonship has two aspects: the aspect of the only begotten Son and the aspect of the firstborn Son. As the only begotten Son, Christ is unique, but as the firstborn Son of God, He is the first among many sons. Romans 8:29 tells us definitely that we are being conformed to the image of God&#8217;s firstborn Son. Christ&#8217;s resurrection was His birth as God&#8217;s firstborn Son. Acts 13:33 reveals that to the man Jesus resurrection was a birth. He was begotten by God in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God among many brothers. He was the only begotten Son of God from eternity (John 1:18; 3:16). After incarnation and through resurrection He was begotten by God in His humanity to be God&#8217;s firstborn Son. In His incarnation Christ was born of Mary, and in resurrection He had another birth. When Christ was born of Mary, He was born as a man, and His humanity had nothing to do with God&#8217;s sonship. Strictly speaking, the human part of Jesus was not the Son of God but the Son of Man. Therefore, it was necessary for the human part of the Lord Jesus to be born into the divine sonship through resurrection. Hence, Christ&#8217;s resurrection was a new birth for Him. He was already the only begotten Son of God before His incarnation. Then through incarnation He was born to be a man. Later, in resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God. This was prophesied in Psalm 2:7: &#8220;Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.&#8221; Acts 13:33, which quotes from Psalm 2:7, indicates that Christ was begotten as the Son of God on the day of His resurrection. He needed to be begotten by resurrection because He had put on humanity. As to His divinity there was no need for Him to be begotten as the Son of God, but as to His humanity there was the need for this. On the day of Christ&#8217;s resurrection His human nature was uplifted and transfigured into a glorious substance. This was the begetting by resurrection. In this way the Lord Jesus was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God.<p>Christ&#8217;s being the firstborn Son of God implies that He has many brothers and that He is the Firstborn among these brothers. The birth that took place through Christ&#8217;s resurrection involved the birth not only of an individual but of a group, a group that includes the firstborn Son of God and all the believers as the many sons of God. This indicates that through one birth, one delivery, many sons of God were brought forth. According to God&#8217;s view, all His chosen people were born together with Christ in His resurrection. This is the reason 1 Peter 1:3 says that we have been regenerated through the resurrection of Christ. When Christ was resurrected, we were regenerated. We were all brought forth by means of a single universal delivery. In Christ&#8217;s resurrection millions of God&#8217;s sons were born to be the brothers of Christ, the firstborn Son of God.<p>As believers in Christ, we all are sons of God and brothers of the firstborn Son. Through regeneration we have the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). Although we are human beings, we now have the divine nature. Although the Lord Jesus is divine, He also has the human nature. This means that both the Lord Jesus and we are the same in that both He and we have the human nature and the divine nature. Now we are being conformed to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God. He, the firstborn Son, is the prototype, and we, the many sons, are the mass production. Christ is the mold, the model, the pattern. God has put us into Him so that we may be molded, conformed, into the image of the firstborn Son. Eventually we all shall be conformed to this mold, to this image.<p>Romans 1:3 and 4 say, &#8220;Concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, and was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.&#8221; In these verses Christ, the Son of God, is the prototype, whereas in 8:29 the many brothers are those who have been mass produced from the prototype. In 1:4 the one Son is designated, but in 8:29 the many sons are conformed. The designation of the one Son is related to the prototype; the conformation of the many sons is the work of mass production. Having gained the firstborn Son as the prototype, God is now seeking to have the mass production in order to produce many sons in the image of the Firstborn.<p>Although we have been regenerated to be the sons of God and we have the appearance of God&#8217;s sons in some respects, in most respects we do not yet have this appearance. For this reason, we need to be saved in the life of Christ (Rom. 5:10) from self-likeness, that is, from the expression, the appearance, of the self. The expression of our self is our self-likeness. How much we need to be saved from our self-likeness in order to bear the appearance of God&#8217;s sons! To be saved from our self-likeness is to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God. Therefore, when we have been saved from our self-likeness and have been fully conformed to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God, we shall be sons of God in reality, and in every respect we shall bear the appearance of His sons.<h2 class=head4>(2) According to God&#8217;s Predestination</h2><p>Romans 8:29 tells us that God predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son. As called and justified ones (v. 30), our destiny has been determined beforehand by God. Before the foundation of the world, God predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son. This means that conformation to Christ is our destiny and also our destination. Our destiny is not heaven-it is to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God.<p>We have been predestinated to be conformed to the image of God&#8217;s firstborn Son so that He may be the Firstborn among many brothers. This is God&#8217;s purpose-to produce many brothers of His firstborn Son for His expression. When Christ was the only begotten Son, He was unique. But God desired to have many sons who will be the many brothers of His Son. In this way the only begotten Son of God becomes the Firstborn among many brothers. He is the firstborn Son, and we, according to God&#8217;s predestination, are the many sons who are being conformed to the image of the Firstborn. God&#8217;s purpose in this is that we express Him in a corporate way. Hence, for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s purpose, He predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son.<h2 class=head4>(3) As the Many Brothers of God&#8217;s Firstborn Son in the Process of Maturity</h2><p>Those who are being conformed to the image of God&#8217;s firstborn Son are the believers as the many brothers of God&#8217;s firstborn Son in the process of maturity. We are presently in the process of maturity, that is, in the process of transformation and conformation. When this process has been completed, we shall reach maturity. Therefore, maturity is the full extent of the process of transformation for conformation.<p>We are now in the process of being conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God. This conformation takes place through transformation. The more we are transformed, the more we are conformed. Transformation, a metabolic change, issues in conformation.<p>Through the process of transformation and conformation we become more and more like Christ, our elder Brother. He has both the divine nature and the human nature, and we, His many brothers, have both the human nature and the divine nature. Concerning this, Hebrews 2:11 says, &#8220;Both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers.&#8221; He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers in Christ as the many sons of God. To say that He and we are all &#8220;of one&#8221; refers to the Father as the source. Both the firstborn Son and the many sons of God have been born of the same Father in resurrection. Therefore, the firstborn Son and the many sons have one source, one life, one nature, and one essence. Because both He, the firstborn Son, and we, the many sons, are the same in the divine life and nature, He is not ashamed to call us brothers. As His brothers we are now in the process of maturity.<p>This process of maturity involves the believers&#8217; experience of the divine life. Conformation actually denotes the shaping of life. As the divine life grows within us and transforms us, it spontaneously shapes us into the form, the image, of the firstborn Son of God. If we are blind to this reality, however, we may try to shape ourselves into the likeness of Christ. Such self-effort never works. Concerning this, only one thing is prevailing-the divine life that grows in us, sanctifies us, transforms us, and shapes us. There is no need for us to shape ourselves, to perform, or to strive to improve our behavior. What we need is a fuller experience of the divine life with its essence, power, law, and shape. As those who are undergoing the process of transformation for conformation, we are being shaped gradually into the image of the firstborn Son of God by the function of the all-inclusive, divine life.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(33)</h1><p>In this message we shall consider how the believers enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by being conformed to the death of Christ.<h2 class=head3>c. By Being Conformed to the Death of Christ</h2><p>Philippians 3:10b speaks of being conformed to Christ&#8217;s death. This indicates that we need to take the death of Christ as the mold of our life. The mold of Christ&#8217;s death refers to the continual putting to death of His human life so that He might live by the life of God. Christ&#8217;s death is now a mold to which we are being conformed. As our human life is conformed to such a mold, we die to our human life in order to live the divine life.<p>Unless we are conformed to the death of Christ we cannot be conformed to the image of Christ. Christ&#8217;s death is a mold in which we are being shaped into His image as the firstborn Son of God. As we are undergoing the process of transformation and conformation, we are being conformed to the death of Christ.<p>Christ&#8217;s death took place throughout His life. As He was living, He was also dying. Daily He was molded by the cross, even when He was a child living in a carpenter&#8217;s home in Nazareth. He was continually being crossed out-crossed out by His mother, by His brothers, and by His disciples, who had no ear to hear what He spoke to them concerning His suffering and death on the cross. Day by day Christ died to the old creation in order to live a life in the new creation.<p>Being conformed to Christ&#8217;s death should be our daily experience as believers. The more our natural life is put to death, the more the divine life within us will be released. Then in our experience we shall be conformed to Christ&#8217;s death.<h2 class=head4>(1) Bearing the Cross</h2><p>In Matthew 16:24 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.&#8221; The cross is not merely a suffering; it is primarily a killing. It kills and terminates the criminal. Christ first bore the cross and then was crucified. As He was bearing the cross, He was constantly under the killing, not under suffering. We, the believers in Christ, have first been crucified with Him and then bear the cross today. To us, bearing the cross is to remain under the killing of the death of Christ for the terminating of our self, our natural life, and our old man.<p>We may have a mistaken concept of the cross and think that the cross is only for suffering. It is wrong to associate the cross merely with suffering. In Matthew 16:24 the cross does not denote suffering but killing. The ultimate purpose of the cross is not to cause us to suffer; it is to terminate us, to kill us. The Lord&#8217;s word here does not have the concept of suffering; His concept concerning the cross is that of killing.<p>The meaning of bearing the cross is not to depart from the cross. All those who have experienced the cross agree that one who bears the cross cannot be separated from the cross. A person who bears the cross is one with the cross; he is inseparable from the cross.<p>In order to bear the cross, we need to realize that we have already been crucified. We have been killed on the cross with Christ, and now we must remain under this killing. We should be able to say, &#8220;I have been killed. My self-life, my natural life, my old man, and my whole being have been killed. Now I must remain under this killing.&#8221; This is what it means to bear the cross.<h2 class=head5>(a) To Identify Themselves with the Crucified Christ</h2><p>For the believers to bear the cross is for them to identify themselves with the crucified Christ. Christ underwent death by crucifixion, and we must be one with Him. This is to identify ourselves not with the glorified Christ but with a crucified Christ.<h2 class=head5>(b) To Stay in the Death of Christ</h2><p>To bear the cross means to bear the death of Christ on us and allow the death of Christ to work on us continually in order to put our self to death. To bear the cross is also to stay in the death of Christ. The death of Christ is not only our destiny but also our destination. If we would be transformed and conformed to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son, we need to stay in His death, taking His death as our residence, our home. Therefore, the meaning of bearing the cross is to identify ourselves with the crucified Christ and then to stay with Him in His death. If we do not stay in Christ&#8217;s death, we are casting aside His cross. However, when we stay in His death, we are bearing the cross. This is to be conformed to the death of Christ.<p>We need to have a clear vision that bearing the cross is not a matter of suffering but of keeping the self under the termination of death. The cross of Christ is the terminating death, and we must stay in the place of this termination. To remain there is to bear the cross. As those who are bearing the cross, we keep ourselves under Christ&#8217;s termination. By the Lord&#8217;s grace, we should remain in the place of termination for our entire life.<h2 class=head4>(2) Having Their Old Man Crucified</h2><p>We should not only bear the cross, identifying ourselves with the crucified Christ and staying in His death, but also realize the fact that our old man has been crucified. Romans 6:6 says, &#8220;Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him that the body of sin might be made of none effect, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves.&#8221; We have been baptized into Christ, and now we are in Christ. Because we are in Him, whatever He has passed through is our history. He has been crucified, and His crucifixion is ours. This is a glorious fact. We need to pray that the Lord will give us a clear vision of the fact that we are in Him and that we have been crucified with Him. God has accomplished the glorious fact of putting us into Christ. Our old man has been crucified with Him.<p>&#8220;Knowing this&#8221; in Romans 6:6 actually refers to the seeing of a fact in a spiritual vision. Such a vision is basic to our knowing. After we see a certain thing, we cannot say that we do not know that thing. Likewise, if we have a clear vision of the fact that our old man has been crucified with Christ, we shall know this fact in its reality. We need to pray that the Lord will deliver us from contentment with a mere doctrinal understanding of Romans 6:6 and grant us a clear vision in our spirit of the divine fact that our old man has been crucified with Christ.<h2 class=head5>(a) Their Body of Sin Having Been Made of None Effect, That They Should No Longer Serve Sin as Slaves</h2><p>Because our old man has been crucified, the body of sin has been made of none effect. Simply realizing that our old man has been crucified causes the body of sin, the sinful body, to become of none effect, so that we should no longer serve sin as slaves. Since we have been crucified with Christ, the body of sin is unemployed; it loses its job. It has nothing to do.<h2 class=head5>(b) Justified, Cleared, Discharged from Sin</h2><p>Romans 6:7 goes on to say, &#8220;He who has died is justified from sin.&#8221; To be justified from sin is to be cleared, discharged, freed from sin. Having been justified from sin, we are no longer indebted to sin or obligated to it.<h2 class=head4>(3) Crucifying Their Flesh with the Passions and the Lusts</h2><p>Galatians 5:24 says, &#8220;They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts.&#8221; &#8220;They who are of Christ Jesus&#8221; refers to those who have believed into Christ and have been baptized into Him. Therefore, they belong to Christ and are of Christ. As saved ones, we are now of Christ.<p>According to Paul&#8217;s word, those who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh. The crucifixion of the old man in Romans 6:6 was not accomplished by us, but here it says that we have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts. The old man is our being; the flesh is the expression of our being in our practical living. The crucifixion of our old man is a fact accomplished by Christ on the cross, whereas the crucifixion of our flesh with its passions and lusts is our practical experience of that fact. Through the crucifixion of Christ we have been crucified with Christ. This enables us to crucify our flesh with the passions and lusts. In other words, we have been crucified with Christ so that we may be able to crucify our flesh. Our crucifying the flesh is based on the fact that our old man has been crucified with Christ.<p>We need a clear understanding concerning the old man and the flesh. There is no need for us to deal with the old man, for the old man has already been crucified with Christ. However, day by day we need to crucify our flesh. The problems in our daily living do not come from the old man but from the flesh with its passions and lusts. Therefore, based upon the fact that our old man has already been dealt with through the death of Christ, we must go on to crucify our flesh in a practical way.<p>It is crucial to see the difference between Romans 6:6 and Galatians 5:24. In 5:24 Paul does not say that those who are Christ&#8217;s have crucified the old man. He says that they have crucified the flesh. It is impossible to commit suicide by crucifixion. For this reason, it is not possible for us to crucify our old man. Although we cannot crucify the old man, we can crucify the flesh. The crucifixion of the old man had to be accomplished by someone else, but the crucifixion of the flesh must be carried out by us.<p>In speaking of the crucifixion of the flesh Paul uses the perfect tense. He says not that we are crucifying the flesh, nor that we shall crucify it, but that we have crucified it. He speaks of this as if it were an accomplished fact. Concerning the crucifixion, there are two aspects. The first is that when Christ was crucified, He crucified our old man. The other aspect is that we have crucified our flesh. Based upon the fact that Christ has crucified the old man, we have crucified the flesh. Hence, the second fact, our crucifixion of the flesh, is the application of the first fact, Christ&#8217;s crucifixion of the old man. In our experience we need to apply Christ&#8217;s crucifixion to our flesh. Paul&#8217;s use of the perfect tense to describe this indicates that such should be the normal experience of the believers. All believers should be those who have applied Christ&#8217;s crucifixion to their flesh. As those who belong to Christ, who have been put into Christ, we have done this. Here Paul is speaking according to the principle. If we have never crucified our flesh, our experience is abnormal. If our experience is normal, then we who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh.<h2 class=head5>(a) By the Spirit</h2><p>It is by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16) that we crucify the flesh. The cross of Christ gives us the standing, or the basis, to deal with the flesh. Our whole being-the entire fallen tripartite man-was crucified with Christ. Not only do we have this base objectively, but we have the Spirit subjectively to enable us to execute the cross of Christ upon our flesh. In order to walk by the Spirit, we must apply Christ&#8217;s crucifixion to our flesh. If we apply the cross to our flesh by the indwelling Spirit, our flesh will be nailed to the cross. This is to crucify the flesh. When the flesh is on the cross, only the Spirit remains, and we experience the Spirit as everything to us. Experiencing the Spirit in this way, we walk by the Spirit and are led by the Spirit. The more we experience the Spirit in this way, the more we are transformed and conformed to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God.<h2 class=head5>(b) To Experience the Death of Christ Practically, Not Living Habitually according to the Flesh</h2><p>To crucify the flesh by the Spirit is to experience the death of Christ in a practical way and not to live habitually according to the flesh. If we would be conformed to the death of Christ and thereby conformed to His image, we should not live habitually, that is, we should not live according to our habits. Because we are accustomed to living habitually according to the flesh, we need to be on the alert moment by moment and be careful about our habits. We need to reject, abandon, set aside, our habits and live according to the Spirit.<h2 class=head4>(4) Putting to Death the Practices of Their Body</h2><h2 class=head5>(a) By the Spirit</h2><p>Romans 8:13 says, &#8220;If you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.&#8221; If we live according to flesh, we are about to die spiritually. However, if by the Spirit we put to death the practices of the body-that is, to mortify or crucify them-we shall live in spirit.<p>Romans 8:13 corresponds to 8:6, which says that the mind set on the flesh is death and that the mind set on the spirit is life. To live according to flesh primarily means to set our mind upon the flesh, and, likewise, to set our mind upon the flesh mainly means to live according to flesh. In order to put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit, we need to set our mind on the spirit and walk according to spirit. When we have our mind set on our spirit, our flesh will be put to death. Therefore, by setting our mind on our spirit we put to death all the practices of the body.<p>The genuine experience of the co-crucifixion with Christ is to be had in putting to death the practices of the body by the Spirit. This does not happen once for all; it is a constant daily exercise. Every practice of the body must be put to death by turning our mind to the spirit and setting it on the spirit.<h2 class=head5>(b) Not Living Habitually according to the Flesh</h2><p>To put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit means that we do not live habitually according to the flesh. This requires coordination with God through the exercise of our will. We need to make a strong decision and say, &#8220;Lord, I take sides with You. I want to be conformed to Your death. Lord, have mercy on me so that I will no longer live habitually according to the flesh but set aside all the habits of my natural life.&#8221; This is the putting to death of the practices of our body.<h2 class=head4>(5) Denying Their Self</h2><p>Matthew 16:24 speaks of denying the self. Self is the soul life (v. 25) with the emphasis on human thoughts and opinions. Self, soul life, and opinion are three aspects of one thing. Self in essence is the soul life, and the expression of self is opinion. The soul life is lived out by the self, and the self is expressed through the mind. What the mind thinks or considers is an opinion, idea, or concept. The mind&#8217;s opinion, concept, or idea is the expression of the self, the embodiment of the soul life. Because opinions are the expression of the self, we need to deny the self by applying the cross to our opinions.<h2 class=head5>(a) Experiencing the Death of Christ</h2><p>We deny the self by experiencing the death of Christ subjectively in a particular way. The experience of the cross of Christ has three steps: first, the crucifying of our old man, which is an objective fact accomplished by Christ; second, our acknowledging and receiving this fact and declaring, &#8220;I have been crucified with Christ&#8221;; third, our going on to experience this fact subjectively.<p>The objective fact in dealing with the self is that our old man, which includes the self, has been crucified with Christ. The subjective experience in dealing with the self is through the Holy Spirit. If we have seen the fact that our old man has been crucified, then in our daily living, whenever we discover the expressing of our natural opinions, we must let the Holy Spirit work the death of the cross upon these opinions and put them to death. This is our subjective experience in dealing with the self.<p>In order to deny the self, we need to see, through divine revelation, that our old man has been crucified with Christ. Then we need to see that our natural opinions are an expression of the old man. Once we know that our old man has been crucified and realize that our opinions are the expression of the old man, we should apply the death of Christ through the Holy Spirit to our opinions. This is what the Lord Jesus refers to in Matthew 16:24 as the denying of the self.<p>The genuine experience of denying the self takes place only in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Although we may understand the crucifying of the old man and know that our opinions are the expression of the self, yet if we do not live in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, this is but an empty doctrine and does not afford any genuine spiritual experience. Only as we live in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is our seeing a real seeing and our experience a real experience. Therefore, if we desire to live continuously in the experience of denying the self, we need to live in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Then we must allow the Holy Spirit to execute the crucifixion of Christ upon every expression of the self. This is the reality of denying the self by experiencing the death of Christ subjectively through the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head5>(b) Not Living in Their &#8220;I,&#8221; Which Has Been Crucified with Christ</h2><p>The believers deny the self by not living in their &#8220;I,&#8221; which has been crucified with Christ (Gal. 2:20). The old man in Romans 6:6 refers to our very being, the created and fallen man, and the &#8220;I&#8221; in Galatians 2:20 is the title which the old man calls himself. The old man is the &#8220;I,&#8221; and the &#8220;I&#8221; is the old man. Galatians 2:20 tells us that this &#8220;I&#8221; has been crucified with Christ, and Romans 6:6 helps us see that the &#8220;I&#8221; who has been crucified is the old man. When we see that our old man has been crucified with Christ, we can say, &#8220;I have been crucified with Christ.&#8221; Then by not living in the &#8220;I&#8221; who has been crucified with Christ, we deny the self.<h2 class=head4>(6) Losing Their Soul</h2><p>The believers are conformed to the death of Christ by losing their soul. In Matthew 16:25 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Whoever desires to save his soul life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul life for My sake shall find it.&#8221; To save the soul life is to allow the soul to have its enjoyment in this age and not to suffer. To lose the soul life is to cause the soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment. In following the Lord we should not save our soul life, that is, we should not let the soul have its enjoyment. If we save our soul life in this age, we shall lose it in the coming age. But if we lose it for Christ&#8217;s sake, we shall find it in the enjoyment of the kingdom in the coming age. This means that if the believers allow their soul to have its. enjoyment in this age, they will cause their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age. But if they allow their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in this age for the Lord&#8217;s sake, they will cause their soul to have its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age. They will share the Lord&#8217;s joy in ruling over the earth (Matt. 25:21, 23).<h2 class=head5>(a) The Reality of the Denying of Their Self and the Bearing of the Cross</h2><p>The believers&#8217; losing their soul is the reality of the denying of their self and the bearing of the cross. The soul life is embodied in the self. To deny ourself is to forfeit our soul life. To bear the cross is to put to death the self, the soul life. To identify ourselves with Christ&#8217;s death is to bear the cross, and to bear the cross is to deny our soul life.<h2 class=head5>(b) Experiencing the Death of Christ</h2><p>For the believers to lose their soul is for them to experience the death of Christ. The believers in Christ have been crucified (terminated) with Him. After being organically united with Him through faith, they should remain on the cross, keeping their old man in the termination of the cross (Rom. 6:3; Col. 2:20). This is to participate in Christ&#8217;s crucifixion. As we remain in this crucifixion, this termination, experiencing the death of Christ subjectively, we lose our soul.<h2 class=head5>(c) Not Living in Their Natural Life</h2><p>To lose the soul is to live no longer in the natural life. The soul has much to do with the natural life. Our natural life needs to be dealt with by losing the soul. Everything that belongs to the natural life and its habits must be put aside. When our natural life has been put to death, we shall then lose our soul.<h2 class=head5>(d) Hating (Not Loving above the Lord) Their Fathers, Mothers, Wives, Children, Brothers, Sisters, and Moreover, Their Own Soul Life</h2><p>For the believers to lose their soul is to hate (not love above the Lord-Matt. 10:37) their fathers, mothers, wives, children, brothers, sisters, and moreover, their own soul life. In Matthew 10:37 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me.&#8221; Our love must be absolute for the Lord. In our love nothing should be above Him. He is the One absolutely worthy of our love, and we must be worthy of Him.<p>In Luke 14:26 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and moreover, his own soul life also, he cannot be My disciple.&#8221; According to the Lord&#8217;s word here, we should hate those we love, not those we do not love. Especially we need to hate ourselves, even our own soul life. What we love in ourselves is not mainly our spirit or body but our soul. In 14:26 the Lord clearly says that if we do not hate our own soul life, we cannot be His disciples. A genuine proof that we are seeking the Lord is that we hate our soul life.<h2 class=head5>(e) For Their Soul to Be Saved</h2><p>Losing our soul in this age is for our soul to be saved in the coming age. When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will exercise His judgment over all the believers. At that time a decision will be made whether or not we shall suffer some kind of dispensational punishment. For our soul to be saved means that it is saved from dispensational punishment in the coming age and instead participates in the joy of the Lord. For a believer to pass through dispensational punishment in the coming age means that he loses his soul.<p>First Peter 1:9 says, &#8220;Obtaining the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.&#8221; The salvation here is full salvation, the salvation which is in three stages-the initial stage, the progressing stage, and the completing stage. Our spirit has been saved through regeneration (John 3:5-6). Our body will be saved, redeemed, through the coming transfiguration (Rom. 8:23; Phil. 3:21). Our soul will be saved from sufferings into the full enjoyment at His unveiling, His coming back. For this we have to deny our soul, our soulish life, with all its pleasures in this age, that we may gain it in the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming age (Matt. 10:37-39; 16:24-27; Luke 17:30-33; John 12:25). At the Lord&#8217;s unveiling, some believers through His judgment seat will enter into the joy of the Lord (Matt. 25:21, 23; 24:45-46), and some will suffer in weeping and gnashing of teeth (Matt. 25:30; 24:51). To enter into the Lord&#8217;s joy is the salvation of our souls (Heb. 10:39).<p>When the Lord Jesus comes back, our soul will be saved from the realm of suffering into a realm of comfort. That will be the full salvation of our soul. Therefore, we are waiting for the unveiling of the Lord Jesus. At the time of His coming back we shall be rescued from the realm of suffering into a realm of enjoyment. In that realm we shall have the full enjoyment of the Triune God and of all that He is, has, and has accomplished, attained, and obtained. This is the salvation of our souls that is ready to be revealed to us at the last time.<h2 class=head4>(7) Having Died with Christ from the Elements of the World-the Worldly Ordinances according to the Teachings of Men</h2><p>As those who are being conformed to the death of Christ, we have died with Christ from the elements of the world- the worldly ordinances according to the teachings of men. Every religion has ordinances, regulations, rules, and codes. These are religious ordinances taught by men. In Christ we have died to these things.<p>In Colossians 2:20-22 Paul says, &#8220;If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why as living in the world do you subject yourself to ordinances: do not handle, do not taste, do not touch, things which are all for corruption in the using, according to the commandments and teachings of men?&#8221; The elements of the world include Jewish observances, heathen ordinances, and philosophy. They also include gnosticism, asceticism, and mysticism. The elements of the world are the elementary principles of worldly society, the rudimentary principles invented by mankind and practiced in society. With Christ we have died to these elements of the world. When Christ was crucified, we were crucified also. In His crucifixion we were released from the elementary principles of the world.<p>In order to be conformed to the death of Christ, we must bear the cross, have our old man crucified, crucify the flesh with the passions and lusts, put to death the practices of the body, deny the self, lose the soul, and experience having died with Christ from the elements of the world. Six negative things need to be dealt with: the old man, the body of sin, the flesh with the passions and lusts, the practices of the body, the self, and the soul. None of these things can remain in the mold of the death of Christ, for Christ&#8217;s death cuts these things off, kills them, nullifies them. Therefore, not a trace of these six things can be found in the pattern of Christ&#8217;s death. Actually, to be conformed to the death of Christ is to deal with these six negative things. The more these things are dealt with, the more we are conformed to Christ&#8217;s death that we may be conformed to His image as the firstborn Son of God. The firstborn Son of God has humanity, but He does not have the old man, the body of sin, the flesh with the passions and lusts, the practices of the body, the self, or the soul. For us to be conformed to Christ&#8217;s image, we must be dealt with by the cross and thereby be conformed to His death.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(34)</h1><p>We have seen that the believers experience and enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by being transformed, by being conformed to Christ&#8217;s image as the firstborn Son of God, and by being conformed to the death of Christ. In this message we shall consider other aspects of this enjoyment of the divine dispensing.<h2 class=head3>d. By Entering into the Holy of Holies</h2><p>As the believers are conformed to the death of Christ, they are released from many negative things, including the old man, the flesh with the passions and lusts, the practices of the body, the self, and the soul life. The more we are released from these things, the more we are enabled to go forward positively and, having passed the outer veil, to enter through the inner veil into the Holy of Holies (Heb. 10:19-20).<p>Hebrews 10:19 says, &#8220;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus.&#8221; The Holy of Holies today is in heaven, where the Lord Jesus is (Heb. 9:12, 24). Even though we are still on earth, we can enter the Holy of Holies. The secret is our spirit, referred to in Hebrews 4:12. The Christ who is in heaven is also in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). He, as the heavenly ladder (Gen. 28:12; John 1:51), joins our spirit to heaven and brings heaven into our spirit. Whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies. Here we meet with God who is on the throne of grace.<p>After showing us the heavenly Christ within the veil, the book of Hebrews encourages us to enter within the veil (Heb. 10:22), where we can look away unto Him (12:2) and consider Him (12:3; 3:1), enjoying direct contact with Him. Because He is within the veil, we must enter within the veil so that we may see Him and consider Him in order to receive His infusion. We can do this only by exercising our spirit, which is joined to the heavenly Holy of Holies. When we turn to our spirit and exercise it, we enter within the veil. Here we participate in the heavenly ministry of the heavenly Christ. Here we are saturated and permeated with the divine riches that make us the corporate reproduction of the firstborn Son of God for His expression.<h2 class=head4>(1) By the Blood of Jesus</h2><p>Hebrews 10:19 tells us that we have boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus. It is a great matter to enter the Holy of Holies, for there God is sitting on the throne of grace. In order to enter into such a place we must have boldness, and we have it by Christ&#8217;s death and by His blood. By the blood of Jesus we have the boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies at any time, unlike the high priest in the Old Testament, who could enter into it only once a year.<h2 class=head4>(2) By a New and Living Way through the Rent Veil</h2><p>Hebrews 10:20 indicates that we enter into the Holy of Holies by &#8220;a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh.&#8221; The way into the Holy of Holies has been cut. According to the Greek, the word &#8220;new&#8221; in this verse means &#8220;freshly slain.&#8221; Through Christ&#8217;s death on the cross, the way has been freshly slain for us. Not only the flesh but also the entire old creation has been slain. In Hebrews 10:20 the veil is the second veil (Heb. 9:3) within the tabernacle. This veil, which typifies the flesh of Christ, signifies the old creation, including us. On this veil were cherubim (Exo. 26:31), which signified the creatures (Ezek. 10:15). When the veil was rent, the cherubim also were rent, signifying that when the flesh of Christ, typified by the veil, was crucified, all the creatures also were crucified with His flesh. According to Matthew 27:51, when the Lord Jesus died, the veil was rent from top to bottom, meaning that it was not rent by anyone on earth but by God in the heavens. The old creation has been slain, and a new and living way to enter into the Holy of Holies has been cut. Now through the riven veil of the flesh and by the blood of Jesus we can enter into the Holy of Holies to contact God for our enjoyment. Furthermore, the fact that the veil has been rent implies that since our old man has been crucified with Christ (Rom. 6:6), we have an open way to contact and enjoy God in our spirit as our life and life supply.<p>In Old Testament times only the high priest could enter into the Holy of Holies. Once a year he brought the atoning blood and sprinkled it upon the propitiation-cover. That was the old way. In Hebrews 10 we are told that now, in the New Testament age, there is a new way of entering into the Holy of Holies. This new way is not only for the high priest but for all believers, not by the blood of goats and bulls but by the blood of Jesus, and not through a veil that has not been rent but through a veil that has been rent. Now we may pass through the rent veil, enter into the Holy of Holies, and go directly to the throne of grace.<h2 class=head4>(3) To the Throne of Grace within the Veil to Receive Mercy and Find Grace from the Ascended Christ in the Heavens</h2><p>When we enter into the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus and by the new and living way, we come to the throne of grace within the veil to receive mercy and find grace from the ascended Christ in the heavens (Heb. 4:14, 16; 6:19-20). Hebrews 4:16 speaks of coming &#8220;forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help.&#8221; The throne of grace is undoubtedly the throne of God which is in heaven (Rev. 4:2). The throne of God is the throne of authority to all the universe (Dan. 7:9; Rev. 5:1) on which God sits to control and rule over the universe. It is the throne of God&#8217;s administration. But to us, the believers, it is the throne of grace, signified by the propitiation-cover (the mercy seat) over the ark of testimony (Exo. 25:17, 21; Rom. 3:25) in the Holy of Holies (Heb. 9:3, 5) sprinkled with the blood of Christ (Lev. 16:15; Heb. 9:12). Here God meets with His people and communes with them (Exo. 25:21-22). When we come to the throne of grace through the blood of Christ, we meet with God and commune with Him.<p>Coming forward to the throne of grace is absolutely a matter in our spirit. Because our spirit is the place of God&#8217;s habitation today (Eph. 2:22), it is the gate of heaven where Christ is the ladder that joins us, the people on earth, to heaven, and brings heaven to us. Whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter into the gate of heaven and touch the throne of grace in heaven through Christ as the heavenly ladder. As long as we are in our spirit, we have the gate of heaven, and within the gate is the throne of grace. It takes no time whatever to enter into the Holy of Holies, because there is no distance between it and our spirit. Whenever we say from the depths of our being, &#8220;O Lord Jesus,&#8221; we are immediately in the Holy of Holies, touching the throne of grace, which is Christ as the propitiation-cover, which covers the demands of the Ten Commandments and fulfills the requirements of God&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, and glory. In a very real sense, our spirit is the Holy of Holies, where God meets with us through Christ as the propitiation-cover, which, to the believers, is the throne of God and of the Lamb (Rev. 22:1).<p>When we come forward to the throne of grace, we receive mercy and find grace for timely help. Both God&#8217;s mercy and His grace are the expression of His love. When we are in a pitiful condition, His mercy reaches us and brings us into a state where God is able to favor us with His grace. Luke 15:20-24 tells us that when the father saw the prodigal son returning, he had compassion on him. This is mercy, expressing the father&#8217;s love. Then the father clothed him with the best robe and fed him with the fatted calf. This is grace, which also manifests the father&#8217;s love. God&#8217;s mercy reaches farther than His grace, bridging the gap between us and His grace. Often, because of our pitiful condition, we need to receive mercy before we can find grace.<p>God&#8217;s mercy and grace are always available to us. However, we need to receive and find them by exercising our spirit to come forward to the throne of grace and touch our High Priest, who sympathizes with us in all our weaknesses. Therefore, we simply need to come forward, open our being, and receive mercy and find grace for timely help. The help which comes from this grace is always timely and exactly fits our situation and need. According to the book of Hebrews, the real Christian life is a life of coming forward to the throne of grace and of continually receiving mercy and finding grace for timely help.<h2 class=head3>e. By Following Jesus</h2><p>The believers enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation not only by entering into the Holy of Holies but also by following Jesus.<p>After indicating by what kind of death Peter would glorify God, the Lord Jesus said to him, &#8220;Follow Me!&#8221; (John 21:19). We all must follow the Lord as the indwelling One. The &#8220;Me&#8221; whom we are to follow is in us. As John 21:18 indicates, we must not follow the Lord by our own will but according to His leading. Our following Him even unto death is to glorify God. Furthermore, we must follow Him without paying attention to others. After the Lord told Peter to follow Him, Peter turned to John and said to Jesus, &#8220;Lord, and what about this man?&#8221; (v. 21). To this, the Lord replied, &#8220;If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me!&#8221; (v. 22). The Lord was telling Peter that what would happen to John was none of his business and that he had to follow Him.<h2 class=head4>(1) Outside the Camp</h2><p>Hebrews 13:13 indicates that the believers are to follow Jesus outside the camp: &#8220;Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.&#8221; Both in the book of Hebrews and in typology the camp signifies the organization of religion, which is human and earthly. To go outside the camp means to go outside the human organization of religion. Whereas the camp signifies the human organization, the city (v. 14) signifies the earthly realm. In the book of Hebrews both the gate (v. 12) and the camp signify the Jewish religion with its two aspects, the earthly and the human. Judaism is both earthly and human. Every religion is both a human organization and an earthly realm which keeps people from God&#8217;s New Testament economy. Any religion-Judaism, Catholicism, or Protestantism- which has rejected the Lord is a camp, a human organization, given up by Him.<p>The book of Hebrews instructs and charges us to come forward to the Holy of Holies and to enter within the veil. The way into the Holy of Holies, a new and living way, has been slain. First, this book ushers us into the Holy of Holies and then directs us to go outside the camp. According to our concept, we first go outside the camp and then enter within the veil. But according to God&#8217;s understanding, we first enter within the veil and only then can we go outside the camp. Everyone who has gone outside the camp has first experienced what is within the veil. No one has first gone outside the camp and then entered within the veil. Although the Lord Jesus first went outside the gate and then entered within the veil, it is exactly the opposite with us. In other words, first we enter into the Holy of Holies, where we are strengthened and encouraged to go outside the camp, and then we go out of the organization of religion. The more we enter within the veil, the more we go outside the camp.<p>In the book of Hebrews the phrases &#8220;within the veil&#8221; and &#8220;outside the camp&#8221; are crucial and very meaningful. On the one hand, we enjoy Christ within the veil; on the other hand, we follow Jesus outside the camp. The goal and ultimate conclusion of this book is that we all would enter within the veil and then go outside the camp.<h2 class=head4>(2) Bearing His Reproach</h2><p>Hebrews 13:13 indicates that as we follow Jesus outside the camp, we bear His reproach. To be within the veil is to enter into the Holy of Holies where the Lord is enthroned in glory, and to go outside the camp is to come out of religion, whence the Lord was cast out in rejection. This signifies that we must be in our spirit, where, experientially speaking, the practical Holy of Holies is today, and outside religion, where the practical camp is today. The more we are in our spirit enjoying the heavenly Christ, the more we shall be outside religion following the suffering Jesus. To be in our spirit to enjoy the glorified Christ enables us to come outside religion to follow the rejected Jesus. The more we contact the heavenly Christ in His glory in our spirit, the more we shall go to the lowly Jesus in His suffering outside religion. To contact Christ in the heavens, enjoying His glorification, energizes us to take the narrow pathway of the cross on earth and to bear His reproach.<p>The book of Hebrews first gives us a clear vision of the heavenly Christ and the heavenly Holy of Holies, and then it shows us how to walk the pathway of the cross on earth, that is, to go forth unto Jesus outside the camp, outside religion, bearing His reproach. To go forth unto Jesus outside the camp, bearing His reproach, is to take the pathway of the cross.<p>When we enter within the veil by getting into our spirit, we taste the sweetness of the heavenly Christ that we may be enabled to go outside the camp, forsaking the earth and its love. As we stay within the veil, we also have our spirit filled with the glory of the heavenly Christ that our heart may be freed from the possession of earth&#8217;s enjoyment outside the camp. Furthermore, within the veil we behold the glorified Christ that we may be attracted to follow the suffering Jesus outside the camp. Beholding His countenance in heaven enables us to trace His footsteps on earth. As we enter within the veil, we are infused with resurrection power (Phil. 3:10) that we may be empowered to walk the pathway of the cross outside the camp. We also participate in the ministry of the heavenly Christ that we may be equipped to minister Him to the thirsty spirits outside the camp. Here we enjoy the Lord&#8217;s best that we may be enriched to meet the needs of people outside the camp.<p>The Holy of Holies, the pathway of the cross (signified by going forth unto Jesus outside the camp, bearing His reproach), and the kingdom are three crucial matters set forth in the book of Hebrews. The Holy of Holies enables us to take the pathway of the cross, and the pathway of the cross ushers us into the kingdom in its manifestation.<h2 class=head4>(3) In His Steps</h2><p>As the believers follow Jesus outside the camp, bearing His reproach, they follow in His steps (1 Pet. 2:21). First, we enter into the Holy of Holies to receive grace. Then by that grace we come out of the camp to follow Jesus, bearing His reproach, in His steps.<p>First Peter 2:21 says, &#8220;To this you were called, because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model that you should follow in His steps.&#8221; The word &#8220;model&#8221; has been spoiled by common usage. Literally, the Greek word means a writing copy, an under-writing for students to use in tracing letters as they learn to draw them. In ancient times teachers would write letters on writing material, and those letters became a master copy. Another piece of writing material was put upon the master copy. Then the children would practice writing by tracing the letters from the master copy onto their copy. The Greek word for model is the word that denotes such a master copy used in the teaching of writing. The Lord Jesus has set His suffering life before us as an under-writing for us to copy by tracing and following His steps.<p>We do not follow the Lord Jesus, walking in His steps, by trying to imitate Him outwardly. Trying to imitate the Lord Jesus simply does not work. Instead of endeavoring to imitate Him in an outward way, we need to become His reproduction by experiencing a process that involves the Spirit and the riches of the divine life. The result of this process is that Christ is reproduced in us. Then, having become His reproduction, we shall follow in His steps.<h2 class=head3>f. By Taking His Yoke on Them and Learning from Him</h2><p>The believers enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity by taking the Lord&#8217;s yoke on them and learning from Him. In Matthew 11:29 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Take My yoke on you and learn from Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you shall find rest to your souls.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s yoke is to take the will of the Father. It is not to be regulated or controlled by any obligations of the law or religion, nor to be enslaved by any work, but to be constrained by the will of the Father. The Lord Jesus lived such a life, caring for nothing but the will of His Father (John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38). He submitted Himself fully to the Father&#8217;s will (Matt. 26:39, 42). Hence, the Lord asked the believers to learn from Him.<p>In Matthew 11:30 the Lord Jesus goes on to say, &#8220;My yoke is pleasant and My burden is light.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s yoke is the Father&#8217;s will, and His burden is the work to carry out the Father&#8217;s will. Such a yoke is pleasant, not bitter, and such a burden is light, not heavy. The Greek word rendered &#8220;pleasant&#8221; signifies fit for use; hence, good, kindly, mild, gentle, easy, pleasant, in contrast to what is hard, harsh, sharp, and bitter.<p>God&#8217;s will is our yoke. Because we are yoked, we are not free to do as we please. How good it is to take the Lord&#8217;s yoke on us and to learn from Him!<h2 class=head4>(1) In His Meekness and Lowliness in Heart</h2><p>In Matthew 11:29 the Lord tells us to learn from Him. He is meek and lowly in heart. To be meek means not to resist any opposition, and to be lowly means not to esteem oneself highly. The Lord Jesus always submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself nor expecting to gain something for Himself. Hence, no matter what the situation was, He had rest in His heart. He was fully satisfied with His Father&#8217;s will.<p>In meekness there is no struggling or fighting but giving in. With lowliness there is no high thought. Lowliness is deeper than humility. We may be humble but still have high thoughts about ourselves or our career. Therefore, we need something deeper than humility, and that is lowliness. We should not consider ourselves something or regard ourselves as higher than others. Instead, we should stay in a lowly state. This is to put the yoke of Christ upon us in His meekness and lowliness, not in an outward form but in heart.<h2 class=head4>(2) For the Rest of the Soul</h2><p>If we take the Lord&#8217;s yoke on us and learn from Him, we shall find rest to our souls. In Matthew 11:28 the Lord sounded out the call, &#8220;Come to Me all who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.&#8221; The labor mentioned here refers not only to the labor of striving to keep the commandments of the law and religious regulations but also to the labor of struggling to be successful in any work. Whoever labors thus is always heavily burdened. Rest refers not only to being set free from labor and burden under the law in religion or under any work and responsibility, but also to perfect peace and full satisfaction.<p>The rest we find by taking the Lord&#8217;s yoke and learning from Him is for our souls. It is an inward rest, not something merely outward in nature. The Lord Jesus always submitted to the Father&#8217;s will, taking God&#8217;s will as His portion and not resisting anything. Hence, He was always at rest. We must learn of Him and also take this view. If we do, we shall have rest in our souls. If we are struggling for a high position, we shall not have rest. But if we are meek and are content to remain in a lowly state, nothing will trouble us, and we shall enjoy the rest of Christ.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(35)</h1><p>In this message we shall consider more aspects of the believers&#8217; enjoying the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation.<h2 class=head3>g. By Living to Christ</h2><p>Second Corinthians 5:14 and 15 say, &#8220;The love of Christ constrains us, having judged this, that One died on behalf of all; therefore all died; and He died on behalf of all, that those who live may no longer live to themselves, but to Him who died for them and has been raised.&#8221; Here Paul speaks not of living for the Lord, by the Lord, or with the Lord, but of living to the Lord. To live to Christ is to take Him as the goal of our living. In all that we do-at home, at work, or in the church life-Christ should be our unique goal.<p>As a help to understand what it means to live to the Lord, we may consider Paul&#8217;s word in Galatians 2:19: &#8220;I through law have died to law that I might live to God.&#8221; To live to the law means that we are under the law, directed by the law, governed by the law, and have the responsibility to fulfill the law. To live to God, or to the Lord means that we are under the Lord&#8217;s direction and control and that we want to fulfill His requirements, satisfy His desires, and complete what He intends.<p>If we consider the context of 2 Corinthians 4 and 5, we shall see that to live to the Lord means to live the kind of life the Lord Jesus lived. In chapter four we see that the apostles experienced the putting to death of Jesus. When we experience the putting to death of Jesus, we can live the kind of life Jesus lived.<p>To live to the Lord is to live a crucified life. It is to live in such a way that the outward man is always put to death. The Lord Jesus lived this kind of life, and those who live such a life today are living to the Lord.<p>What the Lord wants is not that we be so active for Him. He wants us to experience the putting to death of Jesus so that our natural man and our active being may be terminated. We may be active or aggressive for the Lord in a natural way, doing things for Him by our natural aggressiveness. This offends the Lord, and it distracts us from enjoying Him. If we would live to the Lord, we must deny our outward man, the flesh. When we live to Christ, we do not live by our outward man, by our flesh. This means that living to Christ requires that we live by our inward man, by our regenerated spirit.<p>Because it is possible for us to do something for the Lord without doing that thing to the Lord, we need to understand the difference between living for the Lord and living to the Lord. The phrase &#8220;to the Lord&#8221; implies that we are the Lord&#8217;s possession, that we already belong to Him. However, the phrase &#8220;for the Lord&#8221; implies that we still belong to ourselves, but according to our pleasure or convenience, we may be willing to give something for the Lord, do something for the Lord, or even be for the Lord. The Lord desires that we be to Him since we belong to Him already. Do not say that you are for Him. To say that you are for Him indicates that you still possess something under your ownership. Moreover, to be for the Lord means that we still can be away from the Lord. But if we are to the Lord, we cannot be away from Him. To be to the Lord means that we are one with Him.<p>Living to the Lord is based on the fact that we are the Lord&#8217;s (Rom. 14:8). We live to Him because we belong to Him. We need to realize that we have been bought by the Lord with the precious blood as the purchasing price (1 Cor. 6:19-20; 1 Pet. 1:18-19). Now He is our Lord and Master, and we belong to Him. Whatever we have, we have to Him. Whatever we do, we do to Him. Whatever we are, we are to Him. Everything is altogether to Him.<p>As believers in Christ, we are Christians. The title &#8220;Christian&#8221; implies belonging. It does not mean only that we are a &#8220;Christ-man&#8221; but also that we are a person belonging to Christ. When the ancient Romans referred to the believers as Christians, they meant that these people belonged to Christ. Because we are His, everything concerning us must be to Him. The practical meaning of the title Christian is not that we are people for Christ but that we are people belonging to Christ. Because we belong to Him, we live to Him, doing everything to Him. We do not need to say that we are doing something for Him, because we belong to Him. Every believer, as one bought by the Lord with a price, should be a person living to the Lord.<h2 class=head4>(1) No Longer to Themselves</h2><p>In 2 Corinthians 5:15 Paul says that the Lord Jesus &#8220;died on behalf of all, that those who live may no longer live to themselves, but to Him.&#8221; Worldly people live to themselves. But the love of Christ constrains us to live to Him and not to ourselves. To live to ourselves means that we are under our own control, direction, and governing and that we care for our own aims and goals. This is to live not only for ourselves but also to live to ourselves, taking the self as the goal of our living. But the apostles had the single ambition of pleasing the Lord by living to Him. They were absolutely under the Lord. They were under His direction, control, and governing. Everything they did was to fulfill the Lord&#8217;s purpose and desire. As such persons, they did not live to themselves but to the Lord.<p>Paul did not live to himself but to his Master, Christ. He was very different from the rabbis who lived to the law and did everything with a view to the law. Paul&#8217;s only aim was to please his Master. Paul sought to please the Lord not by doing a work but by living to Him in every aspect of his daily life. Likewise, we should not seek to please ourselves, but seek to please the Lord by living to Him. All that we do must be to Him. Since we are to the Lord, our time and money are also to Him. Nothing is to ourselves, because none of us lives to himself but to Him.<h2 class=head4>(2) Constrained by the Love of Christ Who Died for Them</h2><p>We live to Christ, not to ourselves, because &#8220;the love of Christ constrains us&#8221; (2 Cor. 5:14). The love of Christ here is the love which was manifested on the cross through His death for us. This love constrains us.<p>The Greek word rendered &#8220;constrains&#8221; in 5:14 literally means presses on from all sides, holding to one end, forcibly limiting, confining to one object within certain bounds, shutting up to one line and purpose, as in a narrow, walled road. In such a way the apostles were constrained by the love of Christ to live to Him. Today we also are constrained by Christ&#8217;s love toward us. This love surely limits us, confines us to a narrow way, toward the unique goal-Christ Himself. We need to be impressed with the fact that to be constrained by the love of Christ means to be pressed by it from all sides and held by it to one end. When we are thus constrained, we are limited, as if walking on a narrow, walled road, and we are forced to go in a certain direction. Although we love the Lord Jesus, we are not always willing to take His way. Without being walled in by Him, we probably would have escaped from Him. But the love of Christ constrains us; it presses us from every side and holds us to one goal. We have no other way. There is no other way for us to take. Actually, this is not our choice. If the choice had truly been ours, we would probably be somewhere else today. No, it is not up to us to make the choice; it is the love of Christ that constrains us. We are constrained by the Lord&#8217;s love to live to Him.<h2 class=head4>(3) In the Resurrection of Christ, an Issue of His Death</h2><p>In ourselves and by our natural life we are not able to live to the Lord. It is only in the resurrection of Christ, which is an issue of His death, that we are able to live to Him. Christ died on behalf of all so that we may no longer live to ourselves but to Him. Christ&#8217;s death, therefore, causes us, through His resurrection, to live to Him, not to ourselves.<p>When we are constrained, restricted, by the Lord&#8217;s love, we remain in His death. Actually, to be restricted in this way is to stay in His death. Christ&#8217;s death always issues in resurrection, and His resurrection life becomes our portion. Therefore, to be constrained by the love of Christ is to remain in His death, and remaining in the Lord&#8217;s death issues in the enjoyment of His resurrection. Then in the resurrection of Christ as an issue of His death we live to Him.<h2 class=head4>(4) Proving That They Are the Lord&#8217;s and That Christ Is Their Lord Who Died to Purchase Them to Himself</h2><p>The believers&#8217; living to Christ proves that they are the Lord&#8217;s and that Christ is their Lord who died to purchase them to Himself. Our living to the Lord is a declaration, a proclamation, that we belong to Him and thus live to Him as our goal. It is also a testimony that Christ is our Lord who died to purchase us to Himself (Rev. 5:9). As those who are the Lord&#8217;s, we are not living to our enjoyment, career, or future. Instead of caring for these things, we care only for Christ. He is our owner, for He paid the highest price- the price of His precious blood-to purchase us. Now that we belong to Him, in our living we take Him as our unique goal. We belong to Him, and we live to Him.<h2 class=head3>h. By Walking according to Spirit- Walking by the Spirit</h2><p>The believers enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation also by walking according to spirit-walking by the Spirit (Rom. 8:4b; Gal. 5:16, 25). If we live to Christ, spontaneously we shall walk according to spirit and by the Spirit.<p>Romans 8:4 says, &#8220;That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.&#8221; The word &#8220;walk&#8221; here means to live, move, and have our being. This word indicates that we should do everything in spirit. This is to have our being and our daily life according to spirit.<p>As believers, we should not only walk according to spirit but also walk by the Spirit. In Galatians 5:16 Paul says, &#8220;Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.&#8221; The word &#8220;walk&#8221; includes everything we do and say. Hence, it covers our whole daily life. In this verse Paul is charging us to have our daily life-to live, walk, and have our being-by the Spirit. The Christian walk is absolutely by the Spirit. According to the context of chapter five, the Spirit in 5:16 must be the Holy Spirit, who dwells in our regenerated spirit and mingles with it. To walk by the Spirit is to have our walk regulated by the Holy Spirit within our spirit.<p>In Galatians 5:25 Paul speaks again about walking by the Spirit. &#8220;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&#8221; To live by the Spirit is to have our life dependent upon the Spirit and regulated by the Spirit. To walk by the Spirit is to have our practical living and acts in our daily life guided and ruled by the Spirit. Since our life is by the Spirit, so our daily walk should also be by the Spirit.<p>In Galatians 5:16 and 25 Paul uses two different Greek words for walk. This indicates that in the New Testament there are two kinds of walk by the Spirit. The Greek word for walk in verse 16, peripateo, means to have our being, to deport ourselves, to order our manner of life, to walk about. It is used with respect to ordinary daily life, and it denotes a common, habitual daily walk. The Greek word for walk in verse 25, stoicheo, means to march in military rank by keeping step, that is, to walk orderly. It is derived from the root which means to arrange in a line. Thus, this Greek word for walk means to walk in line; it also means to march in military rank. This kind of walk is more regulated than the first. In the first kind of walk we are free to walk about, but in the second kind of walk we need to walk like an army and keep in step. However, both kinds of walk are by the Spirit. Every believer in Christ should have both kinds of walk by the Spirit.<p>In the first kind of walk by the Spirit we take the Spirit as the essence of our life, and in the second kind of walk we take the Spirit as the path for our way so that we may fulfill God&#8217;s purpose and reach the goal of our life on earth. The first kind of walk is for the second. When we take the Spirit as the essence of our life, we shall then be able to take the Spirit as the path for our way. If we have both kinds of walk by the Spirit, we shall reach God&#8217;s goal, and His purpose will be accomplished.<h2 class=head4>(1) According to the Mingled Spirit, Their Spirit Mingled with the Spirit of Life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ</h2><p>Walking according to spirit and by the Spirit is to walk according to the mingled spirit, our spirit mingled with the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:2, 9, 16). The Spirit of life is the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ. Such a threefold Spirit has been mingled with our spirit to become one mingled spirit.<p>Bible translators realize that it is difficult to determine whether the spirit in Romans 8:4, as well as in other verses in this chapter, refers to the Holy Spirit or our human spirit. Of course, in certain verses, such as 9 and 16, the Holy Spirit and the human spirit are clearly designated. In verse 4 the spirit refers to our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. Actually, these two spirits have become one. As Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6:17, &#8220;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&#8221; We have a wonderful mingled spirit, our human spirit regenerated by the divine Spirit and indwelt by the divine Spirit. In the New Testament we are charged to live, walk, and have our being according to this mingled spirit. The more we are willing to bear the cross, remaining in the Lord&#8217;s death and under the constraint of His love, the more we shall be energized by the resurrection life to always walk according to the mingled spirit. This kind of walk is the highest walk, a walk that is higher than a walk that is merely according to the Bible in letters.<h2 class=head4>(2) Setting Their Mind on Their Mingled Spirit</h2><p>Romans 8:6 says, &#8220;The mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&#8221; The spirit in this verse refers to the mingled spirit, our regenerated spirit mingled with the divine Spirit. We should continually set our mind on this mingled spirit. If our mind is set on the flesh, the mind will be death. But if we turn our mind to the mingled spirit and set it on the spirit, our mind will be life and peace. First, our spirit becomes life through regeneration (Rom. 8:10). Then by being set on the spirit our mind can also become life.<p>It is a great protection for us to set our mind on the mingled spirit. This enables us to walk by the Spirit in our daily living and to keep ourselves in the divine dispensing. By setting our mind on the mingled spirit, we enjoy the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity.<h2 class=head4>(3) Freed from the Law of Sin and of Death</h2><p>As the believers set their mind on the mingled spirit and walk according to this spirit, they are freed from the law of sin and of death. In Romans 8:2 Paul says, &#8220;The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.&#8221; In this verse &#8220;law&#8221; denotes a principle, an unchanging rule, that operates automatically and spontaneously. Every kind of life, including the satanic life and the divine life, has such a law, which is the innate ability of that life. This ability is inborn, spontaneous, automatic, constant, and instant. The life of God is the highest life with the highest characteristics and capabilities. Because these highest characteristics and capabilities constitute the law of the life of God, this law is the highest law.<p>In Romans 8:2 Paul speaks not merely of the law of life but of the law of the Spirit of life. The law of the Spirit of life is nothing less than the processed Triune God becoming the life-giving Spirit to dwell within us. After being processed, the Triune God has been dispensed into us to become the law of the Spirit of life in us, and this law now frees us from the law of sin and death, the law of the satanic life. Because the highest law, the law of the Spirit of life, is operating within us, there is no need for us to strive to overcome the law of sin and of death. Instead of striving, we should simply allow the law of the Spirit of life to work within us.<p>As we remain in the death of Christ, the resurrection life that issues from this death will become the element that energizes us to walk according to the mingled spirit and to set our mind upon this spirit. Spontaneously we are freed from the evil law of the satanic life, the law of sin and of death. Then in our experience the evil law is defeated, and we are in Christ enjoying another law, the highest law, the law of the Spirit of life.<h2 class=head4>(4) Fulfilling the Righteous Requirement of the Law</h2><p>Romans 8:4 indicates that when we walk according to spirit, the righteous requirements of the law are fulfilled in us. If we walk according to the mingled spirit, all the righteous requirements of the law will be fulfilled spontaneously. There will be no need for us to try to keep the law, for the requirements of the law are fulfilled automatically by the law of the Spirit of life. For this reason, Paul gives us a unique commandment-to live, walk, and have our being according to the mingled spirit.<p>When we walk according to spirit, we spontaneously keep the law, even though that is not our intention. Our intention is to live to Christ and to walk according to spirit, but the outcome is that all the righteous requirements of the law are fulfilled in us. Actually, we live a life with a standard higher than that of the Ten Commandments, a life with the standard of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens revealed in Matthew 5 through 7. Therefore, when we walk according to spirit, we have a standard of morality much higher than that required by the Mosaic law.<h2 class=head4>(5) Not Fulfilling the Lusts of the Flesh, but Bringing Forth the Fruit of the Spirit</h2><p>As the believers walk by the Spirit, they do not fulfill the lusts of the flesh but instead bring forth the fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22-23). When we live to Christ and walk according to spirit, we have no interest or willingness to fulfill the lusts of our flesh. Rather, we bring forth the fruit of the Spirit as the issue of walking by the Spirit.<p>The result of walking by the Spirit is the fruit of the Spirit. There is no need for us to strive to love, to keep the peace, or to be joyful. Instead, we simply need to live by the Spirit and walk by the Spirit. Then the fruit of the Spirit will be brought forth automatically. As we walk by the Spirit, the fruit of the Spirit will come forth with many aspects as virtues. These virtues are different aspects of the expression of the unique living fruit that is produced by walking by the Spirit. This is something far greater than morality-it is a divine-human virtue, a virtue expressed in our human life through the divine, resurrection power.<h2 class=head3>i. By Sowing unto the Spirit in Their Life</h2><p>The believers enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by sowing unto the Spirit in their life. If we walk according to spirit, set our mind on the spirit, are freed from the law of sin and of death, spontaneously fulfill the righteous requirement of the law, and bring forth the fruit of the Spirit, we shall sow unto the Spirit. &#8220;He who sows unto his own flesh, shall reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life&#8221; (Gal. 6:8). Unto the Spirit the believers sow, and of the Spirit they reap in their life.<p>The Greek word translated &#8220;unto&#8221; in 6:8 also means with a view to or for. It also implies taking something as our goal. To sow unto the flesh is to have the flesh as the goal. But to sow unto the Spirit is to sow with a view to accomplishing the purpose of the Spirit. This is to have the Spirit as our goal. Thus, the Spirit should be not only our life and walk but also the goal of our living. Whatever we do, we do with a view toward this goal. We need to take the Spirit as our unique and eternal goal. In His New Testament economy God has given Himself to us as the Spirit. Now we should sow unto the Spirit, taking the Spirit as our goal.<p>Sowing covers the totality of the Christian life. Everything we do or say is some kind of sowing, either to the flesh or to the Spirit. Therefore, it is crucial for us to realize that the Christian life is a life of sowing unto the Spirit.<h2 class=head4>(1) Not Sowing unto the Flesh to Reap Corruption of the Flesh</h2><p>Because sowing causes a certain result, Paul warned us to be careful of our sowing. He says, &#8220;He who sows unto his own flesh, shall reap corruption of the flesh&#8221; (Gal. 6:8a). To sow unto the flesh is to sow with a view to the flesh, or for the flesh, with the purpose of the flesh in view, fulfilling what the flesh covets. To sow for the fulfilling of the purpose of the flesh issues in corruption, and corruption, no doubt, includes death. Sowing unto the flesh will always produce a harvest of corruption.<h2 class=head4>(2) Reaping of the Spirit Eternally</h2><p>If we sow unto the Spirit, we shall reap of the Spirit eternally. Paul says, &#8220;He who sows unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life&#8221; (Gal. 6:8b). To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with the aim of the Spirit, accomplishing what the Spirit desires. To sow for the accomplishing of the aim of the Spirit issues in life, even eternal life. Eternal life is of the Spirit and is the Spirit Himself. If we sow unto the Spirit, we shall reap eternal life of the Spirit. Sowing unto the Spirit will always produce a harvest of life eternal.<h2 class=head3>j. By Walking by Faith Not by Appearance (Sight)</h2><p>The believers also enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity by walking by faith not by appearance (sight). A person who lives to Christ and walks by the Spirit will never walk by appearance, by sight, but by faith.<p>Second Corinthians 5:7 says, &#8220;We walk by faith, not by appearance.&#8221; Appearance here refers to that which is seen; hence, to sight. The believers regulate their life and conduct themselves by faith, as testified in Hebrews 11, not by that which is seen. This corresponds to Paul&#8217;s word in 2 Corinthians 4:18. Whereas all of fallen mankind walks by appearance we, as those who enjoy the divine dispensing, walk by faith.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(36)</h1><p>In this message we shall begin to consider the believers&#8217; enjoying the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by living in the organism of the divine Trinity and participating in the dispensing of the divine Trinity.<h2 class=head3>k. By Living in the Organism of the Divine Trinity and Participating in the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity</h2><p>The Lord&#8217;s word in John 14-16 is profound and mysterious. In these chapters, the crucial center of the Gospel of John, it is not the Lord&#8217;s intention to give a superficial sermon to His followers. On the contrary, here the Lord is seeking to bring the disciples into the depths of the inexhaustible, divine mysteries. These mysteries include the Father&#8217;s house with its many abodes, the vine, and the newborn child.<p>Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of the Gospel of John reveal that the believers in Christ live in the organism of the divine Trinity and participate in the dispensing of the divine Trinity. The divine Trinity has an organism that is constituted of Christ and all His members. Christ is organic, and His members also are organic. Christ and His members have been brought together into a divine constitution to form an organic entity, the organism of the divine Trinity. The believers live in this organism and thus participate in the dispensing of the divine Trinity. This is for our transformation, which results in conformation to the image of the firstborn Son of God.<h2 class=head4>(1) Having Been Convicted by the Spirit of Reality</h2><p>As those living in the organism of the divine Trinity, the believers have been convicted by the Spirit of reality (John 16:8-11). The Spirit of reality (John 16:13) is commonly called the Spirit of truth. In the writings of John, truth denotes not doctrines but divine realities. Hence, the Spirit of reality or truth is the Spirit of the divine realities. We have been convicted by such a Spirit concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment.<h2 class=head5>(a) Concerning Sin in Adam Because of Not Believing in the Son</h2><p>John 16:8-11 says of the Spirit, &#8220;Having come, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer behold Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.&#8221; First, the Spirit convicts concerning sin, which entered through Adam (Rom. 5:12). We were born of sin in Adam. The only way to be freed from sin is to believe in Christ, the Son of God. If we believe in Him, He will be righteousness to us, and we shall be justified in Him (Rom. 3:24; 4:25). If we do not repent of the sin in Adam and believe in Christ the Son of God, we shall remain in sin and share the judgment of Satan for eternity.<p>In John 16:9 the Lord Jesus said that the Spirit of reality will convict the world concerning sin &#8220;because they do not believe in Me.&#8221; Here we see that the unique sin for perishing is to not believe in the Son. Hence, sin in 16:9 is the unwillingness to be transferred from Adam into Christ. There is no need for a person to commit sin in order to perish. Simply by refusing to believe in the Lord Jesus he will be qualified for perishing. The unique way to escape our sinful situation is to believe in the Lord, and the unique sin that qualifies us for perishing is not to believe in Him. For this reason, according to the New Testament, God will judge the unbelievers in this age not according to the Ten Commandments but according to one unique commandment-the commandment to repent and believe in the Son of God. The unique commandment God gives to the world today is to believe in the Son of God. Therefore, when the Lord judges the unbelievers, He will inquire if they have believed in the Son of God. The Spirit of the divine realities has come to convict us concerning the sin of unbelief. Anyone who does not believe in the Son of God will remain a sinner in Adam until the time comes for him to be judged.<h2 class=head5>(b) Concerning Righteousness in Christ Because of the Son&#8217;s Going to the Father in Resurrection and Ascension</h2><p>In John 16:10 the Lord Jesus says that the Spirit will convict the world &#8220;concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer behold Me.&#8221; Righteousness is the resurrected Christ (1 Cor. 1:30). It was in resurrection that Christ the Son went to the Father in the heavens. This is a strong sign that Christ has accomplished full redemption and this redemption has been accepted by God the Father. Therefore, if we believe in Christ, we receive the righteousness of God in Christ, a righteousness which is Christ Himself. It is by this righteousness that we are justified by God. The very Son of God who has satisfied the righteous requirements of the Father and has been accepted by Him has been given to the believers as their righteousness. Therefore, Christ Himself is now our righteousness. Because the Son has been given to the believers as their righteousness, they are justified in Him before God. It is only in the Son as our righteousness that we are justified by God.<h2 class=head5>(c) Concerning Judgment on Satan Because of the Ruler of This World Having Been Judged</h2><p>Finally, the Spirit of reality convicts &#8220;concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged&#8221; (John 16:11). Satan, the ruler of the world, has been judged through the death of Christ on the cross (John 12:31-33; 3:14). The judgment in 16:11, therefore, is related to Satan, the Devil, the author of sin, the origin of death, the father of sinners, and the ruler of the world. As such, judgment has been prepared for him. The lake of fire has been prepared as God&#8217;s judgment upon Satan; it was not intended for man. However, those who refuse to be transferred out of Adam into Christ will share the judgment that is for Satan. This means that any sinner who does not believe in the Son will remain with the Devil and bear his judgment. God loves the world (John 3:16) and has no intention that any human being be cast into the lake of fire, the judgment intended for the Devil. Nevertheless, if someone remains a companion of Satan by refusing to believe in the Son, God has no choice but to allow that one to suffer Satan&#8217;s judgment.<p>In John 16:8-11 the Lord Jesus presents the gospel in a marvelous and mysterious way. In these verses the convicting work of the Spirit of reality is related to three persons: Adam, Christ, and Satan. We all became fallen in Adam, but we may believe in Christ and be justified. Because Christ was accepted by God in His death, God raised Him up from among the dead, and now He becomes righteousness to all who believe in Him. Satan, the source of death, has been judged and destroyed through Christ&#8217;s death (Heb. 2:14).<p>The three main items in John 16:8-11 are related to the three persons of Adam, Christ, and Satan: sin is related to Adam, righteousness is related to Christ, and judgment is related to Satan. We were born of Adam, but we have believed in Christ and received Him as our righteousness. However, all those who do not believe in Christ but remain followers of Satan will suffer the judgment of Satan. One day the Spirit came to convict us concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment. We repented, believed in the Lord Jesus, and escaped the judgment that is upon Satan. We have been transferred out of Adam into Christ, and we have become children of God and members of Christ. As Christ&#8217;s members, we live in the organism of the divine Trinity and participate in the dispensing of the divine Trinity.<h2 class=head4>(2) Having Been Born, Brought Forth, as the New Child</h2><p>The believers live in the organism of the divine Trinity and participate in the dispensing of the divine Trinity also through having been born, brought forth, as the new child (John 16:19-22). In His resurrection Christ brought forth the corporate child-the corporate new man-including Himself as God&#8217;s firstborn Son and His many brothers as God&#8217;s many sons. In John 16:20-21 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, that you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice; you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. When a woman gives birth she has sorrow, because her hour has come; but when she brings forth the child, she no longer remembers the affliction because of the joy that a man has been born into the world.&#8221; Here the Lord indicates that the disciples were like a woman travailing in birth, and He was the child to be brought forth in His resurrection (Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5; Rom. 1:4). Actually, the man in John 16:21 includes Christ and all the believers. The birth that took place through Christ&#8217;s resurrection involved the birth not only of an individual but of a group, a group that includes the firstborn Son of God and the many sons of God. This indicates that through one birth many sons were brought forth. According to God&#8217;s view, all His chosen people were born together with Christ in His resurrection. This resurrection was the birth of a corporate child.<h2 class=head5>(a) Through Christ&#8217;s Going and Coming- Death and Resurrection</h2><p>The believers have been brought forth as a new child through Christ&#8217;s going and coming, that is, through His death and resurrection. When the disciples heard about the Lord&#8217;s going, they understood it in a natural way. They thought that the Lord&#8217;s going meant that He would leave them and stay away from them forever. However, according to the Gospel of John, the Lord&#8217;s going was to die an all-inclusive death to take away sin, terminate the old creation, judge the world, destroy Satan, abolish the law of commandments and ordinances, release the divine life, and prepare a place for the believers to enter into God.<p>Many readers of the Gospel of John think that the Lord&#8217;s coming in John 14 refers to His second advent. But by the word &#8220;coming&#8221; the Lord was referring to something that was to happen only a few days later-His resurrection. The Lord&#8217;s coming was His resurrection to germinate us in order to have a new creation to produce the church, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. Therefore, in John 14, the Son&#8217;s coming signifies His coming as the Spirit in resurrection. His going was His death, and His coming was His resurrection. Death was a preparatory step for resurrection. The Lord Jesus died so that He might enter into resurrection. Actually, His going was His coming for He came by going.<p>When the disciples heard about the Lord&#8217;s going, they were disappointed, thinking that they would lose their dear Lord. However, He comforted them by indicating that He would go through death in order to come to them in resurrection and enter into them. The Lord said to them, &#8220;I am coming to you&#8221; (John 14:18). Then He went on to say, &#8220;In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&#8221; (14:20). That day was the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection (John 20:19). On the day of His resurrection the Lord came back to the disciples to breathe Himself into them as the Spirit of the divine realities. This means that the One who entered into them was the Lord Himself as the pneumatic Christ. That was His coming back to enter into the disciples. Therefore, through Christ&#8217;s going and coming, through His death and resurrection, the new child was born.<h2 class=head5>(b) As the Aggregate of All the Children (Sons) of God Brought Forth with Christ in His Resurrection</h2><p>The new child is the aggregate of all the children (John 1:12) or sons of God brought forth with Christ in His resurrection (Acts 13:33; 1 Pet. 1:3) as His many brothers (Rom. 8:29). This new child consists of Christ as the firstborn Son of God with all His brothers. All the believers, therefore, are parts, members, of this new child.<p>The new child as the aggregate of all the children of God was brought forth in Christ&#8217;s resurrection. According to 1 Peter 1:3, God regenerated us through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. When Christ was resurrected, we were regenerated to be children of God. The new child is the aggregate of all the children of God regenerated by God through the resurrection of Christ. Hence, the Lord&#8217;s resurrection was a universal delivery, the delivery not of a single child but of a corporate child including Christ as the Head and His many brothers as the Body. This was the birth of a new corporate child comprising Christ and the believers.<h2 class=head5>(c) To Be the New Man as the Body of Christ</h2><p>The new child brought forth with Christ in His resurrection is the new man as the Body of Christ (Eph. 2:15; Col. 3:10-11). The birth of the new child was actually the birth of the new man. The old man was created by God in Genesis 1 and 2, but the new man was born through the resurrection of Christ. We were born into the old man, but we were regenerated into the new man. This new man includes Christ as the Head and all the believers as the Body. The Head is the firstborn Son of God, and the Body is a composition of all the many sons of God, the many brothers of the Lord. This new man, this child, was brought forth through Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection.<h2 class=head4>(3) Abiding in the Son (the Vine as the Organism of the Divine Trinity) with the Father as the Expression of the Father</h2><p>The believers live in the organism of the divine Trinity and participate in the dispensing of the divine Trinity by abiding in the Son (the vine as the organism of the divine Trinity) with the Father as the expression of the Father (John 15:1-8; 14:9-10). The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman&#8221; (John 15:1). He also said to the disciples, &#8220;I am the vine, you are the branches&#8221; (v. 5a). Christ as the true vine is the universal organism of the divine Trinity. The Son is the vine, the Father is the husbandman, and the Spirit is the testifier. Hence, this vine is the organism of the divine Trinity.<p>Christ and the believers, the vine with the branches, form the organism of the divine Trinity in the divine dispensing. The vine in John 15, therefore, is a universal vine comprising Christ and His believers as the branches. In this vine, this organism, the Triune God lives, expresses Himself, and dispenses Himself to the uttermost.<p>Christ as the true vine is the center of God&#8217;s economy, of God&#8217;s universal enterprise. In the Bible the universe is pictured as a vineyard, and centered in the universe is the vine, Christ. Everything that God the Father is and has is for the vine as the center and is embodied and expressed through this center. God the Father is expressed, manifested, and glorified through the vine. God is life, and this life needs an organism in which to grow and express itself. God desires to grow within an organism and to have Himself expressed by means of this organism. This organism is the vine with the branches, Christ with the believers. As the organism of the divine Trinity, this vine is corporate and universal.<p>As branches of the vine, we need to abide in the vine. The Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in Me. I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing&#8221; (John 15:4-5). Only when the branches abide in the vine can the vine be everything to them. Our life and enjoyment are to abide in the vine, and our destiny as branches is to remain in the vine. Apart from the vine, we, the branches, can do nothing. Therefore, it is crucial for us to abide in the Lord and for the Lord to abide in us. Because we are branches to the Lord and the Lord is the vine to us, we must abide in Him and let Him abide in us. Then in our experience Christ will be everything to us for our enjoyment.<p>When we abide in Christ the Son who is the expression of the Father, we abide in the Son with the Father. This is a mystery. As members of Christ, we abide not only in Him but in Him with the Father. When we abide in the Son, we abide in the Son with the Father. This means that we abide in the Father as well as in the Son.<h2 class=head5>(a) To Bear Fruit</h2><p>We abide in the Son in order to bear fruit. Fruit-bearing comes about as the branches abide in the vine and let the vine abide in the branches. This fruit-bearing is the overflow of the riches of the life of the vine. This means that bearing fruit is a matter of the overflow of our inner life. We need continuously to enjoy Christ as everything to us. Then we shall have an abundance of life. Out of this abundance there will be a flow that will reach others, penetrating into their lives, and this flow will bear fruit. This is fruit-bearing by the overflow of the riches of the divine life.<h2 class=head5>(b) For the Father to Be Glorified</h2><p>The bearing of fruit is for the Father to be glorified. In John 15:8 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit.&#8221; In fruit-bearing the Father&#8217;s life is expressed; hence, in fruit-bearing He is glorified. The vine and the branches are an organism to glorify the Father. With the vine we have the glorification of the Father through the expression of the riches of the divine life in fruit-bearing.<p>The fruit born by the branches of the vine is the expression of the life of the vine. If the branches do not bear fruit, there will not be any expression of the inner life element of the vine. However, the fruit born by the branches is the expression of the inner life of the vine. This is an illustration of how the Father is glorified through our fruit-bearing.<p>The word &#8220;glorify&#8221; in John 15:8 means to have the intent, content, inner life, and inner riches expressed. As an organism to glorify the Father, the vine and the branches express the riches of the Father&#8217;s life. When the vine bears clusters of grapes, the riches of the divine life are expressed. This expression is the glorification of the Father because the Father is the divine life.<p>The Father is the source and the substance of the vine. Apart from the fruit borne by the branches, the essence, substance, and life of the vine are concealed and confined. But when the branches bear much fruit, the riches of the inner life of the vine are expressed in the fruit. This expression is the release of the divine substance from within the vine. This is the glorification of the Father, for it is the expression of the riches of the Father&#8217;s life. Whenever the divine life is expressed through us in fruit-bearing, the Father is glorified. The inner life, the intrinsic element, of the divine Father is expressed. This expression is not merely glory-it is the Father&#8217;s glorification. As we abide in the vine to bear much fruit, a transaction takes place which results in the glorification of the Father.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(37)</h1><p>In the foregoing message we saw that, as those living in the organism of the divine Trinity, the believers have been convicted by the Spirit of reality, they have been brought forth as the new child, and they abide in the Son with the Father to bear fruit for the Father&#8217;s glorification. Now we shall go on to see that the believers are indwelt by the Spirit and participate in the dispensing of the divine Trinity.<h2 class=head4>(4) Being Indwelt by the Spirit</h2><p>In John 14:17 the Lord Jesus speaks of &#8220;the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.&#8221; This verse speaks concerning the indwelling of the Spirit. Here we have the first mention of the indwelling of the Spirit, a matter that is fully developed in the Epistles (1 Cor. 6:19; Rom. 8:9, 11). The central and main concept of the Epistles is that Christ today as the life-giving Spirit indwells our spirit as our life and everything for the building up of the Body.<p>John 20:22 also indicates that the Spirit enters into us: &#8220;When He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Here we have the receiving of the Spirit promised in John 14:17. The Lord&#8217;s breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise that the Spirit of reality would dwell in us.<h2 class=head5>(a) With the Son and the Father</h2><p>When the Spirit indwells us, He indwells us with the Son and the Father (John 14:23; 15:26). This means that when the Spirit comes, the Son and the Father also come. When the Spirit dwells in us, both the Son and the Father dwell in us with the Spirit. As John 14:17 makes clear, the Spirit of reality abides in us. In verse 23 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; If we compare verses 17 and 23, we shall see that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit abide in us. Therefore, the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-dwells in us. Romans 8:9-11 also indicates that the Spirit dwells in us with the Son and the Father. When we exercise our spirit to call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit moves within our spirit. Because the Father and the Son dwell in our spirit with the Spirit, we sense that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us.<p>Another verse which indicates that the Spirit dwells in us with the Son and the Father is John 15:26. &#8220;When the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me.&#8221; According to this verse, the Spirit proceeds from the Father. The sense in Greek of the word translated &#8220;from&#8221; is from with. The Spirit of reality is sent by the Son, not only from the Father but also from with the Father. The Spirit comes from the Father and with the Father. The Father is the source. For the Spirit to come from the source does not mean that He leaves the source; it means that the source comes with Him. When the Spirit comes, the Father also comes.<p>The Comforter, the Holy Spirit, is sent by the Father in the Son&#8217;s name to be the reality of His name. The name is the Son Himself, and the Spirit is the person, the being, of the Son. When we call on the name of the Son, we get the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3). The Son came in the Father&#8217;s name (John 5:43) because the Son and the Father are one (John 10:30). Now the Spirit comes in the Son&#8217;s name because the Spirit and the Son also are one (2 Cor. 3:17). This is the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-reaching us eventually as the Spirit.<p>The Spirit comes in the name of the Son. The name of the Son is Jesus, and His person is the Spirit. God the Father sends the Spirit, and the Spirit comes in the name of the Son. Eventually, it is the Triune God who comes. When the Spirit comes to us, the Father also comes. The Son is also here because the Spirit comes with the Father in the name of the Son. The Father sends the Spirit from with Himself, and the Spirit comes in the name of the Son and as the Son. He is the Son coming, and this Son coming is from with the Father. Therefore, when one comes, all three are present.<p>We need to emphasize the fact that when the Spirit comes, the Triune God comes. The reason for this is that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit cannot be separated, because all Three are one. We do not have language adequate to describe this fact. Nevertheless, it is a divine fact that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one. Although the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are distinct, they are one, inseparable, indivisible, and undivided. Therefore, when the Spirit dwells in us, He dwells in us with the Son and the Father.<h2 class=head5>(b) As the Reality of the Son</h2><p>The Spirit dwells within us as the reality of the Son (John 14:18-20). The Spirit is the reality of Christ. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we receive the Spirit as the reality of Christ, and this Christ, the Son of God, is the embodiment of the Father (Col. 2:9). The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is fully realized as the Spirit. Colossians 2:9 says that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. Christ, then, is the embodiment of God fully realized as the Spirit of reality.<p>The Spirit has come into the believers to be the reality of the Son within them. The all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed Triune God, is fully realized as the Spirit who dwells within us. This indwelling Spirit is the reality, the very realization, of Christ.<p>The Spirit is called the Spirit of reality because whatever the Father in the Son is and whatever the Son is, is realized in the Spirit. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, reality had not yet entered man. This reality was present, for Christ Himself is reality (John 14:6). However, this reality was only among the disciples, not in them. Therefore, the Lord went away through death in order to have a change in form, a change from the form of the flesh to the form of the Spirit. After this change had been accomplished, Christ&#8217;s reality became the reality of the Spirit, and the Spirit became the Spirit of reality. Now this Spirit dwells in us as the reality of the Son. Because the Spirit of reality dwells in us, the reality of Christ now dwells in us.<p>After the Spirit has brought us to salvation and has regenerated us, He becomes in us the reality of the Son. Whatever the Son is, has, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained is being wrought into us through the Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit becomes the realization of the Son, the reality of all that the Son is and has.<h2 class=head5>(c) To Be Another Comforter (Paraclete)</h2><p>The Spirit indwells the believers to be another Comforter (Paraclete). In John 14:16 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;Comforter&#8221; here is parakletos. Paraclete is the anglicized form of this Greek word. In Greek parakletos denotes someone along side who takes care of our case, our affairs. It is composed of two words: a preposition that means with and a form of the word for call. In ancient times a paraclete was a helper, an advocate, a counsel, an intercessor, someone who served a particular person by taking care of his needs. As one who is always present, a paraclete may be regarded as a waiter, a helper, and even an attorney. The Paraclete, the Comforter, signifies that the Spirit is the One called to our side to help us. Hence, the Paraclete is a Helper. The Spirit as the Paraclete is always available to help us. Furthermore, the Paraclete is an Advocate and a Counsel. He is also the One who consoles us. Hence, He is the Consoler, the Comforter, the Paraclete. The indwelling Spirit is our Helper, Counselor, and Comforter who takes care of our needs in our daily living.<p>John 14:16 refers to the Spirit as &#8220;another Comforter.&#8221; This indicates that the Son was already present as the first Comforter. The Son was a Comforter, but He asks the Father to give the believers another Comforter. John 14:16-20 reveals that the other Comforter to be given is the reality of the Comforter who was asking the Father. This other Comforter is the Spirit of reality. Verse 17 says, &#8220;Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.&#8221; The original Comforter was only abiding with the disciples; He was not in them. However, the other Comforter, the Spirit of reality, would not only be with the disciples but also in them. Today the Spirit as another Comforter dwells in us.<p>In John 14:26 the Lord Jesus goes on to say, &#8220;The Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and remind you of all things which I said to you.&#8221; The Comforter, the Holy Spirit, will be sent by the Father in the Son&#8217;s name. Thus, the Holy Spirit comes in the Son&#8217;s name to be the reality of the name. The name is the Son Himself; the Spirit is the person, the being of the Son. Hence, when we call on the name of the Son, we receive the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3), and this Spirit is the Paraclete.<p>In 14:26 we have the Three of the divine Trinity: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. According to this verse, the Father sends the Spirit in the name of the Son. Therefore, when the Spirit comes, the Father and the Son come with Him. Because the Son comes in the name of the Father (John 5:43), the Son is called the Father (Isa. 9:6). Because the Spirit is sent by the Father in the Son&#8217;s name, so the Spirit comes in the name of the Son with the Father. This means that when the Spirit comes, the Triune God comes.<p>Just as the Son does not come in His own name but comes in the name of the Father, so the Spirit does not come in His own name but comes in the name of the Son. This means that although the Spirit is here, He is not here in His own name, but in the Son&#8217;s name. Furthermore, the Son is here in the Father&#8217;s name, not in His own name. Therefore, when the Spirit is here, the Son is here, and when the Son is here, the Father is here. This means that when the Spirit comes, all Three of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-come with the Spirit.<h2 class=head4>(5) Participating in the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity</h2><p>John 16:13-15 say, &#8220;When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come. He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; therefore I said that He receives of Mine and shall disclose it to you.&#8221; These verses reveal that the believers participate in the dispensing of the divine Trinity. The Father has given all that He has to the Son, and the Spirit receives what is the Son&#8217;s and discloses it to the believers. Because the Father has given everything He has to the Son, the Son is His embodiment. Now whatever the Son is has been passed on to the Spirit. Hence, the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son. By this we see that the Son is the embodiment of the Father and the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son. This means that when we have the Spirit, we have the Son, and when we have the Son, we have the Father. We have all three: the Father as the source, the Son as the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit as the transfiguration of the Son.<h2 class=head5>(a) All That the Father Has Has Been Given to the Son</h2><p>In John 16:15a the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;All that the Father has is Mine.&#8221; All that the Father is and has is the Son&#8217;s. The Son is the embodiment of the Father. Hence, all that the Father is and has is embodied in Him (Col. 2:9). All that the Father is, all the fullness of the Godhead, dwells in Christ. Therefore, the Father&#8217;s fullness is the Son&#8217;s fullness, and the Father&#8217;s life and nature are also the Son&#8217;s life and nature.<h2 class=head5>(b) All That the Son Is, Has, and Does Has Been Received by the Spirit</h2><p>In John 16:14b the Lord Jesus, speaking of the Spirit of reality, says, &#8220;He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you.&#8221; The Lord repeats this word in verse 15b. All that the Father is and has is the Son&#8217;s, and all that the Son is and has obtained has been received by the Spirit. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ, and the Spirit receives this from Christ.<h2 class=head5>(c) The Spirit Discloses What He Has Received of the Son to the Believers, Testifying for Him and Glorifying Him</h2><p>What the Spirit receives of the Lord He discloses to us (John 16:14c, 15c, 13; 14:26b). Furthermore, the Spirit of reality guides us into all the reality. Furthermore, according to John 15:26, the Spirit of reality testifies concerning Christ, and according to 16:14a, He will glorify Christ. All that the Son is and has is revealed as reality to the believers through the Spirit. This is to glorify the Son with the Father. The Spirit glorifies the Son by revealing Him with all the fullness of the Father. This means that the Spirit glorifies the Son by revealing Him to us.<p>The Spirit discloses the Son with the Father to the believers. He makes all that Christ is and has real to us. The following stanza from one of our hymns speaks of this:<p class=hbody>All things of the Father are Thine;<br>All Thou art in Spirit is mine;<br>The Spirit makes Thee real to me,<br>That Thou experienced might be.</p><p>These words were written according to John 16:14-15.<p>John 16:14 and 15 unveil the transmission of the divine Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, into the believers. The Father as the source, the origin, has an abundance of riches. All that the Father has becomes the Son&#8217;s. Now the Son has not only what the Father has but also all the riches in His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. All these riches contained in the Son are received by the Spirit, and the Spirit discloses them to us. This disclosing is a transmission of the riches of what the processed Triune God is and has into our being. The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is transfigured to be the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reaching of the divine Trinity to us. Therefore, all the riches of the Triune God reach us in the Spirit.<p>All that the Triune God is and has is disclosed, conveyed, transmitted into us. Because we are organically united to the Spirit, that is, organically one with the processed Triune God, whatever He is and has is now our portion. This means that whatever the processed Triune God is and has will become our element, our essence, our being, making the processed Triune God the very essence of our being.<h2 class=head5>(d) For the Father to Be Glorified in the Glorification of the Son</h2><p>Our participation in the dispensing of the divine Trinity is for the Father to be glorified in the glorification of the Son. In John 17:1 the Lord Jesus prayed, &#8220;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&#8221; The subject of the Lord&#8217;s prayer in this chapter is the glorification of the Father in the glorification of the Son. The Son was God incarnated, and His flesh was a tabernacle for God&#8217;s dwelling on earth (John 1:14). His divine element was confined in His humanity, just as God&#8217;s shekinah glory was concealed within the tabernacle. Once, on the mountain of transfiguration, His divine element was released from within His flesh and expressed in glory, being seen by the three disciples (Matt. 17:1-4). However, it was concealed again in His flesh. Before the prayer recorded in John 17, the Lord predicted that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him (John 12:23; 13:31-32). Now He was going to pass through death that the concealing shell of His humanity might be broken for His divine element, His divine life, to be released. He was also to resurrect that He might uplift His humanity into the divine element and that His divine element might be expressed, that His entire being, both divinity and humanity, might be glorified. Thus the Father would be glorified in Him. Hence, He prayed for this.<p>This prayer of the Lord Jesus concerning glorification will be fulfilled in three stages. First, it was fulfilled in His resurrection, in that His divine element, His divine life, was released from within His humanity into His many believers (John 12:23-24), and His whole being including His humanity was brought into glory (Luke 24:26), and in that the Father&#8217;s divine element was expressed. God answered and fulfilled His prayer in His resurrection (Acts 3:13-15). Second, it has been fulfilled in the church, in that as His resurrection life has been expressed through His many members, He has been glorified in them and the Father has been glorified in Him through the church (Eph. 3:21; 1 Tim. 3:15-16). Third, it will be ultimately fulfilled in the New Jerusalem, in that He will be fully expressed in glory, and God will also be glorified in Him through the holy city for eternity (Rev. 21:11, 23-24).<p>The subject of the divine glorification, the glorification of the Father in the glorification of the Son, is the subject of a lengthy section of the Gospel of John. This section begins from the middle of chapter twelve and goes through the end of chapter seventeen. In John 12:23 the Lord Jesus declared, &#8220;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.&#8221; Here we have the first mention of the glorification concerning which the Lord later prayed in chapter seventeen. As verse 24 indicates, for the Son of Man to be glorified is for Him to have His divine element, His divine life, released from within the shell of His humanity to produce many believers in resurrection, just as a grain of wheat releases its life element by falling into the ground and dying in order to bear much fruit and thereby bring forth many grains. Therefore, in verse 24 the Lord says, &#8220;Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&#8221; From this we see that for the Lord to be glorified is for Him to die and be resurrected in order to bear much fruit. This means that the bearing of fruit is His glorification.<p>John 12:23 reveals clearly that the Lord Jesus was concerned for His glorification, and verse 24 explains what this glorification is. The Lord was glorified by dying as a grain of wheat and then growing up in resurrection to produce many grains, that is, to bear much fruit. These grains are actually the believers who are constituted into the house, the vine, and the new man. The crucial point, and the point we are now emphasizing, is that the thought of glorification, which is the subject of the Lord&#8217;s prayer in chapter seventeen, begins in 12:23.<p>In John 12:28 the Lord prayed, &#8220;Father, glorify Your name. There came then a voice out of heaven, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.&#8221; To glorify the name of the Father is to cause the Father&#8217;s divine element to be expressed. The Father&#8217;s divine element, which is the eternal life, was in the incarnated Son. The shell of the Son&#8217;s incarnation had to be broken through death that the Father&#8217;s divine element, the eternal life, could be released and expressed in resurrection, just as the life element of a grain of wheat is released by its shell being broken and expressed by its blossom. This is the glorification of God the Father in the Son.<p>The Lord&#8217;s prayers in 12:28 and 17:1 are similar. These prayers are both for the same matter-glorification. Knowing that the Father would be glorified in the Son&#8217;s glorification, the Lord prayed first that the Father would glorify His name and then that the Father would glorify the Son so that the Son might glorify Him.<p>In John 13:31-32 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him. If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately.&#8221; These verses concerning the glorification of the Son of Man are another indication that this section of the Gospel of John is concerned with the divine glorification. Once again, for the Son of Man to be glorified is for Him to have His divine element released, expressed, and multiplied through death and resurrection. In this way God the Father is glorified in the Son&#8217;s glorification.<p>Shortly after uttering these words in chapter thirteen, the Lord Jesus went on to give His disciples a message in which He spoke concerning the Father&#8217;s house, the new vine, and the new man. The Father&#8217;s house, the vine, and the new man all refer to the same thing. For the Son of Man to be glorified is for Him to die and bring forth many grains in resurrection. These grains are for the constitution of the vine. To constitute the vine of many grains is equal to building up the Father&#8217;s house. Moreover, the building up of the Father&#8217;s house is equal to the planting of the vine, and this is equal to the birth of the new man. All these matters-the house, the vine, and the new man-are related to the divine glorification. Therefore, following this message, the Lord prayed in chapter seventeen regarding His glorification. The divine glorification is the key that opens this portion of the Gospel of John.<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that the five and a half chapters from the middle of John 12 to the end of John 17 are concerned with the glorification of the Father in the glorification of the Son. After speaking of this glorification in 12:23-24, 28 and 13:31-32, the Lord, in His message to the disciples, gave three illustrations of this glorification: the house of the Father composed of all the believers, the vine with the many branches, and the new man, the corporate child, composed of the firstborn Son and all the believers as the many sons.<p>The Father is glorified in His house and in fruit-bearing. The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit, and you shall become My disciples&#8221; (15:8). In fruit-bearing the Father&#8217;s life, the divine life, is expressed. Therefore, He is glorified in fruit-bearing. This corresponds to the thought in 12:23-24 that glorification is a matter of multiplication. Fruit-bearing is a matter of multiplication, propagation, and production. This multiplication is the Father&#8217;s glorification. Therefore, the organism of the vine with its branches is for the glorification of the Son that the Father may be glorified in Him.<p>The vine in John 15 is a universal tree for the expression of the Father. The Son is the vine, and the Father is glorified in the Son&#8217;s expansion. Furthermore, the corporate man-child born through Christ&#8217;s resurrection is also an aspect of His glorification.<p>The three illustrations of the house, the vine, and the child all indicate aspects of Christ&#8217;s glorification that the Father may be glorified in Him. After giving a message using these illustrations, the Lord Jesus concluded with a prayer for His glorification, praying that the Father would glorify the Son that the Son may glorify the Father.<p>The believers enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation. In the section of the Gospel of John from 12:23 to the end of chapter seventeen we see the real significance of the divine dispensing. The divine dispensing is for our transformation and is actually in this transformation. In the divine transformation we are enjoying the divine dispensing for conformation to the image of the firstborn Son of God. Eventually, we, the many sons, will be the same as He is, having divinity as well as humanity. As we participate in this dispensing of the divine Trinity, the Son is glorified in us, and the Father is glorified in the Son&#8217;s glorification.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(38)</h1><p>In previous messages we have seen that, in the progressing stage of God&#8217;s full salvation, the believers enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by being transformed, by being conformed to Christ&#8217;s image and conformed to the death of Christ, by entering into the Holy of Holies, by following Jesus, by living to Christ, by walking according to spirit, by sowing unto the Spirit, by walking by faith, and by living in the organism of the divine Trinity and participating in the dispensing of the divine Trinity. Now we shall begin to consider how the believers enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by being filled in their spirit with the processed Triune God and letting the word of Christ dwell in them richly.<h2 class=head3>l. By Being Filled in Their Spirit with the Processed Triune God and Letting the Word of Christ Dwell in Them Richly</h2><p>We enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity by being filled in our spirit with the processed Triune God and letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly. Ephesians 5:18b says, &#8220;Be filled in spirit,&#8221; and Colossians 3:16a says, &#8220;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.&#8221; These are parallel verses, for the first charges us to be filled in our spirit with the Triune God and the second, to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. When we are filled in our spirit with the processed Triune God and let the word of Christ dwell in us richly, we enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation.<p>To be filled in spirit is to be filled in our regenerated spirit, the human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. However, some readers of Ephesians 5 may regard the spirit in verse 18 as the Holy Spirit. But according to the Greek text, Paul here is not saying that we should be filled with the Spirit; rather, he is saying that we should be filled in our spirit, that is, in our regenerated spirit. Our spirit should not be empty, but should be filled with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God (Eph. 3:19). If our spirit is filled with the riches of Christ, we shall have no problems in our Christian life.<p>All the items in Ephesians 5:18-6:9 are related to the one matter of being filled in spirit. We may read these verses and pay attention to such details as wives submitting to their own husbands or husbands loving their own wives, but fail to see the source of these virtues, that is, being filled in spirit with the processed Triune God. When we are filled in our spirit with the Spirit, then wives will be subject to their husbands, husbands will love their wives, parents will care for their children, slaves will obey their masters, and masters will treat their slaves in a proper way. All of these things are the issue of being filled in spirit.<p>We may say that the imperative &#8220;be filled&#8221; is actually in the &#8220;active-passive&#8221; voice. &#8220;Be&#8221; is active, and &#8220;filled&#8221; is passive. Hence, &#8220;be filled&#8221; is active-passive. In our language there may not be such a thing as active-passive, but in God&#8217;s New Testament economy active-passive is a great matter.<p>Peter&#8217;s word in Acts 2:40 helps us to understand how &#8220;be filled&#8221; in Ephesians 5:18 is a matter of active-passive. Peter entreated the people saying, &#8220;Be saved from this crooked generation!&#8221; Here &#8220;be&#8221; is active, and &#8220;saved&#8221; is passive. Hence, we may say that &#8220;be saved&#8221; is in the active-passive voice. It is to be done by God, but man needs to be active to receive what God intends to do. At the time of Pentecost, everything concerning God&#8217;s full salvation was prepared, and the Holy Spirit was poured out as the application and full blessing of God&#8217;s salvation ready for man to receive. In this matter God is waiting for man, and man needs to take the initiative. Although we cannot save ourselves, we must be willing to be saved by God. God is willing and prepared to save us. Nevertheless, we need to be saved; that is, we need to take the initiative to receive God&#8217;s salvation.<p>The principle is the same with Paul&#8217;s charge, &#8220;Be filled in spirit.&#8221; Just as God has done everything necessary for us to be saved, He has done everything necessary for us to be filled in our regenerated spirit. Nevertheless, just as we need to take some action to be saved, we need to take some action to be filled in spirit with the Holy Spirit who has been given to us and who now dwells in our spirit.<p>We should not limit the Spirit or restrict Him. The Holy Spirit with all of Christ&#8217;s riches as the fullness of God is ready to fill us in our spirit. Now we need to coordinate with Him, taking some action, to be filled.<p>Many of us are filled with the Spirit not thoroughly but only partly. The reason for this may be that we do not give the Holy Spirit enough room within us. Instead, we still have a great deal of reserve and do not allow the Spirit to have every part of our being. As a result, we are filled with things other than the Spirit.<p>It is very difficult for the believers to be completely emptied in order to give the indwelling Spirit all the room in our spirit and in our mind, emotion, and will. The Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God indwells us and desires to fill us. However, we give Him too much restriction and limitation. He does not have the freedom to occupy every part of our inner being. Therefore, if we would be filled in our spirit with the Spirit, we need to clear away all preoccupations from our spirit and allow the indwelling Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God to occupy us in full. If we are filled in our spirit with the Spirit, the issue will be a proper Christian life, church life, individual life, and family life.<p>As believers, we should not only be filled in our spirit with the processed Triune God but should also let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. In Colossians 3:16a Paul says, &#8220;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.&#8221; The word of Christ is the word spoken by Christ. In His New Testament economy, God speaks in the Son, and the Son speaks not only directly in the Gospels but also through His members, the apostles and prophets, in Acts, in the Epistles, and in Revelation. All these may be considered His word.<p>The word of Christ includes the entire New Testament. We need to be filled with this word. This means that we should allow the word of Christ to dwell in us, to inhabit us, to make home in us.<p>The Greek word rendered &#8220;dwell&#8221; in Colossians 3:16a means to be in a house, to inhabit. The word of the Lord must have adequate room within us so that it may operate and minister the riches of Christ into our inner being. Furthermore, the word of Christ must dwell in us richly. The riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8) are in His word. When such a rich word inhabits us, it must inhabit us richly. The word of Christ should have free course within us. We should not simply receive it and then confine it to a small area of our being. On the contrary, the word of Christ should be given a free course to operate within us. In this way the word will inhabit us and make home in us.<p>The verb &#8220;dwell&#8221; in Colossians 3:16a indicates that the word of Christ is actually a person-Christ Himself. Because the word can dwell in us, make home in us, it must be a living person, for it is not possible for something that is not living to dwell in a place or make its home there. We would never say, for example, that a table dwells in our home. Rather, we, as living persons, dwell in our home. Therefore, to let the word of Christ dwell in us indicates that we should let a living person-Christ Himself-dwell in us.<p>As we come to the written word day by day, we should sense that Christ as the living, personified Word is waiting for us and desires to dwell in us richly. Whenever we come to the written word we should have the conviction deep within that we are contacting the Lord Himself as the living Word.<p>As we receive the word of Christ, even Christ Himself, we should give the word the freedom to make its home in us. If a certain place is to become our home, we must have the freedom to make all necessary arrangements. If we want to keep a certain item, we may do so. But if we want to throw something else away, we are free to do that as well. If we do not have this kind of freedom, it is not possible for us to make that place our home. In like manner, if the word of Christ is to make home in us, we must give it the full liberty, freedom, and right. We need to pray, &#8220;Lord, I offer my whole being to You and Your word. I give You access to every part of my inner being. Lord, make my inner being a home for Yourself and Your word.&#8221;<p>In Ephesians 5:18 we have the charge to be filled in our spirit with the Triune God, and in Colossians 3:16, the charge to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. Colossians is focused on Christ as our Head and life. The way for Him to exercise His headship and to minister His riches to us is through His word. Hence, the emphasis is on the word of Christ. Ephesians is concerned with the church as the Body of Christ. The way for us to live a normal church life is to be filled in our spirit unto all the fullness of God. Hence, the emphasis is on the Spirit. In Ephesians both the Holy Spirit and our spirit are emphasized again and again. Even the word is counted as the Spirit (Eph. 6:17). In Colossians the Holy Spirit is mentioned only once (1:8), and the human spirit is also mentioned once (2:5). In Ephesians the word is for washing away our natural life (5:26) and for fighting against the enemy (6:17), whereas in Colossians the word is for revealing Christ (1:25-27) in His preeminence, centrality, and universality. This word, like the Spirit, is ready to dwell in us, occupy us, and fill us, but we need to let the word dwell in us richly.<p>If we compare Ephesians 5:18-20 with Colossians 3:16 and 17, we shall see that, as the New Testament reveals, the word is the Spirit and the Spirit is the word. John 6:63 indicates this. Here the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.&#8221; The Spirit is living and real but rather mysterious and intangible and difficult for us to apprehend. The words, however, are substantial. In John 6 the Lord Jesus first indicates that for giving life He would become the Spirit. Then He says that the words He speaks are spirit and life. This shows that His spoken words are the embodiment of the life-giving Spirit. He is now the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and the Spirit is embodied in His words. When we receive His words by exercising our spirit, we get the Spirit who is life.<p>Many readers of John 6 are puzzled by the Lord&#8217;s word in verse 63, not knowing what it means for His words to be spirit and life. Some Christians care only for the Bible in letters; they are reluctant even to talk about the Spirit. Their desire is merely to understand the Bible in letters. However, if we do not touch the Spirit in the Word, we cannot receive life. The Spirit is the extract of the Bible. Yet this extract is embodied in the Word. Today the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and this Spirit is embodied in the word of the Bible. Daily we need to come to the Lord and touch Him as the Spirit in the Word.<p>The New Testament assures us that the Word and the Spirit are one. John 1:1 says, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word.&#8221; But in John 20:22 the Lord Jesus breathed upon the disciples and said, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit.&#8221; At the beginning of the Gospel of John, Christ is the Word, but at the end of this Gospel He breathes out the Spirit. We have seen that in 6:63 He says that the word is the Spirit. Hence, the Word and the Spirit are one.<p>A further indication of this is seen in Ephesians 6:17. Here Paul charges us to receive &#8220;the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.&#8221; This verse indicates that the Spirit is the word of God. The antecedent of the word &#8220;which&#8221; in this verse is not sword but Spirit. This indicates that the Spirit is the word of God, both of which are Christ (2 Cor. 3:17; Rev. 19:13).<p>In our Christian experience the word of God and the Spirit must always be one. It is an utter falsehood to say that we can take the Spirit without taking the word of God, or that we should take the word of God without the Spirit. Without taking the word of God, we cannot have the Spirit. In our experience we receive the Spirit mainly through the Word. As we contact the Word in a living way, it becomes the Spirit to us.<p>Christ is both the Spirit and the Word. He is not the Spirit without being the Word, nor is He the Word without being the Spirit. Because He is both the Word and the Spirit, we need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly, and we need to be filled in our spirit with the Spirit.<p>Another verse which indicates that the Spirit and the word of God are one is 2 Timothy 3:16a. Here Paul says, &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed.&#8221; This indicates that the Scripture, the word of God, is the breath of God. Every word of the Bible is God&#8217;s breath, and this breath is the pneuma, the Spirit. God&#8217;s breath is His pneuma, the Spirit. The Spirit is the breath of God, and the word of God is also the breath of God. Thus, because both the word of God and the Spirit are God&#8217;s breath, they are truly one. On the one hand, the word of God is the Spirit; on the other hand, the Spirit of God is the word.<p>God&#8217;s speaking is His breathing. Hence, His word is spirit, pneuma, breath. This means that the Scripture is the embodiment of God as the Spirit. The Spirit is therefore the very essence, the substance, of the Scripture, just as phosphorus is the essential substance in matches. We must strike the Spirit of the Scripture with our spirit to catch the divine fire.<p>In our Christian life we should neglect neither the Spirit nor the Word. Because the Lord is both the Spirit and the Word, we should not separate the Spirit from the Word. It is actually dangerous to have the Spirit without the Word, for then we are in an unlimited and unrestricted sphere. But without the Spirit the Word has no life, for apart from the Spirit the Word is dead letters. The Spirit is the life content of the Bible. The Word conveys God&#8217;s life because the Word conveys the Spirit. In fact, the substance, the essence, the constituent, of the Word is the Spirit. Therefore, the Bible cares for both the Spirit and the word of Christ. We are charged to be filled in spirit with the Spirit, and we are also charged to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly.<p>Concerning the Spirit, there are two extremes, one found among fundamentalists and the other among Pentecostalists. Because they are afraid of the experience of the Spirit, certain fundamental Christians care primarily for Bible doctrine. But to have only the doctrine of the Bible without the Spirit is to have a lifeless body. The Spirit is embodied in the Word. Hence, the Word may be called the body of the Spirit. To separate the Spirit from the Word is to have a lifeless body. Nevertheless, fundamental Christians are often afraid to hear about the experience of Christ, the Spirit, and the inner life. They represent one extreme.<p>The Pentecostalists represent another extreme. They may neglect the Word and emphasize the Spirit in an abnormal, unbalanced way.<p>God&#8217;s New Testament economy avoids both extremes. In the economy of God the Spirit is the ultimate and consummate reaching of the Triune God to man. When the Spirit comes to us, the Triune God comes. Along with the Spirit, God gives us the Word. On the one hand, we have the Spirit as the ultimate and consummate reaching of the Triune God; on the other hand, we have the Word as the embodiment of the Spirit. Just as our life and our physical body are one entity, one complete living organism, so the Spirit and the Word are one. As human beings, we must have both a visible and tangible body and also an invisible and intangible life. In like manner, as believers, we need both the Word and the Spirit. Furthermore, just as it is the invisible life within our body which makes our body vigorous and active, it is the Spirit who causes the Word to be living. This indicates that the Spirit and the Word are one. God&#8217;s New Testament economy depends on both the Word and the Spirit. We need the Word as the body and the Spirit as the life.<p>Since the Word and the Spirit are one and since we should allow the word of Christ to dwell in us richly and should be filled in our spirit with the Spirit, we should avoid the two extremes of the fundamentalists who care for the Word but often neglect the Spirit and the Pentecostalists who care for the Spirit but often neglect the Word. We should not be at either extreme, but should be balanced, caring both for the Spirit and the Word. Within, we have the Spirit, and in our hands we have the Word, the Bible.<p>Now, in order to enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation, we need to be filled in our spirit with the processed Triune God who is now the all-inclusive Spirit, and we need to let the word of Christ dwell in us, make home in us, richly. In the two following messages we shall see the kind of living that issues from being filled in our spirit with the Spirit and allowing the word of Christ to dwell in us richly.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(39)</h1><p>In the foregoing message we saw that the believers enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by being filled in their spirit with the processed Triune God and letting the word of Christ dwell in them richly (Eph. 5:18b; Col. 3:16a). In this message we shall consider two aspects of the living that issues from this filling and indwelling.<h2 class=head4>(1) To Live a Life That Matches the New Man in Grace and Truth</h2><p>The believers are filled in their spirit with the Spirit and let the word of Christ dwell in them richly to live a life that matches the new man in grace and truth (Eph. 4:24, 29, 21). In Ephesians 4:24 Paul tells us that we &#8220;have put on the new man, which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.&#8221; The new man is of Christ. It is His Body created in Him on the cross (Eph. 2:15-16). It is not individual but corporate (Col. 3:10-11). The fact that the new man is created of two peoples proves that it is corporate. Furthermore, Colossians 3:10 and 11 reveal that the new man is a composition of many different peoples. In this corporate new man there is no Greek or Jew, no bond or free, no barbarian or Scythian, but Christ is all and in all. In Colossians 3:11 the word &#8220;all&#8221; refers to people. This means that in the new man Christ is all the people and is in all the people. Therefore, in the corporate new man Christ is all and in all.<p>As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life, but as the new man, the church needs Christ as its person. This new corporate person should live a life as Jesus lived on earth, that is, a life of truth (Eph. 4:21), expressing God and causing God to be realized as the reality by man.<p>The article before truth in Ephesians 4:24 is emphatic. The righteousness and holiness of the new man are of the truth. As the deceit in verse 22, related to the old man, is the personification of Satan, so truth here, related to the new man, is the personification of God. This truth was exhibited in the life of Jesus. In the life of Jesus righteousness and holiness of truth were always being manifested. It was in the righteousness and holiness of this truth, which is God realized and expressed, that the new man was created.<p>The believers&#8217; daily living described in Ephesians 4:17-32 has truth and grace as its basic elements. In these verses Paul indicates that we should live as Jesus did, a life full of grace and truth (John 1:14, 17). Grace is God given to us for our enjoyment, and truth is God revealed to us as our reality. When we live and speak truth (Eph. 4:21, 24), we express God as our reality, and others receive God as grace for their enjoyment (v. 29).<p>Grace is the enjoyment of the Triune God in all that He is to us. When He is life to us, that is grace. When He is power to us, that also is grace. Grace is whatever Christ is to us subjectively as our enjoyment. We need grace daily, even hourly. We need the enjoyment of Christ as our life, our power, and everything to us. Grace is the Triune God becoming our enjoyment. He has come to us so that we may gain Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him. When we experience Him as our enjoyment, He becomes grace to us.<p>In Paul&#8217;s exhortation in 4:17-32 truth is clearly mentioned, but grace is somewhat hidden, being especially implied in Paul&#8217;s mention of the details related to our daily living. If we are short of grace, we cannot meet the standard in relation to these details. The principles for our learning of Christ (v. 20) are related to the truth, whereas the details are related to grace. If we would be conformed to the image of Christ, that is, if we would learn Christ, we need both the principles and the details. If we have the truth, we have the principles. If we have grace, we shall succeed in meeting the standard in all the details. Because the details of our daily living are related to grace, we need grace in every aspect of our life.<p>Grace is God Himself in Christ as our enjoyment. We need to allow this enjoyment to remove from us the negative elements mentioned in verse 31. One of these negative elements is bitterness. Without grace, we cannot let go of our bitterness. But when we have God in Christ as our enjoyment, our bitterness will disappear. When we have sufficient grace, we shall be filled with Christ as our enjoyment, and there will be no room in us for bitterness of any kind. Only when we are filled with grace will the negative things be removed from us.<p>If we are filled with grace, then in place of bitterness, wrath, anger, and clamor, we shall have kindness, patience, mercy, forgiveness, and grace. These qualities come not from self-effort but from Christ as our enjoyment. When Christ is our enjoyment, we have no appetite for bitterness, wrath, anger, or clamor. Instead, we desire to have kindness, patience, endurance, gentleness, mercy, love, and various other virtues and qualities. What a difference it makes in our daily living when we are happy and satisfied through the enjoyment of God in Christ as grace!<p>In Ephesians 4:29 Paul says, &#8220;Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for needful building up, that it may give grace to those who hear.&#8221; Here we see that the word out of our mouth should give grace to those who hear. Grace is God embodied in Christ as our enjoyment and supply. Our words should convey this as grace to others. The word that builds up others always ministers grace to the hearers. Our words should communicate God in Christ as enjoyment, imparting Christ to others as their life supply.<p>Ephesians 4:25 says, &#8220;Having put off the falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbor, for we are members one of another.&#8221; Our words should be with grace, and our speaking should be of the truth. Falsehood in verse 25 refers to anything that is false in nature. As we have put off the old man, we have put off everything false. If we have the enjoyment of Christ, then in a practical way in our daily living, we shall put off every false thing. The most honest and faithful people are those who have the full enjoyment of Christ. When we are filled to the brim with Christ, all falsehood will be put away from us. Having put off the falsehood, we should speak truth each one with his neighbor. When we are filled with Christ, our speaking will be of things that are true.<p>Because we may be preoccupied with natural concepts of truth, we may find it difficult to understand the meaning of truth according to the New Testament. We may regard truth merely as doctrine or sincerity. According to the New Testament, truth is God revealed. In principle, because grace and truth have come through Jesus Christ (John 1:17), they must be something of God Himself. Jesus is God coming to us. When God comes to us, He does not come as doctrine or sincerity. When He comes, everything related to His being also comes. God comes to us for our enjoyment. This is grace. God also comes to reveal Himself to us. This is truth. In other words, when God is enjoyed by us, He is grace. But when God is revealed to us, He is truth. Truth, therefore, is God revealed to us.<p>In Ephesians 4:21 Paul says, &#8220;You have heard Him and been taught in Him as the truth is in Jesus.&#8221; The truth in Jesus is the real situation of the life of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels. In the godless walk of the nations, the fallen people, is vanity (Eph. 4:17). But in the godly life of Jesus is truth, reality. Jesus lived a life of always doing things in God, with God, and for God. God was in His life, and He was one with God. This is the truth in Jesus. We, the believers, regenerated with Christ as our life and taught in Him, learn from Him as the truth is in Jesus.<p>We have seen that truth is God revealed. We may also say that truth is the shining of light, the expression of light. Since God is light (1 John 1:5), truth is the expression of God. Every aspect of the life of Jesus recorded in the Gospels is an expression of God. This expression of God is the shining of light; hence, it is the truth.<p>This life of Jesus according to truth is the pattern for our living as believers today. From this pattern we learn Christ as the truth is in Jesus. This means that we learn Christ according to the truth shown in the Gospels, that is, according to the life of the Lord Jesus, which was wholly according to God&#8217;s truth. This life is the shining of light. The shining of light is the truth, and truth is the expression of God. Therefore, in the life of Jesus there is truth. The essence of the pattern set up by the Lord Jesus is truth. The essence of the life of Jesus is truth. When the Lord Jesus was living on earth, He always walked in truth, in the shining of the divine light. Hence, the Lord Jesus lived and walked in the expression of God.<p>In Ephesians 4:17-24 we have the principle of our renewed daily living for the learning of Christ. This principle is the truth, the living of the Lord Jesus when He was on earth. The Lord&#8217;s living was that of always putting off His own life and of putting on the Father&#8217;s life. This is the life of Jesus, and this life is the truth that is the principle of a life of learning Christ. According to this principle, we have put off the old man and have put on the new man. Now by being filled in our regenerated spirit with the processed Triune God and by allowing the word of Christ to dwell in us richly, we live a life that matches the new man in grace and truth.<h2 class=head4>(2) To Live a Life That Matches the Wife of Christ in Love and Light</h2><p>A second issue of being filled in our spirit with the processed Triune God and letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly is that we live a life that matches the wife of Christ (Eph. 5:22-25) in love and light. As grace and truth are the basic elements in Ephesians 4:17-32, so love (5:2, 25) and light (5:8-9, 13-14) are the basic elements in 5:1-33. Grace is the expression of love, and love is the source of grace. Truth is the revelation of light, and light is the origin of truth. God is love and light (1 John 4:8; 1:5). When<p>God is expressed and revealed in the Lord Jesus, His love becomes grace and His light becomes truth. After we have, in the Lord Jesus, received God as grace and realize Him as truth, we come to Him and enjoy His love and light. Love and light are deeper than grace and truth. Hence, Paul first takes grace and truth as the basic elements of a life that matches the new man and then love and light as the elements of a life that matches the wife of Christ. This implies that in our daily living we should grow deeper, from the outward elements to the inward.<p>Love is the substance of God within, whereas light is the element of God expressed. It is possible to sense the love of God inwardly and to see the light of God shining out. Our walk in love should be constituted of both the loving substance of God and the shining element of God. This should be the inner source of our walk.<p>In Ephesians 5:2 Paul says, &#8220;Walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.&#8221; In 4:32 Paul presents God as the pattern for our daily walk, and in 5:2 he sets forth Christ as the example for our living. In 4:32 it is God in Christ as our pattern because, in that section, God&#8217;s grace and truth expressed in the life of Jesus are taken as the basic elements. According to 4:32, we are to forgive others as God in Christ has forgiven us. This means that God is the pattern of forgiveness. But in chapter five Christ Himself is our example because, in this section, love expressed by Christ to us (v. 25) and light shined by Christ upon us (v. 14) are taken as the basic elements. Here Christ, who loved us and gave Himself up for us, is the example of walking in love.<p>In Ephesians 5:8 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;You were once darkness, but now light in the Lord; walk as children of light.&#8221; We were once not only dark but darkness itself. Now we are not only the children of light but light itself (Matt. 5:14). As light is God, so darkness is the Devil. We were darkness because we were one with the Devil. Now we are light because we are one with God in the Lord.<p>In 5:2 Paul tells us to walk in love, and in 5:8 he tells us to walk as children of light. As God is light, so we, the children of God, are also the children of light. Because we are now light in the Lord, we should walk as children of light. We should not simply be according to truth and by grace but also in love and under light. Walking in love and in light is deeper and more tender than living according to truth and by grace.<p>In our experience we may often realize God as truth to us, as our reality. But sometimes when we get into God&#8217;s presence, we sense that we are in the light. At such times, we are not only experiencing reality, but we are the very light itself. Thus, the experience of light is deeper than the experience of truth.<p>After charging us to walk as children of light, Paul in 5:9 inserts a parenthetical statement about the fruit of the light, saying that &#8220;the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth.&#8221; Goodness is the nature of the fruit of the light; righteousness is the way or the procedure to produce the fruit of the light; and the truth is the reality, the real expression, of the fruit of the light. This expression is God Himself. The fruit of the light must be good in nature, righteous in procedure, and real in expression so that God may be expressed as the reality of our daily walk.<p>It is significant that in speaking of the fruit of the light Paul mentions only three things: goodness, righteousness, and truth. The reason he mentions just three things is that the fruit of the light in goodness, righteousness, and truth is related to the Triune God.<p>Goodness refers to the nature of the fruit of life. The Lord Jesus once indicated that the only One who was good is God Himself (Matt. 19:17). Hence, goodness here denotes God the Father. God the Father as goodness is the nature of the fruit of the light.<p>Righteousness is the procedure by which the fruit of the light is produced. In the Godhead, the Son, Christ, is our righteousness. He came to earth to produce certain things according to God&#8217;s procedure, which is always righteous. Righteousness is God&#8217;s way, God&#8217;s procedure. Christ came to accomplish God&#8217;s purpose according to His righteous procedure. Therefore, the second aspect of the fruit of the light refers to God the Son.<p>The truth is the expression of the fruit of the light. This fruit must be real; that is, it must be the expression of God, the shining of the hidden light. No doubt, this truth refers to the Spirit of reality, the third of the Triune God. Therefore, the Father as the goodness, the Son as the righteousness, and the Spirit as the truth, the reality, are all related to the fruit of the light.<p>Ephesians 5:9 is the definition of walking as children of light. If we walk as the children of light, we shall bear the fruit described in this verse. The fruit we bear by walking as the children of light must be in goodness, righteousness, and truth. The proof that we are walking as children of light is seen in the bearing of such fruit.<p>First we receive God in Christ as grace and realize God in Christ as truth. Then we come to enjoy God as love and light. Love and light are inward elements, whereas grace and truth are outward elements. Love is the inner substance of God that can be sensed, and light is the expressed element of God that can be seen. Both love and light are to be the inner source of our daily walk as believers.<p>We need to be deeply impressed that the church life according to God&#8217;s desire must be in love and light, both of which are elements of God Himself. In the substance of God we have love and light. The goal of the book of Ephesians is to bring us into God&#8217;s inner substance to know Him as love and light. Here, by being filled in spirit with the Spirit and by letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly, we are to live in intimate fellowship as we enjoy light in its shining and love in its sweetness.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR PRESENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(40)</h1><p>The believers enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by being filled in their spirit with the processed Triune God and letting the word of Christ dwell in them richly (Eph. 5:18b; Col. 3:16a). When we are filled in our spirit with the Spirit and allow the word of Christ to make home in us, we automatically live a life that matches the new man in grace and truth and that matches the wife of Christ in love and light. In this message we shall see that as the result of being filled in our spirit with the Spirit and of being saturated with the word of Christ, we shall also speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ to live a proper human life.<h2 class=head4>(3) Speaking to One Another, Teaching, Admonishing, in Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, Singing, Psalming to the Lord, and Giving Thanks at All Times for All Things in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father</h2><p>When we are filled in our spirit with the processed Triune God and let the word of Christ dwell in us richly, we speak to one another, teaching, admonishing, in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing, psalming to the Lord, and giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father. After charging us to be filled in spirit (Eph. 5:18) Paul goes on to say in verse 19, &#8220;Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&#8221; Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are not only for singing and psalming but also for speaking to one another. Such speaking, singing, and psalming are the outflow of being filled in spirit. However, they may also be the way for us to be filled in spirit. Psalms are long poems, hymns are shorter ones, and spiritual songs are the shortest. All are needed in order for us to be filled with the Lord and to overflow with Him in our Christian life.<p>Whereas singing may be short, psalming is always long. Sometimes just by singing we cannot express what is in us to the Lord; we need psalming to pour out our praise to the Lord adequately.<p>In 5:20 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;Giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God and the Father.&#8221; We should give thanks to God the Father not only at good times but at bad times, and not only for good things but for all things. Even at the worst times, we should give thanks for all things to God our Father.<p>This verse tells us to give thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. The reality of the name of the Lord is His person. To be in His name is to be in His person, in the Lord Himself. This implies that we should be one with the Lord in giving thanks to God.<p>Colossians 3:16 says, &#8220;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.&#8221; Here the infilling of spiritual life that overflows in praising and singing is related to the Word, whereas in the parallel passage, Ephesians 5:18-20, the infilling of spiritual life is related to the Spirit. This indicates that the Word and the Spirit are identical (John 6:63b). A normal Christian life should be one that is filled with the Word that the Spirit may bubble from within in lauding melodies.<p>According to Colossians 3:16, when the word of Christ dwells in us richly, we shall teach and admonish one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in our hearts to God. Teaching, admonishing, and singing are all related to the verb &#8220;dwell.&#8221; This indicates that the way to let the Lord&#8217;s word dwell in us richly is by teaching, admonishing, and singing. We should teach and admonish not only in words but also in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.<p>Colossians 3:16 also indicates that when we are filled with the word of Christ, we should be filled with joy. If we receive the Lord&#8217;s word and yet have no joy, something must be wrong. When we receive the word of Christ, we actually receive the Spirit. Receiving the Spirit should stir us up and cause us to be joyful and to sing.<p>In Colossians 3:17 Paul continues, &#8220;And in everything, whatever you do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.&#8221; This is the result of allowing the word of Christ to inhabit us. Doing all things in the name of the Lord Jesus is related to letting the word of Christ saturate us and permeate us. The word of Christ is actually the embodiment of Christ. Thus, when the word as the embodiment of Christ is mingled with our inner being, inwardly we are one with Christ. It is at such a time that we can spontaneously do things in the name of the Lord. Because the Lord has saturated us, permeated us, and mingled Himself with us, making us one with Him, we can do all things in His name.<p>To do things in the Lord&#8217;s name is to do things in Him. The name denotes the person, and the Lord&#8217;s person is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17a). Therefore, to do things in the name of the Lord is to act in the Spirit.<p>In the past, many of us did not exercise our whole being when we came to the Word. Often we used only our mind to study the Bible. We did not even exercise our emotion adequately to love the Word, or exercise our will strongly to receive the Word. But if we exercise our whole being to take in the Word, eventually we shall be filled, occupied, and saturated with the living Word. Because the Word is the embodiment of the Spirit and because the Spirit is the reality of Christ, we shall automatically be filled with Christ. Then whatever we do or say will be in the name of Christ. This is to live Christ. We live Christ automatically when we are saturated with the word of Christ through the Spirit.<h2 class=head4>(4) Being Subject to One Another in the Fear of Christ to Live a Proper Human Life</h2><p>Finally, by being filled in our spirit with the Spirit and by allowing the word of Christ to dwell in us richly, we are subject to one another in the fear of Christ to live a proper human life. Ephesians 5:21 says, &#8220;Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ.&#8221; Being subject to one another is also the overflow of being filled in spirit. Our subjection should be one to another, not only the younger ones to the older ones but also the older ones to the younger ones (1 Pet. 5:5).<p>We are to be subject to one another in the fear of Christ. According to the context, to be in the fear of Christ is to fear offending Him as the Head. This is related to Christ&#8217;s headship (Eph. 5:23) and involves our subjection one to another. Christ is the Head of the Body. If we mistreat any member of the Body, we offend the Head of the Body. We need to keep the relationship with the members of the Body in the fear of the Head.<p>The life of being filled in spirit and of speaking, singing, psalming, and thanking is a life of subjection. When we speak, sing, psalm, and give thanks in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we are willing to submit ourselves to one another. We all submit to Christ the Head and also to the Body. This submitting comes from the speaking, the singing, the psalming, and the giving of thanks, which in turn come from the infilling. When we are filled in our spirit, we sing, we psalm, we speak, and we thank. Spontaneously, we also submit. However, if we are not filled, there will be no speaking, singing, psalming, or thanking God, and consequently there will be no submitting. The proper church people are those who are submissive by speaking, singing, psalming, and giving thanks to God from their inner being. They live in the way of being filled in spirit with all the riches of Christ unto the fullness of God.<p>We are subject to one another in the fear of Christ to live a proper human life. God desires that Christ be expressed through human life. We see this in Colossians 3:18-4:1, a sister passage to Ephesians 5:22-6:9, regarding the believers&#8217; ethical relationships. In Ephesians the emphasis is on the need of spirit-filled ethical relationships for the expression of the Body in the normal church life. In Colossians the emphasis is that we should hold Christ as our Head and take Him as our life by having His rich word dwelling in us, that the highest ethical relationships, issuing not from our natural life but from Christ as our life, may be realized for His expression.<p>Christ is to be expressed in the human life, not in the angelic life. Angels cannot express Christ. The Father has ordained that we, His chosen ones, be the expression of His Son. If we live in union with Christ, allowing the word of Christ to saturate us, Christ will be expressed through our humanity. Therefore, the living of the believers in union with Christ results in the expression of Christ in human life. If we realize this, we shall praise the Lord for our human living. In the relationships between wife and husband, between children and parents, and between masters and slaves, we need to express Christ by being filled in our spirit with the Spirit and by being saturated with the word of Christ.<h2 class=head5>(a) Wives Subject to Their Own Husbands as to the Lord</h2><p>The relationship between wives and husbands is connected to the matter of being filled in spirit and saturated with the word of Christ. It is an aspect of the daily living of those who are filled in spirit unto all the fullness of God. Therefore, when we speak about the relationship between wives and husbands, we should not neglect the infilling. Only by being filled in our spirit can we have a proper married life.<p>In Ephesians 5:22 Paul says, &#8220;Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord.&#8221; Concerning this, Colossians 3:18 says, &#8220;The wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.&#8221; The wives are to be subject to their own husbands. Because most wives appreciate and respect others&#8217; husbands, Paul exhorts the wives to be subject to their own husbands, no matter what kind of husbands they have.<p>According to Paul&#8217;s word in Ephesians 5:22, wives are to be subject to their own husbands &#8220;as to the Lord.&#8221; The wives need to realize that in the eyes of the Lord the husband represents the Lord. The reason the wife must submit to her own husband is that in married life he is as the Lord. As Christ is the Head of the church and the Savior of the Body, wives must be subject to their husbands as to the Lord.<p>Wives must also take their husbands as the head. Ephesians 5:23 says, &#8220;For a husband is head of the wife as also Christ is Head of the church, being Himself the Savior of the Body.&#8221; As head of the wife, a husband typifies Christ as the Head of the church. The Savior is a matter of love, whereas the Head is a matter of authority. We love Christ as our Savior, but we must also be subject to Him as our Head. It ought to be the same in the relationship between wives and husbands.<p>In verse 24 Paul continues, &#8220;As the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives to their husbands in everything.&#8221; The thought here is this: although husbands are not the savior of their wives as Christ is of the church, the wives still need to be subject to their husbands as the church is to Christ.<h2 class=head5>(b) Husbands Loving Their Own Wives as Christ Loving the Church</h2><p>Ephesians 5:25 says, &#8220;Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her.&#8221; Colossians 3:19 says, &#8220;The husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter against them.&#8221; Paul exhorts the husbands to love their wives. The opposite of subjection is ruling. However, Paul does not exhort the husbands to rule over their wives but to love them. In married life, the wife&#8217;s obligation is subjection, and the husband&#8217;s is love. The wife&#8217;s subjection plus the husband&#8217;s love constitutes proper married life and typifies the normal church life, in which the church is subject to Christ and Christ loves the church.<p>By being filled in spirit and saturated with the word of Christ, husbands are to love their wives &#8220;as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her.&#8221; A husband&#8217;s love for his wife must be like Christ&#8217;s love for the church. This means that a husband ought to give himself up for his wife. To give yourself up is to be a martyr, to sacrifice your life. Husbands are to love their wives at such a cost to themselves. They must be willing to pay a great price, even to die for their wives.<p>In Ephesians 5:28 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;The husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.&#8221; Here Paul twice speaks of husbands loving their own wives. This indicates that a husband is to love his wife without comparing her to others. Furthermore, the husbands are to love their own wives as their own bodies. A husband should regard his wife as part of his body and care for her as his own body.<p>Verse 29 continues, &#8220;For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church.&#8221; We show love for our body by nourishing and cherishing it. To nourish is to feed. Spiritually speaking, husbands are to nourish their wives. Just as we eat for the sake of our body, so husbands need to take in something of the Lord for the sake of their wives. In doing this a husband regards his wife as part of his body. A husband needs to nourish his wife, to take care of her need, just as he takes care of the need of his body. This is the meaning of &#8220;nourish&#8221; in verse 29.<p>Husbands should also love their wives as their own bodies by cherishing their wives. To cherish is to nurture with tender love and foster with tender care. To cherish something is to care for it deeply and warmly; it is to soften it through tender warmth. This is the way Christ cares for the church as His Body, and this is the way husbands should love their wives. Here we see the depth of the love a husband must have for his wife.<h2 class=head5>(c) Children Obeying Their Parents in the Lord and Honoring Them</h2><p>Ephesians 6:1 says, &#8220;The children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.&#8221; Colossians 3:20 says, &#8220;The children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord.&#8221; In these verses Paul does not speak simply of children but of the children. By using the definite article before children Paul indicates that the children of believers are not common. They are different from the children of people in the world. Therefore, the particular children, those in the families of believers, are exhorted to obey their parents in the Lord.<p>The phrase &#8220;in the Lord&#8221; indicates obedience to the parents by being one with the Lord. It also indicates that this should not be done by self-effort but by the Lord, and not according to the natural concept but according to the Lord&#8217;s word. The children of believers should realize that they are to obey their parents by being one with the Lord. Moreover, they are to obey their parents not by their own strength but by the Lord Himself. Their obedience is to be according to the Lord&#8217;s word, according to the Scriptures.<p>In Ephesians 6:2 and 3 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise, that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth.&#8221; This is not only the first commandment with a promise but also the first commandment concerning man&#8217;s relationship with man (Exo. 20:12). The promise, mentioned in verse 3, is that it may be well with the children and that they may live long on the earth. The first part of the promise is related to prosperity in material blessings; it also refers to living in a peaceful situation. The second part is to have longevity. According to this commandment, prosperity and longevity are God&#8217;s blessings in this life to those who honor their parents.<h2 class=head5>(d) Fathers Not Provoking Their Children to Anger, but Nurturing Them in the Discipline and Admonition of the Lord</h2><p>Ephesians 6:4 says, &#8220;The fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.&#8221; Colossians 3:21 says, &#8220;The fathers, do not provoke your children that they may not be disheartened.&#8221; Provoking to anger damages the children by stirring up their flesh. It is always destructive for parents to be angry with their children. Not provoking the children&#8217;s anger requires the father&#8217;s anger to be dealt with by remaining under the cross. The only way we can keep from losing our temper is to stay on the cross. In dealing with your children&#8217;s wrongdoings or misbehavior, you must first go to the cross and stay there. Otherwise, you will lose your temper, and this loss of temper will provoke your children&#8217;s anger.<p>Instead of provoking the children to anger, the fathers are to nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord. To nurture children means to bring them up, to raise them, by nourishing them. Raising children requires that the parents give them the needed instruction related to human life, family life, and social life. The word &#8220;admonition&#8221; here includes instruction. Paul was probably referring to the Old Testament requirement that parents instruct their children with the word of God (Deut. 6:7). This means that we are to teach our children with the Bible. Along with this instruction, we sometimes must discipline them, chastise them. It is crucial that fathers learn to nurture the children in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.<h2 class=head5>(e) Slaves Obeying Their Masters as to the Lord, as Slaves of Christ, Doing the Will of God</h2><p>In Ephesians 6:5 Paul says, &#8220;The slaves, obey your masters according to flesh with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ.&#8221; In the apostle&#8217;s time, slaves were purchased by their masters, and the masters had the right over their lives. Some slaves and some masters became brothers in the church. As brothers in the church, they were equal. But in their homes those who were slaves still had to obey the brothers who were their masters according to flesh.<p>Paul exhorts the slaves to obey with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as to Christ. Fear is the inward motive, and trembling is the outward attitude. Singleness means to be pure in motive, with only a single purpose. The slaves are to be single; they are not to have a double purpose. That is, they are not to serve their masters with the intention of receiving some gain for themselves.<p>The slaves are to be in obedience to their masters as to Christ. This means that the slaves are to regard their masters as if they were the Lord. The relationship between slaves and masters is a type of our relationship with Christ, our Master. We should obey Him as a slave, in singleness of heart.<p>In verses 6 and 7 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;Not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul, with good will, serving as slaves, as to the Lord and not to men.&#8221; If a brother in slavery stands in his position and obeys his master, he is in the eyes of the Lord a slave of Christ, doing the will of God, and his service is as to the Lord and not to men. Such a slave is to do the will of God from the soul. The words &#8220;from the soul&#8221; here equal from the heart, from the inner being. This means to serve not only with the physical body but with the heart. The slaves were to serve &#8220;as to the Lord and not to men.&#8221; This indicates that Paul&#8217;s intention was to direct the slaves to the Lord. His desire was that they would learn to serve their masters as the Lord.<p>In Colossians 3:22 and 23 Paul gives a charge to the slaves very similar to that in Ephesians 6:5-7. Then in verse 24 he says, &#8220;Knowing that from the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance. You serve as a slave the Lord Christ.&#8221; There is an inheritance for the believers (Rom. 8:17; Acts 26:18; 1 Pet. 1:4). The reward of the inheritance indicates that the Lord uses the inheritance which He will give His believers as an incentive that they may be faithful in their service to Him. The unfaithful ones will surely miss this reward (Matt. 24:45-51; 25:20-29).<h2 class=head5>(f) Masters Doing the Same Things toward the Slaves, Giving Up Threatening</h2><p>In Ephesians 6:9 Paul says, &#8220;The masters, do the same things toward them, giving up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in the heavens, and there is no respect of persons with Him.&#8221; In Colossians 4:1 Paul says, &#8220;The masters, grant to your slaves that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.&#8221; The masters who had the right over the lives of their purchased slaves should give up threatening, because the Lord in the heavens is the real Master of both them and the slaves. In the flesh, some may be slaves, and others may be masters. But in the eyes of the Lord, there is no difference between slaves and masters. According to Colossians 3:11, in the new man there is no slave or freeman. In the church we all are brothers. However, in the flesh there still is the distinction between slaves and masters.<p>In his exhortation to wives, husbands, children, fathers, slaves, and masters Paul is making a crucial point. This point is that for the sake of the church life, we need a proper human living in this present age. This is an extremely important lesson for us all to learn. We have such a human living not by our self-effort but by being filled in our regenerated spirit with the processed Triune God and by letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly, permeating and saturating our inner being. When we are filled with the processed Triune God and allow the word of Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, to dwell in us richly, we shall be permeated, saturated, and soaked with the Triune God. Spontaneously we shall speak to one another, teaching, admonishing, in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and psalming to the Lord and giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Spontaneously we shall be subject to one another in the fear of Christ to live a proper human life, with wives subject to their own husbands, husbands loving their own wives, children obeying their parents, fathers nurturing their children, slaves obeying their masters, and masters giving their slaves that which is just and equal. This is the issue of being filled in our spirit with the Spirit and of letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly.<p>The vital matter here is that when we are filled in our spirit with the Spirit and are saturated with the word of Christ, we enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation. Through this dispensing in the divine transformation we are conformed to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God, for the corporate expression of God in Christ.</body></html>
