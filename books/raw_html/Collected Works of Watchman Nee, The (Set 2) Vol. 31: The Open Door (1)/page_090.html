<h2 class="head2">Prayer and Revival, Shanghai</h2><p>In the past three weeks God has done a new work among our sisters and has revived many people. Many prodigal sons have come back to the Father's house! The Lord has gained something, so we must rejoice with Him! Two or three people began to pray in one accord, and then the Lord began to work. Presently, the power of revival grows daily. There are many small group prayer meetings. The Lord has manifested His work time and again in the sisters' meetings. Many sinners have been coming to the Tuesday sisters' meeting. On Wednesday evening eleven sisters and two brothers were baptized. There was a meeting in a hospital in which all the nurses, doctors, and other employees who had life prayed together (more than fifty people). Thank the Lord, it was more than we had asked or thought; many dumb ones opened their mouths. There will be another such meeting next Wednesday afternoon. We are still waiting for God's direction as to how to go on. A group of married sisters wants to meet together to learn how to pray and work with God. There is also a group of sisters that are teachers who have the same desire. It is even more precious to see a group of sisters who are maids clustering together as prayer-companions. The Lord has promised and given revelation to a small number that He will revive His church! May we always humble ourselves and bow down before Him, not interrupting Him in any way.</p><p>There is one other joyful thing to tell you. Miss Chai has been healed. The minute she was healed, she immediately stood up and walked. For seven years she has not been able to read the Bible or bend her knees in prayer. But last night she was able to do both. The Lord is showing us His authority and glory in all matters! There is nothing we can say but hallelujah! Thank the Lord, Sister Tso has made much progress. The Lord is using her in many ways. Thank and praise the Lord! When we pray in one accord, we are able to shake the heavens and the earth and defeat the demons. I received a letter from Brother Simon Meek and the responsible brothers in Manila in the Philippines asking me to work there for a time. I had a burden to do this when I was in Hong Kong. I wanted to return to Shanghai to make arrangements for my mother, who is old, before going. However, the environment constantly prevented me. (I could not get my passport processed.) I placed the matter in the Lord's hands and waited. The most marvelous thing happened when I had the least hope. There was a special opportunity, and I received my passport without going through any red tape. I am ready to go, but I still do not know when I will leave because my present work is not finished. I hope He returns soon!</p><p>Yun-chun<br />March 18<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Stephen Kaung, Hong Kong</h2><p>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>Peace to you! By the Lord's grace, I safely returned to Hong Kong on the eighteenth of this month. I went with the brothers this time and really gained the benefit. Thank God! I saw more than ten brothers and sisters in Ju Shiu Garden, Jung-Shan, whose freshness and "first love" truly charmed me. However, they have met with persecution and difficulties. Please remember them in prayer. Later, I returned to Macao where I passed out gospel tracts and preached the gospel outdoors. Brother Luan gave a message to the brothers and sisters. May God's kingdom grow in all localities. Brother Nee held a conference here from the twenty-fourth to the twenty-eighth of this month. He spoke on "What Kind of People Can Receive God's Reward?" They are "violent men" (Matt. 11:12), those who walk in the light of the "judgment seat of Christ" (2 Cor. 5:9-11; 1 Cor. 3:10-15; Rev. 1:15). Then he spoke on "The Importance of Light" (Matt. 6:21-23). If God wills, he will continue the conference beginning on March 1. All the co-workers in Hong Kong are well. Miss Huang Ro-chen and Miss Kuo Hai-jen have both come to Hong Kong to attend the conference. If God wills, I plan to return to Shanghai because my father has heart sickness. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Stephen Kuang<br />February 28</p>
