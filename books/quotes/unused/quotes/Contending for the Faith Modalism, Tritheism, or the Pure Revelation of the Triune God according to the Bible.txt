His work is more than an answer to a false accusation; it is an education on the heretical and proper views of the Triune God
We hope that seeking people will take the time to search and know the truth of God's Word, rather than listening to rumors or evil reports
May the study of the truth lead every reader to a fresh appreciation of the God who is our Creator, our Redeemer, and our life
Because this term is unfamiliar to many Christians, we need to define four words-mode, modal, modalism, and modalist
2 For the modalists, the Father, Son, and Spirit only refer to the way in which God reveals Himself, but bear no relation to His inner being
As an explanation of the threefold revelation of God, Monarchianism was aimed at excluding the idea that Christians worshipped three Gods
4 Along with maintaining this principle, the modalistic Monarchians also wanted to assert the full divinity of Christ
As we shall see, the modalists actually sacrificed Christ's independent personality, merging it into the essence of the Father
200,11 teaching that 'Christ was the Father Himself, and that the Father Himself was born and suffered and died'
Since, for Noetus, there could be no division in the Godhead, if Christ suffered, then the Father suffered also
26 Therefore, the trinity of Sabellius is not a trinity of essence, that is, of the inner being of God, but of revelation
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are simply designations of three different phases under which the one divine essence reveals itself
Rather, he insisted that the Father, Son, and Spirit are merely temporary and successive manifestations of the one Person of God
In Arius's formulation, the Father was fully God, the Son had the status of the leading creature, and the Spirit was inferior to the Son
Although for Arius the divine status of the Son and the Spirit was uncertain, his formula must be considered as a type of tritheism
The main issue was between Arius with his form of tritheism and Athanasius with the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity
The Nicene Creed that resulted from this council overthrew the heresy of Arius and tritheism with an anathema at the end of the creed
32 By the time of the Council of Nicaea, both modalism, especially that of Sabellius, and tritheism had been defeated
Dionysius of Alexandria is another example of the misunderstanding concerning the discussions of the Triune God
He was strong to oppose Sabellius, but in doing so he appeared to lean to the other extreme and was charged with teaching tritheism
He was accused by some of treason against the faith before the Bishop of Rome and was asked by a synod of bishops to declare his views
In his reply, Dionysius denied that he had separated the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, since each necessarily implied the others
Some who had not read his replies to the Bishop of Rome or Athanasius's vindications of him still persisted in accusing him of tritheism
Augustine , one of the most important writers on the orthodox view of the Trinity, was accused of being a modalist
Studying the Scriptures in order to carry on the contest with greater accuracy, he himself was caught by the Spirit
Again the advocates of this term, charging their opponents with polytheism, inveighed against them as introducers of heathen superstitions
Co-inherence denotes the mutual indwelling of the three Persons whereby one is as invariably in the other two as they are in the one
52 This doctrine is man's attempt to understand the relationship between the three Persons and to explain how they have one essence
54 On the same page, Strong quotes another writer as saying, 'The persons of the Holy Trinity are not separable individuals
The reason is that both modalism and tritheism stressed in an unbalanced way one aspect of the twofold truth of Gods revelation in the Bible
The twofoldness of truth as offered to our view in Holy Writ is one strong argument of its not being the work of man
It is to trace different results to one principle, to clear it of ambiguities, to show how, through varied appearances, one law holds
59 Therefore Govett says It is not then to be wondered at if two seemingly opposed principles are found placed side by side in the Scripture
Unity in plurality, plurality in unity' is the main principle on which both the world and the Scripture are constructed'
61 As Govett says, 'The claim on our reception is not that we can unite them, but that God has testified both'
Will they trust Him when He affirms that view of truth which runs counter to their temperaments and intellectual bias?
The humble, child-like saint will acknowledge and receive both; for his Father, who cannot err, testifies to each alike
In other words, God's revelation in the Scriptures, being twofold, is an expression of the very nature of God Himself
Adding to the Word of God is most serious and is strictly forbidden in Deuteronomy 4:2; 12:32; and Revelation 22:18
The Lord Jesus Himself likens the teachings of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, the ancient fundamentalists and modernists, to leaven
In Matthew 15:6 the Lord said to the scribes and Pharisees, 'You have deprived the word of God of its authority because of your tradition'
Quoting Isaiah, the Lord could say, 'In vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men'
When we put all these verses together, we see that the leaven of the Pharisees is the traditional teachings and the commandments of men
Let us therefore turn to the pure Word of God and listen to what it says concerning the revelation of the Triune God
The Scriptures unfold two aspects of the revelation of the Triune Godthe aspect of the Three being one and the aspect of the One being three
Although God is uniquely one, there is still the matter of the three Persons-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
In the Hebrew language, the subject 'God' is triple in number, whereas the verb 'create' is singular in number
In Exodus 3:6 the Lord said to Moses, 'I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'
73 Although God is uniquely one, there is still the matter of threefoldness, for He is the Father, Son, and Spirit
The Trinity of the Godhead is also implied in the threefold blessing in Numbers 6:24-26 and in the threefold praise to God in Isaiah 6:3
Undoubtedly, the reason the seraphim in heaven say, 'Holy, holy, holy,' is that the God whom they praise is one-in-three
According to the pure word of the Bible, God is uniquely one, and this unique God is triune, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
That the Spirit is God is proved by Acts 5:3-4 which says that Ananias, in lying to the Holy Spirit, actually lied to God
Any claim that the three Persons of the Godhead are not eternal is a denial of the clear revelation of the Bible
All fundamental Christians agree that God is uniquely one and that He is eternally the Father, Son, and Spirit
They emphasize the aspect of God's being one-in-three, but they often neglect the aspect of His being three-in-one
If we emphasize the Three at the expense of the One, we may fall, although perhaps unconsciously and unintentionally, into tritheism
We must affirm both aspects of the Triune God-the aspect of the Three being one and the aspect of the One being three
It is at the point of testifying these two aspects that we are most acutely aware of the unfathomable mystery of the Triune God
Nowhere does the Bible require that we systematize the Word of God or attempt, through human formulation, to reconcile its statements
After speaking of the two hands, the hand of the Son and the hand of the Father, the Lord Jesus said plainly, 'I and the Father are one'
In verse 16 the Lord says, 'I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever'
In verse 17 the Lord says that the Spirit of reality will be in us, and in verse 20 He says that He, the Son, will be in us
To say that the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45 is not the Holy Spirit is to teach that there are two life-giving Spirits
Commenting on 1 Corinthians 15:45, one writer says, 'Here we see the Spirit and Christ identified in a remarkably intimate way
According to the context of this book, the Lord here is the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Spirit is the very Holy Spirit who gives life
So far as the practical experience of Christians goes, no distinction is made between the Spirit of Christ and Christ Himself
In the Greek, 2 Corinthians 3:18 even contains a compound title-Lord Spirit-showing that the two, the Lord and the Spirit, are one
Before we conclude, let us make two further observations regarding the practical oneness of the Father, Son, and Spirit
In this same verse John says that the Lamb has 'seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth'
That these 'seven Spirits' are none other than the Holy Spirit is proved by Their being mentioned with God and Christ in Revelation 1:4-5
We can no more separate the Holy Spirit from Christ than we can separate a person's eyes from the person himself
As we put all these verses together, we see that the Triune God will be speaking through the persecuted disciples of the Lord Jesus
Rather, they experience the Triune God as the three-in-one giving them instant utterance as they testify for the Lord Jesus
When people consider the Triune God objectively trying to analyze what He is in His inner being they emphasize the aspect of the oneinthree
Once we have established what the pure Word says concerning our wonderful Triune God, we should simply rest upon it
The result of this path is spiritual death, the consequence of trying to understand God according to the principle of the tree of knowledge
All speculation on divine things ends in a mystery before which the thinking mind must bow in humble adoration
May the wonderful Triune God, the three-in-one and the one-in-three, be our portion and enjoyment now and forever
