<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=title>EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS</h1><h1 class=msg>(7)</h1><h2 class=head3>31. The Escort in the Way of Following Him</h2><p>In Matthew 14:22-33 Christ is presented to us as the Escort in the way of following Him. As the Escort, He protects us. Christ pioneers the way, and then He escorts us in the way, leading us on with much protection.<p>In 14:22-33 the disciples, while sailing on the sea, were “battered by the waves, for the wind was contrary” (v. 24). This indicates that there was a storm. This storm troubled the disciples, but it did not bother the Lord Jesus, who “came to them, walking on the sea” (v. 25).<p>We should not expect to follow the Lord Jesus in the way without facing any storms or contrary winds. To be sure, as we follow the Lord, we will experience storms. The more we are faithful to Him, the more storms we will have and the more contrary winds we will face. When a storm comes, we should learn to enjoy Christ as the Escort, as the One escorting us through the storm. Instead of worrying or doing things in ourselves, we should trust Him as the Pioneer and as the Escort. We all need to have much enjoyment of Christ in this matter.<h2 class=head4>a. Walking on the Stormy Sea</h2><p>Matthew 14:24 and 25 say, “The boat was already in the midst of the sea, being battered by the waves, for the wind was contrary. And in the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea.” The Lord surely took notice that the boat was battered by the waves, and eventually He came to His disciples, walking on the sea. While the disciples were distressed by the waves, the Lord Jesus walked on them. This testifies that He is the Creator and the Ruler of the universe (Job 9:8).<h2 class=head4>b. Saving His Followers from the Storm</h2><p>As the Escort, Christ saved His followers from the storm. In response to the Lord’s word, Peter came “down from the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But seeing the strong wind, he became frightened; and as he began to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me!” (Matt. 14:29-30). Peter came down from the boat and walked on the waters by faith. However, when he saw the strong wind, his faith vanished. He should have walked only by faith in the Lord’s word, not by the sight of the circumstances (2 Cor. 5:7). When Peter cried out for help, “Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him and said to him, You of little faith, why did you doubt?” (Matt. 14:31). Since the Lord had said to Peter, “Come” (v. 29), Peter should have stood on that word and not doubted. Hence, the Lord rebuked him.<p>Faith comes from the Lord’s word and stands on the Lord’s word. As long as we have the Lord’s word, we should simply believe His word and not doubt.<h2 class=head4>c. Calming the Wind</h2><p>The Lord Jesus not only saved His followers from the storm but also calmed the wind. “When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased” (v. 32). The Lord’s presence caused the storm to cease. This was a miracle that testifies that the Lord is the Ruler of the heavens and the earth and that He cares for the hardships of His followers as they follow Him.
