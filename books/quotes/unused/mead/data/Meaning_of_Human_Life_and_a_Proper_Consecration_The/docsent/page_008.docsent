   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Entering into Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Make Human Life Meaningful</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Education, marriage, and careers cannot satisfy man because the meaning of human life cannot be found in these things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The meaning of human life is Christ entering into man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Christ enters into you, your human life will have meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not only so, the universe will have meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If there were no saved person in Taiwan, even if there were millions of people on the island, the island would have no meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If no one in the city of Taipei were a Christian, the city of Taipei would have no meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, praise the Lord that there are Christians in Taiwan and in the city of Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As Christians, we are the meaning of human life in Taipei and in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>SINGING JOYFULLY BECAUSE WE HAVE THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Have you ever seen pedestrians whose faces were shining and who were joyfully singing?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What kind of people do you see walking on the streets?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some of the pedestrians I have seen were sorrowful, some were heavy-burdened, and some were toiling and laboring.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have not seen any who were so overcome with joy that they were singing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of course, we should not consider those who are drunk or who suffer from mental illness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If there are any joyful pedestrians, they surely must be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The saints who meet regularly in Taipei are joyful because they have the Lord in them, and they sing spontaneously wherever they are.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This changes the atmosphere of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the brothers and sisters would sing hymns on the streets, at bus stops, in buses, and even in restaurants, their singing would cause a very definite change in the atmosphere in the city of Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This should be our living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only so, all the saints in the church in Taipei should go out and sing on the streets every two weeks or once a month.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The gospel marches should continue, but our appearance should change.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The gospel vests need to be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They need to have a new look.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On Saturday or on the Lord s Day the saints can go out in teams and sing on the streets.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This will bring meaning to the city of Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>CHRISTIANS BEING THE MEANING OF THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must realize that the meaning of the universe is the same as the meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the earth were not in the universe, the universe would be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If there were no human beings on the earth, the earth would be empty, and if there were no Christians, human life would be a complete tragedy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If there were no Christians in your family, it would be a tragedy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What was the situation before Jesus came to your family?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How we thank the Lord that our families have Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not only are our parents saved, but we also are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This has brought meaning into our families.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many of us come from families that used to worship idols.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Have you ever seen a family that worships idols being happy after their worship?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have seen many families that worship idols, but I have never seen them in a joyful mood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some families even have a designated room with a little shrine where they go to burn incense.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, even after burning incense, they are not joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They are not singing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is hard to sing when one is filled with death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Idols represent demons, and demons belong to Satan, who is the source of death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, the worship of idols annuls the meaning of their human life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Chinese refer to those who regularly burn incense and worship idols as kind men and faithful women.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When you enter a Buddhist temple, you do not feel as warm as you do when you are in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is an indication that the meaning of human life is Christ, and Christ is the meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Wherever Christ is, human life has meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Wherever there is no Christ, human life has no meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A family that does not have Christ is in misery and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A society that does not have Christ is in darkness, and a country that does not have Christ is pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are certain that Taiwan is peaceful and has a prosperous situation because the local churches are here.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the reason that Taiwan is blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Man is the meaning of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The meaning of being a human is being a Christian, and the meaning of being a Christian is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ is the meaning of our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>THE NEW JERUSALEM BEING</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>THE CENTER AND THE MEANING</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>OF THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Revelation says that when the new heaven and the new earth appear, the New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven 21:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do not think that the New Jerusalem is a physical city.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Revelation uses signs to speak of spiritual things because spiritual things are mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This can be compared to the fact that we cannot take a photograph or draw a picture of electricity, because electricity is mysterious and invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The New Jerusalem will be in the new heaven and the new earth, but the New Jerusalem is not a physical city.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Revelation uses the sign of a city to describe a spiritual situation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The center and the meaning of the new heaven and the new earth are the New Jerusalem.</S>
