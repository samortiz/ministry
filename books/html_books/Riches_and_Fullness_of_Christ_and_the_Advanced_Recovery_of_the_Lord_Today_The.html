This time, I see many new faces. I am especially overjoyed to see that the majority of you are young people. My burden this time is mainly in three areas. The first concerns Christ, the second concerns the church, and the third concerns the Lord&#8217;s present recovery. These are the main points of this conference: Christ, the church, and the Lord&#8217;s recovery. These three points are not God&#8217;s recovery of yesterday. Rather, they are the Lord&#8217;s present recovery.<h2 class=head1>THE ALL-INCLUSIVENESS AND UNLIMITEDNESS OF CHRIST</h2><p>Christ is the specific and central theme of the Bible. According to the revelation of the Old and New Testaments, Christ is too deep, too high, too wide, and too broad. We can never exhaust speaking about Him, nor can we measure Him. Usually, when we talk about Christ, we make Him too common. We say that &#8220;Christ is loving,&#8217;&#8217; &#8220;Christ is merciful,&#8217;&#8217; &#8220;Christ is forgiving,&#8217;&#8217; and &#8220;Christ is patient.&#8217;&#8217; But all these descriptions are too shallow and common. The terms used by the Bible to describe Christ are all very profound. For this reason, man tends to neglect them.<p>Today we want to see all of the riches of Christ. The first item of these riches is the all-inclusiveness and unlimitedness of Christ. His all-inclusiveness speaks of His content, and the unlimitedness speaks of His measure. As far as His content is concerned, He is everything. There is not one thing that He is not. For this reason, He has a special title: the &#8220;I Am&#8217;&#8217; (Exo. 3:14). If there is a God in the universe, then surely He has to be the one (Rom. 9:5). If there is a man in the universe, surely He is man also (1 Tim. 2:5). He is everything. He is even you and I. He is even every person who is in the churches (Col. 3:11). His content is all-inclusive.<p>In addition, His measure is unlimited. It is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe (Eph. 3:18). When man landed on the moon, he reached a certain height. But the moon is only a part of the solar system. The universe is billions and billions of times larger than the solar system. Since Christ can be compared to the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe, His measure must necessarily be unlimited.<h2 class=head1>HIS PERSON, NATURE, EXPERIENCE, WORK, ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AND ATTAINMENTS ALL BEING EXCELLENT BEYOND COMPARISON</h2><p>We all know that the person denotes the being of a man. Our person is very insignificant. Only the person of the Lord Jesus is excellent beyond comparison. First, He is God: the Lord Jesus is God. Outside of Him, we cannot find God. In addition, He is omnipresent. He is unlimited in what He is. He is power, He is authority, He is light, and He is love. All the positive things in the universe are types of God Himself. Greatness, authority, honor, glory, and nobility are all expressions of what God is. Human language can never describe in full the wonder of what God is. Second, He is also man. The Lord Jesus is not only God; He is also man. This makes His person complete. Before the incarnation of the Lord Jesus, God was merely God; He was not a man. But today, this God has become a man. The One whom the prophets in the Old Testament worshipped was only God; He was not a man. But the birth of the Lord Jesus was God taking up humanity to become a God-man.<p>During the last three and a half years, when the Lord Jesus was fulfilling His ministry in preaching the gospel, those following Him always asked the question: &#8220;Who is this One? Is He God, or is He man?&#8217;&#8217; In our natural concept, there is a clear distinction between God and man. But here is One who is God mingled with man. He is man, yet in Him is God. In Him, God and man are mingled together as one. Hence, He is a God-man.<p>Mark 4 records one time that the Lord Jesus crossed the sea. Suddenly, a great storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat. But the Lord Jesus was asleep in the stern on a cushion (vv. 35-38). We know that God does not slumber; neither does He need to sleep. But the Lord Jesus slept peacefully in the stern of the boat, where the tossing was the most severe. The waves rolled in, one after another. All the disciples were frightened. They awoke the Lord and said to Him, &#8220;Teacher, doesn&#8217;t it matter to You that we are perishing?&#8217;&#8217; (v. 38). When the Lord rose up, He rebuked the winds and the waves, and there was a great calm. At the same time, He rebuked the disciples for their fear and lack of faith. The disciples feared greatly and wondered whether the wonderful One before their eyes was God or man.<p>One day, the Lord told Nicodemus that He was the One who descended out of heaven and who is in heaven (John 3:13). He was not in heaven first, then on earth; rather, He is in heaven and on earth simultaneously. This is the Lord Jesus Christ. He is our Savior. He is also the One we believe in, the One who is now our life. Today, not only is He in heaven and on earth, but He is even in you, in me, and in everyone here who has believed into Him. Ephesians 4:6 tells us that He is above all, through all, and in all. He is omnipresent. Like the air around us, He can be everywhere. These are His all-inclusive, unlimited, excellent, and unsearchable riches.<p>God&#8217;s nature is also rich beyond measure. Holiness and righteousness are God&#8217;s nature. If we believe into God, we have holiness and righteousness. The more you say that there is no God, the less holiness and righteousness you have. We can never explain this matter. It is the same with the air. We do not know all about the air, yet daily we are breathing it. If we stop breathing for five minutes, I am afraid that we will be through. Air is very important to us. For our daily life we also need food and water. But to get these two things, we have to pay a price. However, there is no price for breathing the air. Air does not need to go through any special process, and we can enjoy it without exerting any conscious effort. Furthermore, among these three things, the most important one is the air; we cannot live without it for a moment. Praise the Lord! The thing that is most necessary is also the thing that is most available. This is the way the Lord Jesus is to us. He is the One that we need the most, and yet He is also the One most available to us. He is so available because He is limitless. We can enjoy His riches because He is everything to us.<h2 class=head1>EVERYONE NEEDING JESUS CHRIST</h2><p>We all know that it is not easy to be a human being. Some young people want to commit suicide at the age of eighteen or nineteen because they consider it too difficult to be a human being. All parents love their children, but this love sometimes becomes a bothering to the children. In the same way, although children are precious to the parents, many times they cause their parents to suffer beyond measure. It is not easy to be a parent or a child. It is likewise not easy to be a husband or a wife. It is not easy to be an employer, an employee, a teacher, a student, or to be in any other profession. This is why we all need Jesus. Only Jesus is qualified to be a human being. Without the Lord Jesus, we are not qualified to be a father or a mother. We are not qualified to be any kind of person. We may even want to commit suicide. Only when Jesus comes into us will we not have any thought of committing suicide. Jesus is too rich. When He enters into you, your enjoyment of Him is beyond description. He can satisfy all the needs of our human life.<p>His person, nature, experience, work, accomplishments, and attainments are all excellent beyond comparison. He is such a One. He is all-inclusive; hence, He is excellent beyond comparison. The water that we drink is precious because, on the one hand, it is rich in its constituents, and, on the other hand, these constituents are what the human body needs. Whether or not we understand it, as long as we drink in the water, it will function within us and will meet our need to satisfy our thirst. This is the way with our human life. As soon as Jesus comes in, we feel wonderful. We cannot explain it. Without Jesus, we are just a mess. This is something beyond human explanation. Hence, everyone needs Jesus. Only God can meet and solve all the needs within man. In our human life, we all need this all-inclusive and limitless Christ. In Him are unspeakable human riches and divine riches as well. He can save us to the uttermost.<h2 class=head1>THE CHRIST WHO IS THE BREADTH, THE LENGTH, THE HEIGHT, AND THE DEPTH SATISFYING ALL THE NEEDS OF THE HUMAN LIFE</h2><p>For example, a young person has believed in the Lord and is saved. Before his salvation, he was very unreasonable and unruly. No one could deal with him. Whether it was the school, the police, the court, or his parents, no one could lay their hands on him. One day, this young man believed in Jesus in a wonderful way. In three to five days, his whole person had a wonderful change. The Jesus that he had received began to exercise a regulating function in him, and all his peculiar conduct was changed.<p>After a while, he discovers that he still has some peculiarities in his disposition and temperament. He still hates others and envies others. He feels that since he has become a Christian, he should not be like this any longer. He tries his best to improve himself, but the result is that his temper becomes worse. The more he tries to improve, the more he envies others. The reason for this is that he is striving by himself, and it is difficult for him to see any improvement. This is often our experience. The more we pursue the Lord, the more we feel that we are not right. For this reason, when we love the Lord and pursue after Him, we have to remember to drop our self and give up our self. No matter how peculiar, quick-tempered, or proud we are, we have to forget about these things to touch the Lord. When we contact the Lord with our spirit, we should not ask the Lord to do so many things for us; rather, we should touch the Lord Himself. This is like connecting the electricity to our homes; we do not need to pray for electricity to give light and heat. All we do is link up with the electric source and allow the electric current to flow. Electricity will then be transmitted to us, and every electric appliance will be able to operate and to function. Hence, we must continually touch the Lord in our spirit. He will kill our temper and pride, and He will swallow up our envying. In the end, we will be saved.<p>Finally, the riches in the Lord&#8217;s divinity and the power in His humanity will become our humanity. In this way, the limitless Christ will be in us to meet all our needs and to enable us to do all things. This is like what Paul said: &#8220;I can do all things in Him who empowers me&#8217;&#8217; (Phil. 4:13). In the book of 1 Corinthians, he told us that he was made an uncommon person not because of himself, but because of the grace of God that was with him (1 Cor. 15:10). Paul was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insulting, destructive person (1 Tim. 1:13). After he touched Christ, Christ was in him, and he became an uncommon person.<p>Furthermore, Paul said that the riches of Christ that he enjoyed are unsearchable. In the end, he spoke of the &#8220;excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord&#8217;&#8217; (Phil. 3:8). The riches of Christ are unsearchable; He is both high and deep, and His measure is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe (Eph. 3:8). We need to spend all the days of our life to experience His riches.<h2 class=head1>REALIZING OUR OWN USELESSNESS FOR THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST&#8217;S UNSEARCHABLE RICHES</h2><p>Many of you young ones here today have known Christ. You have also known His matchless riches. We have to learn to touch Him and to see Him. Furthermore, some brothers and sisters have the desire to be full-time and to join the training. I want you to know that to join the training is to be exposed. It shows us that we are nothing and can do nothing. We are corrupt to the uttermost, and we are absolutely useless. Hence, we must touch Christ. It is not enough merely to trust in Him. We have to allow Him to be in us and allow ourselves to get into Him. We must be joined to Him daily, and we must breathe Him in all the time. We have to see that we can never overcome our own temper. We cannot improve ourselves or advance by ourselves. But there is a way today. It is to receive this Jesus Christ. He is our temperament, and He is also our advancement and our improvement. He is everything to us on the positive side.<p>Today, this Lord is the Spirit. Within us, we also have a spirit. Our spirit is linked and mingled as one with God the Spirit. This is the goal of our training. Our training is not a seminary. It is not a monastery. This training is to lead the brothers and sisters to know themselves, to realize their own uselessness, and to contact Christ, so that the riches of Christ can become their riches.<p>Some of you brothers and sisters may think that the training will make you an experienced person. But I must tell you that a person&#8217;s experience, whether that of the older ones or that of the young, is worth nothing. Many times, the more experienced we are, the less we are useful. Although I am so old, I do not trust in my experience at all. On the contrary, my experience many times becomes a hindrance to me. Hence, we have to realize that whether we are old or young, good or evil, we are all useless. Everyone needs Jesus. Only Jesus is useful. If all of you trainees, one hundred or more, would take in these words, your training will be a success, and the churches in the Philippines will double their number very soon.<h2 class=head1>PRODUCING THE CHURCH FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD&#8217;S ETERNAL AND MYSTERIOUS ECONOMY</h2><p>The problem of those serving the Lord is that they think that they are useful. They fail to apply the Lord Jesus, and as a result they cannot enjoy Him. We have to realize that the riches of Christ are unsearchable. As long as we are willing to drop our self and to admit our uselessness, the riches of Christ will become our experience. These unsearchable riches are the gospel that we preach today. When these riches are preached as the gospel to others, the result is the church for the accomplishment of God&#8217;s eternal and mysterious economy. Formerly, our gospel only told people to repent and to confess their sins, and to be delivered from perdition and to receive eternal life. That is not adequate for the producing of the church. The proper and high gospel is one that causes people to see their uselessness and to experience the unsearchable riches of Christ. The result is that the church is produced for the accomplishing of God&#8217;s eternal and mysterious economy.<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Quezon City, Philippines, on March 23, 1989)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 12:9; John 1:14; 2 Cor. 13:14; Phil. 4:13; 1 Cor. 15:9-11; Phil. 1:19; 2 Tim. 4:22; 1 Cor. 6:17; Phil. 1:21</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="3"><li>The grace of Christ-2 Cor. 12:9:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The embodiment of the processed Triune God becoming the believers&#8217; enjoyment-John 1:14; 2 Cor. 13:14.</li>	<li>Being sufficient.</li>	<li>As power tabernacling over the believers.</li>	<li>Empowering the believers in all things-Phil. 4:13.</li>	<li>Making the believers uncommon-1 Cor. 15:9-11.</li>	</ol></li><li>The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ-Phil. 1:19:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Spirit of Jesus Christ being the embodiment of Christ, who is the pneumatic Christ in resurrection.</li>	<li>The riches of Christ becoming the bountiful supply of this Spirit to the believers.</li>	<li>This Spirit abiding in the believers to become one spirit with them, that they may experience Christ and live Him-2 Tim. 4:22; 1 Cor. 6:17; Phil. 1:21.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>In the last message, we have seen the all-inclusiveness and limitlessness of Christ. This all-inclusiveness and limitlessness of Christ become the riches of Christ. Unfortunately, our time was too short, and we did not cover the matter thoroughly. Nevertheless, we need to remember that the person and the nature of Christ, all that He has experienced, all His works, and all that He has attained and obtained are all-inclusive and limitless. In His work, He has solved the problem of sin, Satan, the self, the flesh, the old creation, the world, and all the negative things in the universe. All these have been taken care of by Him. Positively, He has accomplished redemption, salvation, justification, resurrection, and sanctification.<p>Finally, He ascended to the heavens, and He has attained the kingship, the throne, glory, and honor. All these are all-inclusive and limitless, and they are excellent beyond comparison. Today, all these items have become His riches. In these riches are divinity and humanity as well. All these are there for us to experience. Although we cannot understand them in full, we can enjoy them day by day. This can be compared to the rice that we eat every day; very few people understand the composition of rice, but we can enjoy it every day. This is truly a mystery.<h2 class=head1>THE GRACE OF CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>The Embodiment of the Processed Triune God Becoming the Believers&#8217; Enjoyment</h2><p>All the riches of this God become His grace. The meaning of grace is God becoming our enjoyment freely. Today, when we enjoy God, we are enjoying His all-inclusiveness and limitlessness being given to us freely as grace. John 1:14 says, &#8220;The Word became flesh.&#8217;&#8217; For this reason, God brought grace to us for our enjoyment. Grace is simply what Christ is. It is also all the riches of Christ.<p>First, Christ is God. He brought God to us. This is one side of Him as grace. Next, He became a man, and He brought His humanity to us. This is another side of grace. All His human experiences, His accomplishment on the cross, and all that He has attained and obtained, including His ascension and enthronement, are all given freely to us as our free portion. Moreover, He is light, love, holiness, righteousness, authority, power, and strength. All these have become our enjoyment, and they are the different aspects of grace.<p>We know also that grace issues from the love of God, and it is communicated into us through the Holy Spirit. Hence, 2 Corinthians 13:14 says, &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&#8217;&#8217; The fellowship of the Holy Spirit communicates to us the love of God and the grace of Christ, and it becomes our daily experience and enjoyment. All these are aspects of the grace of Christ.<p>This grace is also the embodiment of the processed Triune God. The elements of the Triune God are the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, who have passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and glorification. Without these processes, He would not be a man. But after passing through incarnation, He became a man. Without passing through human living, He would not know what it is like to live the human life and would not be able to taste the sufferings of human life for Himself. Without passing through the cross, He would not be able to taste death. Without entering into resurrection, though He is life, He could not have experienced resurrection. If He were to remain in heaven without descending to earth and ascending again to heaven, He could never have human living and the experience of death and resurrection.<p>The Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, has passed through all the processes. Every time He passed through a process, some elements were added into Him. When He passed through incarnation, the human element was added. When He passed through crucifixion, the element of death was added. When He passed through resurrection, the element of resurrection was added. When He passed through ascension and glorification, the elements of ascension and glorification were added. Today, the God in whom we believe contains within Himself many different elements. To Him, these elements are His riches. To us, they are our grace for us to receive, experience, and enjoy.<h2 class=head2>Being Sufficient</h2><p>This grace and enjoyment is sufficient for us today. It is not lacking in any way. It is sufficient for us in a rich way. We know that it is not easy to be a human being. We have parents above us and children under us. We also have husbands or wives beside us. We do not need to mention other relationships. These three levels of relationships alone are difficult enough for us. If we can live harmoniously with our parents, children, and husbands or wives, we can be considered a success in our human living already. However, there are many trials and sufferings in the human life in addition to these relationships. But the grace of God, which is also the riches of Christ, is sufficient for us in all these environments.<p>If we have this Christ as grace, He will be in us as our enjoyment, and He will prove Himself sufficient to deal with all the people, matters, and things. In this way, not only will we be able to pass through sufferings, but we will be able to be proper brothers or sisters in the church. We will experience sanctification and transformation. In the end, we will be conformed to the glorious image of Christ. This will make us mature and will enable us to enter into His glory and to match Him. All this is what grace accomplishes for us.<h2 class=head2>As Power Tabernacling over the Believers</h2><p>This grace is what God is in Himself as all His riches. Now it is gradually wrought and constituted into us. In this way, this power becomes everything to us, and it has become the power that tabernacles over us.<h2 class=head2>Empowering the Believers in All Things, Making Them Uncommon</h2><p>Moreover, this grace is empowering us in all things. Paul told us that he became an uncommon person not through himself, but through the grace of Christ that was present in him. We can use electricity as an illustration of how Christ is present in us. When electricity is present with the microphone, it will transmit our voice. Of course, when electricity is present with man, man will be killed by it. This is the result of the presence of electricity. When Christ is present with us, the first thing He brings is the killing element. After this, He enables us to live with Him.<p>Our destiny is to die with Christ and to live with Him. Without the presence of Christ, we can never experience death, and we can never experience resurrection. We will remain in ourselves. This is something to be condemned. We can only be a proper and right person when we die with Christ and live together with Him. This is like an electric toy: without electricity, it will not move but will remain in the same place all the time. But when electricity is applied, it will turn around unceasingly. It is the same way with us, the believers. When the grace of Christ is present with the believers, it will empower them in all things and will make them uncommon persons.<h2 class=head1>THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>The Spirit of Jesus Christ Being the Embodiment of Christ, Who Is the Pneumatic Christ in Resurrection</h2><p>The all-inclusiveness and limitlessness of Christ become the riches of Christ. Today, these riches become the grace that we enjoy. This grace comes upon us through the Spirit. The Triune God is Spirit. The ultimate consummation of the Triune God is also the Spirit. Moreover, after the Lord Jesus resurrected from the dead, He also became a life-giving Spirit. But this does not mean that there are three Spirits. It is only the three aspects of the one Spirit. As far as God is concerned, His nature is Spirit. As far as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God is concerned, and as far as the Lord&#8217;s incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension are concerned, He is also the Spirit. Furthermore, all the riches of Christ that come to us as grace and enjoyment are also a matter of the Spirit.<p>From my youth, I learned to treasure the grace of God, but I had no idea what this grace is, or how this Spirit comes to us. Even at that time, however, grace came upon me day by day, and the Spirit was with me all the time. Second Timothy 4:22 says, &#8220;The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.&#8217;&#8217; The Lord&#8217;s grace is simply the Lord being with our spirit.<p>This morning we feel happy and sweet while we are singing the hymns. This is because the Spirit of God is with us. This Spirit of God that is with us is grace. If your parents bother you, you can still sing and can still say &#8220;Hallelujah.&#8217;&#8217; This is because grace is with you. If others praise you and commend your merits, you will not be proud. On the contrary, you can be humble and can have the full sense that you are glorifying God. This shows that the Spirit is present with you. This Spirit that is present with you is the grace. Whatever we could not do formerly but are able to do now is done through the presence of the Spirit, that is, through the presence of this instant grace.<h2 class=head2>The Riches of Christ Becoming the Bountiful Supply of This Spirit to the Believers</h2><p>The riches of Christ realized in the Spirit are the bountiful supply to the believers. Whatever we need is supplied to us in this bountiful Spirit. If we need God, this bountiful Spirit is God in us. If you think that your humanity is too poor, the Spirit within you will supply you with the humanity of Jesus. If you need patience, this Spirit will supply you with patience. If you need utterance, this Spirit will supply you with utterance. If you need joy or peace, this Spirit will supply you with joy and peace. These bountiful supplies are also the grace that continually supplies us within.<h2 class=head2>This Spirit Abiding in the Believers to Become One Spirit with Them, That They May Experience Christ and Live Him</h2><p>We have seen that this grace is a Person, and this Person is the Spirit of God. The Spirit of God is simply the reality of Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God. In the end, what comes to us is the Spirit. When He is enjoyed by us, He becomes grace. Hence, the key today is the Spirit. He is not in our ears, or in our mind, but in our spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &#8220;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&#8217;&#8217; This shows that the Spirit can become one spirit with our spirit. The end of this experience is that our whole being will become the grace of Christ, who is the all-inclusive and limitless One.<p>At the end of his Epistles, Paul often mentioned grace and peace being with us. We know that peace comes from grace, and grace is the Spirit that is present with us. Now this Spirit with His bountiful supply is in our spirit. Whenever we exercise our spirit and use our spirit, we can contact the Spirit, and we can experience the God of grace. We can also experience His all-inclusiveness and limitlessness. These are the riches of Christ that we enjoy.<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Quezon City, Philippines, on March 23, 1989)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:14, 16; Eph. 1:23</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The riches of God becoming the fullness of Christ:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The riches of the Triune God overflowing in the flesh to become the fullness of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God-John 1:14, 16.</li>	<li>The riches of God overflowing in Christ to become the fullness of Christ as God&#8217;s expression; the believers having received of this fullness of Christ the rich grace-John 1:16.</li>	</ol></li><li>The riches of Christ becoming the fullness of Christ:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The riches of Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed Triune God, experienced by the believers, overflowing to become His fullness.</li>	<li>The riches of Christ overflowing to the believers to become the fullness of Christ as His expression and God&#8217;s fullness-Eph. 1:23.</li>	<li>This fullness that is the expression of Christ being the Body of Christ.</li>	<li>This Body being the church constituted of the believers in Christ:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Being constituted in Christ by the divine life of Christ.</li>		<li>Being out of Christ and being one in life and nature with Christ.</li>		<li>Being an organism begotten of God rather than an organization made by man.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class=head1>THE RICHES OF GOD BECOMING THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>The Riches of the Triune God Overflowing in the Flesh to Become the Fullness of Christ as the Embodiment of the Triune God- John 1:14, 16</h2><p>In the previous two messages we have seen Christ. In this message we will see the church. There are two terms in the Bible that are very difficult to understand. One of them is the riches of Christ, and the other is the fullness of Christ. The two words are different from one another, but there is a relation between the two. The riches produce the fullness, and the fullness comes out of the riches. When something is rich, it becomes full. The fullness is the expression of the riches. Without the riches, there can never be the fullness. When something becomes rich to the uttermost, there is the fullness. For example, here are two cups, both filled with water. The water in them may be very rich, but the cups are not full yet. If we continue to add water into them until they overflow, we will see the fullness.<p>All of what Christ is are His riches. When these riches come into us and overflow from us, they are the fullness. John 1:14 says, &#8220;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&#8217;&#8217; Not only are the grace and reality rich; they are full. Most people think that to be full of something is the same as to be rich in that thing. Actually, there is a distinction between being rich and being full. Fullness means more than riches. For example, the cup on my right hand is rich, but we do not see its riches. The cup on my left hand, however, the overflowing cup, has the fullness, and everyone can see it.<p>When God became flesh, the grace that He brought was not only rich, but it was full. It was not only rich within, but it was full to overflowing. Hence, John 1:16 says, &#8220;For of His fullness we have all received.&#8217;&#8217; Hence, when you pray, you should not say, &#8220;Lord, of Your rich grace we have received.&#8217;&#8217; Rather, you should say, &#8220;Lord, of Your fullness in grace we have received.&#8217;&#8217; Riches are what is hidden within, and fullness is what is flowed out. Riches are abundant, but not abundant enough. Fullness is abundance upon abundance, to the extent that there is an overflow.<p>What then are riches? Riches are simply what the Lord Jesus is. All that the Lord Jesus is are His riches. He is God. He is also man. He is light and love. He is holiness and righteousness. He is forbearance and patience. He is everything. That is why He is called the &#8220;I Am.&#8217;&#8217; He is everything positive. He is the noble and the lowly. He is the length and the breadth. Hence, He is rich in what He is. What then is fullness? When the riches of the Lord are expressed, that is, when all that the Lord is overflows from us, the riches become the fullness.<h2 class=head2>The Riches of God Overflowing in Christ to Become the Fullness of Christ as God&#8217;s Expression; the Believers Having Received of this Fullness of Christ the Rich Grace-John 1:16</h2><p>God&#8217;s riches are riches when they are in Christ; they become the fullness when they come to us. He is the Christ, and we are the church. For Christ it is the riches; for us it is the fullness. For example, the water in these two cups is identical; but in one cup, it is the riches, and in the other cup, when the water flows out, it is the fullness. It is Christ who is rich, and it is the church that is full. These two are actually one. Riches are hidden within, and fullness is expressed without. What is hidden within is Christ. What is expressed without is the church. Hence, the church is the expression of Christ. The expression of Christ is the fullness of Christ. His fullness issues forth from His riches. When it is hidden in Him, it is the riches. When it is expressed in us, it is the fullness. When we speak of riches, we refer to Christ. When we speak of fullness, we refer to the church. For the riches to become the fullness means for Christ to become the church. Riches and fullness, therefore, refer to Christ and the church.<p>The New Testament also shows us that the source of these riches is God. One day, this God became flesh and came among men. He is God, yet He expressed all His riches item by item in the human flesh. What was expressed was His fullness. In God they are the riches. In Christ when they are expressed, they are the fullness. The Jews received grace from God. We the Christians today receive grace from Christ. The Jews worshipped God for His riches. We the Christians today worship in Christ in order to gain His fullness.<p>We should never forget this matter. God is the Word. When this God became flesh, He was full of grace and reality. It was not that He was rich in these things, but that He was full of these things. In God they are the riches. When they reach Christ, they become the fullness. Hence, it is not a matter that we receive of His riches. Rather, we receive of His fullness. Today, we do not receive grace directly from God. Rather, we receive God&#8217;s grace in Christ. Furthermore, the grace that we talk about is not God&#8217;s direct grace, but His grace in Christ. Hence, this grace is not merely rich; it is also full. It is not merely grace, but grace upon grace.<p>Christ is in the riches of God. When the riches of God become the fullness, that is the church. Hence, the church is not something of God&#8217;s riches. The church is something of Christ&#8217;s fullness. In God&#8217;s riches there is no church yet. It is only when we come to the fullness of Christ that we have the church. This shows us that the riches are Christ, and the fullness is the church.<p>Let us now return to the outline. First, the riches of God become the fullness of Christ. I believe you can now understand this. Under this heading there are two points. First, the riches of the Triune God overflow in the flesh to become the fullness of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God. God is great. He is not limited by anything. At the same time, He is abstract. Although we cannot see Him or touch Him, He exists and is real. One day, He became flesh and was a man, manifesting Himself among men. He was the embodiment of God. God&#8217;s riches were in this One and were expressed through this One. The riches of God became the fullness expressed without. Second, the riches of God overflow in Christ to become the fullness of Christ as God&#8217;s expression; of this fullness of Christ, the believers have received the rich grace. Here we see three important terms. The first is riches, the second is fullness, and the third is the fullness becoming the expression. First, there are the riches. When they are expressed, they become the fullness. This fullness is an expression. This can be compared to saying that the outflow of water is the expression of water.<h2 class=head1>THE RICHES OF CHRIST BECOMING THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2><p>The riches of Christ are the riches of God. When these riches are hidden in Christ, they remain the riches. When they are expressed without in Christ, they become the fullness. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, Peter, John, James, Mary, and many others came to Him. Of Him they all received. Let me ask you: what was it that they received? Was it the grace hidden in the Lord Jesus, or the grace expressed out from the Lord Jesus? It was grace expressed out from the Lord Jesus. This is why John said that of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace (John 1:16). This grace is expressed, and we have received it. It keeps coming again and again without stopping. It is grace upon grace. Hence, it becomes an expression.<h2 class=head2>The Riches of Christ, Who Is the Embodiment of the Processed Triune God, Experienced by the Believers, Overflowing to Become His Fullness</h2><p>When the riches of Christ are in Him, they are the riches. When they are expressed, they become Christ&#8217;s fullness. When the riches that are in this Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed Triune God, are experienced by us, they overflow to become His fullness.<p>In 1962, at Easter, I spoke this message for the first time in the Bay Area in America. I remember that I used the riches of America as an example. I said that when I first arrived in America, I did not understand how the Americans could be so tall and strong. Later when I went to the supermarkets and saw all the rich foods, I began to understand. The Americans grow to their size because of the rich American food they eat.<p>In an American supermarket, there are all kinds of rich food. After the Americans eat these foods and have digested them, every one of them becomes a big American. The different kinds of food are the riches of America, and the individual big Americans are the fullness of America. The American food in the supermarket becomes the constitution of the Americans within a week after they eat it. Before being eaten, the American beef, chicken, fish, vegetables, and fruits are the riches of America. After they are eaten and digested, they become the fullness of America. The Americans themselves are the fullness of America. They express the riches of America.<p>In the same way, the riches of Christ were in Christ. After we have eaten these riches, they are digested in us, and we become the fullness of Christ. Christians are simply the fullness of Christ. This fullness is there to express Christ. Today, we are all Christians here. Although some are taller, whereas others are smaller, in their spiritual stature, we have all been produced through eating and enjoying the riches of Christ. When all the Christians are put together, the fullness that is expressed is the church. This fullness is the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head2>The Riches of Christ Overflowing to the Believers to Become the Fullness of Christ as His Expression and God&#8217;s Fullness- Ephesians 1:23</h2><p>When the riches of Christ overflow in and over the believers, they become the fullness of Christ as His expression and God&#8217;s fullness. First, the riches of Christ become His fullness. Since He is the embodiment of God, this fullness also becomes the fullness of God. In John 1:16, the fullness of God is in Christ. By Ephesians 1:23, God&#8217;s fullness in Christ becomes the church. This fullness of Christ in the end becomes the fullness of God. Hence, we can see that the fullness of God is first expressed in Christ. Next it is expressed in the believers, who are the church. In the end, when it is expressed in the church, it is still the fullness of God.<h2 class=head2>This Fullness That Is the Expression of Christ Being the Body of Christ</h2><p>The fullness that is the expression of the riches of Christ is the Body of Christ. This Body is the expression of Christ. If while I am standing here, I have only a head hanging in the air without a body under it, I will not at all be full. But if here is a big American who measures seven feet, one inch, and who weighs three hundred fifty pounds, his body will express his fullness. In the same way, the Body of Christ is the expression of the fullness of Christ.<h2 class=head2>This Body Being the Church Constituted of the Believers in Christ</h2><p>First, this Body is in Christ and is constituted by the divine life of Christ. A false Christian may have the name of a Christian, but he does not have the life of Christ, and he has no part in the organic Body of Christ. Judas, the betrayer of the Lord, had the name of a Christian, but he did not have anything to do with the life of Christ. Hence, he had no part in the Body of Christ. Every one who has a part in the organic Body of Christ has the life of Christ.<p>Second, this Body comes out of Christ and is one in life and nature with Christ. All the members of the Body of Christ come out of Christ. In their spiritual life and nature, they are one with Christ.<p>Third, this Body is an organism begotten by God, rather than an organization made by man. This organism is the organic Body of Christ, and it is constituted of the riches of Christ enjoyed and digested by us.<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Quezon City, Philippines, on March 24, 1989)<h1 class=msg> CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:16; Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:15, 13, 12, 16, 7-11</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="3"><li>The organic Body of Christ needing the growth-Eph. 4:16:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Growing by the growth of God in the believers-Col. 2:19.</li>	<li>Causing all the saints to grow into the Head, Christ, in all things, being full of the element of Christ-Eph. 4:15.</li>	<li>Until all the saints arrive at a full-grown man, at the full measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ-Eph. 4:13.</li>	</ol></li><li>The growth of the organic Body of Christ being the organic building of the church as the Body of Christ-Eph. 4:12, 16:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Christ as the resurrected and ascended Head producing the gifted persons through His resurrection life to be the gifts given to the church produced by Him as His Body-Eph. 4:7-11.</li>	<li>These gifts given by Christ to the church perfecting the saints for the work of the unique New Testament ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ-Eph. 4:12.</li>	<li>The saints perfected by the gifts, building the Body of Christ directly through the organic function of the measure of each one part-Eph. 4:16.</li>	<li>The gifted ones being the joints of the life supply in the organic Body of Christ, the other members being the different parts in this organic Body; the two coordinating to build up the Body of Christ organically.</li>	<li>Through the joints of the life supply, and through the different parts that operate in their measures, the Body being caused to grow unto the building up of itself.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>In the last few messages, we have seen the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ. The riches of Christ come to us for the producing of the fullness of Christ, which is the Body of Christ. In this message, we shall see how the organic Body of Christ needs to grow. The growth of the organic Body of Christ is the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ.<p>In the New Testament, there are some mysterious points that are easily missed by readers of the Bible. They are points that are difficult to grasp. For example, in the book of Ephesians Paul revealed the thought concerning the fullness of Christ as the Body of Christ, which is the church of Christ. When he spoke of the church, he said that it is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23). This is a very profound term. In chapter four of Ephesians, Paul used another profound word, &#8220;the fullness of Christ&#8217;&#8217; (v. 13). He said that the fullness of Christ is the expression of Christ. This expression is fully a matter of the eternal and divine life of God.<p>In John 10:10 the Lord Jesus said that He came that the sheep may have life and have it more abundantly. Most Christians know that life is for salvation. Christ is our life for the purpose that we would be saved. Of course, there is nothing wrong in this realization. However, this is not enough. When Christ enters into us, not only is He life to us to save us, but He is also making us the church through this saving life.<p>The church is the Body of Christ. It is not an organization, but an organism. It is not a matter of outward things, but a matter of an inward life. The church can be compared to the human body. Outwardly speaking, the human body is composed of all the different organs and members. It may look like an organization. Actually, every part of the human body is a matter of life. Hence, the church is not an organization, but an organism. Look at my ten fingers. Not only is every finger joined to me; each one has an organic relationship with me. All of them have a circulation and a fellowship with the blood of the whole body. The whole body is a living organism that is full of the activities of life. The wooden stand before me is different. It is composed of pieces of wood as an organization; there is no life in them.<h2 class=head1>THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST NEEDING THE GROWTH</h2><p>The church is the Body of Christ. As the human body needs to grow, in the same way the Body of Christ needs to grow. In Ephesians 4, the word &#8220;growth,&#8217;&#8217; &#8220;grown,&#8221; or &#8220;to grow&#8217;&#8217; is used at least three times. First, Paul says, &#8220;Until we all arrive...at a full-grown man&#8217;&#8217; (4:13). When a man is first born, his stature is very small. Day by day, he needs to grow, until he becomes a full-grown man. Since the church is the Body of Christ, it needs to grow day by day also. Following this, Paul says, &#8220;We may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ&#8217;&#8217; (4:15). After a Christian is saved, he is a person in Christ. But there are still many things not of Christ in him. For this reason, he has to give the Lord the ground in all things so that the Lord may grow in him.<p>Finally, we have &#8220;the growth of the Body&#8217;&#8217; (4:16). The church is the Body of Christ. This body grows; it does not expand. Often we say that the church has expanded. Actually, this term is not that scriptural. The church does not expand; it should only grow. Something that has no life can be said to expand, but something with life should grow. When we speak of a nation, we can say that it expands. This is because a nation is an organization; it is not an organism. But when we speak of the church, we should speak of growth, because the church is the Body of Christ. It is organic, and not organizational.<p>Because the church needs the growth, and because we all have to arrive at a full-grown man, being full of the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, we need to know how the Body of Christ grows.<h2 class=head2>Growing by the Growth of God in the Believers</h2><p>The growth of the Body of Christ is by the growth of God in us. Today God is in us. If we love God, pursue after Him, and live by Him, we will afford God the opportunity to grow in us. When God grows in every believer, this growth issues in the growth of the church. Hence, the growth of the church is absolutely not due to the growth of the human, natural life. The growth of the church is absolutely due to the growth of God in every one of us. When the God within us increases, the church as a Body grows. This is why we must pursue after God and allow Him to have the ground in us. When we give God the ground step by step, we will be filled with God, and God will grow in us.<h2 class=head2>Causing All the Saints to Grow into the Head, Christ, in All Things, Being Full of the Element of Christ</h2><p>When God grows in us, we will grow into the Head, Christ, in all things. Although we are saved and are in Christ, we may still do many things apart from Christ.<p>When I first went to America in 1962, the hippies were very popular. I lived in California, which was the place where the hippies originated. In Los Angeles, there were groups of hippies who came to listen to the gospel. Some were saved. I still remember one time that a hippie with long hair came in while I was preaching. His hair covered his shoulders, and he wore a colorful headband. When he came in, he sat on the front row. Following that, another tall hippie came in. He wore a shabby pair of slippers and had no socks on. He also sat on the first row. While he listened to my speaking, he stretched out his legs and wiggled his toes.<p>When these two people sat down, I found it hard to continue with my speaking. Nevertheless, both of them got saved. After a day or two, when the one with the headband came to the meeting, we noticed that the headband was gone. This was a good sign. In this matter of the headband, he had grown into the Head, Christ. A few days later, when he came to the meeting, his long hair had been cut. I was rejoicing, because in the matter of hair cutting he had grown into Christ. After a few more days, when he came to the meeting again, I could not recognize him any longer. Not only had he cut his beard, but he had shaved his face clean. In the matter of beard shaving, he had also grown into Christ. A little later, he came with short hair; his hair was a few inches from his collar. The other barefoot hippie began to put on his socks after a few days, but he still wore his slippers. After a few more days, he began to put on proper shoes also. By that time, the two began to look like proper people.<p>These two living testimonies show us that we have to grow in all things. Even in the matter of cutting our hair and shaving our beard, we have to grow. The more a person pursues after the Lord, the more the Lord will occupy ground in him, and the more he will grow in the Lord. Strictly speaking, it is not we who are growing; it is He who is growing within us. The more He grows within us, the more we grow into Christ.<p>Let me take another example. The sisters have a problem in combing their hair. They often find it hard to take five minutes for morning watch and prayer. But when they stand before the mirror, they can spend twenty minutes combing their hair. This kind of combing is not in Christ. In the matter of combing our hair, we need to grow. Some others like to make long-distance telephone calls. Once they are on the phone, their ears are glued to the phone, and they would not put it down for a long time. Such telephone calls are not carried out in Christ. This is why Ephesians 4:15 says that we have to grow up in all things into the Head, Christ.<p>This is easy to say, but it is not entirely easy to grow. When I look at my grandchildren, they look the same as they did five days ago. Even after a year, they do not seem to have grown much. Our growth in Christ is often very slow. But nevertheless, we all have to grow in all things into Christ the Head. Do not think that your combing of your hair is not a big issue. If you comb your hair this way, it proves that you love your beauty more than you love the Lord, and that you love the world more than you love the Lord. This will hinder your growth. If you would forget about the way you comb your hair, but would be satisfied with a hairdo that is merely proper and neat, this proves that you have yielded yourself to Christ. Hence, we have to grow in all things, big or small, into Christ the Head.<h2 class=head2>Until All the Saints Arrive at a Full-grown Man, at the Full Measure of the Stature of the Fullness of Christ</h2><p>Those brothers and sisters who have come from various localities should know that the growth of the church where they are depends on their growth. Whether or not they grow depends on whether or not they have Christ growing in them. If you give Christ the ground, He will grow in you. In this way, you will grow in Him. When you grow, the church in your place will also grow. This is the gradual growth of the organic Body of Christ in you. Hence, you have to allow Christ to grow in you, and you have to grow in Him, so that the church can grow in you. This is the growth of the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE GROWTH OF THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST BEING THE ORGANIC BUILDING OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>The church is the Body of Christ, and the growth of the Body is the building up of the Body. In simple terms, the growth is the building. The growth of the church is the building up of the church. While you are growing, you are being built up. If you would not grow, but would stay in the old way, this would be a tearing down for the church. In a church, as long as some of the brothers and sisters would grow, the church in that locality would be built up. Hence, growth is the key to building. When we all grow, the growth becomes the building up of the church.<h2 class=head2>Christ as the Resurrected and Ascended Head Producing the Gifted Persons through His Resurrection Life to Be the Gifts Given to the Church Produced by Him as His Body</h2><p>Christ ascended to the heavens. By His resurrection life, He made the saved sinners the gifts, such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers, and He gave them to the church for the building up of His Body.<h2 class=head2>These Gifts Given by Christ to the Church Perfecting the Saints for the Work of the Unique New Testament Ministry, Which Is the Building Up of the Body of Christ</h2><h2 class=head2>The Saints Perfected by the Gifts Building the Body of Christ Directly through the Organic Function of the Measure of Each One Part</h2><p>The Lord Jesus said that He would build His church. After He spoke this word, He did not build up the church directly by Himself. Rather, He gave a group of gifted persons perfected by Him, such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to the church. These gifted ones do not build up the church directly either. Instead, they first perfect the saints. The perfected saints then do the building work. The Bible shows us that every saint is a priest and should fulfill his priestly duty, which is to directly build up the Body of Christ. Those gifted ones should perfect the ones who do not have the gifts. When those without the gifts are perfected, together they can do the same work that the gifted ones can do. Hence, in the church everyone can do the work of the New Testament ministry, and everyone can directly build up the church.<h2 class=head2>The Gifted Ones Being the Joints of the Life Supply in the Organic Body of Christ, the Other Members Being the Different Parts in This Organic Body; the Two Coordinating to Build Up the Body of Christ Organically</h2><h2 class=head2>Through the Joints of the Life Supply, and through the Different Parts That Operate in Their Measures, the Body Being Made to Grow unto the Building Up of Itself</h2><p>Ephesians 4:16 says, &#8220;Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&#8217;&#8217; There are two kinds of members in the Body of Christ. The joints of supply are one kind. This refers particularly to the gifted persons. The other kind is the &#8220;each one part.&#8217;&#8217; This refers to every member in the Body. Every member in the Body of Christ has its measure through the growth in life and the development of its gift, and every member can function for the building up of the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ grows by itself through the supplying joints and the functioning parts. The growth of the Body of Christ is a matter of the increase of Christ in the church. The result is that the Body of Christ is built up by itself.<p>Perhaps you are not a supplying joint in the church, but nevertheless you are a part of the Body, and you should function according to your organic capacity. The Christianity way of worship services has killed the organic function of the Christians. Today, we can no longer take the old way of one speaking and all the rest listening. We need all the brothers and sisters to rise up to be the joints of supply and to function as the other parts. The more we function, the more we will be exercised, and the more we are exercised, the more we will be useful. In this way, the Body will grow and will be built up directly.<p>Thank the Lord and praise Him. The church is the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ is organic. There are the supplying joints, and there are the functioning parts. When the two are joined and linked together, the Body will grow. This growth will issue in the building up of the Body.<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Quezon City, Philippines, on March 24, 1989)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE ADVANCED RECOVERY OF THE LORD TODAY</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:7-12, 15-16; 1 Thes. 2:11; Acts 20:20, 27, 31</h1><p>In the past messages, we have seen Christ, and we have seen the church. We can replace these two terms with riches and fullness. For Christ, we have the riches, and for the church, we have the fullness. In this message, we will consider the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Here we are not speaking of the general recovery of the Lord. Rather, we are speaking of the present recovery of the Lord. This recovery is a further recovery, and it is an advanced recovery. Moreover, we are not talking about the past recovery of the Lord, but we are emphasizing the present, advanced recovery of the Lord.<h2 class=head1>THE COMPLETE REVELATION IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><p>The recovery of the Lord is a recovery of the truth that was in the Bible, but was subsequently lost. We all know that the New Testament is the complete revelation of the Lord in this age. In it are fully recorded both God&#8217;s New Testament economy and God&#8217;s plan in the New Testament as well. Its period covers the time from the coming of John the Baptist until the appearing of the New Jerusalem.<p>At the beginning of this period, there is the record of the Lord Jesus coming to work for God. He passed through all the sufferings of the human life. Afterwards, He was crucified on the cross to accomplish an all-inclusive death and to deal with all the negative things, persons, and events. Following this, He came out from the dead and entered into resurrection. In resurrection, He ascended to the heavens and received glory and honor. He was also enthroned to rule for God. In the end, He became the Ruler and the Savior exalted by God, and He poured out the Holy Spirit to all the believers, who receive power and authority to preach the gospel and to save sinners. Furthermore, He gave gifts for the building of the church. These gifts are the apostles whom He has perfected, who gather together the saved sinners and build them up into the churches in the various localities. When we add together all the different churches, we have the whole Body of Christ.<p>We have also seen that when this Body enjoys the riches of Christ, it becomes the fullness of Christ. This fullness is the expression of Christ, whereas Christ is the expression of the Triune God. Hence, the church is not only the expression of Christ; ultimately, it becomes the expression of the Triune God. The fullness of this Body and its expression are built up gradually, and it grows gradually as the Body of Christ until it reaches the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.<p>By that time, Christ will come again, and He will establish the millennial kingdom. On the one hand, He will be the reward to the overcoming saints. On the other hand, He will punish the saved though defeated Christians. In addition, He will perfect the Jews and the remnant from among the Gentiles on earth. After all these things are completed, the millennial kingdom will be over. Following this, the new heaven and the new earth will come, and the New Jerusalem will descend out of heaven from God. It will be the composition of the perfected saints and the perfected Jews. This New Jerusalem is simply the kingship and the priesthood. All who will be in the New Jerusalem will be kings and priests. On the one hand, they will serve God. On the other hand, they will reign for God. The perfected Gentiles will be the citizens in the new earth around the New Jerusalem. This will be the situation in eternity in the new heaven and the new earth. In this situation, the processed Triune God will be expressed for eternity. This is the complete revelation of the New Testament.<h2 class=head1>THE RECOVERY OF THE TRUTHS THROUGHOUT THE AGES</h2><p>Although these truths that the Lord has given us are in the New Testament, by the end of the apostolic age they had gradually been lost. The reason these truths were lost was that the church became degraded. This is why in Revelation chapters two and three the Lord Jesus called the overcomers. On the one hand, these overcomers lived an overcoming life. On the other hand, they recovered the lost truths. This overcoming and recovery began at the end of the first century even before the apostles passed away.<p>There was a famous church historian raised up among the British Brethren by the name of E. H. Broadbent who wrote a book called The Pilgrim Church. The outstanding feature of that book is its record of the recovery of the different items of the truths by the overcomers throughout the ages, beginning from the apostolic age until the end of the nineteenth century. Included in this record is Martin Luther, who is well known, who was an overcomer of the sixteenth century. He recovered the truth concerning justification by faith. By the seventeenth century, among the Catholics, the mystics who sought after the inner life were raised up. They were opposed to the deadness and coldness of the situation of the time. The leading figure in this group was Madame Guyon. These people were very good in the experience in life. But they were not clear concerning the church.<p>Following this, we come to the eighteenth century. The Lord raised up Brother Zinzendorf in Europe. Although he was comparatively clearer concerning the truth and practice of the church, he did not arrive at the ultimate mark. After another century, in the nineteenth century the Lord raised up a group of brothers in England, among whom were J. N. Darby and many other great teachers contemporary with him. They recovered the truth concerning the church quite thoroughly. In particular, they opened up the visions, types, and prophecies of the Bible. All these are important recoveries. The Brethren are typified by the Lord as the church in Philadelphia in Revelation 3.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S RECOVERY AMONG US</h2><p>Twenty or thirty years after the Brethren were raised up, they became degraded and divided again. This degradation has lasted until today. Around the beginning of the twentieth century, the Lord could not have a way with His recovery in the West any longer. He was forced to turn to China. He found one who became the leading one among us in releasing the truth. This was Brother Watchman Nee, whom many are familiar with. He was saved when he was seventeen years old. At the age of twenty-two, he began to speak for the Lord. During that year, the first meeting of the church in the Lord&#8217;s recovery in the Far East was raised up in his hometown in Foochow.<h2 class=head2>A Collection of the Riches of All the Ages</h2><p>Brother Nee received a good education in English. He also read a lot of books. After he was saved, not only did he love the Lord and pursue after the Bible, but he had frequent contacts with the Western missionaries, and he collected many classical writings in Christianity. What he collected were firstly the commentaries and expositions on the Bible and on faith by the famous writers and great teachers throughout the ages. This includes the so-called church fathers of the early ages. He also collected writings by Martin Luther, Madame Guyon, Father Fenelon, Zinzendorf, J. N. Darby, and many others. The writings of all these people were among his collection. Second, he also collected the biographies of many spiritual giants. Third, he collected many writings on church history. These books totaled more than three thousand volumes. He received tremendous help from these classical writings and saw much light. He made wide selections and references from these books, and he added to them his own light from his study of the Scripture, and he collected all these riches together to lead others in the practice of the church life.<h2 class=head2>Practicing the Church Life</h2><p>At the beginning, the way we carried out our service, the way we met, and the practice of the gospel preaching were done eighty percent according to the way of the Brethren in the nineteenth century. One notable example was the translation and compilation of a hymnal called &#8220;Hymns for the Little Flock.&#8217;&#8217; The Brethren saw at that time that the church should not have a special name on earth, in the same way that the moon is the same moon everywhere on earth. Whether in the Philippines or in America, there is only one moon. Although there are many countries on this earth, this does not mean that there are many moons. There is still one moon. When this moon is over Taipei, it becomes the moon in Taipei. When it is over Japan, it becomes the moon in Japan. Today, there may be hundreds and thousands of churches on earth, but there is only one universal church.<p>From the beginning, Brother Nee took the lead among us not to use any special name. Once there is a special name, there will be division. Today, the Assemblies of God, the Lutherans, the Baptists, and the Presbyterians all denominate their churches by different names. As a result, the church is divided into many pieces. This is like saying that there is a Holiness Moon, a Baptist Moon, a Presbyterian Moon, and a Lutheran Moon. This is a complete distortion of the truth, and we cannot follow this. Although we do not have any special name, in the practice of the church and in its content, we do have justification by faith, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, baptism, the presbytery, the laying on of hands, and many other items. We include all these items which we ought to have. For this reason, others could not give us a definite name. When they saw our &#8220;Hymns for the Little Flock,&#8217;&#8217; they began to call us &#8220;the Little Flock.&#8217;&#8217; This forced Brother Nee to make the declaration repeatedly that we are not the &#8220;Little Flock Church.&#8217;&#8217; The name &#8220;Little Flock&#8217;&#8217; is only the name of our hymnal; it is not our name.<h2 class=head2>The Advance and Furtherance of the Practice</h2><p>It was at this time that I came into the Lord&#8217;s work. That was around 1933 or 1934. We know that our practice was very much according to that of the Brethren at the beginning. But by 1933, Brother Nee began to consider some of the unsuitable and unscriptural conditions among the Brethren. In 1934, he published a book entitled The Assembly Life. In 1937, he put out another book entitled The Normal Christian Church Life. In these two books, he made many adjustments. From that time on, we have gradually recovered many new items.<p>By 1984, we have spread what we practice, believe, preach, and teach in the Lord&#8217;s recovery to all six continents throughout the earth. Before 1962, the Lord&#8217;s recovery among us was mainly confined to the Chinese-speaking world. It was not until 1962 when I began to work in America that I was led to do my best to have the English-speaking work. After the first year, we began to publish an English magazine called The Stream and also some English books. The first book was The All-inclusive Christ, and the second was The Economy of God.<p>After ten years, I began to conduct the Life-study Trainings in America. Every year we have two trainings, one in winter and one in summer. After twelve years, we finished the study of the whole New Testament. These trainings were carried out by me, first by preparing the text and the footnotes with the outlines, and then by releasing the messages according to what was prepared. In total, we conducted twenty-four of these trainings. Every training was for ten days, with thirty messages. In this way, there were over seven hundred messages. These messages were given in English, and they were translated and published in other languages as well. Through these publications, the Lord&#8217;s recovery spread everywhere over the whole earth. By 1984, there were over eight hundred churches all over the six continents of the earth. We can say that on every continent, there is the testimony of the Lord&#8217;s recovery.<h2 class=head1>THE LACK IN THE LORD&#8217;S RECOVERY TODAY</h2><p>After I had completed the Life-study of the New Testament in 1984, I began to observe the development of the churches in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. I found out that although the number of churches was large, the number of saints in the churches was not large enough. Although we preached the gospel, the result was short of what we expected. For example, when I left the church in Manila in the Philippines in 1962, there were about two hundred saints. Now after twenty-seven years, it has increased only up to five hundred saints or more. Obviously, the rate of increase is not high. This is the common problem among all the churches today.<h2 class=head2>In the Preaching of the Gospel</h2><p>In this fellowship, I want to prove to you one thing, that we come short in the matter of the preaching of the gospel. It is not enough for us to have so small an increase within so long a period of time. This warning sign tells us that we should all humble ourselves before the Lord and should ask for the Lord&#8217;s forgiveness.<h2 class=head2>In the Nourishing and Teaching of the New Ones</h2><p>At the same time, we saw that the prevailing lack among us is not only in the preaching of the gospel, but in the nourishing and care of people after salvation and in the further edification, teaching, perfecting, equipping, and spiritual supply of the saints as well. Although we say that all the saints are the priests and that there is no distinction between the clergy and the laity among us, the fact that we have not perfected the saints properly causes many saints to become incapable of serving. What we considered as church services were merely the miscellaneous affairs such as mopping the floors, cleaning the windows, arranging the chairs, and serving as ushers in the meetings. There are few who serve truly in the spiritual services as priests and who are able to teach the truth and to minister life. Many times, unavoidably there develops the taste of the clergy-laity system.<h2 class=head2>In the Perfecting of the Saints</h2><p>Ephesians 4 shows us that the goal for the perfecting of the saints is the work of the ministry unto the building up of the Body of Christ (v. 12). However, we must admit to the fact that we have not attained to this goal. The Bible reveals to us that whatever the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers can do, should be something that all the saints can also do. This is like starting a university; it is not enough only to invite famous speakers to speak to the students. There must be courses, and there must be an adequate number of professors. The students must also be divided into classes. The smaller the classes are, and the greater the number of professors there are, the better it will be. The professors need to teach the students personally. After four or five years, the students will graduate, and they will be able to do what the professors do. This is the only way to have a successful university.<p>The problem with the church today is that everyone comes only to listen to the famous speakers. This has gone on year after year. After thirty years, not many have been perfected. We should return to the practice revealed to us by the Scriptures: &#8220;And He Himself gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints&#8217;&#8217; (Eph. 4:11-12). Furthermore, we have to learn from Paul&#8217;s example of perfecting others. Not only did he travel to work, but he also remained in a place to perfect the brothers and sisters. For example, he remained in Ephesus for three years to teach publicly and from house to house, admonishing everyone night and day with tears, not shrinking back from declaring to them everything concerning the counsel of God, the apostles&#8217; teaching, and that which was profitable to them (Acts 20:20, 27). After the saints received this kind of perfecting, every one of them was able to do what Paul could do. This is the normal way.<p>Today, although the Body of Christ has not been built up yet, and the whole earth is still in a state of desolation, I believe that the Lord will surely recover what is recorded in Ephesians 4 and 1 Corinthians 14, so that every saint can become an apostle, a prophet, an evangelist, and a shepherd and teacher. This will surely come to pass in the advanced recovery of the Lord today. May the Lord be merciful to us.<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Quezon City, Philippines, on March 25, 1989)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE ADVANCED RECOVERY OF THE LORD TODAY</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:1, 39, 3-5, 12, 24-25, 31, 26</h1><h2 class=head1>THE GIFTED PERSONS BEING FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</h2><p>I believe today the Lord is recovering Ephesians 4:11-16. These six verses have never been completely opened to the saints throughout the ages. Although we have read them many times before, we were still not clear how the gifted persons could perfect the saints.<p>Beginning from 1984, I spent four and a half years to study this matter, and the Lord showed me that the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers given by the Lord are there to perfect others. It can be compared to a university. There are professors in the different departments who teach different subjects. At the beginning, the students may not be very well acquainted with their subjects. But after four or five years of instruction, all the students are perfected. The word &#8220;to be perfected&#8217;&#8217; in Greek means primarily to be equipped. It also includes the sense of supply and provision. The result of this kind of perfecting is that the students are able to do what the professors can do. We use this illustration to show how God perfects the saints through the gifts He gave.<h2 class=head1>THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS BEING IN THE HOME MEETINGS AND GROUP MEETINGS</h2><p>We know that God has not given many gifts. From the history of the church in the past, we can see that there have not been many apostles or prophets. In the same way, there have not been many shepherds and teachers. But there are many saved believers. For example, on the day of Pentecost there were at the most one hundred twenty of those who were the apostles, the prophets, and the evangelists. They all learned from the Lord Jesus and were taught by Him for three and a half years. We know that, first of all, the Lord Jesus perfected twelve disciples. Among them, four were fishermen. These four were two pairs of brothers. One pair was Peter and Andrew; the other pair was James and John. Originally, they knew only how to mend nets and catch fish; they knew nothing about saving men, preaching the gospel, or serving God. The Lord Jesus gathered them together. This is like the group meeting. They met with the Lord in group meetings for three and a half years, and they learned everything there. As a result, they came to know everything.<p>Some have asked me how to have a group meeting. I told them that the best example of the group meeting is found in what the Lord did in those three and a half years. We can say that for the three and a half years, He mainly established one group meeting. The nucleus of this group meeting had twelve brothers. Outside of this was a group of sisters with some other people. On the day of Pentecost, this group meeting already had one hundred twenty people. They were all perfected by the Lord Jesus during those three and a half years in that group meeting.<p>At Pentecost, three thousand people were saved in a short time. Prior to this, they never knew how to serve God or how to help the new believers. From that day on, they began to meet from house to house. Acts 2 tells us that daily they were in one accord, meeting from house to house (v. 46). These one hundred twenty who had been perfected began to lead the three thousand on in their homes. Among the ancient Jews, sometimes a few generations would live together under the same roof. If one person were to take care of five households, the one hundred twenty people could take care of at least six hundred households. Perhaps some were saved during the day in the temple. At night, they could begin to meet in their homes. This is the example of perfecting in the book of Acts.<p>After these three thousand were saved, it was not a matter that they only called special conferences. Rather, they met in one house after another. In their meetings, not only did they have the fellowship, the prayer, and the breaking of the bread, but they had the teaching of the truth and the preaching of the gospel as well. Hence, at that time, the function of the home meeting and the group meeting was all-inclusive. They practiced their church life in their homes. We should believe that they had group meetings daily and frequently in the believers&#8217; homes. Those who understood a little more would teach those who understood less. Those who had been taught by the Lord would lead on the ones who did not know much about God. This shows us that the perfecting of the saints in the church is carried out in the home meetings and the group meetings.<p>Paul said in Acts 20 that he lived in Ephesus for three years (v. 31). He personally taught and admonished the disciples publicly and from house to house (v. 20). He knew very well that it was not practical enough to have teaching and perfecting in large meetings. There was the need to go to the saved ones&#8217; homes and to have group meetings house by house. This is the only practical way of perfecting others. During the last few mornings, I have been speaking to you in public. In the afternoon, all of you went home. I did not at all have the assurance that you understood what I was speaking of. I did not know if my words had entered into you. Perhaps you have enjoyed very much listening to the words on the &#8220;riches&#8217;&#8217; and the &#8220;fullness&#8217;&#8217; while you were in the meetings, but after you went home, you forgot everything about the &#8220;riches&#8217;&#8217; and the &#8220;fullness.&#8217;&#8217;<p>I do wish that I could stay here for over three years. If that were the case, I could go from house to house to teach in your home. If you do not have the time in the morning, I could come in the afternoon. If you are busy in the daytime, I could come to you at night, or even at midnight. At any rate, I would get a chance to tell you how Christ&#8217;s riches can become your riches, and how these riches can become the fullness. If you do not understand these things, I would repeat them again and again until all of you understand and are enlightened by them. In this way, you would be perfected and equipped.<h2 class=head1>RECOVERING ALL BELIEVERS TO PROPHESY</h2><p>Not only do we need to be perfected, but we need to go on to practice prophesying also. By this, all the believers will be able to speak for the Lord. They will not be speaking their own words, but they will learn to speak forth the Lord and to deposit the riches of Christ into others. When these riches are experienced by man, they will become Christ&#8217;s fullness. This is the reality and the content of the church life. Today, this situation is generally lacking among the saints. In their meetings, for the most part they depend on one person to speak. This is not rich enough. Suppose all the brothers and sisters could prophesy, and all could present some riches. This would be like a love feast in the church, where everyone brings a dish. When everyone brings something, the love feast will surely be rich.<p>Hence, according to the Bible, the way to meet today is for everyone to speak. Not only should the brothers speak, but the sisters should speak as well. No one should come empty-handed. Everyone should supply Christ to others. This is the way for the church to be built up. If everyone comes empty-handed, the result will be a return to the old way, where one pastor is hired to speak to everyone. That kind of meeting week after week and year after year does not have much value to it.<p>For this reason, today there is the need to recover not only Ephesians 4, but 1 Corinthians 14 as well. During the past two thousand years, not many people have paid attention to these two passages. But this time when we studied them specifically, the Lord opened them up to us and showed us that if we really want to build up the church, we cannot depend on one speaker any longer. First, everyone has to practice Ephesians 4, perfecting the saints one by one in the home meetings and the group meetings. Next, in the meetings every saint should prophesy. They should all speak for the Lord and should all speak forth the Lord. In other words, everyone should exhibit the riches of Christ. Only then will the church be built up.<h2 class=head2>Prophesying Being the Most Excelling Gift</h2><p>Paul revealed to us in 1 Corinthians 14 that prophesying is the most excelling gift. All other gifts are secondary. Since to prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak the Lord into others, this gift is necessarily the highest and the most excelling one. The gift of tongues is the lowest of all gifts, because it does not build up the church. It is prophesying that will build up the church. At the same time, if we pursue after prophesying, we ourselves will also excel. This is why Paul exhorted us in 1 Corinthians 14:1 to desire prophesying. At the end of the chapter in verse 39, he said again: &#8220;So then, my brothers, desire earnestly the prophesying.&#8221;<h2 class=head2>Prophesying Being to Speak to Men Building Up, Encouragement, and Consolation for the Building Up of the Church</h2><p>When we speak to men building up, encouragement, and consolation, we are speaking the riches of Christ. When everyone speaks these things, the church will be built.<h2 class=head2>Every Believer Can and Should Prophesy</h2><p>If everyone prophesies one by one in the meeting, and an unbeliever comes to the meeting, he will be convicted by all and judged by all. The secrets of his heart will become manifest, and he will be able to humble himself before God (1 Cor. 14:24-25). Hence, in this kind of prophesying, everybody learns, and everybody can be encouraged (v. 31). In short, all the riches of Christ are released through the prophesying of every member of Christ. Some prophecies are for building up, and others are for encouragement or for consolation. Still others are for conviction, for judgment, and for the manifesting of the secrets of the heart. In the end, all will learn and all will be encouraged. The result is that all will be supplied and the church will be built up.<p>First Corinthians 14:26 says, &#8220;What then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.&#8221; This reveals to us that whenever we meet, everyone should &#8220;have&#8217;&#8217; something. Whatever each one has, he has to release it by his speaking. According to Ephesians 5, even our hymns are primarily not for singing, but for speaking. Verse 19 says: &#8220;Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&#8217;&#8217; We should treat the hymns in a very living way. Strictly speaking, while we are speaking to one another, there is much possibility that we will be prophesying. In addition, teaching and revelation are also prophesying. In the church meetings, if we can prophesy, we will be able to build up one another mutually.<h2 class=head2>The Condition for Prophesying-Every Morning Being Revived to Live Always in the Spirit</h2><p>Lastly, I want to speak concerning the qualification for prophesying. First, one must be a revived person. To have a revival once is not enough; every morning we need a revival. This is like the sun that rises once every twenty-four hours. Once the sun rises, we have morning, and we should rise with the rising of the sun. Proverbs says, &#8220;But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day&#8217;&#8217; (4:18). The book of Judges also says, &#8220;Let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might&#8217;&#8217; (5:31). This tells us that every day we should have a morning that rises up. The Lord also tells us in Lamentations that His mercies are new every morning (3:22-23). Hence, between the Lord and us, every morning there should be a new beginning and a new revival. When we are revived in the morning, we can live an overcoming life during the day. If we are revived daily and we are overcoming every day, we will be able to prophesy for the Lord.<p>Second, we need to live always in the spirit and to fellowship with the Lord, being filled and saturated with the Lord&#8217;s word, so that we can become one who is full of the Lord&#8217;s word. Furthermore, our spirit should always be ready to receive inspiration and revelation at any time. In addition, we should have spiritual discernment; we should not live in darkness and should not be blind or follow others indiscriminately. We need to discern all the situations and all the persons, events, and things that are around us. If you are such a discerning and enlightened person, wherever you go and whichever meeting you are in, you will be able to prophesy.<h2 class=head1>THREE CRUCIAL THINGS IN THE ADVANCED RECOVERY OF THE LORD TODAY</h2><h2 class=head2>Visiting People to Preach the Gospel</h2><p>Our old way of preaching the gospel cannot be said to be bad or wrong. However, it is not good enough. For example, when we go out to travel today, do we go by car or by mule-wagon? Although there is nothing wrong with riding on a mule-wagon, and although whatever way we take, we are traveling, this way is too restricted. No one would travel today on a mule-wagon instead of in a car. During the past four years, I have spoken about preaching the gospel by visiting people through knocking on their doors. Some think that, although we can preach the gospel by knocking on doors, we can also preach the gospel by ways other than knocking on doors. I have never said that if we do not knock on doors, we cannot preach the gospel. This would be like saying that if we do not ride in a car, we cannot travel. Nevertheless, there is a great difference between traveling by car and traveling on foot.<p>Which way is more effective, the old way of preaching the gospel, or the present way of visiting people by knocking on doors from house to house? According to our statistics, when we preach the gospel by knocking on doors, we can easily have one saved and baptized out of twenty doors. We do not need to go out to knock on doors every day. As long as we baptize one person a month, that will be enough. We do not need to knock on too many doors. Every one of you can do this. Today, people talk much about childbearing and birth control; with respect to the preaching of the gospel, we should pay attention to these matters.<h2 class=head2>Nourishing Others through the Home Meetings</h2><p>After we have baptized someone, we need to nourish him the next day. Once every two or three days after that, we need to continue going to him. At least we should visit him four times a month. The most important thing for a mother to do once a baby is born is to feed him. If the baby does not have milk for three or five days, he will starve to death. This was the problem among us in the past. The result is that not many people remained. Hence, we should have adequate care for the newly baptized ones.<p>Not only does a mother have to feed a newborn baby with milk, but she has to cherish him as well. When the baby is not comfortable and is crying, she has to rock him back and forth in her arms so that the child will feel comfortable. This is the cherishing. When a new one is saved, what follows is the care. Moreover, we must care for new ones in their homes rather than asking them to come to the meeting. This is the home meeting. Of course, the new ones cannot stay in their homes forever. After a while, they need to be brought to the group meetings and the church meetings.<h2 class=head2>Perfecting Others in the Group Meetings</h2><p>Let us now consider the group meetings. There is a big difference between a group meeting that is mechanical and one that is organic. A group meeting that is mechanical is one in which everyone comes to the meeting place one after another at the assigned date and time. The early ones are waiting there. The late ones also sit there watching the ceiling. Everyone is there waiting for someone to take the lead. Ten minutes ago, the time to start the meeting may have passed, but the meeting still has not begun. Reluctantly, a hymn is called, and a little reluctant prayer is offered up. After this, the leading one would ask everyone to read the Truth Lessons, paragraph by paragraph, one after another. This kind of group meeting is equivalent to a worship service. It is mechanical, and it is dead.<p>An organic group meeting should start from the morning revival. When we wake up, we should call, &#8220;O Lord Jesus.&#8217;&#8217; During the day, we should live in an overcoming way and should walk according to the spirit and live in fellowship with the Lord. In the evening after dinner, we should go to the group meeting nearby with singing and praising. Actually, the group meeting should have started with us already by that time. We may be the first one to arrive at the meeting. But we sing and pray just the same. When other brothers and sisters come, they will join in. After a while, a brother may come in and say, &#8220;Sorry, excuse me for the interruption. A brother just had a car accident. He is now in the hospital.&#8217;&#8217; We may then say, &#8220;Let us all pray.&#8217;&#8217; While we pray, another, a young sister, may come in and say, &#8220;Fortunately, the brother who had the accident was not seriously injured.&#8217;&#8217; When she brings us this news, we have more fellowship, and we turn to more prayer and thanksgiving for this brother. This is the group meeting. There is fellowship, prayer, and the mutual care.<p>Following this, a new one may ask a question, saying, &#8220;I was saved last week. I do not understand what the meaning of the anointing is.&#8217;&#8217; After this question is raised, there should be more than one who answer. Every attendant in the meeting can answer. A sister may first say, &#8220;I was saved recently also. To me, the anointing is the prompting of the Holy Spirit within us.&#8217;&#8217; Although this is only one sentence, there is teaching contained in this word. Another, a brother, may say, &#8220;The prompting of the Holy Spirit is an operation within us, and this operation is the anointing.&#8217;&#8217; After the first sister gives some teaching, a second brother adds on with something, and then another sister adds in something more. In this way, everyone speaks, and everyone teaches. All the attendants put in their little bit. After six or seven minutes, everyone has taught something, and the subject is clearly covered.<p>There may be some experienced brothers in the meeting. They may add a word lasting for a minute or more. This will give a clearer explanation to the matter of the anointing. Such a one may say, &#8220;This anointing oil is typified by the holy ointment in Exodus 30. It contains different kinds of ingredients. They typify the fact that in the Holy Spirit today there is the element of the Lord Jesus: the element of humanity, the element of death, and the element of resurrection. Today, through the operation of the Holy Spirit, all these rich elements are brought into us. As long as we would go along with the anointing, we can enjoy God, and we can enjoy the humanity of the Lord Jesus. The Lord&#8217;s death will work in us, and the Lord&#8217;s resurrection will strengthen us from within. In this way, we will receive all these rich elements into us. All these are the results of our obedience to the anointing.&#8217;&#8217; After this, another sister may ask, &#8220;Is this prompting of the Holy Spirit once for all, or does it happen again and again?&#8217;&#8217; Based on the principle we have discussed, everyone can answer and fellowship some more.<p>In the two questions mentioned, one has to do with the truth, and the other has to do with the experience of life. If we bring the new ones to this kind of group meeting, they will see how the saints fellowship, pray, and care for one another. At the same time, they will hear the truth and will be led further on to pursue life. If they do this week after week for fifty-two weeks in a year, they will spontaneously learn many things. At the same time, the care among the brothers and sisters will increase. After half a year, a new one can begin to attend the church meetings. When he sees the others prophesy in the meetings, he will also gradually learn to speak for the Lord. In another half a year, he will be able to speak even more. In this way, he will be fully perfected.<p>If the group meeting had fifteen people half a year ago, and now it has increased in number to twenty-nine, it can be divided into two group meetings. They should seek the Lord&#8217;s guidance for the way to go on. If all fifteen people within this group know each other well, and there are no new ones, they should go out to preach the gospel by knocking on doors. When they gain some new ones, they should all care for them together. Some new ones may eventually pass away, or move abroad, or relocate to another city, in which case the brothers and sisters should go out again to preach the gospel by visiting more people. In brief, every one of us should be caring for, helping, and perfecting three or four newly saved ones.<h2 class=head1>A CHRISTIAN CARING FOR BOTH LIFE AND THE GOSPEL</h2><p>What I have fellowshipped with you is the way that the Lord has shown us during the past four years. We see from John 15 that we are all branches of the vine (v. 5). The destiny of the branches is to bear fruit. No matter how much you say that you enjoy the Lord, if you do not bear fruit, there is something wrong. Moreover, if a branch does not bear fruit, it will be cut off. This does not refer to perdition, but to the loss of the rich enjoyment of Christ.<p>We know that the Christian life is two-sided. On the one hand, as a branch in the vine, a Christian should absorb the riches of the tree. On the other hand, as a branch he must bear fruit. The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain&#8217;&#8217; (v. 16). Hence, a Christian must match his gospel preaching with life, and he must also realize that life supplies us for the purpose of preaching the gospel. In this way, we will become balanced Christians.<p>Many times, when we pursue after life, we forget about the gospel. At other times, when we are zealous for the gospel, we neglect life. Both are wrong. We can never neglect the pursuit after life. But the pursuit after life should supply us to the extent that we will go forth to preach the gospel, to bear fruit, and to have the fruit remain. This means that not only do we need to preach the gospel, but we should have the nourishment and care in the home meetings, and we should bring the new ones to the group meetings for help and perfecting and also to the church meetings, so that this life can receive all the supply. This is the proper church life. By this, the church as the organic Body of Christ will be built up.<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Quezon City, Philippines, on March 25, 1989)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE ADVANCED RECOVERY OF THE LORD TODAY</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:12; Heb. 10:24-25; 1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 24, 31, 26</h1><p>The Bible compares Christians to sheep. Sheep are in flocks, and that is why in the Bible a flock refers to the church. Christians love to flock together, in the same way that sheep like to flock together. If one sheep strays off from the flock, it will suffer. When it returns to the flock, it will be at rest and be happy. This is the same with a saved person. After he is called out from the world, he will no longer want to flock together with the worldly people; he has a nature different from them already. When Christians come together, they feel at home, happy, and at rest.<h2 class=head1>THE CHRISTIAN MEETINGS ORDAINED BY THE SCRIPTURES</h2><p>Christians love to meet; hence, to them, meeting is an important thing. The church has been on this earth for two thousand years. Mainly it can be divided into two groups, the Roman Catholics and the Protestants. Outwardly speaking, their ways of meeting are very different, but in principle they are the same. Both worship according to the human natural feeling and need. These traditional and natural ways are different from the scripturally ordained way for Christians to meet.<p>The Bible says that God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit. The Christian meeting is not a service. It is a matter of exercising the spirit. Without the exercise of the spirit, there is no true worship to God. If anyone observes the Catholic or Protestant way of worship, however, he will realize that such worshippers do not seem to have a spirit and do not exercise their spirit. Instead, they worship according to the human natural feelings and needs. Even the cathedrals are designed and built to fit in with man&#8217;s sense of fear of God. When a person enters these places, he will become fearful. Because the believers enter the cathedrals only for the purpose of attending the services, the pastors, in meeting everyone&#8217;s need for worship, design a printed program, a form, and some regulations for the conducting of the services.<h2 class=head2>Worshipping God in Spirit</h2><p>Actually, the Bible has none of these things. When the Lord began His ministry at the age of thirty, He indicated to others that He was God. At that time there was a temple at Jerusalem, and the Jews thought that God was in the temple. Hence, they all went to the temple to worship God. The Lord Jesus also went to Jerusalem. At that time, was God in the temple or in the Lord Jesus? When men wanted to worship God, should they go to the temple or to the Lord Jesus?<p>If a man were to go into the temple, he would have seen the priests helping the Jews to slaughter bulls and lambs and offer them up as sacrifices to God. They were worshipping God according to tradition, and apparently they were very proper. At the same time, however, there was a group of people with the Lord Jesus, including tax collectors and prostitutes. They surrounded the Lord Jesus, and they spoke and laughed together with Him. Someone leaned on His breast, and another washed His feet. Some asked questions; others answered questions. There was no form and no regulation, but there was freedom and enjoyment.<p>In simple terms, there were two kinds of meetings. The first kind was very proper. The priests served according to their order and performed the ceremonies step by step. The second kind appeared confusing outwardly, but everyone was active, free, and comfortable. Both kinds of meetings are recorded in the four Gospels. Which one do you prefer?<p>We see from the Bible that God is Spirit, and that those who worship Him must worship in spirit. The Christian meeting itself is a worship of God. When we come together, we come to worship God and to enjoy Him and for God to be satisfied. At the same time, we receive His love and enjoy His grace. We are also enlightened and taught by Him, and we receive His word. This is the reason and the goal for us Christians to flock together.<p>Hence, the emphasis is not on the form, but on the organ that we use; are we using our spirit, or are we using our mind? Do we use the natural mind that has been affected by tradition, or do we put the mind aside, deny our own judgment, and worship only in spirit? What God wants is for us to worship in spirit. This is the first consideration.<h2 class=head2>Receiving God&#8217;s Speaking</h2><p>Second, the Christian meeting is not only for us to enjoy God and for God to enjoy us, but it is a time for us to be taught of God. The Bible shows us that the greatest thing between God and us is that God speaks to us. If God does not speak to us, that means that God has rejected us. If God is present with us, He will prove His presence by His speaking.<p>God is a speaking God, but sometimes He is silent. His silence is very meaningful. Even His silence is a kind of speaking. The principle is that whenever we come to God, He always speaks to us. His grace, love, and peace, all come to us through His speaking. For this reason, whenever we come together, we should exercise our spirit to contact God and to wait for Him to speak to us.<p>In the Old Testament, God rarely spoke directly. For the most part, He spoke through different men. Hebrews 1 says that God spoke of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets (v. 1). In the New Testament, He spoke to us in His Son. In Acts and the Epistles, He spoke through the apostles. Paul said that he spoke as if he did not have the Lord&#8217;s word and was speaking only according to his opinion, but in the end he also said that he thought he also had the Spirit of God (1 Cor. 7:25, 40). Hence, his words were recorded in the Bible and became the word of God. This is God speaking to us through men.<p>Every time we Christians meet, we worship God and offer up our aspirations and adorations. This is for God&#8217;s satisfaction. At the same time, we receive grace and supply from God. This is for our enjoyment. Everything that comes from God comes through the word, but God does not give His words to us directly. Rather, He speaks to us through men.<h2 class=head1>THE CHRISTIAN MEETING BEING FULLY A MATTER OF SPEAKING</h2><p>The Christian meeting is fully a matter of speaking. This kind of speaking goes both ways, back and forth. As soon as you come to the meeting, you should open your mouth to speak, sing, praise, give thanks, and pray. This is towards God. On the other hand, you have to speak for God. In this way, God&#8217;s grace and riches will enter into others through your speaking. When we speak to God, we are giving ourselves to God. When we speak for God, we are allowing God to give Himself to us. The Christian meeting is nothing but a speaking to God and a speaking for God. Everyone can speak to God, and everyone can speak for God.<h2 class=head1>GROUP MEETINGS OF MUTUALITY</h2><p>There are many kinds of Christian meetings. The most important among them are two, the group meeting and the district meeting. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He met with the disciples for three and a half years. Sometimes these meetings were in one person&#8217;s home; sometimes they were in another person&#8217;s home. Sometimes they were held at the seaside, and sometimes they were held on the mountain. All these meetings were group meetings. The real church life and the service take place in the group meetings. This is the clear revelation of the Bible. In Matthew 18:20 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.&#8217;&#8217; The gathering together of two or three is surely a group meeting, for the number is obviously not large. Here we see that the meeting is in the Lord&#8217;s name only.<p>By Hebrews 10, we see something more: &#8220;And let us consider one another as to how we might incite one another to love and good works, not abandoning our own assembling together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another&#8217;&#8217; (vv. 24-25). Here it speaks of considering one another, inciting to love, and exhorting one another. The meeting with one speaking and all the others listening cannot be mutual. According to our experience, to have a meeting with mutuality is not easy if the number is over twenty. Hebrews 10:24-25 is a very good window. It shows us that the main kind of meeting for the early Christians was the group meeting. Verse 25 says: &#8220;Not abandoning our own assembling together.&#8217;&#8217; The Christian meeting at the apostolic time was a mutual meeting; it was something for the believers themselves. Hence, this kind of meeting could not have been large. Instead, there must have been group meetings.<p>Formerly, we did not see the group meeting as clearly as we do now. Whether or not a church is a strong one depends on its group meetings; if the group meetings are strong, the church will surely be strong. This is like an army; whether or not an army can fight depends on its training at the basic unit level. If the units are trained properly, the army will fight well.<p>In Quezon City, Philippines, we have three hundred brothers and sisters attending the Lord&#8217;s Day morning meeting. However, the big meeting can only release some general truths; it cannot meet the special needs of the saints, and it cannot solve the problems of the saints. It is also difficult to know the condition of the individual saints or to care for one another mutually in this meeting. Suppose we divide the three hundred brothers and sisters in the church in Quezon City into twenty groups, and have the fifteen or sixteen saints within each group meet at least once a week. There will be no restriction in time, and there can be free talk among themselves. This will bring in the fellowship, and the fellowship will bring in the intercession. Spontaneously, there will be the mutuality.<p>Perhaps a newly saved one would bring up a question concerning the truth. Everyone should then speak a few simple words according to what he has learned. At the end, a more mature one can say a little more. In this way, within a few minutes the dozen or more brothers and sisters attending the meeting will be able to participate in the teaching of the truth. Everyone will be able to speak for God. Through this speaking, grace and supply will come. Not only will the one that asks the question receive the help, but all the attendants will receive the help also.<p>When we wrote the Truth Lessons, it was not our intention for all the churches to have another meeting and to teach them in the way of another worship service. Rather, our hope was that the brothers and sisters would read them at home first. As long as anyone reads, he will get something. It is possible that he may come across something that he does not understand. In that case, he should simply read it one more time. If he reads a few more times, he will understand. For those places that he really cannot understand, he can make a note. When he comes to the group meeting, he can bring out that point and have some mutual answering and learning. Those who understand may teach those who do not understand, and at the end the experienced ones can teach more. If we teach the truth in this way, after a year, by the end of fifty-two weeks, we will have heard all kinds of truths, and the church life will be filled with a spirit of learning.<p>If the new ones ask questions concerning life, the principle is the same. Everyone learns, and everyone teaches. Everyone asks, and everyone answers. This kind of group meeting will be living and rich. There will not be any printed program, form, or regulations. Everyone will follow the spirit, and everyone will exercise their spirit to speak to God, to speak for God, to receive God&#8217;s grace, or to transmit God&#8217;s grace to others. In this way, there will be fellowship, mutual intercession, exhortations, and mutual care. This is the group meeting.<p>In these twenty groups, all the three hundred saints in the whole church will be cared for in every way. This is the result of my study of sixty years. I look to the Lord that all the churches in the Philippines would pick up this practice, and that the churches in all the localities would bring the saints on in this new way.<p>After we have gained some people through door-knocking, immediately we need to go to their homes to nourish them. This nourishing in their homes is the home meeting. At the same time, we have to bring them to the group meetings. In the group meeting, there is the mutual care and perfecting. This will then be the fulfillment of the word concerning the perfecting of the saints in Ephesians 4:12. They will be like the gifted ones, fulfilling the work of the New Testament ministry unto the building up of the Body of Christ. After half a year, these ones will be perfected, and some new ones will be added through the gospel preaching. By that time, another group meeting can be formed. During the second half of the year, the two groups will do exactly the same things: on the one hand, they will preach the gospel to gain new ones; on the other hand, they will nourish the new ones by meeting in their homes. The new ones will also be introduced to the group meetings, where they will be cared for and perfected.<p>There is one thing that we should take note of: we should not knock on doors too much; otherwise, we will not be able to raise the new ones up. In your hand, you should always have three or four new ones under your care. If some move away, you have to make up the number by preaching the gospel.<h2 class=head1>EVERYONE PROPHESYING IN THE DISTRICT MEETING</h2><p>The preaching of the gospel, the home meetings, and the group meetings are all conducted during the week. On the Lord&#8217;s Day, we should bring the new ones to the district meetings. A church can be divided into a few districts. The best number for the district meeting is around fifty. When we gain some new ones through the gospel, we should nourish and establish them in the home meetings. We should also care for them and perfect them in the group meetings. In this way, when they come to the church meetings, every one of them will be able to prophesy.<p>In order for the saints to prophesy, they need to enjoy the Lord&#8217;s word every day and be filled with the Lord&#8217;s word. Every district can select its own portion of Scripture. Every week the saints can go through one chapter, and they can divide the chapter into six sections. Every morning the saints can read one section and pick out two verses for pray-reading. If we want to have an overcoming church life, we need to live this life of morning revival. For this reason, we must help the brothers and sisters to live this life of revival and overcoming every day. Every morning we need to have some enjoyment, and every morning we need to soak ourselves in the Lord&#8217;s word and be filled and saturated by the Lord&#8217;s word. After six days, we will surely have a rich reaping. By the weekend, we can compile our inspirations into a composition for prophesying. On the Lord&#8217;s Day, we can bring this composition to the meeting. We should not read or recite it, but should speak out with our spirit what we have prepared. This is to prophesy.<p>In a meeting with fifty saints, at least half of them should be prepared beforehand. Everyone should be limited to three minutes of speaking, and everyone should take turns speaking. There should not be any prearranged order, but the speaking should be done in a spontaneous way. This kind of speaking in the district meeting will be very rich. We can prophesy this way week after week for fifty-two weeks in a year. The supply of the Lord&#8217;s word will then be rich among us. When everyone is supplied and edified, the problems and difficulties of the saints will be solved spontaneously through the supply of the rich word, and the church will be built up. This is the way that the Lord has shown us today.<p>The Lord&#8217;s recovery today is the recovery of the saints in the building up of the Body of Christ. For this reason, there is the need for every saint to be able to prophesy, so that the church can be built up in a genuine way. First Corinthians 14:31 says that we can all prophesy one by one. Verses 24 and 25 say that if we all prophesy, and if an unbeliever or one unlearned comes, he will be convicted by all and will be judged by all. The secrets of his heart will become manifest, and he will admit that God is really among us. Hence, for everyone to prophesy unto the building up of the Body of Christ is the proper way revealed in the Scriptures. Thank and praise the Lord! I hope that the Lord would bless all the churches in the Philippines according to this new way.<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Quezon City, Philippines, on March 26, 1989)</body></html>
