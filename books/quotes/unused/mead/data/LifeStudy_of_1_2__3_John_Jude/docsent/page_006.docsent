   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Inoculating the Believers against All Heretical</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Doctrines concerning God and Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John s writings not only are all-inclusive concerning the Person of Christ and polemical against heresy, but they also inoculate the believers against all heretical doctrines philosophies concerning God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such writings were needed not only for the first century but have also been needed throughout all the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even today in the twentieth century, we still need them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the coming days they will still be a great help in keeping the truth concerning the Person of Christ and in preserving His believers in all the divine realities.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We hope that these Life-studies may serve the same purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not see the revelation of the divine things contained in John s writings, we cannot be complete, mysterious, all-inclusive, or polemical.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, we shall not be properly inoculated against heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if we see this revelation, we shall be mysterious, all-inclusive, and polemical, and we shall be inoculated against all heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here I would like to point out that the Trinity of the Godhead is revealed more fully in the Gospel of John than any other place in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We know from the Gospel of John that Christ was the very God in eternity John 1:1 and that He became a man in time John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His deity is complete, and His humanity is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, He is both God and man John 20:28; 19:5 , possessing both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a man He was anointed by God with the Spirit John 1:32-33; Matt 3:16 to accomplish God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, He is the Christ, the anointed One John 20:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is the Son of God John 20:31 , who is the image of God Col 1:15 , the effulgence of God s glory and the express image of His substance Heb 1:3 , subsisting in the form of God and equal with God Phil 2:6; John 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the Son of God He came in the flesh with Gk., para, from with the Father John 6:46 and in the name of the Father John 5:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, He is called the Father Isa 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was with God, and He was God in eternity past John 1:1-2 , not only coexisting but also coinhering with the Father all the time John 14:10a, 11a; 17:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even while He was in the flesh on the earth, the Father was with Him John 16:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, Christ was one with the Father John 10:30 , working in the Father s name and with the Father John 10:25; 14:10b , doing the Father s will John 6:38; 5:30 , speaking the Father s word John 3:34a; 14:24 , seeking the Father s glory John 7:18 , and expressing the Father John 14:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the eternal God, Christ is the Creator of all things John 1:3 , and as a man who came in the flesh 1 John 4:2 with the physical blood and flesh Heb 2:14 , He is a creature, the Firstborn of all creation Col 1:15b .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, He is both the Creator and the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the Sender and the Giver of the Spirit John 15:26; 16:7; 3:34b , whom the Father sent in His name the Son s name, John 14:26 , the Son, being the last Adam in the flesh, became the life-giving Spirit through death and resurrection 1 Cor 15:45b; John 14:16-20 , who received all that is of the Son John 16:14-15 to testify concerning the Son and glorify the Son John 15:26; 16:14 , and who is the breath of the Son John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, He is also the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 to abide coexistingly and coinheringly with the Son and the Father in the believers John 14:17, 23 to be the Triune God who is Spirit John 4:24 mingled with the believers as one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 in their spirit Rom 8:16; 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually, He became the seven Spirits of God Rev 1:4; 4:5 , who are the seven eyes of the Son, the Lamb Rev 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I believe that many of these points will be puzzling to those who hold to traditional systematic theology.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, how can the seven Spirits, who are the Spirit of God, be the seven eyes of the Son, the Second of the Godhead?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are regarded as separate persons, how can the Third of the Godhead be the eyes of the Second?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, in the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus said that He came in the Father s name.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the reason that, according to Isaiah 9:6, His name is called the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the Lord Jesus came, He also came with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Have you ever thought that when the Lord Jesus came down from the heavens, He came with the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some Christians may have the concept that when He came, He left the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when the Lord Jesus came, the Father came also.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Moreover, the Lord said that He came to work in the Father s name.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Who, then, was the One working, the Son or the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the Gospel of John, the Son came in the Father s name, He came with the Father, He came to work in the name of the Father, and He came to work with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Son did not do anything of His own will.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead, He did the will of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Likewise, He did not speak anything from Himself, but He spoke the Father s word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He also sought the Father s glory and expressed the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Son in John s Gospel is both the Sender and the Giver of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But, eventually, He Himself became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This Spirit is the seven Spirits of God, the seven eyes of the Lamb, the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It certainly was foolish of Philip to say, Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us John 14:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To this request, the Lord Jesus replied, Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father v. 9 . Because the Lord Jesus came in the Father s name and with the Father, worked in the name of the Father and with the Father, did the Father s will, spoke the Father s word, sought the Father s glory, and expressed the Father, to see the Son was to see the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we see the revelation of the Trinity in the writings of John, we shall certainly become polemical.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those who are polemical cannot be political.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, even though we should be polemical in our fight for the truth, we still need to speak with others in a proper way.</S>
