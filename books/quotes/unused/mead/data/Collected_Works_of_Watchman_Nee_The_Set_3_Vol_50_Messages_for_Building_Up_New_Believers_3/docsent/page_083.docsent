   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. Two Fundamental Sins Fornication</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Eating of Sacrifices Offered to Idols</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What does this woman do?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Revelation 2:20 says, "But I have something against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jezebel has two chief sins: One is fornication, and the other is eating sacrifices offered to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These two are sins that are worthy of excommunication.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord rebuked the teachings of Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verses 21 through 23 say, "And I gave her time that she might repent, and she is not willing to repent of her fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her, into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works; and her children I will kill with death; and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the inward parts and the hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your works."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church in Thyatira and the teachings of Jezebel have two characteristics: One is fornication, and the other is idol worship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Bible fornication means mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For a man to be in a mixture means that he is involved in fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here we see that the Roman Catholic Church is mixed up with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Mary in Place of the Goddess of Greece</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every religion of the world has its goddess.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Buddhism has Kuan Yin, and the Greeks worship Venus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Romans took this practice from the Greeks and worshipped goddesses.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They could not find a goddess in Christianity, so they took the virgin Mary to be their goddess.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In name they called her Mary, but in actuality she was treated like the Greek goddess.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is fornication and mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Sun Festival Becoming Christmas</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many Romans worshipped the sun and celebrated the birthday of the sun on December 25 every year.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>December 22 is the shortest day of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After December 22, days begin to grow longer and nights become shorter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The sun worshippers regarded December 25 as the birthday of the sun, and they had a great festival.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After many of them were converted, they came up with an idea when they saw their unbelieving friends celebrating the festival with great alacrity, while they had no celebration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They claimed that the Lord Jesus was the true sun and that December 25 should be the birthday of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Consequently, they made this day Christmas Day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The only thing that is Christian about Christmas is the use of Christ's name in its name.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In fact, it belongs to the sun religion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Please bear in mind that this is fornication before God; it is a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The worship of the sun is mixed up with Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Heathen Temple Becoming the Temple of God</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church is the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Old Testament the temple of God was built partly with wood and mostly with stone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the New Testament age God allowed the temple to be destroyed, not leaving one stone upon another.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Where is the temple today?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All those who believe in the Lord today are the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yet today the Roman Catholic Church has built tall and imposing buildings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Greeks were skillful at fine architecture.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Romans continued the Greek tradition and devoted much time to the study of architecture.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They were also very good at artistic edifices.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They felt that all the gods had their own temple, and Christianity had nothing for the eyes to admire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They forsook the teaching of the apostles and built big and handsome buildings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No other edifices in the world can be compared to the cathedrals of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Men call these cathedrals the temples of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The cathedrals in Milan, St. Paul's Cathedral in Rome, and Notre Dame in Paris are all high buildings that men call temples of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Please bear in mind that this thought is pagan in its source.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Men turned the pagan temples into temples of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They consider these buildings as Christian buildings, but in fact they are pagan edifices.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christianity has committed fornication and has followed after pagan people.</S>
