   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION NINE CONCERNING THE RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF GOD AND CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Are we saved by the righteousness of God Rom 3:21-26 or by the righteousness of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the meaning of each, and what is the difference between them?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is the righteousness of God which saves us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is the righteousness of God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 3:25 and 26 say, "Whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred, with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The propitiation place is on the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is here that God meets with men.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God has set forth Jesus to be the propitiation place; therefore, He can contact man only through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If there were no propitiation place on the ark, the law in the ark would condemn man's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But with the blood on the propitiation place, the law cannot condemn man's sin, because the requirements of the law have been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this, God's righteousness is demonstrated, which means that God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the law, whoever sins must die.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But since the Lord Jesus died for you, you do not need to die.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, forgiveness is granted by God according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose someone owes you one hundred dollars and gives you a promissory note.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When he returns the one hundred dollars, you should return the promissory note to him in order to cancel the debt.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you did not return the note and continued to demand payment from him, you would be an unrighteous person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You have sinned, and you deserve to die.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But you applied the blood of Christ to repay your debt of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>So now God can ask nothing further from you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You are now forgiven because of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regardless of the circumstances, God must forgive you because the Lord Jesus has died for you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Faithful" refers to God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whatever God says will stand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Righteous" refers to the fact that the work done by Christ is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since Christ has satisfied God's requirement for us, God can no longer require anything from us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's Word says that he who believes will be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we believe, God must forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since Christ has died, God's requirements have been met, and God must forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Both God's forbearance of the sins committed by men in the past and His justification of those who believe at present manifest that He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God not only justifies us, He also wants us to regard Him as righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In other words, He wants us to realize that He is very righteous in the way He treats us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jesus is a man just as we also are men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As sin entered into the world by one man, it is also taken away by one man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The sin of Adam was not just one individual's problem; it became the problem of all mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Adam is the head, and we are all a part of him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The same is true with being in Christ; when Christ died, we also died, and when Christ resurrected, life flowed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not need to pitifully beg God to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since Christ has died for us, God must forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we believe, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the entire New Testament, we cannot find one verse which says that Christ's righteousness saves us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ's righteousness only gives Him the proper qualification to be the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His righteousness refers to His own good conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He saves us by His death, not by His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His death fulfills the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His righteousness is like the veil in the tabernacle made of four different colors.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He alone can come and appear before God; all others are kept outside the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only when the veil was rent when Christ died was a new and living way opened, and only then could we draw near to God Heb 10:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How then do we explain 1 Corinthians 1:30: "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption"; and 1 Peter 3:18: "the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous"?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to ask whether these two verses both refer to Christ's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No, they do not.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>First Corinthians 1 says that Christ Himself became our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First Peter 3 says that the Lord Jesus Himself is righteous; He is qualified to be a substitute for us who are unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Regarding 2 Peter 1:1, "Simon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have been allotted faith equally precious as ours in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"Righteousness" here can also be translated as "fairness" or "justice."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that He is not a respecter of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He has given the same precious faith to all, to those believers who have come first or come last, and to both the Jews and the Gentiles cf.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Acts 10:34, 44; 15:8-9 .</S>
