THE LIFE OF GOD</h2><p>Firstly, this indestructible life is the life of God. This term, &ldquo;the life of God,&rdquo; is used only once in the entire Bible, in Ephesians 4:18, which says, &ldquo;Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart.&rdquo; While the unbelievers are alienated, cut off, from the life of God, we are attached, joined to it, for God has pledged His life into our being. The English word for this is articulated, meaning that a member of the body is pledged to another member. The hand, for example, is articulated to the arm. This is not merely a positional matter but a matter of life. Since the life of God has been articulated into our being, we are no longer alienated from God&rsquo;s life. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; It is not a small thing that God&rsquo;s life has pledged itself into our being. I believe that the Lord will develop this more and more in the church life in the coming years. We must forget all the human teachings that say we need good ethics and behavior and focus on what we really need&mdash;the life of God.</p><p>This life is the divine life. Tell me, are you a human being or a divine being? The way to answer this question is to say, &ldquo;Undoubtedly, I am a human being, but I am a human being with the divine life.&rdquo; We should make a declaration to all the angels: &ldquo;Angels, don&rsquo;t you know that I have the divine life? Angels, you don&rsquo;t have the divine life, but I do. I have the life of your Creator.&rdquo; We have the divine life!</p><p>Nothing is better than life. In the whole universe the best item is life. If you were to take life away from the earth, this planet would be a desolation. The loveliness, pleasantness, and beauty of the earth all come out of one thing&mdash;life. If there were no life on earth, this planet would be meaningless. Today we have the highest life, not the vegetable life, the animal life, the angelic life, or even just the human life&mdash;we have the divine life! If we saw this, we would be beside ourselves with joy and praise.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE ETERNAL LIFE</h2><p>The indestructible life is also the eternal life (John 3:16). What does the term eternal mean? A number of times the King James Version says everlasting life instead of eternal life, but this translation misses the mark. Eternal life is not just everlasting life, although the matter of everlastingness is included in it. Eternal life is a super life, a life without beginning or end, a life without the limitations of time and space. Eternal life is so high that it is beyond description; it far transcends our understanding. The divine priesthood of Christ is constituted with such a life as this.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE UNCREATED LIFE</h2><p>This indestructible life is the uncreated life (John 1:4). Every kind of life, from the angelic life to the vegetable life, is a created life. Only the indestructible life is uncreated. Although it is uncreated, it is creating. This life is always creating something positive in our church life, family life, and Christian life. Day by day we may enjoy this creating, yet uncreated, life. This is our life today.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE LIFE WHICH IS CHRIST HIMSELF</h2><p>This indestructible life is just Christ Himself (John 14:6a; 1 John 5:12; Col. 3:4a). Anything less than Christ, who is God Himself, is not the indestructible life. The indestructible life not only has functions and abilities&mdash;it has a wonderful Person. We need to experience this life day after day.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE LIFE WHICH HAS BEEN TESTED<br />IN CHRIST&rsquo;S HUMAN LIVING</h2><p>The indestructible life has been tested in Christ&rsquo;s human living (John 18:38; 19:4, 6). This life was tested during Christ&rsquo;s thirty-three and a half years on earth. At the end of the Lord&rsquo;s earthly life, Pilate, a governor of the Roman Empire, made the last three tests, and at the end of every test he declared, &ldquo;I find no fault in this man.&rdquo; Can you find another person concerning whom your conscience can say that he has no fault? Although my dear wife loves me very much, she would have to admit that she has found fault with me. I believe that every wife has found fault with her husband. Although none of us can stand the test, the Lord Jesus withstood every test. The kind of life that we have today is a life that has passed through every test. This life is perfect.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_115.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_117.html">Next</a> </body></html>
