<h2 class="head2">Lacking in Root</h2><p>The second reason that the word withers away is the lack of root. What are roots? The section of a tree that is above the ground is the trunk, and the section that is hidden under the ground is the root. The visible life-section is the branches; the invisible life-section is the root. Therefore, the root represents the hidden life. Those who are rootless in the Lord live a dry life. Those who have no hidden spiritual life, except that which is manifest before men, have no root. The root is the hidden, invisible part. What is exposed and visible is not the root. Brothers and sisters, we should ask ourselves: Besides the part of our life which is visible before men, how much hidden life do we have before the Lord? If all that we have is that which is exposed, it is no wonder that we wither away as soon as the sun comes and scorches us. In our spiritual life nothing sustains us like the hidden life. If we see a brother or sister falling away, do not regard the fall as an accidental or sudden occurrence. Instead, we should realize that there must be something wrong with his hidden life before God. Since he has no root, he falls when the sun rises to scorch him.</p><p>In Matthew 6:6 the Lord Jesus said, "But you, when you pray, enter into your private room, and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you." To shut the door is to have a hidden life, and this is to have roots. The Lord spoke in a very peculiar way: The Father will see in secret. Oh, praying can be seen! We think that praying is heard, but the Lord said that it is seen. Sometimes when we are before the Lord, we have no words; there is only an attitude&mdash;this is precious also. Brothers and sisters, what proportion of our life is seen by God in secret? Is all that we have apparent before men? How much of our spiritual life before God has never been divulged? How much experience do we have which is comparable to what Paul kept secret from other people for fourteen years (2 Cor. 12:2)? If we have none, it indicates that we have no root. If we are persons without root, we will immediately fall away when the sun comes up to scorch us. Brothers and sisters, only the part of us which can survive the test of trials is reliable. If our roots are not deep enough, we are bound to fail.</p><h2 class="head2">The Rocky Place</h2><p>The third reason that the word withers away is that there are rocks underneath the shallow earth. A person with shallow earth may be willing to send his roots deep, but rocks may obstruct them. Outwardly, he is the same as other people, but within him there are hidden sins and a hardened self. In the Bible the word rock has several meanings&mdash;one relates to a stony heart (Ezek. 36:26). If we wish to send our spiritual roots deep, we should not harden our hearts (Heb. 3:8). Many Christians have never experienced the breaking of their concepts and have never been broken. They give many reasons to reject God's will and insist on their own views. They always have opinions as to whether something should be done this way or that way. They have rocks within, and their hearts are very hard. God has to blast these inner rocks away before they can strike their roots. There is only one kind of people who can strike roots: those who tremble at the word of the Lord (Isa. 66:5). Brothers and sisters, a heart that is not submissive to God is a stony heart. We should ask God to enlighten us and show us how big the rocks within us are. If we have rocks inside, we cannot strike roots, and when the sun comes up and scorches, how can we escape from withering away?</p><p>Rocks not only stand for a hardened heart but also for hidden sins. Perhaps there is a particular sin in your life which you have not given up because the price is too high, and you do not have the courage to deal with it. Perhaps God's demand is strong; consequently, you reason and argue with God because you cannot obey. If you allow your hidden sins to remain, you cannot strike roots. When the sun comes up and scorches, how can you escape from withering away?</p>
