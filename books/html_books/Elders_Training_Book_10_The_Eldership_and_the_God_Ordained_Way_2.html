Lord, we thank You for Your abundant grace, which is so sufficient for us. We thank You for Your dear presence, which meets all of our needs. We also thank You for Your constant patience. Lord, we thank You for Your anointing, the holy ointment, the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, which is always anointing us. We thank You for Your Word, which is a rich and uplifted provision to us. We thank You for Your riches which You have given us in the past years and for all Your divine, holy, and spiritual provisions which we have experienced. Lord, we thank You that in Your sovereignty we are here and are gathered here into Your dear and precious name. Lord, we thank You for Your constant word, Your instant word, and Your repeated word. We thank You that You have not left us in darkness and that we are now in the light. Thank You for the light which follows us and shines within us, above us, and through us. Lord, we thank You for all these provisions, and we trust in You Yourself.</P><P>Lord, forgive us and cleanse us again. We thank You for Your precious blood, which cleanses us all the time. Lord, cleanse our conscience and our sensation. Cleanse us in every way that we may have a thorough fellowship with You and with one another. We do not agree that Your time would be wasted, so we pray that every minute will be under a proper and thorough fellowship with You. Give us the openness, the liberty, the freedom, and Your leading. Lord, we need You. You are our satisfaction. Lord, we cannot do or say anything apart from You in the way of doing something for You. We are simply here, open before You, waiting on You. We believe that in the short time we have together, You can do many things among us. Lord, we put this time into Your hands. Lord, break it, bless it, and make it an endless blessing.</P><P>Lord, defeat the enemy. We can never forget the devil, Satan, the slanderer, the accuser. Lord, we accuse him before You. As we touch Your throne, we look unto You&#151;nothing could turn us away from You. But Lord, You have to look at the evil one. He is Your enemy, and he is also our enemy. We hate him. We believe that all the negative things have come out of him. Lord, put him to shame. His place is not in the church, but in the lake of fire. He has been defeated, and the lake of fire is his place. We just condemn him by declaring and claiming the victory You have won on the cross. Hallelujah for the cross of Calvary! Lord, You have encountered him on the cross, and You have shamed him all these years. Shame him again today. Lord, the victory is Yours, and we enjoy the blessing. Thank You, Lord Jesus. We worship You as we worship the Father. We worship the divine Trinity in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TURMOIL AMONG THE CHILDREN OF GOD</H2><P>Now I would like to point out to you the turmoils among the children of God in both the Old Testament and the New Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Turmoil among the Children of Israel<br>in the Old Testament,<br>as Recorded in the Book of Numbers</H2><P>Immediately after the children of Israel were formed into a nation through the building up of the tabernacle and the raising up of the priesthood with its service for their worship of God, that is, after their theocratic government was established, they began to journey in the wilderness (Num. 10:12-13). After only three days (v. 33) they had their first occasion of turmoil, in Taberah, where the children of Israel were murmuring evil (11:1-3). After this murmuring, the mixed multitude lusted exceedingly for flesh to eat (v. 4). Later, Miriam and Aaron, Moses' elder sister and brother, rebelled by speaking against Moses because he had married a Cushite woman (12:1-15). Because of their rebellion, Miriam became leprous and had to be quarantined for seven days so that this leprosy would not spread. Not long after this turmoil, they journeyed to Paran (12:16), and the problem of unbelief arose. At this juncture, the children of Israel wept, cried, and complained concerning entering the good land. They considered that if they entered into the good land, they would become prey for the giants (13:32-33; 14:3). They even wanted to return to Egypt (14:4). They had forgotten the tyranny and slavery that they had suffered in Egypt.</P><P>Numbers 15 is a very peaceful chapter, having no record of any turmoil. But in chapter sixteen, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram rose up with two hundred fifty leaders of the assembly to oppose Moses (vv. 1-3). This was a great turmoil. The peace of chapter fifteen did not last very long. Prior to this rebellion, a certain amount of fermentation had taken place among the leaders. The punishment for this rebellion was threefold. First, God caused the earth to open up and swallow up the three leaders with their families (Num. 16:32). Thus, they were the first ones in history to go down alive&#151;body, soul, and spirit&#151;into Sheol (v. 33). Second, fire came forth from Jehovah and consumed all two hundred fifty leaders (v. 35). This kind of burning could have been accomplished only by God Himself. Third, a plague came in and killed fourteen thousand seven hundred in one day (vv. 46-49). Following this threefold punishment, God commanded each tribe to bring a rod, and He commanded Moses to lay them before the testimony (17:1-5). The man whose rod budded would be the man whom God had chosen. The next day Aaron's rod not only budded but also brought forth almonds (v. 8). This was a miracle of resurrection. Nevertheless, even this threefold punishment with the miracle of resurrection did not subdue the rebellious people (vv. 12-13).</P><P>The following chapters in Numbers contain turmoil after turmoil, problem after problem. It is no wonder that a man such as Moses, of whom the Lord testified that he was the meekest man on the earth (12:3), became angry, calling the children of Israel rebels (20:10). Although it is understandable why Moses became angry, his word and attitude toward the children of Israel, issuing from his anger, offended God. When the Lord spoke to Aaron and Moses, He said that the two of them had rebelled against His word (v. 24). Because of this failure, Moses and Aaron had no share in entering the good land. What a tragedy!</P><P>The last big turmoil and failure in the book of Numbers occurred when the children of Israel committed fornication and idolatry corporately (25:1-3) by the snare of Balaam's teaching (31:16) with Balak's plot. Because of this failure, twenty-four thousand died by a plague (25:9). After this failure, God came in to renumber the children of Israel in Numbers 26. After forty years of purging, purifying, and filtering, 601,730 were numbered in the second numbering. This number is only 1,820 less than that of the first numbering. The primary difference between the first numbering and the second numbering was that those numbered in the second numbering were altogether new. Although Moses helped to renumber the children of Israel, he was not renumbered. Of those who were numbered in the first numbering, only Joshua and Caleb were renumbered. By the time of Numbers 26, God had gained a new people, a people who had been purged by God's judgments through His divine dealings. Thus, they were purified. This is the history of the Old Testament. Through all the turmoil in the wilderness, the children of Israel were fully purged, purified, and filtered.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Turmoil among the Lord's People<br>in the New Testament</H2><P>In the New Testament, the Lord Jesus selected twelve of His disciples and appointed them to be apostles (Luke 6:13). One among the disciples selected by the Lord Jesus was Judas, who also became a betrayer (v. 16). During the Apostle Paul's lifetime, the church life passed through turmoils that were full of problems.</P><P>I have been in the church life since 1932, and I was with Brother Nee for eighteen years. During those eighteen years with Brother Nee, turmoil came in every five or six years. In 1949 I went to Taiwan. From 1949 until 1989 there have been three different times of turmoil, including the present one. The rate has decreased from once every five or six years to once every twelve years.</P><P>Turmoil is the destiny of the progressing church, the pilgrim church. While the church is journeying on this earth as a corporate pilgrim, it is destined to suffer turmoil. We need such turmoil for our purification. According to our point of view, turmoil is not very good, but according to our real situation, turmoil is needed. Therefore, we should not expect to remain free from turmoil in the church life all the time. In Acts 20, after Paul had a long talk with the elders of the church in Ephesus, he warned them of fierce wolves who would come in among them, not sparing the flock (v. 29). In verse 30 he said that men would rise up from among them to speak perverted things to draw away the disciples after themselves. In the past three years, some have risen up among us to speak perverted things.</P><P>An article entitled "Being Realistic" was published in a periodical entitled The Word and the Testimony. The author of this article is John So, and the editors of the periodical are John Ingalls and Bill Mallon. This article insinuates that I am like the Japanese army when it invaded and occupied the Philippines in the Second World War. This implies that I invaded the church in Anaheim, taking it and possessing it in order to make it "the church of Witness Lee." The article goes on to indicate that the meeting on Ball Road in Anaheim is no longer a local church, because it has lost its ground. According to this article, the ground of the church in Anaheim has become a person (Witness Lee) and his work and ministry, and it is now occupied by us, just as the site of the temple in Jerusalem is occupied today by the Moslems. Is this not a perverted word?</P><P>In another portion of this article, under the heading "The Nicolaitans," I am categorized by innuendo as a Nicolaitan. In the way of innuendo, I am also likened to Balaam, who peddled the word of God in order to make money.</P><P>This article by John So also likens me to Jezebel, who called herself a prophetess and killed all the prophets of God, making herself the unique oracle of God. Is this not a perverted word that fulfills Acts 20:30?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRESENT TURMOIL IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>The present turmoil among us can be considered a rebellion, a rebellion with a conspiracy. I have been quiet for more than two years. You have probably never heard me speak concerning this matter. On occasion I have expressed something related to this matter in the elders' meetings, but not in a very clear way. Since the ones who initiated this rebellion have made it so obvious, even through the printed page, I feel that after such a long period of silence I should let you know some of the facts. But in this message I will say only a little bit in principle. For the details in full, see the book entitled The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion. It is published by Living Stream Ministry and is free of charge.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Instigated by the Evil One</H2><P>Having thoroughly considered during the past two years the things that have happened in the rebellion, I came to the conclusion that this rebellion is the work of the devil, the evil one (Matt. 13:19), because nearly everything brought out by the rebellious ones was not logical or reasonable, and some of the ways by which they did things were inhuman.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Carried Out by the Perverted Ones</H2><P>A rebellion such as the one we are encountering now in the Lord's recovery is not only instigated by the evil spiritual source but also carried out through human instruments. In Paul's charge to the elders from Ephesus in Acts 20:30, he warned them that from among themselves men would rise up to speak perverted things to draw away the disciples to be their followers. In the past nineteen centuries, Paul's warning has been fulfilled repeatedly. I would say that the present rebellion among us is another fulfillment of Paul's warning. Many words that have come out of those who are participating in this rebellion should be considered as "perverted things."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>With the Winds of Teaching</H2><P>A number of the teachings put out by the four leading ones in this rebellion, especially in the past three years, are truly winds of teaching (Eph. 4:14), such as the Lord Jesus building up the church by Himself directly (implying not through others), absolute autonomy in the local churches, no delegated authority, no spiritual father, and democracy instead of theocracy. These winds of teaching have damaged some of the dear saints in the Lord's recovery, who need the help through the light of the proper teachings of the New Testament, which are the teachings of the apostles (Acts 2:42).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Test to the Faithful Ones</H2><P>This illogical and unreasonable rebellion is a test to the faithful ones. Any saint who knows the New Testament teachings logically and reasonably and who is faithful to the Lord according to His holy and unchanging Word would not care for the unbridled speakings in the present turmoil. So, the rebellion is truly a test to the faithful ones for their approvedness (1 Cor. 11:19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Purification to the Recovery</H2><P>A rebellion always brings about some sifting among God's people. This sifting can be considered as a kind of purification exercised by the Lord's sovereignty to purify His collective people. Furthermore, the occurring of a rebellion also renders some purification to the faithful ones in their intention, their motive, their purpose, their aims, and other matters. To some extent I have been purified. During the turmoil, when I heard that people slandered me and defamed me, as the Lord said in Matthew 5:11, "Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and say every evil thing against you, lying, for My sake," I checked with the Lord to find out if I was wrong. By such checking, I was purified.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PROPER WAY TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEMS<br>IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>Now we need to see the proper way to take care of the problems in the Lord's recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>With a Genuine and Sincere Concern<br>for the Lord's Recovery</H2><P>To take care of the problems in the recovery, we must have a genuine and sincere concern for the Lord's recovery, without any biased view concerning any matter. Furthermore, we should not have any element of self-interest, self-plotting, self-esteem, and self-consideration. We must be unbiased, fair, and pure, without any background that would affect us. We must abandon our self-esteem and self-consideration. We all have our own prestige, and we like to highly esteem ourselves. We also expect that others will esteem us highly. As long as we seek self-esteem in the church life, we become a problem. Perhaps we are always considering, "What about me, my position, my future, and my interest?" If we are considering ourselves all the time in this way, we are unable to take care of problems in the Lord's recovery. In order to take care of the problems, we must be pure, tested, and checked by the Lord. When we have a pure, genuine, and sincere concern for the Lord's recovery, we are qualified to take care of the problems. Otherwise, we become a problem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Through the Proper and<br>Common Fellowship of the Body</H2><P>The proper way to take care of the problems in the Lord's recovery is through the proper and common fellowship of the Body. We should have a common fellowship, not the fellowship of a small nucleus or small circle. This kind of fellowship should be in love. If we are short of love, we are disqualified. The proper and common fellowship of the Body is without any private circle, without any party spirit, and without any hidden secrecies. Many of these negative items have been practiced by those in the center of the present turmoil. They came together in small, private circles to plan, plot, and conspire. They even proposed secret conferences to several brothers.</P><P>In Acts 15 a proper, open conference with the leading ones took place in Jerusalem to consider the matter of circumcision and the faith. It was a big problem among the churches at Paul's time, but the brothers did nothing secretly, and they did not form parties. Paul and Barnabas went up to Jerusalem in order to have a proper fellowship with the elders and the other apostles (vv. 2-21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Avoiding Any Attempt at Conspiracy</H2><P>To take care of the problems in the Lord's recovery, we must avoid any attempt at conspiracy. We must do things face to face, keeping everything in the light. We should do things openly and avoid doing anything behind a person's back. To do something behind a person's back or in a small group by way of conspiracy is absolutely devilish and very evil.</P><P>As children of the light (Eph. 5:8), we should keep everything in the light, not doing anything in darkness or in secrecy. We are serving the Lord. Why is there the need to do anything in darkness? We should also condemn any seeking of sympathy. Some today are not only seeking sympathy but also hunting for sympathy. We should also abandon backbiting, evil speaking, and death spreading. Backbiting is cruel, evil speaking is slandering, which is the devil's main work to destroy God's people, and death spreading is to work with Satan, the source of death, to spread the germ of spiritual death to deaden God's people. For keeping the oneness in the Lord's recovery, we must abandon all these devilish evils.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Holding to the Unique Goal</H2><P>If we are to take care of the problems in the Lord's recovery, we must hold to the unique goal. Whatever we do should be for the edification of the saints, for the benefit of the churches, for the building up of the Body of Christ, for the keeping of the oneness of the Body, and for the spreading of the Lord's recovery. These are the crucial points in what we call the central lane. For the saints' edification we have to sacrifice our seekings; for the churches' benefit we have to ignore our interest; for the Body of Christ's building up we have to give up any kind of personal preference; for the keeping of the oneness of the Body we have to drop all kinds of personal insistings; and for the spreading of the Lord's recovery we have to forget about our territories. It is only in this way that we can cleave to the unique goal of the Lord's recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>According to the Scriptures</H2><P>The way to take care of the problems in the Lord's recovery should also be according to the Scriptures without twisting and without any interpretation out of context, without any mixing in of human ideas, without any element of tradition, but with an open and seeking spirit. If we hold such an open and seeking spirit, the problems can be taken care of properly. To avoid twisting the Scriptures, we must be very objective in our realization of any portion of the holy Word. To avoid having any interpretation of the Scriptures that is out of context, we must not be biased in our subjective knowledge or personal feelings. To avoid the mixing in of any human ideas, we must reject our natural thoughts, our natural learning, and our natural doings. And to avoid having any element of tradition, we need to be under the light of the pure revelation of the holy Word. All these will keep us in an open and seeking spirit. Then we can discern and judge things concerning the Lord's recovery according to the Scriptures.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HIDDEN DIVISIVE FACTORS IN THE PAST</H2><P>The present trouble among us had its beginning in the past, but the fermentation or leavening process was not significantly manifested until 1985. This fermenting process has continued over the past few years and has become fully exposed this year (1989). In August of this year, the brothers who are taking the lead in the present trouble began to publish a paper called The Word and the Testimony in open opposition to the Lord's recovery and ministry.</P><P>From 1984 to 1986 I called three urgent elders' trainings. The first was in February 1984, the second in September 1985, and the last in February 1986 (see Elders' Training, Books 1&#151;8, published by Living Stream Ministry). My opening word in two of these three elders' trainings was concerning the danger of division.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Intention to Do an Extra Work<br>in the Unique Work of the Lord's Recovery</H2><P>The present problem among us came out of something which was hidden in the past. One of these hidden things was the intention to do an extra work in the unique work of the Lord's recovery. In the recovery there is a definite work which is for the building up of the local churches unto the building up of the universal Body of Christ. This is the work. But among us, there was a case of someone who wanted to do an extra work within the work. This person would not leave the recovery or give up the church life. Instead, he insisted on having a particular work of his own, by his own effort, within the recovery. This was a divisive factor.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Tendency to Keep Separate Territories</H2><P>Another hidden divisive factor is the tendency to keep separate territories. The Lord's work and move for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy is uniquely one. If we consider any region in which we are participating in the Lord's unique work as our particular territory, this will be a cause or a factor of division. Even the tendency to keep a separate territory should be uprooted. We should work for the Lord within His measure (2 Cor. 10:13-16), but we should not consider what the Lord has measured to us as our particular territory. Our local work in our region should be for the Lord's universal Body. In the New Testament we cannot see such a thing as jurisdiction in the Lord's work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Way of Not Having One's Work<br>Mingled with Others' Work</H2><P>In the past there was the hidden factor of working in a way of not having one's work mingled with others' work. The New Testament unveils to us that Peter's work for the Lord, mainly in the Jewish land, and Paul's, mainly in the Gentile world, were all for the one Body of Christ, without any distinction or separation. Rather, they were one in the carrying out of God's New Testament economy. The effect of Peter's work was realized in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:12), and Paul did go to Jerusalem to fellowship with the apostles and elders there (Acts 15:2, 4; 21:17-20a). This kind of fellowship, like the blood circulation of our physical body, helps the Body of Christ in the circulation of the divine life. It mingles the different pieces of our work for the Lord's recovery into one move. If our work is void of this kind of fellowship, this may develop into another factor of division.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Hidden Expectation of Being<br>a Prominent Figure in the Lord's Work</H2><P>There was also the hidden expectation of being a prominent figure in the Lord's work. We cannot deny that this "gopher" of ambition was among us. If you are ambitious and have the capacity, your capacity may neutralize your ambition, and there may be no problem. The problem among us today is that a number of brothers have ambition but do not have the capacity. Ambition plus incapacity is a real problem.</P><P>If all the ambitious brothers had the capacity, their capacity could swallow up the ugliness of their ambition. But if they have ambition without the capacity for their ambition, their ambition with their incapacity causes them to become dropouts. If you desire to be a prominent figure and you have that capacity, you may become such a person. If all the churches are helped by you and all the churches listen to you, you may become a prominent figure. But if you do not have the capacity and you want to become prominent, this is when a problem comes in.</P><P>We can see the difference in capacity with Barnabas and Paul in Acts. Barnabas was used by the Lord to bring Saul, who became Paul, into the ministry (Acts 9:26-27; 11:22-26). Furthermore, in Acts 13 Barnabas's name was mentioned first when the list of prophets and teachers in Antioch was recorded and when the Spirit set Barnabas and Saul apart for the work. Shortly after they went out, the matter of capacity arose. At the beginning of the journey, Barnabas was always mentioned first (vv. 2, 7); then Paul's name began to be mentioned first (vv. 9, 13, 16, 46, 50). Paul's name was mentioned first because his capacity to meet the need at that time was greater than Barnabas's, and he eventually became the leading speaker (14:12). Paul began to take the lead on their journey because he had a greater capacity. Barnabas did not have the capacity that Paul had. Later, Paul wrote fourteen Epistles. Who could speak as much, as deeply, or as high as Paul spoke? Of all the writers of the New Testament, Paul was the only one to use the term the Body of Christ. The other writers did not use this term or the term economy because they did not have as great a capacity as Paul.</P><P>When Paul and Barnabas returned from their trip to Antioch, a big problem arose concerning circumcision, and the church in Antioch sent them to Jerusalem to fellowship so that the problem could be solved (Acts 15:1-3). After the problem of circumcision was solved and they returned from Jerusalem to Antioch, they wanted to make another journey (v. 36). At this juncture Barnabas wanted to bring his cousin, John Mark (v. 37; Col. 4:10), on the journey. But Paul would not agree to bring Mark along, because Mark had left Barnabas and Paul in a negative way on their first ministry journey (Acts 13:13 and note 1). Barnabas's desire that Mark go with them was simply according to his own feeling. As a result, Barnabas and Paul separated from each other (Acts 15:39). From that point on, even though Barnabas might have gone out to visit the churches, his ministry was finished as far as the holy record in Acts is concerned.</P><P>According to my understanding, the problem between Paul and Barnabas consisted mainly of two points. First, Barnabas might have had some hidden unhappiness within him, because he took the lead at the beginning and later Paul began to take the lead since Barnabas had a smaller capacity. This was not an easy matter to overcome. If Barnabas had been happy about this development, that would have been a great mercy to Barnabas. Second, according to the record in Acts 15, Barnabas did not keep a proper principle in taking John Mark with him. Apparently, he did this only because of his own personal feeling concerning his cousin. This violated the spiritual principle. Barnabas should have submitted to Paul's way of not taking John Mark in order to allow Mark to learn the lesson. Instead of submitting to Paul, Barnabas took his own way, and this resulted in a separation between him and Paul. Paul had a greater capacity than Barnabas, and because of this he eventually was the one to take the lead in the ministry.</P><P>For more than twenty-five years in this country, I never told people that I was an apostle. But in these past few years, some brothers began to talk considerably about apostles and have said that there are not one, but many apostles among us. This is a shame! In a meeting of the church in Anaheim on August 28, 1988, one of the sixteen points concerning the standing of the church in Anaheim, a point presented by a certain brother, was that there are many apostles among us today, not just one. He said that he would give a list of these apostles to any of the saints who were interested. One brother asked for and received such a list from that brother. The list included seven names, with a question mark beside one of the names, and it did not include the name of the one who gave the list.</P><P>Shortly after I received news concerning this list, I went to Taipei, and I gave a message there concerning the three different kinds of apostles (see A Timely Trumpeting and the Present Need, pp. 25-29, published by Living Stream Ministry). The seven brothers on that list were all under my ministry. According to the truth concerning the kinds of apostles, this would make them apostles like Timothy, Titus, and Silas, who were produced by the Lord's directly appointed apostles. After this message was published, another word came out saying that there are no apostles today. This is similar to what John Nelson Darby taught. Later, still another word came out saying that there are only twelve apostles&#151;the eleven, who were selected by the Lord Jesus, and Paul. It was said that the selection of Matthias by lot in Acts 1 was wrong. But according to the Bible, when Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:14), he stood up with the eleven, which included Matthias.</P><P>This kind of speaking is based on whatever would be a benefit to the speaker and does not have the standard of the truth. This is a basic problem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Negligence regarding the Keeping<br>of the One Accord in the Lord's Recovery</H2><P>Another great divisive factor in the past has been the negligence regarding the keeping of the one accord in the Lord's recovery. In the elders' training in February 1986, my burden was to ask the elders to take care of the one accord in the Lord's recovery. More than four hundred brothers signed a letter written to me, assuring me that they would endeavor to keep the one accord (see Elders' Training, Book 8, The Life-pulse of the Lord's Present Move, pp. 154-155, published by Living Stream Ministry). But in the past three years of rebellion, a few brothers condemned that letter and even said that a part of that letter is heretical. Two of them wrote to tell me that they would remove their signatures from that letter. This shows that either they were not clear about the real meaning of the one accord or they despised it.</P><P>The above-mentioned factors of division hidden in the past are a strong proof that there was a negligence regarding the keeping of the one accord in the Lord's recovery. The present turmoil among us is not a matter of right or wrong, but an issue and a full manifestation of this negligence. This manifestation has progressed to the extent that some of the rebellious ones told people definitely that they will fight until they put me down. This shows strongly that they would not care for the one accord. This is surely a hidden factor of division.</P><P>The present turmoil among us did not develop in only one day. Ice in a river accumulates over a period of time before it becomes several feet thick. In the same way, in our situation there has been a certain amount of accumulation of unpleasant things over a number of years. At the beginning I had no realization concerning any opposition or criticism, because I was busy in Taipei. But when I came back in December 1987 and the brothers came to make certain demands according to their plan, I began to realize that something was terribly wrong. Their plan was actually their conspiracy.</P><P>In principle, turmoil and problems among the Lord's people come from two sources, a human source and a satanic source. After observing and considering the situation among us over the past three years, I believe that this turmoil is initiated by Satan, the evil one, the enemy (Matt. 13:19, 28). It is something from the realm of darkness to destroy the ministry and to shut the door to the new way. Satan hates the ministry, and he also hates the new way. The ministry with the new way is the great blockade to the enemy in his evil device, so Satan and the evil spirits moved quite strongly to do something. As a result, some of the brothers were captured and used by the evil spirits to do things which are altogether illogical, unreasonable, and inhuman. They told people that I am old, I am no longer able to judge things clearly. This is a lie. All such things show strongly that this turmoil is of the devil.</P><P>However, in spite of the turmoil, by the mercy and grace of the Lord, most of the churches around the globe are still going on positively. The reports of their present situation, given by their elders who were present in the elders' meetings, are quite encouraging. These reports are printed separately as a book entitled The Present Situation of the Churches in the Recovery throughout the World.

Thank the Lord that He has given me the environment, the time, the energy, and everything that was needed for me to remain in that study for these five years. And I thank Him even more that through this long period of study the Lord has shown me the God-ordained way to serve and work for Him, as revealed in the New Testament. This implies also the scriptural way to preach the gospel and to meet as Christians, as the children of God. This kind of realization has surely made me clear about the direction of the Lord's move today on the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR GOD IS LIVING, OUR LORD IS MOVING,<br>AND THE SPIRIT IS WORKING</H2><P>Concerning the direction of the Lord's move today, I fully believe that our God is living (1 Tim. 3:15; Heb. 3:12), that our Lord is moving (Matt. 16:18), and that the Spirit is working (Rev. 5:6b). Since our God is living, our Lord is moving, and the Spirit is working, our Triune God must still be carrying on His unique work for the accomplishing of His eternal economy, just as He has worked for this in the past ages and centuries. Now we need to find out what our living, moving, and working God is doing today on this earth. What is He carrying on today on this earth to complete His work for His eternal economy, that is, to build up the organic Body of His Christ? We all need to know what the Lord's move is today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD'S MOVE TODAY</H2><P>The Lord's move today is to recover the God-ordained way revealed in the New Testament in four steps:</P><P>1)To recover the New Testament priesthood of the gospel.</P><P>This is not merely to preach the gospel, but to handle the gospel as a priest, as Paul did (Rom. 15:16). Peter in his first Epistle, in 2:5 and 9, also referred to this. He told us that we are being built up into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God, and that as such a priesthood we should tell out the virtues of God, who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. To tell out the virtues of God, who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light, is to preach the gospel, telling people how God has saved us out of darkness into His marvelous light through His virtues, such as His mercy, His grace, His forgiveness, His washing away of our sins, His justification, and His regeneration. To offer up spiritual sacrifices to God is to bring the saved sinners as sacrifices for us to offer to our God. In the Old Testament what was offered were the types of Christ, but today what should be offered are the saved ones, who have become the members of Christ. The priests in the Old Testament offered types of Christ Himself, but today we offer saved sinners as parts of the Body of Christ. Thus, in Romans 12:1 Paul said that we need to present our bodies to God as living sacrifices. We do not go out merely to win souls. We do not go out only to save sinners. We go out to fulfill our New Testament priesthood. When we go out, we should have the realization that we are priests, priests of the gospel. This matter must be recovered.</P><P>2)To recover the home meetings for feeding the new believers.</P><P>In John 21:15 the Lord Jesus charged Peter to feed His lambs, the new believers. The new believers need to feed on the milk of the Word that they may grow (1 Pet. 2:2). After we have brought some to the Lord and have baptized them into the Triune God, we should go back as a nursing mother (1 Thes. 2:7) to feed them in their homes continually for a period of a few months. We did not take care of this properly and adequately in the past. This must be recovered in the Lord's recovery for His move today. We need to encourage all the saints to feed the new believers, the Lord's lambs, by having meetings in their homes.</P><P>3)To recover the perfecting of the saints for the work of the New Testament ministry.</P><P>The gifted persons must perfect the saints, as Ephesians 4:11-12 unveils to us. This kind of perfecting work should be done in group meetings. This kind of meeting is mentioned in Hebrews 10:24-25. In such a meeting, we should consider one another and incite one another to love and good works. We should also exhort one another. It would be difficult to consider others, to incite others, and to exhort others in a big meeting. This must be done in group meetings like those mentioned in Hebrews 10:24-25.</P><P>4)To recover the prophesying for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ.</P><P>The last crucial matter that the Lord is recovering today is the prophesying by all the saints, mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14. Brother Watchman Nee saw this matter more than fifty years ago, and he spoke of this in his book The Normal Christian Church Life. Later, in the book Church Affairs, Brother Nee said that the practice in Christianity of holding a "service" on Sunday morning, with one man speaking and all the rest sitting and listening, is not according to the Bible but according to the custom of the nations. Thus, there is the definite need to recover the prophesying for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ, as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14.</P><P>For years I did not know what it means to prophesy. The Pentecostals believe that to prophesy is to predict that some event, such as an earthquake or the Lord's second coming, is imminent, and then to conclude with, "Thus saith the Lord." However, this is altogether the Old Testament way. In the New Testament, no apostle or prophet said "Thus saith the Lord" at the end of his speaking. Rather, in 1 Corinthians 7:25 Paul said, "I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion," and in verse 40 he said, "I think that I also have the Spirit of God." Today 1 Corinthians 7 is recognized as a part of the divine revelation. Such a divine revelation was revealed through Paul's opinion. Paul was not spiritual in the way that today's Pentecostals are spiritual.</P><P>After reading the Bible again and again, I eventually understood that to prophesy, as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14, does not mean to predict. It means to speak something concerning the Lord and even to speak the Lord forth. This is the correct denotation. In verse 3 of that chapter we are told that to prophesy is to speak to men building up and encouragement and consolation. We all can speak to one another in this way. In order to prophesy, we do not need to wait for a great outpouring of the Spirit. First Corinthians 14:31 says clearly that we all can prophesy one by one. And verse 24 of the same chapter says that we all have the responsibility to speak. But today in the Lord's recovery, only a few speak.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIRECTION OF THE LORD'S MOVE TODAY</H2><P>The Lord's move today has a direction. The direction of the Lord's move today is:</P><P>1)To build up the organic Body of Christ as the organism of the processed and dispensing God in His divine Trinity for His full expression.</P><P>The direction of the Lord's move today is, first, to build up His organic Body (Eph. 4:12), a Body full of Himself and built up with Himself (Col. 3:11) as the life-giving Spirit, who is the essence, the element, and the reality of the church as the organic Body of Christ (Eph. 4:4a). Such a Body becomes the organism of the processed Triune God (John 15:1, 5, 8a), who is dispensing Himself in His divine Trinity (2 Cor. 13:14) to saturate the Body of Christ organically that it might be His full expression in the universe (Eph. 3:19).</P><P>2)To prepare the bride as the counterpart of the Bridegroom for the eternal marriage of the redeeming God with His redeemed.</P><P>The direction of the Lord's move today is, second, to prepare His bride, the church, as His (the Bridegroom's) counterpart (John 3:29-30) for the eternal marriage (Rev. 19:7-8), the universal marriage, of the redeeming God with His redeemed people (Rev. 22:17; 21:1-2, 9b-10). This universal marriage was typified by the union of the people of Israel with their redeeming God (Isa. 54:5; Hosea 2:19) and is clearly revealed in the New Testament (Eph. 5:25-27, 32).</P><P>3)To bring in the kingdom of God as the spreading of the divine life for God's eternal administration in the fulfillment of His eternal economy.</P><P>The direction of the Lord's move today is, third, to bring in the kingdom of God as the spreading of the divine life, which is Christ. The kingdom of God is actually Christ Himself as the seed of life sown into His believers in the church age (Luke 17:21; Mark 4:3, 8, 26) and spreading in His increasing (John 3:30) to be the enlarged, upcoming kingdom of God, which He will bring in at His coming back (Luke 19:12, 15a; Rev. 11:15). This is signified by the stone (Christ) that became a great mountain (the kingdom in the millennium), as revealed in Daniel 2:34-35. This upcoming, enlarged kingdom of God will be God's universal government in the new heaven and new earth for God's eternal administration in the fulfillment of God's eternal economy in Christ as God's ultimately consummated household administration in eternity.</P><P>Both God and Christ are aspiring to see the Body of Christ built up, to see the bride prepared, and to see the kingdom brought in, that Christ may have a Body, that Christ may have His bride, and that God may have a kingdom on this earth for His eternal economy. There is no other way to accomplish this but the God-ordained way.</P><P>This is my burden, this is my desire, and this is what I am promoting. I hope that you all will pick up this burden and this desire and endeavor to practice the God-ordained way.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE GENUINE ONENESS OF THE BODY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 17:2, 6, 11, 14-21, 22-24; Eph. 4:1-6, 11-16</H1><P>Prayer: Thank You, Father, that we have Your name. Your name is the source of life. We have Your life, and now we have Your word. Thank You that You are the source of the oneness. You are also the element of the oneness. Now we do have the sanctifying word. It sanctifies us all the time to make us all one in You.</P><P>Lord, we do praise You. The Father has loved You and has given You all His glory. And You love us. Oh, how much You love the church! You have given us the Father's name, the Father's life, and the Father's glory, and You have given us the sanctifying holy word. Lord Jesus, we worship You for all this. Tonight, bring us into all the reality of the name of the Father, of the divine life, and of the glory of the Triune God with the sanctifying word that we might be really one.</P><P>Lord, how we praise You that there is oneness among the Triune God. We worship this oneness of the divine Trinity. Oh, what a wonder and what a blessing that the Father loves You, and You love us, and now in turn we love You! Lord Jesus, thank You that there is such a divine love, a mutual love, from the Father to You, from You to us, and now from us to You. We love each other, and we love each other in the Triune God. Thank You, Lord, for the divine name, for the divine life, for the divine word, for the divine glory, and even for the divine love. We do love You; we love You with Your love. We are in Your love. Thank You, Lord Jesus. Here we have the oneness, the oneness of the Triune God.</P><P>Thank You, Lord, that You are still giving. You are the loving Giver, the rich Giver. The Father has given us to You, and You have given to us the Father's name, the Father's word, and even the Father's glory. We are just the receivers. We desire also to be the givers, to give You to one another.</P><P>Lord, we do thank You for this occasion. We believe this is a gathering conducted by You. You have gathered us out of so many occupations into Your name. Do bless this gathering. Lord, we pray for these meetings. Release all Your riches. Do release Yourself by releasing us. Release us in Your Spirit, in Your anointing, in Your presence. We desire to have the fellowship and this release, Lord, that we may release You. O Lord Jesus, we enjoy You. We enjoy Your essence, we enjoy Your element, we enjoy Your presence, and we even enjoy Your countenance; we see You face to face. Lord, we pray that in all these meetings You will touch us. We desire to be touched by You, and we also desire to touch You. Touch us, Lord, and cause us to touch You. Lord, we ask You to feel free to move among us. Feel free to do everything that is on Your heart. We desire to see, to know, and to realize what is on Your heart. We want to see Your pleasure, Your heart's desire.</P><P>For Your sake, Lord, You must rebuke the enemy. He is Your enemy and ours. We hate him. We accuse him before Your throne. Lord, do rebuke him and condemn him. Rebuke him away from Your presence. Rebuke him away from the very oneness of Your Body, away from all the local churches. Lord, even crush him under our feet. Lord, do Your recovery work. Recover all that has been lost.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S PROMISE TO CRUSH SATAN UNDER THE FEET<br>OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES</H2><P>As we were praying, I was reminded that the book of Romans consummates with the local churches (16:1, 4-5, 16, 23). In the last chapter of that book, there is a promise from God to the local churches, that is, that God will crush Satan under the feet of the local churches (v. 20). We need to stand on this promise and believe that our God, the God of peace, will surely crush Satan under our feet. We claim the fulfillment of this promise.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INTRINSIC PROBLEM<br>IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY TODAY</H2><P>We want to see the intrinsic problem in the Lord's recovery today and its scriptural remedy. We cannot deny that there is still a problem in the recovery today. The intrinsic nature of this problem is quite hidden; it is an intrinsic problem. To face such an intrinsic problem, we need a clear vision of the genuine oneness of the Body of Christ, which is unveiled in the Lord's prayer in John 17. As we are trying to find the scriptural remedy for this problem, I have a burden to point out to you this genuine oneness, which the Lord prayed for before He went to die and resurrect for the accomplishment of God's New Testament economy. I believe that this is the excelling way to obtain the needed remedy.</P><P>According to my observation, the problem among us came in because of the shortage of the proper understanding of the genuine oneness. The oneness to which I am referring is the genuine oneness, not the oneness that many Christians talk about so lightly. My burden in this message is to fellowship with you concerning the genuine oneness of the Body.</P><P>First, the New Testament shows us that what the Lord desires in His Body is oneness. Then, when the church came into being, there was the need of the practice of this oneness. The practice of the genuine oneness is the one accord. The New Testament reveals that as the churches were practicing the genuine oneness in the one accord, many negative things came in to test the oneness. These tests of the genuine oneness can be seen from the book of Acts, the beginning of the New Testament record concerning the church, to the book of Revelation, the end of the record of the church life in the New Testament. By considering the problems in the early church, we can find some examples that will help us to find a remedy for our present situation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BODY BEING THE GENUINE ONENESS</H2><P>One of the most positive items in the New Testament revelation is the genuine oneness of the Body. This genuine oneness is just the processed Triune God, who mingles Himself with us, the redeemed and transformed Christians. The genuine oneness of the Body is nothing less than the Triune God, who is not only triune but also processed and consummated. This consummated, processed Triune God mingles Himself with His chosen people in their humanity, and this mingling is the genuine oneness.</P><P>The genuine oneness is not merely a matter of our meeting together. The worldly people meet together, and in their gatherings they have their kind of oneness. However, that is not our oneness. Our oneness is the oneness of the organic Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is a mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed and transformed people. Because it is such a mingling, the Body itself is the oneness. The Three of the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;are three divine factors of this oneness, and these three divine factors are mingled with one human factor, consummating in the Body. This Body is the genuine oneness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ONENESS OF THE LORD'S<br>ASPIRATION AND PRAYER</H2><P>First, this oneness was something in the Lord's desire. This desire of the Lord's became His aspiration, and this aspiration was expressed in the prayer offered by the Lord in John 17 (vv. 2, 6, 11, 14-24). The subject of the Lord's prayer in John 17 is oneness. The Lord uttered this prayer out of the divine aspiration. At that time this oneness was not yet a reality; however, a model of this oneness&#151;the oneness among the Three of the divine Trinity&#151;was there. The Father and the Son are one (vv. 11, 21), and this oneness implies or includes the Spirit. In John 17 the Lord used the plural pronouns We (v. 11) and Us (v. 21) to signify the Triune God. The Triune God is one, and that oneness is a model of the oneness of the Body of Christ. Because the oneness of the Body has the oneness among the Three of the Trinity as a model, John 17 tells us that this oneness is altogether wrapped up with the Triune God (v. 21). The oneness of the Body of Christ is just the enlarged oneness of the divine Trinity. The model was there at the time the Lord prayed, but the enlargement was still to come. This enlarged oneness came on the day of Pentecost. Through the outpouring of the Spirit, the Body of Christ was produced (1 Cor. 12:13). That Body is the solid oneness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Oneness of All the Believers in Christ<br>in the Father's Name by His Divine Life</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>In the Father's Name</H2><P>The oneness of the Body is the oneness of all the believers in Christ in the Father's name (John 17:2, 6, 11). To be in the Father's name is to be in the Father's person, for in the New Testament, the name always denotes the person. Thus, to be in the Father's name is to be in the Father Himself. In the sense of the New Testament, the Father always bears the denotation of the source of life. The father of a family is the source of the life of that family. In John 17:11 the Lord prayed that the believers would be one in the name of the Father. To be one in the Father's name is to be one in the very source of the divine Trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>By the Father's Divine Life</H2><P>This oneness is also by the Father's divine life and with the Father's divine nature. Since we have the Father's life, we also have the Father's nature, for the nature always goes along with the life. We have the Father's person as the source of the genuine oneness, and we have the Father's divine life with His divine nature as the very element of this oneness. These are the intrinsic contents of the oneness of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Oneness of All the Believers in Christ<br>in the Triune God through Sanctification<br>by the Reality of the Word</H2><P>The oneness of all the believers in Christ is in the Triune God through sanctification by the reality of the word (John 17:14-21). In the portion of His prayer in verses 14-21, the Lord referred to the word and to the truth. The word sanctifies, and the truth sanctifies. Thus, the word and the truth are one. The word contains and bears the truth. This word, which is the truth, sanctifies God's redeemed people from the world (v. 17) and keeps them from the ruler of the world, the evil one (v. 15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>In the Triune God</H2><P>In John 17:21 the Lord prayed, "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us." The word Us here refers to the Triune God. This shows that the oneness of the believers is in the Triune God, which means that the believers are mingled with the processed Triune God. The believers could not be one without being mingled with the Triune God. Hence, the Triune God is the very base and element of our oneness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Through Sanctification by the Reality of the Word</H2><P>Before being saved, we were in the world and were mixed with the world. To be in the Triune God as our oneness, we need to be sanctified, that is, we need to be separated from being mixed with the world. If we would practice the genuine oneness, we must realize that the world must go. We cannot be mingled with the Triune God and at the same time remain in a mixture with the world. Therefore, we must be separated from being mixed with the world, so that we can be holy unto the Triune God to have a pure mingling with Him. This pure mingling is the oneness. If we desire to realize the genuine oneness, we must be separated from the mixing world unto the sanctifying God through the reality of His sanctifying word.</P><P>In addition to being separated from the world, we need to be kept from the evil one (v. 15). When we were mixed with the world, we were captured by the evil one. Thus, we need to be sanctified from the world and to be kept from the evil one unto the Triune God. Then we will be freed and purified to be mingled with the Triune God, that is, to practice the genuine oneness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Through the Reality of the Word</H2><P>The oneness of all the believers in Christ is through the reality of the word, that is, through the reality of the processed Triune God conveyed in His sanctifying word (John 17:17). Without the Triune God as the content, the word would be empty. The New Testament shows us clearly that the truth, the word, and the Triune God are one. The word is the truth (v. 17), and the truth is the Triune God (John 14:6; 1 John 5:6b). Hence, the word that is the reality contains the Triune God as its content. To be sanctified by the reality of the word is to be sanctified by the Triune God Himself. The Triune God is the very content of the sanctification. By this we can realize what the nature of this genuine oneness is.</P><P>The genuine oneness, which is the mingling of the Triune God with the redeemed humanity, has three aspects. The first aspect is the oneness in the Father's name by His divine life, and the second is the oneness in the Triune God by His sanctifying word. The first aspect concerns the source and the element of the oneness, and the second concerns the standing of the oneness. If we are in the world and under Satan's hand, we cannot practice the oneness. To practice the oneness, we must be separated from the world and kept away from Satan's hand.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Oneness of All the Believers in Christ<br>in the Divine Glory for the Expression<br>of the Processed and Mingled Triune God</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>In the Divine Glory</H2><P>The third aspect of the genuine oneness is the oneness of the believers in Christ in the divine glory (John 17:22-24). After many years of studying the New Testament, we have found out that God's glory is His divine life with His divine nature to express Him. If we did not have the Father's life with the Father's nature, it would be impossible for us to express the Father. The expression of the Father comes from the Father's life with the Father's nature. This expression of the Father is the glory.</P><P>First, the Father gave this glory to the Son that the Son may have the Father's life with the Father's nature to express the Father. Then the Son gave the same glory to His believers. This means that the Son has given the divine life with the divine nature to His believers that they may express God. It is in this expression that we are one. The oneness of all the believers in the divine glory is the oneness in the expressed sonship with the Father's life and nature. If we live by our life with our nature to express ourselves, there will be no glory of God. In the expression of ourselves there is no oneness; rather, there is division.</P><P>In the second aspect of oneness, we must be sanctified from the world and kept from Satan. In the third aspect, we must be saved from ourself, we must lose ourself. We must not act or do anything to express ourself; rather, we must do things in the Father's life with the Father's nature to express the Father. This is glory, and it is in this glory that we all are one.</P><P>Even in a small town where only fifteen saints are meeting as the church, if these fifteen do not behave, act, and do things in the divine life with the divine nature to express God, they will have opinions and will surely be divided. However, if they would be willing to be saved from themselves, willing not to live in their natural life with their own nature to express themselves, but to live the divine life with the divine nature to carry out the divine expression, spontaneously, among those fifteen there would be a genuine oneness, and this oneness would swallow up all their opinions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>For the Expression of<br>the Processed and Mingled Triune God</H2><P>This oneness is to express in His fullness the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected God, who has mingled Himself with the believers in their humanity. The oneness in the divine glory is to express the whole and entire incarnated, crucified, and resurrected God in all His fullness, that is, in all His riches. This rich God has mingled Himself with the human believers for His corporate, all-inclusive expression. Such an expression is a mingling of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected God with all His redeemed in their humanity. This is to be one in the glory of the divine Trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>The first kind of oneness revealed in the New Testament is the oneness of the Lord's aspiration and prayer. The model for the genuine oneness was there at the time of the Lord's prayer, but the actual oneness had not yet come. On the day of Pentecost, the actual oneness came. At that time the oneness of the Lord's aspiration and prayer became the oneness of the Spirit (Eph. 4:1-6). This matter touches the depths of the holy Word. The Spirit is the very consummated Triune God. When we have the Spirit, we have the totality of the processed and consummated Triune God. The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, and this consummation is now one with the saved ones. This is the enlarged oneness in actuality, but still not in practicality. To have something in actuality means that it exists, that it is a fact; whereas to have something in practicality means that such a thing has become our practice, our experience. Hence, in the second kind of oneness, the oneness of the Spirit, we have only the actuality of the oneness; we do not yet have the practicality. First, this oneness was in Christ's aspiration, and it became His prayer. Then this oneness became the oneness of the Spirit, which is the oneness in actuality, the oneness in fact.</P><P>On the day of Pentecost, the Triune God mingled Himself with His redeemed people, and this mingling became the actuality of the oneness. In John 17 this oneness was there among the divine Trinity only as a model; it had not yet been enlarged. But on the day of Pentecost, the Triune God, after being processed and consummated, was poured out as the Spirit; that is, the processed and consummated Triune God mingled Himself with His chosen and redeemed people. This mingling is the actual oneness, and this actual oneness is the enlargement of the model of the oneness of the divine Trinity. In John 17 the oneness was an aspiration in Christ which Christ uttered into a prayer. On the day of Pentecost, the oneness that had been in Christ's aspiration and prayer came into being. This is the oneness of the Spirit, which is fully defined by the Apostle Paul in Ephesians chapter four. In verse 3 Paul said that we all must be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit. Then, in the subsequent verses he gave a definition of the oneness of the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>This Oneness in Actuality Being Composed<br>of Four Factors by Two Means with One Goal</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Composed of Four Factors</H2><P>This oneness is composed of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God as its four factors (vv. 4-6). These four factors are four persons&#151;the Body, the Spirit, the Lord, and God. The Body as the object is mingled with the divine Trinity as the elements to be the factors of the oneness of the Spirit. The three factors&#151;the Spirit, the Lord (the Son), and the one God (the Father)&#151;are the elements of the oneness of the Spirit. These three elements are mingled with the Body, producing a fourth factor. The mingling of these four factors is the oneness of the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>By One Faith and One Baptism<br>as the Two Means</H2><P>The one faith and the one baptism mentioned in verse 5 are the two means to accomplish this oneness. Faith is the means for the Body to be joined to Christ the Head, and baptism is the means for the Body to be separated from Adam, the old head. Baptism separates us from Adam, and faith joins us to Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>With One Hope as the One Goal</H2><P>The oneness of the Spirit has the one hope of our calling, mentioned in verse 4, as the one goal. This goal is for the Body to be brought into the divine glory of the processed Triune God, who is mingled with the Body. Thus, in the oneness of the Spirit, there are four factors, two means, and one goal. The genuine oneness is the Spirit, the Son, and the Father mingled with the Body through baptism and faith, with a hope of something to come. This is the oneness. Anything besides these seven items is a foreign article that divides the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Making the Body an Object<br>of Seven Attributes of Oneness</H2><P>The one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one God, one faith, one baptism, and one hope make the Body one in every aspect as its attributes. The four factors of which the Body is composed, the two means by which the Body is separated from Adam and joined to Christ, and the one hope that is the glorious goal of the Body are the Body's attributes, which make the Body one in every aspect. The Body is altogether a matter of oneness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Oneness to Accomplish<br>the Aspiration and Prayer of the Lord</H2><P>This oneness of the above three attributes accomplishes the aspiration and prayer of the Lord. However, it is not yet the fulfillment of the Lord's aspiration and prayer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Oneness Possessed<br>by All the Believers in Christ,<br>Who Have Received the Spirit as the Seal<br>of God's Possession (the Church) and<br>the Pledge of Our Inheritance (the Triune God)</H2><P>This oneness is possessed by all the believers in Christ, who have received the Spirit as the seal of God's possession, which is the church, and the pledge of our inheritance, which is the Triune God (Eph. 1:13-14). Because we have received such a Spirit as the consummated God, we have the oneness. We all possess this oneness; this oneness is our possession. However, we need to experience it. To possess the oneness is to have the actuality of the oneness. When we experience this oneness, the actuality becomes our practicality; the actual oneness becomes our practical oneness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Oneness to Be Kept Diligently<br>by All the Believers</H2><P>First, we possess this oneness, and then we should keep it. This oneness must be kept diligently by all the believers in Christ with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing one another in love in the uniting bond of peace, that we may walk worthily of the calling with which we were called (Eph. 4:1-3). We keep the oneness by practicing the oneness, first diligently, then with all lowliness, all meekness, and all longsuffering. Then we need to bear one another in the divine love and in the uniting bond of the divine peace. In this way we practice the possessed oneness and thus keep it to have a walk that is worthy of the calling with which God has called us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ONENESS<br>PARTLY OF THE FAITH AND PARTLY<br>OF THE FULL KNOWLEDGE<br>OF THE SON OF GOD</H2><P>When we keep this oneness, it will become the third kind of oneness, that is, the oneness partly of the faith and partly of the full knowledge of the Son of God (Eph. 4:11-16). The faith mentioned in Ephesians 4:13 is the objective faith, denoting all the things in which we believe for our salvation. The faith equals the apostles' teaching, which is the teaching of the entire New Testament. The faith in which we believe is the contents of the entire New Testament. The three main things in the New Testament are God Himself, the person of Christ, and the work of Christ. We believe in what God is, we believe in what Christ is, and we believe in what Christ has done. This is our faith.</P><P>If we do not believe in any one of these main aspects of the New Testament teaching, we are divisive. Some so-called Christians say that they believe that Christ is the Savior, but they do not believe that Christ is God. They believe that Christ loved them and died for them, but they do not believe that He is God. We might mistakenly think that because they believe in Christ, these people are Christians. The Mormons and the modernists are such persons who do not believe that Christ is God. Because of this, they are divided from us.</P><P>This oneness is also the oneness partly of the full knowledge of the Son of God. We may know Christ, but we may not know Christ in full. The Christ whom we know may be very narrow. We need to have the full knowledge of Christ, that is, to know Christ in full. Then the Christ whom we know will be the enlarged Christ, the expanded Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Oneness to Which<br>All the Believers in Christ<br>Need to Go On<br>and at Which<br>All the Believers Need to Arrive</H2><P>The believers in Christ need to go on until they all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God (Eph. 4:13a). When we say that Christ is all-inclusive, we mean that He is not only the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;but also the Man; that within Him is His marvelous death and His powerful resurrection; and that He is all that we need&#151;salvation, peace, hope, our spiritual food, our spiritual drink, and our spiritual home. Some people argue with us and try to discourage us from speaking in such a way. Because I teach that Christ is our food (John 6:57), our drink (John 7:37-39), our clothing (Gal. 3:27), and our dwelling place (John 15:4a), some have misunderstood my teaching concerning the all-inclusiveness of Christ and have even accused me of teaching pantheism. They believe in their kind of Christ, and I believe in Christ according to the full revelation of the Bible. Because of such differences in the knowing of Christ, there is a lack of oneness. Thus, there is the need for us to go on to arrive at the full knowledge of the Son of God.</P><P>Christians disagree and argue over many small matters. For example, some argue over whether a person should be baptized by sprinkling or by immersion, and others have disagreed over the number of times and in what direction, forward or backward, a person should be immersed. Disputing over small matters such as these causes division. Those who are preoccupied with such things may be genuine believers, but they have not arrived at the oneness of the proper faith or at the full knowledge of Christ. They are like small children who are preoccupied with certain toys. Therefore, we all need to advance; we all need to grow. The more we advance in the growth of life, the more we will drop all the "toys," and the more we will arrive at the genuine oneness in practicality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Oneness That Needs the Full Growth<br>of the New Man and the Measure of the Stature<br>of the Fullness (the Body) of Christ</H2><P>This oneness in practicality needs the full growth of the new man and needs also the measure of the stature of the fullness (the Body) of Christ (Eph. 4:13c). This means that we need to grow. A child who is only four feet tall is not full-grown; he needs to grow further until he arrives at the measure of six feet, the measure of the stature of a full-grown man. In a similar way, we need to grow in the divine life until we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness, the Body, of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>No Longer Babes Tossed by Waves<br>and Carried About by Every Wind of Teaching<br>in the Sleight of Men, in Craftiness<br>with a View to a System of Error</H2><P>When we are full-grown, that is, mature, we will no longer be babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error (Eph. 4:14). The problems among us today are due to the immaturity of many of the saints. A number of saints have been damaged by the negative speaking of the divisive ones because they lack the full growth, which means that they are short of the adequate knowledge of Christ and the proper understanding of the faith. Because of this they listened to and believed the negative talk.</P><P>Ephesians 4:14 speaks of the winds of teaching. Every wind of teaching comes in the sleight of men, that is, in a cheating way, and in craftiness. In this verse sleight and craftiness are used in apposition, meaning that they refer to the same thing. Sleight implies cheating, and craftiness implies deceiving. To deceive people is to cheat them. The winds of teaching in sleight and in craftiness are related to the system of error. The word system indicates that the system of error must be of Satan; it must be a satanic system of error designed to systematize people into a division. The winds of teaching may have the appearance of truth, but in such teaching the truth may be applied for the purpose of causing division. Anything that divides the believers is a wind of teaching.</P><P>In 1 Corinthians 1:12, some of the Corinthian believers said, "I am of Paul," some said, "I am of Apollos," and some said, "I am of Cephas." Surely we all would condemn this kind of speaking as divisive. However, some of the Corinthians said, "I am of Christ." This does not seem to be divisive; rather, it seems very spiritual. Nevertheless, even such a "spiritual" saying was divisive; it was a wind of teaching. We all must be of Christ, but to say that we are of Christ so as to designate ourselves as different from other believers is divisive. To designate ourselves by saying either "I am of Paul," or "I am of Cephas," or "I am of Christ" is divisive. To say "I am of Christ," in itself, may be right, but as long as it is divisive, it is a wind of teaching that carries the believers away from the genuine oneness. It is not a matter of whether a certain kind of speaking is right or wrong; it is a matter of whether or not it is divisive.</P><P>Satan is subtle. It is difficult to seduce people by using something that is obviously wrong. However, anything that is good and right can easily be used to attract people. Whether a certain thing is divisive or not does not depend on whether that thing is right or wrong; it depends on whether that thing divides or does not divide. In recent days some have declared that they have come back to the enjoyment of Christ. This kind of speaking seems very good, because to enjoy Christ is a wonderful thing. However, if we use this wonderful thing to designate ourselves, to separate ourselves from others, this is divisive.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>All Growing Up into the Head, Christ,<br>in All Things by Holding the Truth in Love<br>and Being Built Up in the Organic Body of Christ<br>by Each One Part Functioning in Its Measure</H2><P>We all need to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things by holding the truth in love and being built up in the organic Body of Christ by each one part, that is, each member, functioning in its measure (Eph. 4:15-16). When we grow in life and function as members of the Body, we will spontaneously grow up into Christ. This growing up into Christ, the Head, equals the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Oneness to Fulfill<br>the Aspiration and Prayer of the Lord</H2><P>The oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God fulfills the aspiration and prayer of the Lord in John 17. The first kind of oneness is the oneness in the Lord's aspiration and prayer. Then, in the second kind of oneness, the oneness of the Spirit, that aspiration and prayer was accomplished but was not yet fulfilled. Finally, in the third kind of oneness, the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, the oneness in the Lord's aspiration and prayer is fulfilled. This third kind of oneness is the practical oneness for us to live in the church life.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PROPER ONE ACCORD<br>IN THE CHURCH</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:4-6; Matt. 18:19; Acts 1:14; Phil. 1:27; 1 Cor. 1:10; Rev. 1:4a, 11-12, 20; 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14; 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17; Col. 4:16; 1 Cor. 11:16; 14:33-34; Acts 15:1-31; 1 Thes. 2:14; 1 Cor. 1:11-13; Phil. 1:15, 17</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ONE ACCORD<br>BEING THE PRACTICE OF THE ONENESS</H2><P>I have put the genuine oneness first and the proper one accord second. Strictly speaking, the genuine oneness is not of the church but of the Body; it is the Body's own organic oneness. In Ephesians 4:4, after telling us to keep the oneness of the Spirit, Paul did not say, "One church and one Spirit..."; rather, he said, "One Body and one Spirit..." The church may be plural as the churches in different localities, but the Body could never be plural. Whether it is viewed locally or universally, the Body is one. In contrast, the church is universally one but locally many.</P><P>In the Body we need oneness; in the churches and among the churches, we need the one accord. The one accord is for our practice; the oneness is primarily for the actuality, for the fact. In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed for such a fact, and on the day of Pentecost, by pouring out Himself as the consummated Spirit, He accomplished His prayer. That was the actuality of the oneness. After the accomplishment of the actuality of the oneness, there is the need for the practice of the oneness. When the oneness is practiced, it becomes the one accord. The one accord is the practice of the oneness.</P><P>If we have only the oneness as an actuality, and do not have the present, practical one accord, the oneness that we have will be objective and abstract; it will not be real to us. If we would apply the oneness accomplished by the outpouring of the Spirit, we must practice the one accord. If among us there is no one accord, how could we say that there is oneness? If in a prayer meeting we each pray in our own way, without any accord among us, how could we say that we are practicing the oneness? As long as we have differences existing among us, the oneness is not applied. We must have the one accord to swallow up all the differences; then oneness will be present.</P><P>The practice of the proper one accord in the church is the application of the oneness. Although oneness and one accord seem to be synonymous, there is a difference between them. The Lord did not teach us concerning oneness. In John 17 He prayed for oneness, but in Matthew 18 He led us to practice the one accord. In Matthew 18:19 the Lord spoke of two praying together on earth in one accord. That was His leading, His training, and His directing us to pray in one accord. As a test of whether we are practicing the oneness or not, we may check to see whether there is one accord in our prayer meeting. When certain ones pray, we may shake our head as an indication of our displeasure, and when others pray, we may nod our head as an expression of our agreement. Such a shaking and nodding of our head is strong evidence that we do no practice oneness, because we do not have the one accord.</P><P>To say "Amen" in response to others' prayer is a practice taught by Paul in 1 Corinthians. In 14:16 Paul said that we need to pray in such a way that others can say "Amen." If there are no Amens to indicate our one accord, we should not expect that our prayer will be heard. If only two on earth pray in one accord, their prayer will be answered. The one accord is the practice, the application, of the oneness, and the oneness is the basis on which we practice the one accord. This is very meaningful.</P><P>In a church meeting there may be people of different races and colors. Our one accord could never be based on the different races and colors. We practice one accord based on the fact that we all have a common life. We may be different in race and in the color of our skin, but when we come together to pray, we must forget about the different races and colors. We do have a base for our oneness; thus, we can practice the one accord.</P><P>Not only so, if we do not have the same understanding, the same intention, the same purpose, the same goal, it will be impossible to pray together in one accord. There will be no base for such prayer. If we each have our own opinion, our own intention, and our own goal, there will be no base on which we can pray in one accord. But when we who are saved and who love the Lord and mean business for the Lord's purpose come together, we surely have the base to pray in one accord.</P><P>In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed for the oneness of His believers. That oneness was only in His aspiration. A little more than fifty days later, on the day of Pentecost, the oneness in the Lord's aspiration was accomplished. The oneness in the Lord's aspiration became the oneness in actuality. This oneness is called "the oneness of the Spirit" (Eph. 4:3), the Spirit here being the consummated Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, as the consummation of the entire Triune God. We, the saved ones, possess this oneness as our heritage. We possess this oneness, we enjoy it, and we apply it. To apply this oneness is to keep it, and to keep it is to practice one accord.</P><P>If in our Christian life and our church life we do not practice one accord, we conduct ourselves as if we are unlearned people who do not know that there is such a thing as the oneness of the Spirit. Suppose you have one billion dollars in your checking account. If you never write checks, it will seem as if you do not have a checking account at all, or that your account has a zero balance. Your writing of checks is the practice of your realization that there is one billion dollars in your checking account. The one billion dollars in your checking account is your possession. We may liken the oneness of the Spirit to a one billion dollar deposit in our heavenly bank account. Therefore, every day and in every meeting we need to "write checks"; that is, we need to exercise to apply the oneness of the Spirit to the present situation.</P><P>The oneness that we possess in all the churches is not merely the oneness in the Lord's aspiration and prayer. The oneness in John 17 may be likened to a promissory note. We do not have merely a promissory note; we possess a real bank deposit, for the promised "cash" has actually been "deposited into the bank" and has become our possession. We may consider this possession as our inheritance. The oneness that we have is the accomplished oneness, the oneness of the Spirit. We all have the Spirit in our "bank account," that is, in our spirit (Rom. 8:9, 16). This Spirit who is in our spirit is the equivalent of the oneness. We have the oneness as a deposit in our account, but we may not write "checks of oneness" because we may not remain in the spirit. Instead, we may remain in our mind. When a certain brother prays, we may be in our mind discerning whether that brother's prayer is genuine, or whether there is hidden intention in his prayer. Thus, we may not say "Amen" to his prayer. In such a situation, there is no practice of oneness. The one accord actually is the using of the oneness, which is the using of our possession. We all need to realize and to learn that not to be one with the saints, not to have one accord with others in the church, is serious. This indicates that the oneness is not applied.</P><P>To keep the oneness, to apply the oneness, to use the oneness, to enjoy the oneness, to spend the oneness, we need to practice the one accord. However, we should practice the one accord not only among the saints in our particular locality; we must practice the one accord among all the churches universally. During the past two and a half years, the teaching of the absolute autonomy of the local churches was promoted among us. This teaching was based mainly on the book The Churches of God by G. H. Lang. This kind of teaching encourages and even promotes differences among the churches. It is serious to say that all the churches should be different. We are not for uniformity among the churches, but we are for oneness.</P><P>Uniformity and oneness are not the same thing. In a family there may be a grandfather and a grandmother who are over eighty years of age, a father and a mother who are about fifty years of age, and a number of children ranging from eighteen down to four years of age. They all are different in age, different in the degree of maturity. In such a family it would be impossible to make all the members uniformly the same age. However, although the members of a family can never be the same age, they can still be one. Likewise, in the church we do not practice uniformity because in the household of God, a large household, there are many degrees of maturity among the children. To eliminate the degrees of maturity would be absolutely wrong and would be impossible. However, this does not mean that we do not need oneness. In the practicality of the church life, as in the family life, there is the need of oneness; but in the degree of the growth in life, it is impossible to have uniformity. To make all the children the same in the growth in life is not to practice oneness; it is to practice uniformity. To have a clear vision of the proper one accord as the practice of the genuine oneness also is a part of the scriptural remedy for the intrinsic problem in the present rebellion among us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE ONENESS OF THE CHURCH<br>AS THE UNIQUE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>When we practice the proper one accord, we must realize the attributes of the church as the unique Body of Christ. The church has its own attributes, and all the attributes of the church have the oneness. Oneness becomes the attributes of the church. This is because the factors of the church are one, the elements of the church are one, the means of the church are one, and the goal of the church is one. According to Ephesians 4:4-6, there is one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one God, one faith, one baptism, and one hope. These are seven attributes of the church. Every attribute of the church is one. Oneness is the striking characteristic of the attributes of the church. Thus, when we speak of or touch the church, we must realize that the church is altogether a matter of oneness. It gives us no ground not to be one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PROPER ONE ACCORD IN THE CHURCH<br>BEING THE PRACTICE OF THE GENUINE<br>ONENESS OF THE BODY</H2><P>The proper one accord in the church is the practice of the genuine oneness of the Body (Matt. 18:19; Acts 1:14). In Matthew 18:19, before the Lord prayed for the oneness in John 17, He trained His disciples to practice the one accord. Actually, as we have seen, to be in the one accord is to practice the oneness. A little more than forty days after the Lord's prayer in John 17, the one hundred twenty disciples practiced the Lord's direction in Matthew 18 by praying together in one accord (Acts 1:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being in One Spirit, with One Soul</H2><P>When we practice the one accord, we must learn to be in one spirit and with one soul (Phil. 1:27). We may be bodily sitting together in the same room, but if we are not one in our spirit, it is certain that we will not be one in our soul. To practice the one accord, we must learn to turn to our spirit and then to enter into our soul with the spirit that we may be in the one accord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Attuned in the Same Mind<br>and in the Same Opinion</H2><P>To practice the one accord, we must be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion (1 Cor. 1:10). To be attuned in the same mind is to practically be one in our soul. When the thoughts in our mind are expressed in our speaking, they become our opinions. When the opinions remain in our mind, they are simply our thoughts. When our differences in thinking are expressed as opinions, that may cause a problem.</P><P>The Corinthian believers were not attuned in the same mind; thus, they spoke differently in the flesh. Some said, "I am of Paul," and others, "I am of Apollos" or "I am of Cephas" (1 Cor. 1:12). The supposedly spiritual ones among them said, "I am of Christ." This too was the expressing of an opinion. This kind of different speaking caused divisions among the Corinthians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BASE OF THE PRACTICE<br>OF THE PROPER ONE ACCORD IN THE CHURCH</H2><P>The New Testament reveals that not only all the saints but even all the churches must be in one accord. As recorded in Acts 15, certain Judaizers came down from Judea to Antioch, teaching the Gentile believers that they had to be circumcised in order to be saved. To make circumcision a requirement for salvation in the New Testament jeopardizes the redemptive work of Christ. Hence, this was a great heresy that concerned all the churches. Thus, the churches came together to find a unique solution to this problem, a solution that could satisfy all the churches and keep the one accord among the churches.</P><P>The practice of the proper one accord in the church is based upon the following eight items.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Identity of the Churches</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Seven Golden Lampstands, Symbols of<br>the Seven Churches, Being All Identical</H2><P>In Revelation 1:11-12 and 20, the seven golden lampstands, symbols of the seven local churches in Asia, are all identical in essence, nature, shape, color, appearance, function, and expression. In all these aspects the seven lampstands are identical. This signifies that all the local churches should be the same in essence, nature, shape, color, appearance, function, and expression. The seven lampstands were identical to the point that if they were placed side-by-side before our eyes, we could not discern which is which.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Seven Churches Differing<br>in the Business Affairs of Their Administration</H2><P>Today a certain kind of teaching is being promulgated among the churches encouraging the churches to be different from one another. However, the normal differences among the churches can be only in the business affairs of their administration. Although the Lord did not touch business affairs in the seven epistles to the seven churches, as a rule, according to their practical needs, the churches should be different in the business affairs of their administration. These affairs include such matters as the times of the church meetings, and whether the church purchases property and builds a meeting hall or simply rents a room or a building for its meetings. In matters such as these, there is no need for the churches to be identical. To require all the churches to be identical in these matters would be very awkward.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Seven Churches Being the Same Normally<br>in the Positive Things</H2><P>The seven churches were the same normally in the positive things concerning the testimony of Christ. In all the positive things concerning the Lord Jesus, the churches should be the same. In the Lord's speaking to the seven churches, the positive things were commended, strengthened, encouraged, and exalted by the Lord for the abounding. These positive things include: in Ephesus, labor, endurance, and the hating of the works of the Nicolaitans (Rev. 2:2-3, 6); in Smyrna, the suffering of tribulation, poverty, and trial, and being faithful (2:9-10); in Pergamos, holding fast the Lord's name and not denying the faith of the Lord (2:13); in Thyatira, love, faith, service, and endurance (2:19); in Sardis, not defiling their garments (3:4); and in Philadelphia, keeping the word of the Lord and not denying His name (3:8, 10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Seven Churches Differing Abnormally<br>Only in the Negative Things</H2><P>The seven churches differed abnormally only in the negative things, which were rebuked, judged, condemned, and corrected by the Lord for elimination. These negative things include: in Ephesus, some calling themselves apostles and not being such, and the church leaving its first love (Rev. 2:1a, 2, 4); in Pergamos, the church settling in the world, some holding the teaching of Balaam, and some holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans (2:12a, 13-15); in Thyatira, the church tolerating the woman Jezebel to teach and lead the Lord's slaves to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices (2:18a, 20); in Sardis, the church having a name that it was living but it was dead, and its works not being found by Christ completed before God (3:1-2); and in Laodicea, the church being neither cold nor hot, but boasting, "I am rich and have become rich and have need of nothing" (3:14-15, 17). The Lord's rebuking indicates that the Lord does not want such differences.</P><P>By reading the epistles to the seven churches in Revelation, we can see that all the local churches should be the same in positive things, but not in negative things. The churches should be different only in business affairs. For example, whether a church buys a piece of land and builds a meeting hall should depend on the church's need and on the Lord's sovereignty. The churches should not be required to follow one another in affairs such as these, but all the churches should be one in all the spiritual aspects concerning the Lord's testimony. This is the first item as the base for us to practice the proper one accord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Seven Epistles Being Written<br>as One Book to the Seven Churches</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Each of the Seven Epistles Being Addressed<br>by the Lord to a Particular Church<br>in a Certain Locality</H2><P>The seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 were written as one book to the seven churches (Rev. 1:4a). Before the book of Revelation, every epistle was written and sent particularly to a certain church. However, in Revelation, the Lord wrote seven epistles and put them together in one book. These epistles were addressed by the Lord to the seven particular churches separately (2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14); but they were sent not as seven books but as one book.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>All the Seven Epistles Being Closed as<br>the Speaking of the Spirit to All the Churches</H2><P>Although the contents of the seven epistles differ, at the end of each epistle there is the same closing word: "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches" (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). Each epistle was written to a particular church in a certain locality, yet all the seven epistles were closed in the same way, as the Spirit's speaking to all the churches. This means that each epistle was written to all the churches, and it indicates that all the churches should be the same. This is the second item as the base for all the churches to practice the one accord. There must be the one accord among all the churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Apostle Teaching<br>the Same Thing in All the Churches</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>An Epistle Written to a Certain Church<br>Being Also for Other Churches</H2><P>The Apostle Paul taught the same thing in all the churches (1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17). This means that all the churches in all the different localities should be the same. In Colossians 4:16 Paul wrote, "And when this letter is read among you, cause that it may be read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the one from Laodicea." The epistle to the church in Colosse was also for the church in Laodicea, and the epistle to the church in Laodicea was also for the church in Colosse. Thus, every epistle was written not only for the receiving church but also for all the other churches. This indicates that the Lord wants all the churches to have the one accord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Teaching Differently Being Prohibited</H2><P>In 1 Timothy 1:3 Paul said that he urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently. To teach differently is to teach things different from what the apostles teach, that is, to teach things other than God's New Testament economy (1 Tim. 1:4). This indicates that all the teaching ones should teach the same things in all the churches according to the apostles' teaching. Of course, this indicates also that all the churches should be one in the matter of teaching. This does not mean that in the matter of teaching all the churches should give the same messages and use the same books, even at the same time; it means that all the churches should not teach things that are different from the New Testament revelation of God's New Testament economy. Examples of such teaching are the teaching of the Mosaic law (1 Tim. 1:7) and the teaching of Jewish genealogies (1 Tim. 1:4) by some Christian teachers at Paul's time, which were different from ministering Christ to people according to the proper revelation as taught in the New Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>All the Churches Being the Same<br>in Their Custom and Practice</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Same in Custom</H2><P>All the churches were the same in their customs (1 Cor. 11:16). In 1 Corinthians 11:16, after instructing the saints concerning the matter of head covering, Paul said, "But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God." This indicates that all the churches were the same in their customs. A custom among the churches should not be considered a business affair. Paul told those who would express their opinions in order to dispute with him concerning head covering that the churches did not have the custom of disputation concerning the apostles' teaching. This is not a matter of business; it is a matter of the customs among the churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Same in Practice</H2><P>All the churches should be one also in their practice. In 1 Corinthians 14:33-34, concerning women being silent in relation to teaching with authority, Paul said, "As in all the churches of the saints," indicating that all the churches should be the same in not permitting the sisters to teach with authority. This also is not a business affair in the church; it is a practice in the church. In such a practice, all the churches should be one.</P><P>In the churches we practice neither democracy nor autocracy, but theocracy. We all are under the Lord's ruling in everything and in all the practices, following His divine intention according to His holy Word; thus, there is no room for us to express our own human opinions. Unlike the world, the churches should not have the Laodicean practice of deciding matters according to people's opinions, which would often carry the church away from the divine economy to a decision made by a council according to human thought and on a human level. In this matter also all the churches should be the same.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The One Solution Being the Decree<br>for All the Churches</H2><P>The one solution made at Jerusalem for the problem of circumcision became a decree for all the churches, both Jewish and Gentile, to keep (Acts 15:1-31). Hence, in relation to the matter of circumcision, all the churches should be the same. After the issuing of such a decree, it would have been wrong to allow the Jewish churches to keep the practice of circumcision while permitting the Gentile churches not to observe it. We should not forget that in the church, in the new man, there is no difference between the Greeks and the Jews, because in the new man Christ is every member (Col. 3:11). The one solution regarding the problem of circumcision was good for all the churches, making all the churches the same.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Gentile Churches<br>Imitating the Jewish Churches</H2><P>In 1 Thessalonians 2:14 Paul wrote, "For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus." This indicates that the Gentile churches imitated the Jewish churches. This imitating did not make the Gentile churches Jewish; rather, it made all the churches the same in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>All the Books of the New Testament,<br>as One New Testament, Being Written to<br>All the Saints and All the Churches Universally</H2><P>All the books of the New Testament, as one New Testament, that is, as one book, were written not only to their receivers but also to all the saints and to all the churches universally, that is, through all the centuries (1 Cor. 1:2). All the churches on the whole earth through all the centuries have received the same New Testament. The Lord did not write one New Testament to one church and a different New Testament to another church. In 1 Corinthians 1:2, Paul addressed his epistle "to the church of God which is in Corinth..with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place." The one epistle of 1 Corinthians was written to the saints in Corinth, with all the Lord's callers in every place. Thus, it was written to all the saints and all the churches through all the centuries. This indicates that all the churches on this earth should be the same, because they have all received the same teaching, the same New Testament. How, then, could we promote differences among the churches?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>All the Churches through the Centuries<br>Needing to Imitate All the Churches<br>Unveiled in the New Testament</H2><P>All the churches through the centuries should imitate all the churches unveiled in the New Testament. Today there are those who are promoting differences among the churches, but the Bible indicates that the churches should imitate one another.</P><P>To imitate is to follow something that is better than what we are, what we have, and what we do. All the churches differ in degree in the positive things related to the practices in the church. Thus, they should imitate what is better in any church, that they may have some improvement and some advancement in the interest of the Lord. It is not a matter of legality; it is a matter of the degree in the growth of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A STRONG ENCOURAGEMENT<br>TO THE PRACTICE OF THE PROPER ONE ACCORD</H2><P>All the above eight points are a strong encouragement to the practice of the proper one accord in the church for the keeping of the genuine oneness of the Body by all the saints and all the churches universally. We must consider that all these points came sovereignly into existence that we may be one in all things related to God, Christ, and the church, that we may spontaneously be exercised to practice the one accord according to all the attributes of oneness in the divine and spiritual interests. May the Lord bless us and grace us to practice the one accord according to these attributes of oneness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A DISCOURAGEMENT TO THE ONE ACCORD,<br>ENCOURAGING AND PROMOTING DIVISION</H2><P>Any teaching contrary to the above eight points, such as the teaching of the absolute autonomy of the local churches, is a discouragement to the one accord in the church and encourages and promotes division among the saints and among the churches. All our teachings should be in the nature and with the intention to encourage and promote the practice of the one accord for the keeping of the oneness. We should do our best in any teaching to avoid any discouragement to such a practice, so that the churches in all the localities can be built up in peace, without any disturbance, frustration, and distraction. May the Lord have mercy on all of us that we may practice the one accord to be kept from causing any kind of division and to have His economy carried out in the building up of His Body in oneness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SPIRITUALITY OR SCRIPTURAL TEACHING<br>NOT TO BE USED AS A CLOAK FOR DIVISION</H2><P>Any kind of spirituality or any kind of scriptural teaching should not be used as a cloak for division.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Saying "I am of Christ"<br>Being Condemned by the Scripture</H2><P>In 1 Corinthians 1:11-13, saying "I am of Christ" was condemned, just as saying "I am of Paul," "I am of Apollos," or "I am of Cephas."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Taking the Enjoyment of Christ<br>as an Excuse for Separation or for Division<br>Also Being Condemned</H2><P>Taking the enjoyment of Christ as an excuse for separating oneself from the saints or for division among the churches also is condemned, just as saying "I am of Christ."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Preaching Christ Because of Envy and Strife<br>Being Condemned by the Scripture</H2><P>In Philippians 1:15 and 17, the Apostle Paul condemned those who preached Christ because of envy and strife, out of rivalry.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Using Teachings<br>That Are Seemingly Scriptural<br>as Reasons for Separation<br>or for Division also Being Condemned</H2><P>Using teachings such as the teaching concerning the headship of Christ, the teaching concerning all the churches being responsible directly to Christ alone, and the teaching concerning not exalting man, all of which seem very scriptural, as reasons for separation from the saints or for division among the churches also is condemned. As long as anything that is spiritual or scriptural causes separation or division, it is condemned.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CATHOLIC HIERARCHY</H2><P>The Catholic Church's organization, with the pope as its head and with the bishops in different ranks as subordinates, is a hierarchy, which is not scriptural and is condemned by the Lord. We abandon such hierarchy to the uttermost because it is abominable to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BRETHREN "FEDERATION"</H2><P>The Brethren assemblies' uniformity, which resembles a federation, also is not scriptural.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DIFFERENCES IN<br>THE DEGREE OF MATURITY IN LIFE</H2><P>Any difference among the saints or among the churches in the degree of maturity in life is normal and is needed according to God's economy. God has arranged it so, and we should not attempt to make the saints or the churches uniform in this matter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>INTENTIONAL DIFFERENCES</H2><P>Any differences among the saints or among the churches that are intentional are abnormal and are condemned by the Scripture. Any intention to have differences among the saints or among the churches in order to demonstrate something or to oppose something should be condemned and rejected.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>UNITY WITH VARIETY<br>AND VARIETY VERSUS UNIFORMITY</H2><P>For the keeping of the oneness of the Body of Christ that we might not be sectarian, we must tolerate certain differences, such as differences in the way of baptism and in the observing of days (Rom. 14:15). This we consider as unity with variety. By tolerating this kind of variety, we annul uniformity. This is variety versus uniformity. If we practice this, we can be in one accord in spite of the variety that we may have. Of course, we know that sprinkling as a means of baptism is not as scriptural as immersion, and that the keeping of the Sabbath is altogether not in God's New Testament economy, yet we tolerate these kinds of differences which do not damage the faith according to the New Testament revelation. We tolerate this kind of variety with the expectation that the believers who are for unscriptural practices such as these may grow in life to become more mature in the fullness of the measure of Christ so that they may drop these differences and arrive at the oneness of the faith. We earnestly hope that these believers will also be tolerant of the fact that we are not the same in these practices as they are, so that they can be in the one accord for the keeping of the oneness of the Body. To practice the proper one accord according to all the points mentioned above will surely render much help in resolving the intrinsic problem in the present rebellion in the Lord's recovery. Thus, such a practice also is a part of the scriptural remedy for the present rebellion among us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A CONCLUDING WORD</H2><P>In the elders' training in February 1986, I spoke on the matter of one accord (see Elders' Training&#151;Book 7, One Accord for the Lord's Move, published by Living Stream Ministry). In those messages I mentioned the fact that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in Acts 2 was brought in through the one accord among the one hundred twenty believers (Acts 1:14; 2:1-4). Without the one accord, the outpouring of the Spirit probably would have been delayed. Hence, we need to see that the one accord among the saints and among the churches is crucial.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE TESTS OF THE ONENESS OF THE BODY<br>AND OF THE ONE ACCORD<br>IN THE CHURCH</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 11:19; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; 4:6</H1><P>In this chapter we will consider all the tests in the New Testament of the genuine oneness of the Body and of the proper one accord in the church. Immediately after the oneness was accomplished in Acts chapter two, the tests began to come in chapter six. In this message I have selected fifty-one cases in the New Testament, from Acts to Revelation, in which the genuine oneness of the Body and the one accord in the churches was tested.</P><P>By considering all these tests and the way in which they were taken care of, we can see several things. First, we can see the actual situation of the churches at the time of the apostles. For many years I held the concept that the churches in the apostolic age were wonderful, but today my concept has changed. After considering the fifty-one tests of the oneness and of the one accord, I now realize that the churches in the age of the apostles were not as wonderful as I had thought. It is hard to tell whether their condition was better than ours or not.</P><P>Second, by considering this list of cases, we can learn how to face all the tests. We can learn how to solve the problems and how to take care of them. If we would ponder all these items, we will surely see the way. I believe that this is the reason that all these negative things were recorded in the New Testament. I believe the Holy Spirit's intention was to establish some examples from which we may learn.</P><P>Third, by considering all these tests of the oneness and of the one accord, we can see what things should be tolerated and what things should not be tolerated. Many things may be mistakes and may cause us trouble, yet we should not be bothered by them; they are tolerable and can be taken care of. On the other hand, by all these examples we can find a few things that the Spirit would not tolerate; they are intolerable. Concerning these things, there is the need to exercise to quarantine those who are responsible for the contagious situations.</P><P>I came into the recovery in Chefoo in 1932. The church life at that time was very good. I remained in Chefoo for a little over a year, and during that time I did not see anything as a test of the oneness. Then the Lord led me to leave my job and to enter into His work full-time. In October 1933 I went to Shanghai, and Brother Nee asked me to enter into the work there. After approximately one year, in the fall of 1934, a big turmoil arose. That was the first time that I saw a test of the genuine oneness and of the proper one accord. From that year until today I have passed through turmoil after turmoil, approximately one in every six to ten years. At times I have been bothered by this, thinking that our labor did not produce a satisfactory result. Fifty years ago I wondered why such things happened. At that time Brother Nee's ministry was the highest in the entire world, but the situation was not very encouraging.</P><P>When I came out of mainland China and went to Taiwan, the work in Taiwan had a wonderful beginning. In less than six years, from 1949 to 1954, our number increased from fewer than five hundred to about fifty thousand. However, not long after that, a turmoil arose. Again I considered why this kind of thing happens. From that time I began to see that there was not one church recorded in the Bible that did not have any trouble. This comforted me very much, and I was much less bothered.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE TEST OF THE PROBLEM OF LANGUAGE&#151;</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ACTS 6:1-6</H2><P>The first test of the oneness of the Body and of the one accord in the church was the test of the problem of language. Here we can see that murmurings arose because of the unequal daily dispensing of food. Even in the glorious condition of the church after the day of Pentecost, murmurings arose over the matter of eating. This problem was solved by the proper service arranged by the apostles according to the practical need (vv. 2-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE TEST OF PETER'S CONTACT<br>WITH THE GENTILES&#151;<br>ACTS 11:1-18</H2><P>According to the Levitical regulations (Lev. 11; cf. Acts 10:9-16, 28), the Jews were not allowed to contact the Gentiles. They considered the Gentiles unclean. However, in Acts 10 Peter contacted the Gentiles in the house of Cornelius. Because of this, a disputation arose between the disciples of the circumcision and Peter (Acts 11:2-3). This disputation was solved by Peter's testifying of the facts according to the truth (vv. 4-18). In dealing with such disputes, we must present the facts, and these facts must be vouchsafed by the truth. Such a big problem must be solved in this way: by the presenting of facts that are fully according to the New Testament teaching, the truth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE TEST OF THE HERETICAL TEACHING<br>CONCERNING CIRCUMCISION<br>AS A REQUIREMENT FOR SALVATION&#151;<br>ACTS 15:1-31</H2><P>The Judaizers, the Jewish believers, not only stressed the practice of circumcision, but also said that circumcision was a requirement for salvation (v. 1). This was a great heresy. No little dissension and discussion arose between the Judaic believers and those of the proper faith (vv. 2-5). This problem was solved by Paul and Barnabas and certain others among the believers going to Jerusalem from Antioch to have a conference with the apostles and the elders there (v. 2). The Bible shows us that when a question like this arises, the leading ones need to come together to have a conference, to bring everything out into the open. The problem in Acts 15 was solved by Paul and Barnabas going to Jerusalem, having a conference with the apostles and the elders there, and through thorough fellowship, working out a solution that satisfied all the believers in different localities, a solution over which all the churches rejoiced and by which they were comforted (vv. 2, 6-31). This is the way we should solve the problems among us today. I believe that if from the beginning the concerned brothers among us would have had a sincere heart with a pure motive to come together to pray, to study the Word, and to fellowship, their concerns would have been easily taken care of. However, until now the brothers have been avoiding this kind of necessary fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE TEST OF A SHARP CONTENTION BETWEEN<br>THE TWO CO-WORKERS, PAUL AND BARNABAS,<br>CONCERNING TAKING MARK ALONG WITH THEM&#151;<br>ACTS 15:36-40</H2><P>Paul proposed that he and Barnabas return to the places where they had worked and visit the brothers there. Barnabas intended to take Mark with them, but Paul did not consider it suitable (vv. 36-38). In their contending, both of them were frank, honest, and faithful. However, in these past two years I have not seen such frankness, honesty, and faithfulness with those who instigated the present turmoil.</P><P>The contention among Paul and Barnabas, with no way to revolve it, resulted in a separation between the two co-workers (vv. 39-40). This separation might not be considered a practical division, but it was surely a strong discord that seriously damaged the genuine oneness of the Body. There is no record that the problem between Paul and Barnabas was ever resolved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE TEST OF THOSE WHO MAKE DIVISIONS<br>AND CAUSES OF FALLING CONTRARY TO<br>THE APOSTLES' TEACHING, DECEIVING PEOPLE<br>BY SMOOTH AND FLATTERING SPEECH&#151;<br>ROMANS 16:17-18</H2><P>I am comforted that Paul put such an item at the end of Romans, which is a book revealing how we sinners can be regenerated and transformed into mature sons of God that we may be the constituents of the churches. This is surely wonderful. However, even among the churches established by Paul, there were those who made divisions and causes of falling, deceiving people by smooth and flattering speech to draw away the believers to follow after them. Paul told the saints that they had to keep a watchful eye on such persons and turn away from them. Paul did not say that because these persons were pitiful, the saints should show them love and sympathy. Such persons damage the Body and offend Christ, the Head. Thus, Paul did not tell the saints to express their love to them. Rather, he exhorted them to keep a watchful eye on divisive persons of this kind and to turn away from them.</P><P>The Lord's recovery has been in the United States for over a quarter of a century. Such a thing as is described in Romans 16:17-18 has never taken place in the recovery in as serious a way as today. What has been going on among us and is still going on is exactly what is mentioned in Romans 16. Among us there are those who are making divisions and causing people to fall. As the Apostle Paul warned in Acts 20:30, these are perverted persons who speak perverted things to draw people away from the church to be their following. In Acts 20 Paul did not tell the believers to turn away from such persons, but in Romans 16, Paul did say that we should turn away from them.</P><P>This turning away is to exercise to quarantine the divisive, sectarian ones in order to protect the saints from being contaminated. The divisive ones are very contagious. Anyone who contacts them will be "infected." This would not be good for them or for others. Thus, today we should carry out what is termed in medicine a quarantine. To quarantine a person does not mean that we do not love him. On the contrary, it means that we love both him and many others. If one member of a family contracts a contagious disease, the whole family may need to quarantine him. This is for the benefit of all the members of the family. To cut people off, to excommunicate people, was the practice of the Brethren. From the beginning of the Lord's recovery we realized that was wrong. However, to quarantine those who are sick with a contagious spiritual disease certainly is scriptural.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE TEST OF DIVISIONS AND STRIFES<br>AMONG THE SAINTS IN EXALTING GIFTED PERSONS&#151;<br>1 CORINTHIANS 1:10-13</H2><P>This was the case among the Corinthians. Some said, "I am of Paul," some, "I am of Apollos," some, "I am of Peter," and others, "I am of Christ." They exalted the gifted ones, thus creating divisions and strifes among themselves. Saying "I am of Christ" seemed to be very spiritual, but it was condemned by the apostle just as saying "I am of Paul," "I am of Apollos," or "I am of Cephas," because it caused division just as much as the other three sayings, which apparently were very fleshly (3:3-4). All of these sayings caused division; hence, all were condemned. The apostle charged all the Corinthians to speak the same thing and to be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion in order to avoid division among them (1:10-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE TEST OF SOME FLESHLY CORINTHIAN<br>BELIEVERS BEING PUFFED UP AS THOUGH<br>THE APOSTLE WERE NOT COMING TO THEM&#151;<br>1 CORINTHIANS 4:18</H2><P>In dealing with this case, the apostle as a begetting father admonished the Corinthians as his beloved children (vv. 14-15). Then the apostle told them that he would come to them with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness, depending on their preference (vv. 19-21). This was the Apostle Paul's way to solve this problem, that is, to show his love to the troublemaking believers, who were his children, and to point out to them his God-given authority over them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE TEST OF A CORINTHIAN BROTHER<br>WHO LIVED IN GROSS SIN AND WOULD NOT REPENT&#151;<br>1 CORINTHIANS 5:1-5, 9-13</H2><P>In Corinth there was a brother who lived in gross sin and would not repent. The apostle had already judged such a one in the name of the Lord Jesus, with His power, to deliver him to Satan for the destruction of his flesh (vv. 3-5). The apostle charged the church in Corinth to remove this one from the fellowship among the believers (vv. 2, 9-13). This also was a kind of quarantine exercised over a sinful brother.</P><P>We have studied 1 Corinthians 5:13 particularly. The word translated remove here was taken from the Septuagint (Greek) version of the Old Testament. The removal of the sinful brother in 1 Corinthians 5 was like the putting of a leper outside the camp in the Old Testament (Lev. 13:45-46; Num. 5:2). In Numbers 12 Miriam rebelled against Moses, and she was stricken with leprosy. She was removed from the camp for seven days, until her leprosy was cleared up. This was a form of quarantining. There has been much talk among Christians concerning the matter of excommunication. It is wrong to excommunicate a believer. To excommunicate someone is to give him up; but to remove a person is to quarantine him with the hope that he would become sound.</P><P>The apostle charged the church in Corinth to remove the sinning one from the fellowship among the believers (1 Cor. 5:2, 9-13). He charged the church not to associate with such a one, not even to eat with him (v. 11).</P><P>Later, when the sinful brother repented, the apostle charged the church to forgive him by confirming their love to him, that they might not be taken advantage of by Satan, because the apostle was knowledgeable of Satan's devices (2 Cor. 2:5-11). Once a sinning brother has repented, the church should immediately forgive him and show its confirmed love to him. Otherwise, Satan will come in to take advantage of the church to devour the fallen and repentant believer. This is the proper way to deal with such a case, a way that takes care of 1) the purity of the church, 2) the discipline of an unrepentant believer, 3) the necessary and urgent forgiveness and confirmed love to a repentant believer, and 4) the devices of Satan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. THE TEST OF A BROTHER HAVING A CASE AGAINST<br>ANOTHER BROTHER&#151;1 CORINTHIANS 6:1, 6-8</H2><P>In Corinth, brother went to law with brother, and that before unbelievers, to be judged before the unrighteous, and not before the saints. This took place in a church established by Paul. The apostle charged the brothers of this kind to realize that it is altogether a defeat for them that they have lawsuits among themselves, and that they should rather be wronged and rather be defrauded, that is, suffer loss, bear the cross. This is the best way to solve a problem that concerns material gain or loss.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. THE TEST OF THE CORINTHIAN BELIEVERS<br>EXAMINING PAUL AS TO HIS QUALIFICATION<br>FOR BEING AN APOSTLE&#151;1 CORINTHIANS 9:3</H2><P>Paul made a defense for himself with the signs of his apostleship, and he took a strong stand concerning all his rights as an apostle (vv. 1-14; 2 Cor. 12:11-12). But for the sake of the spreading of the gospel, he had not used all the rights of his apostleship (1 Cor. 9:15-23).</P><P>It seems that Paul was vindicating himself in taking care of this case, but he did it in this way not for his own gain, but for the profit of the church, which would have suffered a great loss by doubting his qualification for being an apostle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI. THE TEST OF THE BELIEVERS PARTAKING<br>OF THE LORD'S TABLE UNWORTHILY&#151;<br>1 CORINTHIANS 11:19-22, 27</H2><P>In dealing with this problem, Paul said that parties, sects, are unavoidable among the believers, that those who are approved may become manifest among the believers (v. 19). This was the reason Paul gave for such things happening in the churches established by him. This kind of trouble is a sifting that shows whether or not we are approved. The word approved can also be translated experienced. Our being approved indicates that we are experienced and thus, that it is not easy for us to participate in any kind of party.</P><P>This is the way in the experience of life to deal with such a case of trouble that indicates the shortage of growth in the spiritual life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XII. THE TEST OF SOME BELIEVERS IN CORINTH<br>SAYING THAT THERE IS NO RESURRECTION OF<br>THE DEAD&#151;1 CORINTHIANS 15:12</H2><P>I do not believe that anyone among us has ever said that there is no resurrection of the dead. Therefore, in this sense we might be a little better than the churches established by Paul. In facing this test, the apostle corrected the heresy by unveiling the truth of resurrection (vv. 12-57) and by testifying to the fact of resurrection by the power and effectiveness of the resurrection of Christ (vv. 3-11). In 1 Corinthians 15:10, Paul said, "..not I, but the grace of God." The grace of God is the resurrected Christ. Christ in resurrection is the grace of God. Thus, Paul testified to the fact of resurrection not only by the power but also by the effectiveness of the resurrection of Christ, which he himself had experienced.</P><P>Paul's way of taking care of this test of heresy was excellent; but it requires the adequate knowledge of the divine truth in the New Testament teaching and the sufficient experience of the reality of the divine truth. Hence, we need to endeavor to get into the divine truths and to experience the reality of the divine truths that we may be able to take care of this kind of problem for the churches' profit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIII. THE TEST OF THE DISOBEDIENCE OF SOME OF<br>THE CORINTHIAN BELIEVERS&#151;2 CORINTHIANS 10:2-10</H2><P>In facing such a test, the apostles first fought the spiritual warfare to overthrow the strongholds in the believers' minds and to take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ (vv. 3-5). Then the apostles eventually would punish all disobedience among the believers (v. 6). Paul did not say that they would take revenge on persons, but that they would punish the disobedience of the disobedient ones.</P><P>To take care of such a case related to the spiritual warfare requires the spiritual insight to see thoroughly that the source of such a case is not in man but in the evil power of Satan and needs the ability in the divine life to fight against the evil source.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIV. THE TEST OF SOME PREACHING ANOTHER JESUS,<br>MINISTERING A DIFFERENT SPIRIT OR A DIFFERENT<br>GOSPEL, YET THE BELIEVERS IN CORINTH<br>BEARING WELL WITH THEM&#151;2 CORINTHIANS 11:4</H2><P>It is difficult to believe that in the apostolic church such a thing could have taken place. In Greek, bear well with him was used in an ironic sense. The Corinthian believers bore well with the heretical preachers. Taking this as a base, Paul said, ironically, that since they bore well with those heretical preachers, they should bear well with his boasting. The apostle boasted of his apostleship and his virtuous conduct by listing many items concerning himself (vv. 5-33). This shows that sometimes it is necessary to boast, making a defense and taking a standing for the benefit of the churches and the saints.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XV. THE TEST OF SOME FLESHLY CORINTHIAN BELIEVERS<br>CHARGING THAT THE APOSTLE, BEING CRAFTY,<br>TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THEM WITH GUILE THROUGH TITUS,<br>WHO TOOK CARE OF THE GIFTS<br>FOR THE JEWISH BELIEVERS&#151;<br>2 CORINTHIANS 12:16-18a</H2><P>The Corinthians accused Paul of sending Titus to collect the offerings for the Jewish saints in Judea and, by so doing, stealing money from them in guile. To this the apostle responded that both he and Titus walked in the same spirit and in the same steps (v. 18b). In fact, the apostle, like parents for their children, would most gladly have spent (money) and been utterly spent, that is, exhausted (himself), on behalf of the believers' souls (vv. 14-15).</P><P>This shows that the Apostle Paul, when slandered by the fleshly believers, did vindicate his honesty and generosity for the benefit of the evil-intentioned slanderers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVI. THE TEST OF SOME JEWISH BELIEVERS<br>TROUBLING THE GALATIAN BELIEVERS AND<br>DESIRING TO PERVERT THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST<br>WITH A DIFFERENT GOSPEL, THAT IS, THE JUDAIC<br>OBSERVANCES OF THE LAW&#151;GALATIANS 1:6-7</H2><P>The Judaizers considered the observing of the law a gospel. The apostle cursed these heretical Jewish preachers (vv. 8-9). The apostle, a slave of Christ, was not persuading men or seeking to please men (v. 10). Thus, he condemned the heretical ones. For the truth of the gospel we need to learn of the apostle's faithfulness, frankness, and boldness in cursing the heretics and not trying to please men.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVII. THE TEST OF PETER BEING HYPOCRITICAL<br>IN RELATION TO THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL<br>DUE TO HIS FEARING OF THE BELIEVERS<br>OF THE CIRCUMCISION&#151;GALATIANS 2:12-13</H2><P>Paul opposed and condemned Peter to his face and rebuked him in front of all (vv. 11, 14). In doing this, Paul was not merciful, and many would consider him unwise. Later, however, Peter still recommended Paul and confirmed his teachings as having the same standing as the rest of the Scriptures (2 Pet. 3:15-16).</P><P>Paul was faithful to the truth of the gospel and honest toward Peter for his correction, and Peter was humble in bearing Paul's rebuking. In his old age, Peter wrote a letter in which he recommended Paul highly and confirmed the standing of his writings among the Scriptures. We all need to learn of both Paul and Peter in their spiritual virtues.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVIII. THE TEST OF A BROTHER BEING OVERTAKEN<br>IN SOME OFFENSE&#151;GALATIANS 6:1</H2><P>The apostle instructed the believers, saying that the spiritual ones should restore such a one in a spirit of meekness. It is common for believers to be overtaken in some offense. Those who restore such a one should consider themselves lest they also be tempted. To take care of such a case of restoration, there is the need of spiritual maturity with a heart that loves the brother and with a burden to recover him. In carrying out such a restoration, we must do it in fear and with consideration, not in a light and careless way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIX. THE TEST OF SOME PREACHING CHRIST<br>BECAUSE OF ENVY AND STRIFE, OUT OF RIVALRY,<br>NOT PURELY, THINKING TO RAISE UP AFFLICTION<br>IN THE APOSTLE PAUL'S BONDS&#151;PHILIPPIANS 1:15, 17</H2><P>When Paul was in prison, the Judaizers made more trouble for him. Paul rejoiced in that Christ was announced even in pretense (v. 18). Yet Paul considered those Judaic preachers dogs, evil workers, and the concision, and warned the saints in Philippi to beware of them as such (3:2). On the one hand, Paul rejoiced over their preaching, and on the other hand, he considered them dogs, evil workers, and the concision. (Concision is a term of contempt for circumcision.) We need to learn of Paul in his discernment in judging things. In this case, the preaching of Christ was good, but the preachers were evil in their preaching because of envy, strife, and rivalry, and with a purpose to afflict others. We should not condemn the preaching because of the evil preacher, nor should we accept the evil preacher because of his good preaching.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XX. THE TEST OF TWO SISTERS,<br>EUODIAS AND SYNTYCHE, BEING DIFFERENT IN THEIR THINKING&#151;PHILIPPIANS 4:2</H2><P>It is easy for sisters to be different in their thinking. The apostle besought the two sisters to think the same thing in the Lord, and he asked his genuine yokefellow to assist the two sisters, who contended with him in the gospel (v. 3). The way the apostle took care of this case was gentle and loving. Gentleness and loving consideration for others are always necessary weapons in correcting others' mistakes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXI. THE TEST OF WRONG TEACHING, EITHER BY<br>SPIRIT, OR BY WORD, OR BY A LETTER IN THE NAME<br>OF THE APOSTLES, CONCERNING THE DAY<br>OF THE LORD'S COMING&#151;2 THESSALONIANS 2:2</H2><P>The apostle warned the believers not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed and not to be deceived in any way (vv. 2a, 3a). He then rendered the proper teaching to the believers concerning the day of the Lord's appearing (vv. 3b-8). To solve this kind of problem, the right way is to give people the proper teaching.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXII. THE TEST OF SOME WALKING<br>AMONG THE BELIEVERS DISORDERLY,<br>WORKING AT NOTHING, BUT BEING BUSYBODIES&#151;<br>2 THESSALONIANS 3:11</H2><P>The apostle gave the believers the charge that if anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat (v. 10). The apostle also charged and entreated in the Lord that working with quietness they might eat their own bread (v. 12). The apostle's way in dealing with this case was very practical.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXIII. THE TEST OF CERTAIN ONES<br>TEACHING DIFFERENTLY,<br>OCCUPYING THEMSELVES WITH THINGS<br>OTHER THAN GOD'S ECONOMY, WHICH IS IN FAITH&#151;<br>1 TIMOTHY 1:3-4</H2><P>The apostle urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently. The apostle also gave the correcting word according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, with which he was entrusted (vv. 5-11).</P><P>To take care of such a case, we should not merely correct, but should supply the proper teachings to replace the wrong teachings. In taking care of such a problem that concerns God's economy, we need the adequate knowledge of the holy Word, which conveys the full revelation of God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXIV. THE TEST OF SOME DEPARTING<br>FROM THE FAITH, GIVING HEED TO DECEIVING<br>SPIRITS AND TEACHINGS OF DEMONS<br>IN THE HYPOCRISY OF MEN WHO SPEAK LIES&#151;<br>1 TIMOTHY 4:1-2</H2><P>The apostle gave the correcting word (vv. 3-5). The apostle also charged Timothy to lay these things before the brothers so that Timothy would be a good minister of Christ, being nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which he had closely followed (v. 6). To take care of this test, we need to have a great deal of learning, as Paul had.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXV. THE TEST OF AN ELDER COMMITTING SIN<br>AND BEING ACCUSED BY THE BELIEVERS&#151;<br>1 TIMOTHY 5:19-20</H2><P>The apostle charged Timothy not to receive an accusation against an elder without two or three witnesses, and charged him to reprove the sinning elder before all that the rest might be in fear. The apostle also solemnly charged Timothy before God, Christ, and the chosen angels to keep the apostle's words without prejudice, doing nothing by way of partiality (v. 21). Here we can see the frankness of the apostle, and also his faithfulness. He charged Timothy not just by himself, but before God, before Christ, and even before the chosen angels. The eldership is related to God's authority. It is for this reason that Paul mentioned the angels here, since the angels are subject to God's authority.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXVI. THE TEST OF ALL THE BELIEVERS IN ASIA<br>TURNING AWAY FROM PAUL&#151;2 TIMOTHY 1:15</H2><P>The turning away in this case probably did not constitute a division. It surely was a separation that damaged the oneness of the Body of Christ. Nevertheless, the Apostle Paul was altogether not affected; rather, he encouraged Timothy to be empowered in the grace of the Lord (2:1). If we are going to take care of such a case, we must not be shaken by anyone's turning away from the Lord's ministry, but must be strong in the power of the Lord's grace for God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXVII. THE TEST<br>OF THE PROFANE WORD BEING SPREAD<br>LIKE GANGRENE BY THE PARTY<br>OF HYMENAEUS AND PHILETUS, WHO MISAIMED<br>CONCERNING THE TRUTH, SAYING THAT<br>THE RESURRECTION HAD ALREADY TAKEN PLACE,<br>AND OVERTHREW THE FAITH OF SOME&#151;<br>2 TIMOTHY 2:17-18</H2><P>In this section of the Word, Paul exposed the names of two heretics, Hymenaeus and Philetus. The Apostle Paul had the assurance that the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, "The Lord knows those who are His," and "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness" (v. 19). In spite of the heresy being spread like gangrene, God has a standing, namely, that His faithful ones who call on the name of the Lord would depart from unrighteousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXVIII. THE TEST OF MEN BEING LOVERS OF SELF,<br>LOVERS OF MONEY, AND LOVERS OF PLEASURE<br>RATHER THAN LOVERS OF GOD,<br>HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS BUT HAVING DENIED<br>ITS POWER, MEN CORRUPTED IN MIND, DISAPPROVED<br>CONCERNING THE FAITH&#151;2 TIMOTHY 3:2-8</H2><P>To face this test, the Apostle Paul reminded Timothy that he had closely followed the apostle's teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, endurance, persecutions, and sufferings (vv. 9-11a). This indicates that to face such a test we need to be an example in teaching and conduct in the days of apostasy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXIX. THE TEST OF DEMAS HAVING LOVED<br>THE PRESENT AGE, FORSAKING PAUL&#151;<br>2 TIMOTHY 4:10</H2><P>Demas' forsaking of Paul also should not be considered a division, but was a separation, which is always a damage to the oneness in the Body of Christ. However, Paul was not discouraged even at the time of his martyrdom (v. 6); rather, he was still very active in taking care of his co-workers and all the necessary things (vv. 11-13). This should be a pattern to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXX. THE TEST OF ALEXANDER THE COPPERSMITH<br>HAVING DONE MANY THINGS AGAINST PAUL&#151;<br>2 TIMOTHY 4:14</H2><P>The Apostle Paul put his trust in the Lord concerning the evil attacks. He believed that the Lord would deliver him from every evil work and would save him unto His heavenly kingdom (v. 18). He also had the assurance that the Lord will award to him the crown of righteousness at the Lord's appearing for his participation in the Lord's kingdom (vv. 8, 1). This was the apostle's way to face all the adverse situations. We should learn of him.</P><P>In facing the above five tests by exposing them to Timothy, the Apostle Paul could not avoid the mentioning of the names of five persons: Phygelus, Hermogenes, Hymenaeus, Philetus, and Alexander the coppersmith (1:15; 2:17; 4:14). This indicates that sometimes in dealing with some negative things that greatly damage the interest of the Lord, we may be forced to mention the names of those who are involved in the negative things, for the building up of the positive saints.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXI. THE TEST OF A FACTIOUS, SECTARIAN MAN&#151;<br>TITUS 3:10-11</H2><P>We should refuse such a one after a first and second admonition, knowing that such a one has been perverted and sins, being self-condemned. To refuse such a one is to exercise to quarantine him. When a believer is divisive, factious, sectarian, he becomes contagious; therefore, we need to refuse him, that is, to quarantine him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXII. THE TEST OF ANYONE<br>AMONG THE BELIEVERS BEING LED ASTRAY<br>FROM THE TRUTH&#151;<br>JAMES 5:19-20</H2><P>Someone should turn him back, knowing that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save his soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins. This is to restore from his sins a brother who is erring in the truth. To do this requires love, spirituality, and adequate knowledge.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXIII. THE TEST OF FALSE TEACHERS<br>AMONG THE BELIEVERS WHO SECRETLY BRING IN<br>DESTRUCTIVE HERESIES, EVEN DENYING THE<br>MASTER WHO BOUGHT THEM, AND MANY FOLLOWING<br>THEIR LICENTIOUSNESS, BECAUSE OF WHOM<br>THE WAY OF THE TRUTH WILL BE REVILED;<br>BY COVETOUSNESS WITH FABRICATED WORDS<br>THEY MAKE MERCHANDISE OF THE BELIEVERS&#151;<br>2 PETER 2:1-3</H2><P>The false teachers in this case were heretics in the ancient time, like today's modernists. For them the judgment of old is not idle, and their destruction does not slumber. The believers should take Noah, a herald of righteousness, and righteous Lot as examples (vv. 5, 7). In a situation of destructive heresies, we should learn how to follow the faithful saints who stand fast in the truth against any kind of heresies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXIV. THE TEST OF MOCKERS MOCKING<br>ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN LUSTS, SAYING,<br>"WHERE IS THE PROMISE OF HIS COMING?"&#151;<br>2 PETER 3:3-4</H2><P>The truth is hidden from the heretical mockers by their own willfulness (v. 5a). Because they are willfully ignorant, the truth in the word of God spoken by the prophets in the Scriptures is covered from their sight. Therefore, Peter reminded the believers to remember the word of God spoken by the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament apostles (vv. 1-2, 5b, 7). This indicates that to take care of such a case of heresy, we need to help the believers to hold to the holy Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXV. THE TEST OF MANY ANTICHRISTS<br>HAVING COME&#151;1 JOHN 2:18</H2><P>The antichrists deny that Jesus is the Christ (v. 22). The believers should abide in the Lord according to His anointing (vv. 20, 27). To take care of this case of heresy, we need the experience of abiding in the Lord according to His anointing, and we should charge the believers not to listen to the heretical teaching, but to take care of the inner anointing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXVI. THE TEST OF THE SPIRIT THAT<br>DOES NOT CONFESS JESUS CHRIST HAVING COME<br>IN THE FLESH&#151;1 JOHN 4:1-6</H2><P>This again is a case of heresy. The spirit in this case is not out of God but is of the antichrist; it is not the Spirit of truth but the spirit of deception. The antichrists are out of the world; the believers are out of God. The believers have overcome the false prophets in verse 1 and the antichrist in verse 3, because greater is He who is in the believers than he who is in the world.</P><P>To confront such a case of heresy, we need the experience of 1) the Triune God as the all-inclusive, anointing Spirit, who is in us, being greater than Satan as the evil spirit who is in the world, and 2) the world having been overcome by us through the indwelling Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXVII. THE TEST OF A BELIEVER SEEING<br>A BROTHER SINNING A SIN NOT UNTO DEATH&#151;<br>1 JOHN 5:16</H2><P>He should ask, that is, pray, for the sinning one. By so doing, he will give life to such a one. To give life to such a one is to minister life to the sinning one in our contacting of him. This requires us to have a certain amount of the divine love to care for the sinning one, and to have a certain degree of growth in the divine life that we may have the riches of the divine life to share with him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXVIII. THE TEST OF MANY DECEIVERS,<br>AS ANTICHRISTS, GOING OUT INTO THE WORLD,<br>NOT CONFESSING JESUS CHRIST COMING<br>IN THE FLESH BUT GOING BEYOND<br>THE TEACHING OF CHRIST&#151;<br>2 JOHN 7, 9-11</H2><P>This is the case involving the greatest heresy. The Apostle John charged the believers not to receive the heretical antichrists into their houses and even not to say to the heretics, "Rejoice!" (v. 10). To say "Rejoice" to someone is to greet him. He who says to these heretics, "Rejoice," shares in their heretical, evil works (v. 11). This is a strong quarantine exercised over the heretics who do not confess the incarnation of Christ, who came in the flesh. Here there is the need of our boldness and frankness to keep the divine truth concerning Christ's divine person in His divinity and humanity. Any compromise in dealing with heresies concerning Christ's person should be abandoned.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXIX. THE TEST OF DIOTREPHES,<br>WHO LOVED TO BE FIRST IN THE CHURCH<br>IN WHICH GAIUS WAS&#151;3 JOHN 9, 1</H2><P>Diotrephes did not receive the apostles and babbled against them with evil words; neither did he receive the brothers, and those intending to do so he forbade and cast them out of the church. If the Apostle John would have come to the church, he would have brought Diotrephes' works to the remembrance of the believers (v. 10). We need to be careful in dealing with such a case. Diotrephes' actions surely constituted a great sin. However, the apostle did not indicate that Diotrephes' sin was intolerable to the extent that he needed to be quarantined. John did not tell us to quarantine such a person. Even sinful acts such as this in the church life should be dealt with through much consideration, with the expectation that the sinful acts could be corrected after a certain amount of loving rebuking and punishment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XL. THE TEST OF THOSE WHO<br>HAVE GONE IN THE WAY OF CAIN,<br>POURED THEMSELVES OUT IN THE ERROR<br>OF BALAAM FOR REWARD, AND<br>PERISHED IN THE REBELLION OF KORAH,<br>GOING ON ACCORDING TO THEIR LUSTS, ADMIRING<br>PERSONS FOR THE SAKE OF ADVANTAGE&#151;<br>JUDE 11, 16</H2><P>These apostates were hidden reefs in the believers' love feasts, shepherds who fed themselves, waterless clouds, autumn trees without fruit, wild waves of the sea, and wandering stars (vv. 12-13). Jude exhorted the believers to remember the words spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, who said that in the last time there will be mockers going on according to their own ungodly lusts, making separations, soulish, not having spirit (vv. 17-19). Jude exhorted the believers also to build up themselves in their most holy faith, pray in the Holy Spirit, and keep themselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life (v. 20). This shows that in such a situation of apostasy, the best way for us is to exhort the believers in the positive way that Jude did.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XLI. THE TEST OF SOME IN EPHESUS<br>CALLING THEMSELVES APOSTLES<br>AND NOT BEING SUCH&#151;<br>REVELATION 2:1a, 2</H2><P>What these false apostles did in their false assuming and pretense was a great damage, carried out by Satan, to the building up of the Body of Christ (2 Cor. 11:13-15). This was a real test of the genuine oneness of the Body of Christ. We should follow the positive example of the church in Ephesus by trying these false apostles and finding them to be false.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XLII. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN EPHESUS<br>LEAVING ITS FIRST LOVE&#151;REVELATION 2:4</H2><P>The church in Ephesus was praised by the Lord for its works, labor, endurance, not bearing evil men, and trying the false apostles and finding them false (v. 2). However, it was rebuked by the Lord for leaving its first love. To leave the first love is to become indifferent and dormant in the appreciation of the Lord's excellency and preciousness and also in gratitude for the Lord's love in His redemptive work for us. This is the root of the degradation of the church through the centuries. For this the Lord admonished the church in Ephesus to repent; otherwise, its lampstand would be removed. The removing of the lampstand implies the losing of the power to shine in the darkness and to testify for the Lord. The Lord's admonishing is the way for us to take care of a case of leaving the first love towards the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XLIII. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN PERGAMOS<br>BEING SETTLED IN THE WORLD, WHERE SATAN'S<br>DWELLING AND THRONE ARE&#151;<br>REVELATION 2:12a, 13</H2><P>The church in Pergamos became worldly and was even settled in the world, where Satan's dwelling and throne are. This caused her to be joined with Satan in the satanic cosmos&#151;the system of darkness&#151;which is against God and His economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XLIV. THE TEST OF SOME IN PERGAMOS<br>HOLDING THE TEACHING OF BALAAM, WHO CAUSED<br>THE SONS OF ISRAEL TO STUMBLE IN EATING<br>IDOL SACRIFICES AND COMMITTING FORNICATION&#151;<br>REVELATION 2:14</H2><P>Becoming worldly and even settled in the world led some members of the church to hold the teaching that caused the people of God to stumble in eating idol sacrifices and committing fornication. Becoming worldly always issues in idolatry and fornication. These three always go together, one along with another, damaging the people of God in their carrying out of God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XLV. THE TEST OF SOME IN PERGAMOS<br>HOLDING THE TEACHING OF THE NICOLAITANS&#151;<br>REVELATION 2:15</H2><P>The Nicolaitans should be a group of people who esteemed themselves higher than the common believers. They constituted a hierarchy that was versus the building up of the Body of Christ, like the hierarchy in Catholicism and Protestantism. Such a hierarchy is hated by the Lord (v. 6) because it destroys God's New Testament economy concerning the church.</P><P>To deal with such a complicated case as the case of the church in Pergamos being one with the world and some of its members holding the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans requires us to be one with the Lord in standing against the world as the satanic system of darkness, and requires us to hate idolatry, spiritual fornication, and the sin of hierarchy&#151;the evil system of organization in religion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XLVI. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN THYATIRA<br>TOLERATING THE WOMAN JEZEBEL, WHO<br>TAUGHT AND LED THE LORD'S SLAVES ASTRAY<br>TO COMMIT FORNICATION AND TO EAT<br>IDOL SACRIFICES&#151;<br>REVELATION 2:18a, 20</H2><P>Jezebel was the pagan wife of King Ahab (1 Kings 16:31). She was a type of the apostate Catholic Church and a figure of the woman prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 13:33, who brought evil, heretical, and pagan things as leaven into the teaching concerning Christ, and who became the great prostitute in Revelation 17, who mixes abominations with the divine things and who leads the Lord's slaves astray to commit fornication and to worship idols. Of all these she is not willing to repent, and for all these the Lord will destroy her (Rev. 2:21-23).</P><P>To handle such a great case of the apostasy of the degraded church, we need to be equipped with the knowledge of the history of the church's degradation and with the knowledge of the divine revelation concerning the church in God's New Testament economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XLVII. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN SARDIS<br>HAVING A NAME THAT IT WAS LIVING,<br>BUT IT WAS DEAD&#151;REVELATION 3:1</H2><P>This depicts the real situation of the present Protestant churches&#151;seemingly living but actually dead.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XLVIII. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN SARDIS<br>WITH THE REMAINING THINGS BEING ABOUT TO DIE&#151;<br>REVELATION 3:2a</H2><P>This also is a picture of the Protestant churches, with which some of the positive things remain but are about to die. Every item of the positive things inherited and received by the present Protestant churches remains in a dying situation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XLIX. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN SARDIS<br>HAVING ITS WORKS NOT FOUND BY CHRIST<br>COMPLETED BEFORE GOD&#151;<br>REVELATION 3:2b</H2><P>This also is a portrait of the present Protestant churches, concerning which no work has been found by the Lord completed before God.</P><P>The three cases related to the church in Sardis all indicate a shortage of the vigor of the divine life and a lack of the power of the Holy Spirit. To take care of these cases would force us to be enriched in the vigorous divine life and to be empowered in the powerful Holy Spirit. Only the vigor of the divine life and the power of the Holy Spirit can make us living, fresh, and complete.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>L. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA<br>BEING NEITHER COLD NOR HOT&#151;<br>REVELATION 3:14a, 15-16</H2><P>The main meaning of the Greek name Laodicea is the opinion, the judgment, of the people. When a local church is full of peoples' opinions, it surely will become neither cold nor hot. Because of its lukewarmness, such a church will suffer being vomited out of the Lord's mouth. This is to be given up by the Lord because the taste of that church is repulsive. Thus, a church that is full of peoples' opinions, peoples' judgments, is terrible. Even we would reject such a church in the practice of the church life, not to mention that the Lord would vomit it out. Peoples' opinions are versus God's judgment and authority. This is why the Lord is standing at the door of the church in Laodicea (v. 20), indicating that the Lord has been rejected by that church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LI. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA<br>BOASTING, "I AM RICH AND HAVE BECOME RICH<br>AND HAVE NEED OF NOTHING," NOT KNOWING<br>THAT IT WAS WRETCHED, MISERABLE,<br>POOR, BLIND, AND NAKED&#151;<br>REVELATION 3:17</H2><P>An opinionated and lukewarm church would always be proud and boast of its riches, thinking that it has need of nothing, but not knowing its wretchedness, miserableness, poverty, blindness, and nakedness. Hence, the loving and merciful Lord counsels such a church to buy, to obtain at a cost from Him, refined gold (the tested faith for partaking of the divine nature), white garments (the conduct approvable to the Lord), and anointing eye salve (the anointing Spirit, the Lord Himself as the life-giving Spirit) as their remedies (v. 18).</P><P>The above items, XLI to LI, are all the negative items in which the seven local churches in Asia were different from one another. The seven churches as the seven golden lampstands were all identical in the positive things concerning the testimony of Christ. But they were abnormally different in these eleven cases, all of which are serious tests that have done tremendous damage to the oneness of the organic Body of Christ. Hence, the Lord advised all seven churches to overcome all these tests that they might be rewarded (2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). Otherwise, they will be punished (2:5, 11&#151;by implication&#151;16, 22-23; 3:3, 11, 16).</P><P>The seven local churches in Asia were sovereignly arranged by the Lord so that they might typify all the churches in the seven stages of the church age. Thus, regardless of what stage we are in as a local church, we should take care of all the eleven cases of negative things in the proper way as shown in Revelation 2 and 3. May the Lord have mercy on us and afford us His grace and blessing that we might not be negligent and indifferent in dealing with all these oneness-damaging problems.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A CONCLUDING WORD</H2><P>Among the fifty-one cases listed above, thirty-five, the majority, are of different kinds and were all (except case IV) taken care of positively by various adequate ways, such as the proper arrangement of the service in case I, testifying according to the truth in case II, and recovering in a spirit of meekness a brother overtaken in an offense in case XVIII, leaving only sixteen, the minority, to be taken care of in the way of quarantine. This indicates that, according to His loving concern over His dear redeemed saints, the Lord's intention concerning all the believers who are involved in the tests of the oneness of His Body and of the one accord of His church is to adjust, correct, rescue, recover, and perfect them so that He can carry out the building up of His organic Body.</P><P>Among the sixteen cases remaining to be dealt with in the way of quarantine, there are two cases of division (cases V and XXXI), thirteen cases of heresy (cases III, XII, XVI, XXIV, XXVII, XXXIII, XXXIV, XXXV, XXXVI, XXXVIII, XL, XLIV, and XLVI), and one case of gross sin (case VIII).</P><P>Concerning the first case of division (case V), the Apostle Paul decisively and emphatically gave us a strong charge that we should carry out a quarantine by "turning away from" the divisive persons (Rom. 16:17). Concerning the second case of division (case XXXI), the Apostle Paul also charged us strongly and decisively to exercise a stern quarantine by refusing the factious, divisive person (Titus 3:10).</P><P>As to the thirteen cases of heresy, case III was taken care of by the proper fellowship according to the truth (Acts 15:1-31); cases XII, XXIV, XXXV, and XXXVI were taken care of by teaching; case XVI was dealt with by cursing the heretics (Gal. 1:8-9); cases XXVII, XXXIII, XXXIV, and XL were taken care of by warning the saints; cases XLIV and XLVI were dealt with by condemnation; and case XXXVIII was dealt with by the exercising of a quarantine. In case XXXVIII, the Apostle John sharply and emphatically charged us not to receive into our house a heretic who does not confess Christ's coming in the flesh but goes beyond the teaching of Christ, and even not to greet him, that we may not share in his evil works (2 John 7, 9-11).</P><P>Concerning case VIII, a case of gross sin, the Apostle Paul took care of it first by judging the sinning one in the name of the Lord and delivering him to Satan for destruction of the flesh (1 Cor. 5:3-5), and then by solemnly charging the saints to exercise to quarantine the sinning one by not eating with him and removing him from the fellowship in the church (1 Cor. 5:11, 13).</P><P>Among all the tests of the oneness of the Body and of the one accord of the church listed above, only three&#151;divisions, heresies, and fornication&#151;are intolerable and need a quarantine by the churches and the saints according to the apostles' teaching. Divisions damage the Body of Christ, and heresies insult the person of Christ and also damage the work of Christ. Thus, divisions are related negatively to the Body of Christ, and heresies are related negatively to Christ in His person and His work. Fornication is a gross sin that damages the humanity made by God to be the members of the Body of Christ. If these three things are taking place in the church, the Body of Christ would be annulled, the very Christ would be altogether damaged, and the humanity used as the constituents of the Body of Christ would be fully corrupted. Therefore, these three problems cannot be tolerated, and we should exercise to quarantine those who are involved in these problems, in order to preserve the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>I hope that we will spend some time to learn the proper way to face each kind of problem. We all must be impressed that among so many kinds of problems, only three are intolerable. Even with those involved in the three intolerable sins, we must be careful to deal with them in our spirit by the Spirit. We should be careful to carry out a quarantine over them to restrict the spreading of the contagious diseases. Concerning all the others, we must exercise our longsuffering, with love, in hope of recovering them. There might be a few hopeless cases. Concerning the three problems of division, heresy, and gross sin, we need to be very careful in dealing with those involved, in order that the building up of the Body of Christ may proceed in a proper way, not allowing the Body of Christ to be damaged by divisions, Christ to be damaged by heresies, and the humanity that is for the Lord's Body to be damaged by gross sins. Such a study of fifty-one cases in the New Testament as tests of the genuine oneness and the proper one accord helps us to find the proper way to solve our present problem in the rebellion among us. Thus, it also is a part of the scriptural remedy for our problem.</P><P>We have studied the genuine oneness in chapter three, the proper one accord in chapter four, and the fifty-one negative cases as tests of the genuine oneness and of the proper one accord in this chapter. I consider the genuine oneness as our constitution, the proper one accord as our law, and the tests as cases of judgment. The case of the present rebellion in the Lord's recovery should be judged according to our constitution (the genuine oneness), our law (the proper one accord), and the fifty-one cases for reference. If a just judgment were to be rendered, none of the fifty-one cases could be used as an example to judge any item of the dissenting ones' accusations against us as a case that requires a quarantine. In contrast, there are cases on the list of tests that can be used as strong examples to judge our case against the dissenting ones as a case that needs a thorough quarantine.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE WAY TO FACE<br>THE PRESENT DIVISIVE SITUATION<br>IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:15; 2 John 1-2; 3 John 3-4; Rom. 16:17; Titus 3:10; 2 John 7-11; 1 Cor. 5:2, 11-13; 11:19; 4:1-5; 2 Cor. 5:10</H1><P>In this chapter we shall cover the way to face the present divisive situation in the Lord's recovery. But before we do this, I would like to present to you a list of truths that can help us to clear up the dimmed vision of the Lord's recovery among us today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE PRACTICAL TRUTHS<br>VERSUS THE DISSENTING ACCUSATIONS</H2><P>In his withdrawal from the eldership of the church in Anaheim on March 19, 1989, Brother John Ingalls charged us with a number of accusations concerning our present situation. Hence, I have the burden to present to the saints in the Lord's recovery some truths that will blow away the cloud that has dimmed the clear vision of the Lord's recovery among us, and will bring back to us a clear sky with a clear view in the recovery. These practical truths are versus some of John's dissenting accusations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;the Change<br>of the Nature of the Lord's Recovery</H2><P>"The nature of what we call the Lord's recovery has changed."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>The Lord's recovery is the recovery of:</P><P>A.The church ground of oneness versus division.<br>B.The church as the organic Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.<br>C.The all-inclusive Christ as the mystery of God.<br>D.The life-giving and compound Spirit.<br>E.The divine life in Christ.<br>F.The divine revelation of the holy Word.</P><P>These six items are the main contents of the Lord's recovery, and the nature of the Lord's recovery should be the very nature of the elements of these items as the contents of the Lord's recovery. Whatever changes have been made in our practice up to the present time, not one of them can be considered as something that has caused the Lord's recovery to change in its nature.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;the Emphasizing<br>of the Building Up of the Ministry<br>More Than the Local Churches</H2><P>"There has been a change of emphasis to the building up of the work or the ministry more than the local churches...it seems that in the past years...there has been more emphasis on the churches being for the ministry. The ministry has been promoted, exalted, and built up, and the churches have suffered greatly in the process."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>The basic problem in the matter that John covers in this accusation concerns the understanding of the relationship between the ministry and the churches. Concerning the relationship between the ministry or the work and the churches, it has been our practice, from Brother Nee's time up to the present time, that whatever the ministry or the work does is absolutely for the churches. Even in the building up of the work or the ministry, the purpose and goal are for the churches. The initial purpose and final goal of our ministry or work are absolutely and utterly for the churches. We have received our ministry from the Lord with a definite commission, that is, to build up the churches as the organic Body of Christ. Whatever we do&#151;preaching the gospel to save the sinners, feeding the new believers that they may grow, perfecting the saints that they may do the work that the gifted persons can do to build up the Body of Christ, teaching the word and expounding the Bible that the saints may be edified both in the truth and life, training the saints that they may be built up in the Lord's service and work, and even establishing the ministry or the work itself&#151;is for the building up of the churches. Our history has fully proven this.</P><P>In such a practice as ours, we also stress that all the churches with all the saints should cooperate and be one with the ministry, so that the ministry will be strengthened and be more effective, that the churches with all the saints may benefit more in the ultimate goal for the Lord's interest, that is, to have His organic Body fully built up. In the Apostle Paul's ministry, such a coordination (fellowship) and oneness were rendered to him by the churches and the saints. The church in Philippi with all the saints there, and the church in Corinth and the churches in Galatia with the saints, all did this (Phil. 1:5; 4:16, 18; 1 Cor. 16:1-3). The apostle even praised this kind of fellowship as a "good work" begun by the Lord, and believed that the Lord would complete such a good work until the day of His appearing (Phil. 1:6). The thought in John's accusation concerning the relationship between the ministry and the churches with all the saints can only weaken the ministry in its work for the church and deprive the churches and the saints of their enjoyment of the benefit of the ministry's work. Without the cooperation of the churches and the saints, it would be difficult for the ministry to be strong and effective in its work, and without the churches with the saints being one with the ministry, it would be difficult for the Lord's recovery to be prevailing in its spreading. To carry out the New Testament economy of God, the ministry, the churches, and the saints all must be one with one another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>a Great Effort and Promotion<br>to Unite the Saints and the Churches<br>around a Certain Leader and Organization</H2><P>"There has been a great effort and promotion to unite the saints and the churches around a certain leader and organization."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>This kind of great effort and promotion should be condemned. To unite the saints and the churches around a certain leader and organization is to build up a hierarchy. There has never been such a thing in the Lord's recovery from its beginning. However, this does not mean that there is no need for a proper leadership under the Lord that brings the divine revelation to the Lord's people and keeps the Lord's interest from suffering the damage of confusion. According to the New Testament revelation, in the church the elders take the lead (Heb. 13:24; Rom. 12:8), and in the ministry Peter took the lead in the Lord's work among the Jews (Gal. 2:7b), and Paul took the lead in the Lord's work among the Gentiles (Gal. 2:7a; Rom. 11:13). Without the proper leadership under the Lord, the kingdom of God on the earth today would become an anarchy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>the Pressuring of All the Saints and the Churches to Conform to the Ministry in Full Uniformity</H2><P>"There has been much pressure with full expectation that all the saints and the churches will conform to the burden of the ministry and be identical with one another in full uniformity of practice, to carry it out."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>Surely, to have any kind of uniformity is wrong. However, to have intentional differences among the churches also is wrong. The problem lies in the matter of what vision we are under and what motive we have.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>5. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>the Writing of the Letter by the Elders concerning the One Accord</H2><P>"In February 1986 there was an elders' training in Anaheim....At the end of that training, the brothers wrote a letter which, with perhaps two or three exceptions, we all signed....At the present time and for the past year and a half, we have regretted very much that we signed that letter, and even more, that such a letter was ever written. There is no precedent of that in the Word; furthermore, there is no scriptural basis for the contents of such a letter. We agreed in that letter that we would be identical with all the churches, that we would follow the ministry absolutely, and that we realized Brother Lee's leading was indispensable to our oneness. Then, at the bottom of the letter we said that all these things were according to the teaching of the Word of God. But those things are not according to the teaching of the Word, and we regret very much that we subscribed to them. I want to state publicly and make it clear that I would retract my signature."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>The letter John referred to in this accusation is related to the one accord which I spoke about to the elders in February 1986. Now, John and some of those who are with him condemn the writing of that letter. Concerning such a matter, again I would say that it all depends on what vision he and some of those who are with him are under, what view they hold, and what motive they have. In principle, according to the Lord's prayer in John 17 that all His believers would be one, the Lord is always pleased when we, the believers, are one in the things that are for His interest, and the Lord is surely offended if in anything that is for His interest we would not be one. At any rate, to be one is better than to be divided, than not to be one; to be in one accord is better than to be in confusion, in discord. Thank the Lord that those who would retract their signatures from the letter that John spoke about in the above paragraph are few, a small percentage of the more than four hundred who appreciate their signing of that letter. Some of the signers did express to me that they would like to keep that letter, with their signatures, for the sake of history.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>6. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>the Centralization of the Churches and the Work</H2><P>"There has been quite an emphasis, at least in practice, on a kind of centralization of the churches and the work, which we also find contrary to the Word of God."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>In the Lord's recovery there is no such practice of a "centralization of the churches" and a "centralization of the work." We do emphasize that all the churches should be one in the Body of Christ, not by the way of forming a federation but in the way of adequate fellowship in the Spirit in the organic union of the divine life. We also stress that the co-workers should not work independently but corporately under one leadership. It is clearly revealed in the New Testament that the co-workers among the Jews worked together corporately under the leadership of Peter, and the co-workers among the Gentiles worked corporately under the leadership of Paul. This does not mean that all the co-workers are centralized, but it does mean that the co-workers who are working in a certain region all work as one. This is the way to bring in the Lord's blessing. We do not practice any kind of centralization; we treasure only the proper oneness in the Spirit by the divine life, both of which unite us together organically, whether in the church life or in the work for the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>7. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>a Pervasive Control over the Church</H2><P>"There has been a pervasive control exercised over the church. Now at least I can speak for Anaheim. I know this to be a fact, and I'm in a position to know this. There has been much outside influence exercised upon the church which has made it very difficult to go on by getting our leading directly from the Lord. This control has not been exercised so much directly, but very much indirectly, through videos, conferences, trainings, and elders' meetings."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>In this point John condemns "a pervasive control exercised over the church." He also defines this control, saying that "this control has not been exercised so much directly, but very much indirectly, through videos, conferences, trainings, and elders' meetings." Is there among us such "a pervasive control exercised over the church," that is, a control that pervades all the churches? I would say here and now that there is no such thing! I do not exercise any control over any church, nor do I have any intention to do this. Here John has pointed out clearly that "this control has not been exercised so much directly." This word of his indicates definitely that the pervasive control that he condemns is not one that is carried out directly by me or by anyone other than me, but "very much indirectly," as he says, "through videos, conferences, trainings, and elders' meetings." His clear word indicates that the means to carry out the indirect, pervasive control mentioned in his accusation are "videos, conferences, trainings, and elders' meetings." The videos, conferences, trainings, and elders' meetings refer, no doubt, to the messages I have put out at different times and on different occasions. To say that through the messages that I gave I exercised a pervasive control over the church is not true. Whenever I gave a message, I never had the thought to control any church or anyone. In speaking for the Lord, I have only a sincere intention that through the Lord's word that I speak, sinners may be saved, saints may be edified and perfected, and the church may be built up for the carrying out of the New Testament economy of God. The thought of speaking for the Lord with an intention to exercise control over others is evil.</P><P>Here John says also, "At least I can speak for Anaheim. I know this to be a fact, and I'm in a position to know this." "This" must refer to the pervasive control that has been exercised "very much indirectly through videos, conferences, trainings, and elders' meetings," as he indicated. The messages given by me in conferences, trainings, and elders' meetings that were recorded on video were sent to all the churches, not only to the church in Anaheim. Hence, not only John, but all the elders of all the churches who have listened to my tapes are in a position to know this pervasive control. Do some of you brothers, who are the elders of the churches and who are present in this meeting, have the same kind of realization that John has&#151;that I exercise a pervasive control over your churches indirectly through the messages on the videos?</P><P>My messages are always spoken with the Word of God as their base, structure, and element, which always conveys not only the divine revelation and the supply of the divine life, but also regulations, corrections, exhortations, and even reproofs (2 Tim. 3:16). How could John consider my messages, with such contents, a means that I use in order to exercise a pervasive control over the churches? If all the churches had the same kind of realization that John has, what would be left of the building up? This is a real devastation.</P><P>John also says, "There has been much outside influence exercised upon the church." Since what was mentioned in his accusation was an "influence," especially an "outside" influence, it should not refer to anything within but to something outside the church that was under his care. Even if there were such an outside influence, such an outside influence should not be considered as a control that I exercised over the church under his care.</P><P>John went further to say that this outside influence "has made it very difficult to go on by getting our leading directly from the Lord." In the Lord's recovery we work and serve in the Body of Christ. So, in our work and service to the Lord, we are related both to the Lord as our Head and to the ones who work and serve together with us as fellow members of the Lord's Body. Hence, the New Testament teaches us to be subject not only to the Lord but also to one another in the fear of the Lord (Eph. 5:24a, 21). Thus, in the Lord's work and service, in the matter of "getting our leading directly from the Lord," we need to consider our relationship with the ones who work and serve together with us. It is hardly possible for us to receive a leading directly from the Lord without taking care of the ones with whom we work and serve. If we get our leading directly from the Lord without considering the fellow members of the Lord's Body who are laboring with us, we will surely jeopardize the oneness of the Body. We constantly need the cooperation and the coordination to keep us in a balanced situation in which we take care not only of the Lord's leading directly but also of the co-working ones' realization. On the other hand, when we take care of the co-working ones' realization, we should also seek the Lord's leading directly. This way of balance is the safe way and the proper way to save us from being independent, whether intentionally or unintentionally, and to keep the oneness of the Body so that the Body can be built up without the suffering of any loss.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>8. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>the Training Center<br>and the Affiliation under One Leadership</H2><P>"Church history reveals that in the history of one denomination after another, not all started as a denomination....The Lord did something among His people in a fresh way, with His presence and blessing. But after the saints in that group multiplied and other groups were formed, they all agreed together and decided to affiliate in order to preserve what they had received. The second thing they did again and again was to start a training center, a Bible School, or a Seminary to educate their people in the truth they had received. From there on out, it was a full-blown denomination. The first step is affiliation under one leadership; the second is some sort of training center. That is the way group after group has gone, and...we are also going that way."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>We have never had a training center to "educate" our people as "a Bible School, or a Seminary" do. Our training is to train mainly the young saints to grow in the divine life and in the divine truth, to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God, to feed the lambs of the Lord, to perfect the saints, and to build up the organic Body of Christ. We never had the intention to "educate" our people in a system of belief, in a kind of creed that will lead to the formation of a "full-blown denomination"; neither have we ever affiliated the saints in the Lord's recovery "under one leadership." We have never had any kind of "affiliation." What we stress, according to the divine revelation in the holy Word, is the unique oneness both in the church as the organic Body of Christ and in the work to carry out the unique New Testament ministry. For keeping such a oneness according to the heart's desire of the Lord and according to the attributes of oneness that characterize the Body of Christ with the elements of the divine Trinity (Eph. 4:3-6), there is the need of the proper leadership of the elders in the church life and the genuine leadership of the ministers in the Lord's ministry. This is our real practice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>9. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>Exalting Brother Lee above What Is Written</H2><P>"...he [Brother Lee] has been exalted and honored above what is written, according to 1 Corinthians 4:6....We repent of having ourselves taken part in this. One of the brothers said to me at one time, 'I'm going to put a sign up outside the meeting hall here&#151;The Local Church of Witness Lee.' I would hate that there would be in reality any such thing, but there has been a strong tendency toward this. The church should not be the church of anyone but Christ."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>Thank the Lord that, by His grace, the ministry that He has given me has been greatly blessed by Him in the past years. Because of this, in all the years a certain regard has been rendered to me by the dear saints. But compared with the regard that the ancient saints rendered to the Apostle Paul because of his excellent ministry, the regard that I have received from the saints is much less. Paul was never accused of being overly regarded throughout the past centuries. No one ever said that he was "exalted and honored above what is written, according to 1 Corinthians 4:6."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>10. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>Brother Lee and His Ministry Having Been Made<br>a Great Issue and Factor of Division</H2><P>"...A spiritual leader should never be made an issue or a factor of division, but Brother Lee and his ministry have been made a great issue and factor of division among us."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>The first clause of John's word here indicates that he admits that there are spiritual leaders, but the second clause makes an accusation regarding a matter that does not exist. There has never been a "division among us" that was made with me and my ministry as "a great issue and factor." The intention of John, and of those who are for him, in trying to put my ministry aside is the real issue and factor of the division among us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>11. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>the Relationship with the Saints and<br>with the Church Being Made to Depend on<br>the Relationship to Brother Lee</H2><P>"In Matthew 22 the Lord...asked...the question..., 'What do you think of Christ?...' Everyone has to answer that question...But I'm afraid, that question has been changed among us to read this way&#151;'What do you think of Witness Lee? What is your relationship to him?'...Such a question should never become an issue or factor among us, so that our going on or our relationship with the saints and with the church is made to depend on our relationship to him. But this has been the case."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>John said that "our going on or our relationship with the saints and with the church is made to depend on our relationship to him [Witness Lee]." A servant of the Lord who ministers the word of God to the saints is very much related to the saints, and the saints are very much related to him. Hence, such a relationship is not only right but also needed. Therefore, the saints' "going on" and their relationship with each other and with the church should depend on their relationship to the one who ministers the word of God to them. This also is needed. If there were not such a thing, the church could not be healthy and would be left in a miserable state.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>12. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>the Application of the Church Ground<br>in a Divisive and Sectarian Way</H2><P>"...We have...applied this teaching [concerning the ground of oneness] in a divisive and sectarian way, so that we divide ourselves from other Christians. This is due to an improper attitude and application of the truth....I feel that in the local churches we have become very narrow and small; narrow in view, in our outlook, and in our reception of other saints..."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>To take the ground of oneness requires us to be separated from divisive and sectarian Christians, because they are on a divisive and sectarian ground. This does not mean that we are divisive and sectarian. We are standing on the ground of oneness; they are remaining on the ground of division. Thus, the taking of the ground of oneness should not be condemned as "an improper attitude and application of the truth."</P><P>Further, our taking of the ground of oneness surely makes us "narrow and small," because the majority of Christians are taking the broad way and the way of greatness, which we would not take in following Jesus today on this earth outside the camp, bearing His reproach (Heb. 13:13). However, this does not mean that we are "narrow in view." By standing on the ground of oneness, our view has been very much broadened to be the broad view that the Head, Christ, holds over His entire Body universally. And "in our reception of other saints" we are absolutely not narrow; rather, we are as broad as the Lord is in this matter, because we receive, as the Lord and God do (Rom. 14:3; 15:7), every kind of genuine Christian who believes in the Lord Jesus Christ. Our hearts are for them, and our arms and bosom are open to them. Yet regardless of how broad our view is in the receiving of other saints, the majority of the saints will not come to us, because they prefer, and some insist, to remain in their denominations or divisive groups, not having the broad view to care for the whole Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>13. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>Our Attitude toward Other Christians</H2><P>"Our attitude toward other Christians is one of belittling them and thinking we're superior to them. I don't know how many times we've heard this expression, 'Poor Christianity!' We say that we're speaking only of the system, not of the people, but our attitude has definitely spilled over to the people..."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>Concerning John's accusation in this item, we must distinguish Christianity from the Christians and the genuine church that is according to the divine revelation of the New Testament. In Matthew 13 the Lord Jesus showed us clearly in His parables the difference between the wheat (the real Christians) and the tares (the nominal Christians), the difference between meal (fine flour&#151;Christ as food to God and men) and leaven (evil things such as heresies, false teachings, and evil practices), the difference between the mustard seed (Christ as the seed of life) and a big tree (the abnormal development of the church&#151;Christianity), and the difference between the tares, leaven, and the abnormally developed tree, and the treasure hidden in the field (the kingdom of the heavens) and the pearl of great value (the genuine church). The nominal Christians, the heresies, the evil practices, and the abnormal development have transmuted the church, which is composed of the genuine Christians and Christ as the seed of life and the spiritual food to be the precious pearl and the hidden treasure, into Christianity, which is not acceptable to God. Today, for the Lord's recovery, we must realize the difference between the genuine church, composed of the real Christians, and the abnormal Christianity. When we say "Poor Christianity!" we refer to the abnormal Christianity, with no intention of belittling or despising any real Christian. We do recognize real Christians as our beloved brothers and sisters in Christ and respect those among them who are seeking the Lord and His kingdom. However, we cannot justify the very Christianity of which they are members and for which they work. Hence, in the Lord's recovery, quite often in teaching the saints we must present the truth concerning the genuine church of the Lord as His organic Body by pointing out the poor situation of today's Christianity. We prefer to speak about others in a positive way, but in today's abnormal situation we simply cannot avoid pointing out the abnormality that exists among Christians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>14. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>an Overstressing and Distortion<br>of the Teaching concerning Deputy Authority</H2><P>"There has been to some extent an atmosphere of fear brought in among the saints and among the churches, bringing the conscience of the saints into bondage. I believe this has been done by an over-stressing and distortion of the teaching concerning deputy authority. This has brought the saints into a condition where they are fearful to follow their conscience, to be one with their spirit, and sometimes to speak their genuine concerns."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>John's word here is an accusation against the teaching of deputy authority in the Lord's recovery. According to the divine revelation in the holy Word, there is deputy authority in God's economy, both in the Old Testament, such as with Moses and the priests who taught the people the divine oracle, and in the New Testament, such as with the elders, who take care of the church (1 Tim. 3:5; 5:17; Heb. 13:17), and the apostles, who establish the churches and teach the saints (2 Cor. 10:8; 13:10; 1 Cor. 4:21). A local church is under the authority of Christ as the Head, represented by the elders. Hence, the saints in a local church should obey the elders (Heb. 13:17). The churches as the Body of Christ are under their Head, Christ, represented by the apostles. Hence, the churches should obey the apostles (2 Cor. 2:9; 7:15; 10:6). To obey the elders in a local church and to obey the apostles among the churches does not mean that the obeying one does not need to obey the Lord directly. When he is seeking the leading directly from the Lord, he should also take care of the elders in the local church, because he is living and working in the church as a part of the Body. When the churches are seeking the leading directly from the Lord, they should also take care of the apostles, because they are all living and working with the apostles in the churches as the Body of Christ. Whether in a local church or among all the churches, we should be Body-conscious, taking care not only of the Head but also of His Body. Since we are living and working in the Body, we have the Body with the Head. We cannot have the Head without the Body; neither can we have the Body without the Head. We should seek to obey the Head with a relationship to the Body, and we should also seek to obey the Body with a relationship to the Head. We all need to realize that in our natural life we are very independent. So, to take care of obeying both the Lord and the elders or the apostles at the same time is not an easy thing for us. Hence, we may unconsciously feel that the teaching concerning the obeying of God's deputy authority is overly stressed or even unscriptural. In any case, to say that there is no deputy authority of the Lord is surely unscriptural.</P><P>The fear within those who are not willing to obey the elders in a local church or the apostles in the churches might, according to their feeling, bring their conscience into bondage. Any kind of fear that causes the saints to feel bound in their conscience and not free to do whatever they feel led of the Lord is not needed or healthy. Such a fear might be due to the saints' independence, or to their unwillingness to be one with the elders, or to their holding of a view concerning the church life which is different from the view held generally by the church. If it is due to the saints' independence, then the saints need to learn how to live the Body life; if it is due to the saints' unwillingness to be one with the elders, then they need to learn more concerning how to be in one accord with the elders in the church life; if they are holding a different view than the church's view, then they need to learn more lessons that they may go along with the church or the churches in the Lord's recovery. Regardless of what the fear is due to, it is always better to obey the elders in a church or the apostles among the churches at the same time as one obeys the Lord, rather than to obey only the Lord without caring for the elders in the church or the apostles among the churches. All the saints need to be ushered into a Body-consciousness and to be helped to pay the price of the giving up of their independence, their freedom to be different, and their subjective view, so that the Body of Christ can be built up in the Lord's way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>15. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>the Emphasizing of Methods<br>More Than the Inner Anointing,<br>and External Big Success More Than<br>the Experience of the Inner Life</H2><P>"There has been too much emphasizing of methods more than the inner anointing, and external big success more than the experience of the inner life. This is surely a deviation from the central lane of God's economy."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>Yes, we do need the inner anointing and the experience of the inner life. However, if we lack the proper external methods to match the inner anointing, and an adequate external success in fruit bearing to encourage the experience of the inner life, and we emphasize the inner anointing without the adequate methods with which to labor, and the experience of the inner life without the success of fruit bearing, we will not have the capable way to carry out God's economy in the central lane. Such a situation would be a real abuse of the central lane in God's economy. No one should put forth the accusation that to emphasize the necessary methods that we may work prevailingly through the inner anointing and to emphasize a satisfactory success that we may be encouraged to seek more experience of the inner life are a "deviation from the central lane of God's economy." To abide in the vine is a matter of the inner life, and it is for fruit bearing. If the abiding does not issue in fruit bearing but in barrenness, such an abiding should be condemned as an abusing of the inner life of the vine.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE WAY TO FACE THE DIVISIVE SITUATION</H2><P>Based on our study concerning the genuine oneness, the proper one accord, and the tests of these two matters, and based on the listing of some practical truths versus some dissenting accusations, we can come to consider the way to face the present divisive situation among us. This way can be considered a scriptural remedy to meet our present need.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. To Pay Full Attention to the Truth<br>concerning the Church as the Body of Christ<br>and as the House and Kingdom of God</H2><P>To face the present divisive situation, we need to pay our full attention to the truth concerning the church as the Body of Christ and as the house and kingdom of God. First Timothy 3:15 tells us that the church is the pillar and base of the truth. Thus, we must help the saints to have the full knowledge concerning these matters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. To Keep the Truth at Any Cost</H2><P>In 2 John 1-2 and in 3 John 3-4, the aged Apostle John was happy to know that his children kept the truth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Exercise to Quarantine</H2><P>I do feel that all the churches must do something to help the saints to know the real situation in the recovery. The saints must be helped to realize that a "contagious disease" is now among us, and, as in the field of medicine, we must quarantine the diseased ones. To quarantine does not mean that we do not love those who are "ill," nor does it mean that we cut them off. It means that we do something to preserve both the contagious ones and the rest of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Divisive Ones</H2><P>According to Romans 16:17 and Titus 3:10, we need to exercise to quarantine the divisive ones. Romans 16:17 charges us to turn away from those who make divisions. To turn away from them is to exercise to quarantine them. Titus 3:10 says that we should refuse a factious (sectarian, divisive) person after a first and second admonition. To refuse such a one also is to exercise to quarantine him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Heretical Ones</H2><P>We also need to quarantine the heretical ones, those who go beyond the teaching concerning Christ (2 John 7-11). According to 2 John 10, we should not receive such persons into our home, and even we should not greet them. This also is to quarantine them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Fornicators</H2><P>In addition, according to 1 Corinthians 5:2, 11-13, we need to quarantine the fornicators, who live in such a gross sin, by removing them from the fellowship of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. A CONCLUDING WORD</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Divisions Testing and Approving the Believers</H2><P>First Corinthians 11:19 says that divisions are unavoidable that the approved ones might be made manifest. The kind of turmoil and rebellion that we are now experiencing always sifts the congregation. In such a situation, some are sifted and some are manifested as being approved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Not a Matter of Being Right or Wrong but<br>a Matter of Keeping or Not Keeping the Oneness</H2><P>Most people pay their attention to the matter of being right or wrong. However, in today's situation, it is not a matter of right or wrong; it is a matter of whether we are divisive or not.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Remain Neutral Not Being Good<br>for the Building Up but for the Destruction<br>of the Body of Christ</H2><P>Being neutral does not build up (2 Cor. 13:8, 10) but destroys the Body of Christ. Being neutral may come out of a good heart, but it is the wrong way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. To Keep the Truth Needing<br>the Overcoming of Personal Affection</H2><P>To keep the truth, we need to overcome personal affection with the vow of a Nazarite. In Numbers 6:6-7, the Nazarites were charged not to be contaminated by any kind of death, even by the death of their blood relatives. Therefore, we must be careful about anyone who is "dying" or who is spreading death. If we realize that one who is near us is "dying" or is spreading death, we must keep ourselves away. Otherwise, if we remain near such a person, we will be contaminated by the germs of death. This will nullify our vow, and we will have to begin our vow over again (Num. 6:9-12). In some cases, to avoid the contagion of death, we need to overcome our personal affection, especially for those with whom we are well-aquainted. Leviticus 10:6-7, Exodus 32:25-29, and Deuteronomy 33:8-9 all stress the need of the overcoming of our personal affection in the service of our priesthood. Both Exodus 32:25-29 and Deuteronomy 33:8-9 tell us that when the children of Israel worshipped the golden calf, offending the Lord to the uttermost, Moses spoke the word asking all the Levites to kill their relatives and those who were close to them. They obeyed, and as a result they obtained the priesthood. The Urim and Thummim were with them, meaning that they had the revelation; they had the vision of the Lord's oracle because of their faithfulness to God's person. God hates to see His people worship anyone besides Him. So, He demands that His faithful people "kill" all the idol worshippers. One of these worshippers might be our father, and one might be our sister. In order to be faithful to the Lord, we must overcome our personal affection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Lord's Recovery Being<br>Not Only through Life,<br>but Even the More of the Truth</H2><P>At such a time as this, we need to stress not only the matter of life but also the matter of truth (1 Tim. 3:15). We need to stress the truth concerning the Body and concerning the church ground.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Walk in the Light<br>of the Judgment Seat of Christ</H2><P>We need to remember that whatever we do and whatever we say will be judged by the Lord's coming back at His judgment seat (1 Cor. 4:1-5; 2 Cor. 5:10). Paul was strongly criticized. In such a situation he was forced to say that he did not judge himself, nor did he justify himself; rather, he was waiting for the Lord's judgment at His coming back (1 Cor. 4:3-5). We must walk in this kind of light. It is not just a matter of what we are today. Whatever we are today affects what we will be in the future.</P><P>Even the Apostle Paul was greatly criticized; hence, we should not be disappointed if we are criticized, defamed, and slandered. We ourselves must exercise to have a conscience void of offense (Acts 24:16).</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CHURCHES,<br>THE NATURE, GROUND, AND<br>CONDITION OF A LOCAL CHURCH,<br>THE FACTORS OF A DENOMINATION,<br>AND THE DISCERNING OF THE ONE BODY</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CHURCHES<br>IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:3-6; Acts 2:42a; 1 John 1:3; John 17:11b, 20-23; Rev. 1:11; Rom. 14:1-6; 15:1-7; 16:17; 2 John 7-11; 1 Cor. 5:9-13; 2 Cor. 2:5-11; Titus 3:10</H1><P>In this chapter, I am burdened to share with you, first, concerning the fellowship of the churches in the Lord's recovery. Today we need to have a complete, thorough knowledge concerning the fellowship of the Body of Christ, and also concerning the fellowship of the local churches.</P><P>As we have seen in this book, the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine revelation concerning eight basic and major items: God, Christ, the Spirit, the eternal life, the believers, the church, the proper ground of the church, and the practice of the local churches. Among these items, the recovery of the proper ground of the church touches a major practical problem that we are facing today. The recovery today is very practically the recovery of the proper ground of the church. All the divisions and confusions among Christians today have come from this one source: the fact that most Christians are destitute of the knowledge of the proper ground of the church. Today all of Christianity is full of divisions. Division eventually leads to confusion; these two are actually two sides of one thing. In the past three years we have been facing a real problem among us, a problem that may be termed a rebellion, a turmoil, or a division. This problem has been due not to the lack of knowledge concerning the proper ground of the church, but to the fact that those responsible for the problem would not practice the truth concerning the proper ground of the church. They would not keep the proper ground of the church. In addition to the knowledge concerning the ground of the church, for the proper practice of the local churches, the adequate knowledge of the fellowship of the Body of Christ is needed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Fellowship of the Body of Christ</H2><P>We need to see in a brief way the fellowship of the Body of Christ. In our physical body there is a current of blood, which we may call the circulation of the blood. This current, or this circulation, is going on continuously in our physical body. If this circulation, or this current of blood, were to stop for only a few minutes, we would die. Thus, it is the circulation of our blood that keeps us alive. The health of our body depends on the circulation of our blood. We may say that this circulation is the fellowship of our body.</P><P>The fellowship of the Body of Christ is very similar to the circulation of the blood in our body. We have been enlightened to see that Christ has a Body and that we are members of His Body, that is, members of Christ Himself. Just as our physical body has many members, Christ's Body also has many members. And just as a man has only one body&#151;this is a principle ordained in God's creation&#151;Christ also has only one Body. If we do not understand the church as the Body of Christ, we should simply look at our own body. We can understand Christ's Body by knowing our own body. I have learned a great deal concerning the Body of Christ by learning to know my own body. If we learn to know our body, we will know the Body of Christ.</P><P>The circulation of the blood is the fellowship of our body. The fellowship of Christ's Body also is a kind of circulation. In our physical body we have the circulation of the blood, but Christ's mystical Body does not have blood. The fellowship in Christ's Body, then, is the circulation of the Spirit. The Spirit today is the "blood" in Christ's Body. If there were no blood in our body, our body would be dried up and would be dead. Likewise, if Christ's Body did not have the Spirit, it would be like a corpse. Thus, the fellowship of the Body of Christ is simply the circulation, the current, of the Spirit&#151;not the Holy Spirit or the Spirit of God, but the Spirit. In the New Testament the Spirit denotes the consummated Spirit, the Spirit who has been consummated, compounded, and mingled, and who is now dispensing. In this Spirit there is divinity, that is, God's divine nature, and there is humanity, that is, man's human nature. There is also Christ's person, Christ's wonderful, all-inclusive death, and Christ's empowering resurrection with His ascension. All these elements have been compounded into this one Spirit. When this one Spirit is circulating within the Body of Christ, divinity, humanity, Christ's person, Christ's death, and Christ's resurrection all are circulating. How wonderful this is!</P><P>The circulation of the blood is very important to our physical body. This circulation carries nourishment to every part of our body, and it also causes our body to be cherished. At times we may need to do some physical exercises to improve the circulation in our body. This may cause us to be more healthy. Romans 10:12 says that whenever we call on the name of the Lord, the Lord becomes rich to us. I have discovered that the more we call on the Lord with a loud voice, the more our spirit is released and the more we are healed and strengthened. Such calling on the Lord will make us very healthy, because to call in this way is to exercise. If we are always quiet and shut up within ourselves, we will be very weak. But if we call, "O Lord Jesus! O Lord! O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!" for ten minutes, the Lord will become rich to us. We will have joy, and eventually we will have strength. The joy of the Lord will be our strength (Neh. 8:10). I have learned the secret of calling on the name of the Lord. The Lord is rich to all who call on Him. To call is not merely to pray. The Greek word for call means to cry out, even loudly. In certain situations it would not be appropriate for us to call on the Lord loudly. However, when we are in a proper situation to do so, we should call loudly, "O Lord Jesus! Amen!" By calling on the Lord in this way, we will enjoy the riches of Christ, and we will be strengthened. This is because our calling on the name of the Lord causes the Spirit to circulate within us. This circulating Spirit is the compound Spirit, who includes divinity, humanity, Christ's person, Christ's death, and Christ's resurrection. The riches in this compound Spirit are unsearchable. When this Spirit circulates within us, we enjoy all Christ's riches. This circulation is the fellowship of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Body of Christ<br>Being Uniquely One Universally</H2><P>The Body of Christ is uniquely one universally (Eph. 4:4-6). Individually, we are members of the Body of Christ, and all the local churches are parts of this one unique Body of Christ. As those who are in the Body, we need to realize that we are one with all the saints in the entire universe. Ephesians 4:4-6 depicts a oneness that is universal: "One Body and one Spirit, as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all." In these verses we can see that the Triune God is mingled with the Body. The Body mentioned here is not local; rather, it is universal. This is the universal oneness of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Fellowship of the Body of Christ<br>Also Being Uniquely One Universally</H2><P>Since the Body of Christ is uniquely one universally, the fellowship of the Body of Christ also is uniquely one universally.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Fellowship of the Apostles</H2><P>The fellowship of the Body of Christ is the fellowship of the apostles&#151;the divine fellowship between all the believers and the Triune God. The term the fellowship of the apostles is used in Acts 2:42: "And they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles." Then, 1 John 1:3 tells us that the fellowship of the apostles is not merely with us, the believers, but also with the Father and the Son. Here John did not mention the Spirit directly, because he was speaking in the Spirit. The Spirit was there already. The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship of the Body of Christ, the divine fellowship between all the believers and the Triune God.</P><P>The fellowship of the apostles is based upon the apostles' teaching. Fellowship always comes after teaching. If there is no teaching, there is no element or realm of the fellowship. Actually, the teaching is the element and the realm of the fellowship. By the Lord's mercy, today in the Lord's recovery we are under the apostles' teaching and in the apostles' fellowship. The fellowship of the recovery which we are in is the recovered fellowship of the apostles. This fellowship was lost, but it has been recovered. Today we are in the fellowship of the apostles, which is the fellowship of the Lord's recovery. If you are a Baptist, you are in the fellowship of the Baptists. But the fellowship of the Baptists is narrower than the fellowship of the apostles, so they cannot claim that their fellowship is the fellowship of the apostles. We need to see and have the boldness to say that we are in the fellowship of the recovery which is the recovered apostles' fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Fellowship<br>for the Lord's Unique Recovery</H2><P>We always need to remember that we are in the Lord's recovery and that His recovery is unique. There is not another recovery, just as there is not another Body of Christ or another New Testament. The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship for this unique recovery of the Lord. When we see something going on in the recovery which is not so good, we need to have this kind of fellowship and a proper attitude. When a man marries someone, he is bound to her for as long as he lives. If he is unhappy with her, he cannot divorce her. He should try the best to help his wife by fellowshipping to improve in a nice and living way. He should not charge her to improve but help her to improve. This is the right way. When we see something wrong in the recovery or in any of the local churches, we should try the best to help the situation by fellowshipping so that it can be improved and corrected. If there is anything wrong, we can and should fellowship and pray together and seek the Lord's leading to improve the situation for the benefit of all the saints. This will be a real help to the Lord's recovery.</P><P>We should not have the thought that we can do a particular work according to our way in the recovery. We may be very gifted and have a large capacity to work out something. But what we work out may be the same as worldly people carrying out a certain enterprise. We have to realize that in the Lord's recovery there is only one work.</P><P>When I came into the recovery, I realized what the recovery was and that it was uniquely one. The one who brought the recovery to China among us was Brother Watchman Nee. If I would not have taken the way of the recovery, I could have had a work in northern China, but I gave that up. I fully realized that the Lord has only one Body, one work, one Bible, one revelation, and one current, one flow, in one fellowship. At that time Brother Nee was being used by the Lord. I never tried to speak anything different from his teaching. This does not mean that I did not have any other teachings, but my speaking always followed Brother Nee's speaking in order to keep the unique fellowship in the Lord's unique recovery. I felt that it was a glory to participate in the Lord's recovery in such a subjective way with Brother Nee. I thank the Lord that He had mercy upon me in helping me to have the best choice. In Moses' blessing in Deuteronomy 33, there is the term "the choicest things" (vv. 13-16). I realize that the Lord has been giving me the choicest things throughout my years in the recovery. This is due to His mercy in placing me and keeping me all the time in His recovery. As long as we are preserved in the Lord's way, we are preserved in the oneness in the unique fellowship. There is only one Lord, one Body, one Bible, one divine revelation, one speaking, one recovery, one fellowship, and one way to practice the recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Need for the Fellowship<br>among the Churches</H2><P>Our problem today is related to the matter of fellowship. We are in the fellowship of the recovery, but do we fellowship? For example, do the brothers in Sacramento fellowship with the brothers in Chicago, Cleveland, or Wichita? Among the churches in the Lord's recovery, there is not much fellowship. We have seen that the problems between Barnabas and Saul were probably due to a lack of proper and adequate fellowship. If we are not in fellowship, problems can come in among us.</P><P>The circulation of blood in our physical body is a good picture of the fellowship, the flow of the divine life, in the Body of Christ. If our blood circulation is not proper, this can cause much sickness to our body. The proper blood circulation swallows up all kinds of germs. I was in Taipei for about five years beginning in late 1984. After about three of those years, trouble came in among the churches. The trouble in the churches today is due to the shortage of the fellowship, the circulation of the blood. This lack of fellowship gave the enemy an opportunity to come in.</P><P>We are even very short of fellowship with the churches who are close to us geographically. There is very little circulation. If my shoulder were not participating adequately in the blood circulation of my body, it would be sick. No part of my physical body can be separate from the other parts since all the parts must participate in the one blood circulation. Some may think that they are wise to keep themselves separate. But if any part of the Body of Christ is separate, that part will eventually die. The best way to stay healthy is to "receive more blood and to give more blood," that is, to stay in the fellowship, the circulation of life. Then we will save ourselves and promote the healing of the Body. In some places there has been no peace because of a lack of fellowship. The more fellowship we have, the more peace we have.</P><P>The reason why many people are weak physically is because they sit too much. They do not move. It is the same spiritually. We are sick and weak because we remain with ourselves, in ourselves, and for ourselves. We are sick because we are so much in ourselves. We need to get out of ourselves by fellowshipping with the other churches. If we want to get helped, the secret is to go to see some brothers in another locality. The brothers in Texas should not have traffic among themselves only. They need to go to Chicago, Cleveland, and Seattle, and break the boundary of Texas.</P><P>I would like to make a proposal to the leading brothers. Perhaps ten days from today, fifty brothers from fifty cities can go to a certain church to be in their Lord's Day morning meeting at 10 a.m. I can assure you that you will receive the help and that the church will be helped. Today there are many opinions among the churches concerning the churches. Other churches have opinions concerning the church in Cleveland and the church in Anaheim. The church in a certain city may have many opinions about other localities. Each local church may have some opinions about other local churches. All of these opinions need to be thrown away. How can they be thrown away? They can be thrown away by the circulation, the fellowship. If the waste in our physical body is not discharged regularly, we will die. The circulation of blood within our body is like a river that always carries away the waste in our being so that it can be discharged. In like manner, the fellowship in the Body carries away all the negative things.</P><P>Some brothers may be afraid for others to come and visit them. But what we need today among the churches is more divine circulation, more fellowship. There are about fifty churches in California, but there is not much fellowship among them. This is where our shortcoming is, and this is why we are weak. The circulation helps us and helps others. It helps everyone in the Body. We need the fellowship. This fellowship is the fellowship of the apostles, which is today the fellowship of the recovery. The fellowship today among us is the recovered apostles' fellowship.</P><P>All the churches around the globe are part of the one recovery of the Lord. There should not be any boundaries of separation among the churches. Some co-workers in the past did have the feeling that a certain area was their territory. But we need to see that it is not healthy or profitable in the Lord's recovery for anyone to have a boundary for his work. The only boundary is the boundary of the recovery. We should not say, "That's my church. That's the work in my territory." We have only one work. That work is the work of the recovery based upon the teaching of the apostles. The remedy to the problem of so-called boundaries and territories among the churches is the fellowship. We should not have the thought that others coming to our place may disturb our work. We do not need to defend our work. Our work is the Lord's work, which is the recovery's work. We need the adequate fellowship among all the churches in all the nations, and we need a clear vision concerning the apostles' teaching and the apostles' fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. To Keep the Universal Oneness<br>of the Body of Christ</H2><P>This fellowship is to keep the universal oneness of the Body of Christ (John 17:11b, 20-23; Eph. 4:3-6). Ephesians 4:3 charges us to endeavor to keep the oneness of the Spirit. We can keep this oneness because it is our possession already. We have this oneness; thus, we only need to keep it. Regardless of how weak we may be, we still have this oneness. This is because we still have the circulation of the "blood," the circulation of the Spirit. If we did not have this circulation, we would be spiritually dead. As long as we have life, regardless of how weak we may be, we have this oneness. It is the possession of every believer. What we need, then, is just to keep this oneness. When we keep this oneness, we are in the unique fellowship of the Lord's recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Fellowship of the Local Churches</H2><P>Now we come to another aspect of the fellowship, that is, the fellowship of the local churches. It seems that there is no problem with the universal fellowship of the Body of Christ; however, when we put this fellowship into practice, immediately it becomes a local fellowship, the fellowship of the local churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Local Churches<br>Being Many in Different Localities</H2><P>The local churches are many in different localities (Rev. 1:11). The Body of Christ as the church, the unique universal church, is expressed through the local churches. It is impossible for the Body of Christ to be expressed without the local churches. The local churches, which are the expressions of the unique Body of Christ, are scattered on this earth in the localities where the local churches exist to express the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Local Churches<br>Being Locally Kept Away from One Another,<br>but Not Being Divided Universally</H2><P>The local churches are locally kept away from one another by their being in different localities. I do not say that they are separated from one another; the word separated may carry the connotation of division. I have used the term kept away because to be kept away is not to be divided. The churches are kept away from one another only by their localities, not by anything else. However, they are not divided universally.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Local Churches Needing to Fellowship<br>with All the Genuine Local Churches<br>on the Whole Earth</H2><P>The local churches should fellowship with all the genuine local churches on the whole earth to keep the universal fellowship of the Body of Christ. Any local church that does not keep this universal fellowship of the Body of Christ is divisive and becomes a local sect. Some so-called local churches are not genuine and have become divisions; we do not need to fellowship with such "churches." But we should have fellowship with all the genuine local churches on the whole earth to keep the universal fellowship of the Body of Christ. If not, we are no longer a church but a sect. A church is one that remains in the Body; a sect is a group of believers who divide themselves from the Body. When my arm remains in the body, it is a part of my living body. If it is cut off and separated from the body, it becomes a dead thing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Every Local Church Needing to Receive<br>All Kinds of Genuine Believers in Christ</H2><P>Every local church should receive all kinds of genuine believers in Christ (Rom. 14:1-6; 15:1-7). We have no right to give up any believer, unless he is divisive. When a believer becomes divisive, he is divided from the church already. But as long as a believer is not divisive, we should not give him up. If a believer prefers to keep the Sabbath whereas we take the Lord's Day, or if he eats only vegetables whereas we eat every kind of food, we still must receive him. We must receive him because God has received him (Rom. 14:3) and because Christ has received him (Rom. 15:7). We must receive every believer in Christ according to Christ (Rom. 15:5).</P><P>We should not receive the believers according to their diet or according to our preference. Whether we like a particular believer or not, we have no choice but to receive him. Suppose you were born into a family of twelve brothers. You might like only yourself and one of your brothers and not like the rest. However, the fact that the other ten are in the same family is not up to you; it is up to your parents. They begot those peculiar ones. Therefore, you have no choice but to receive them as your brothers. Likewise, in the church a particular brother may have certain characteristics that are offensive to us. But we need to realize that our Father has begotten him and has received him. If we give up this brother, we would give up our Father. Thus, we must receive all kinds of genuine believers, not according to anything of ourselves but according to Christ. We must receive them because they have Christ; Christ is in them. If a church does not receive all kinds of genuine believers, it is divisive and becomes a sect.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. A Believer to Be Kept Away<br>from the Fellowship of a Local Church<br>Because of Only Three Things</H2><P>A believer can be kept away from the fellowship of a local church, that is, the fellowship of the Body of Christ, because of only three things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Being Divisive</H2><P>The first thing is being divisive, making divisions and causes of falling contrary to the apostles' teaching (Rom. 16:17). In Romans 14 Paul said that we must receive all kinds of genuine believers, whether they keep certain days or consider every day alike, whether they eat herbs or eat meat (vv. 1-6). Then, in chapter fifteen Paul said that we must receive genuine believers according to Christ (vv. 5-7). In these portions of the Word, Paul was very broadminded, very generous, and, in a sense, very liberal. But at the end of chapter sixteen Paul said, "Now I beg you, brothers, keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them." These two things&#151;the making of divisions and causes of falling&#151;have been and still are going on among us. Thus, we need to keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to what we have learned of the apostles, and we must turn away from them.</P><P>In dealing with the divisive ones, we must also take Paul's word in Titus 3:10, "A factious man after the first and second admonition refuse." A factious person is a divisive and sectarian person. According to Paul's word in Romans 16:17 and in Titus 3:10, after the first and second admonitions, we must reject such persons and turn away from them. To do this is to quarantine such persons. To quarantine a person does not mean that we hate that person. If one member in a family became ill with a contagious disease, the rest of the family would need to quarantine him for the safety of the whole family. Otherwise, the entire family would be affected. Likewise, to practice Paul's word in Romans 16:17 and in Titus 3:10 is to quarantine the divisive members in the Body of Christ. This is not my teaching; it is my presentation of the holy Word to you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Being Heretical</H2><P>The second thing for which a believer can be kept away from the fellowship of the church is being heretical, denying that Christ came in the flesh (2 John 7-11). This implies the denying of Christ's redemptive work, which was accomplished by Christ in His flesh (Rom. 8:3; Col. 1:22). Teaching heresy is not merely a matter of teaching wrongly or differently. In 1 Timothy 1:3 Paul said that he had urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently. However, in 2 John 7-11, John was not referring to those who taught differently, but to those who taught heretically, denying that Christ came in the flesh, that is, denying Christ's person in His humanity, and denying His redemptive work. They do not believe that Christ is both God and man who came in the flesh to accomplish redemption for us, the sinners. The apostle John said that if such a one comes to us, we should not receive him into our home, and we should not even greet him. Then John said that if we greet him, saying to him, "Rejoice," we will share in his sin. This is not my word, but the word of the apostle John.</P><P>Thus far, among us there is no one who is teaching heretically. However, there are some who are making divisions and causes of falling.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Committing Gross Sins and Living in Them</H2><P>The third thing for which a believer can be kept away from the fellowship of a local church is the committing of gross sins and living in these sins, not being willing to repent of them and forsake them (1 Cor. 5:9-13). A person who commits gross sins in this way should be removed from the fellowship of the church. But once such a one would repent and forsake his sins, the church should forgive him and receive him into the fellowship of the church, that we may not be taken advantage of by Satan (2 Cor. 2:5-11). In his first Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul charged the church in Corinth to remove a sinful brother from the fellowship of the church. Later, this one repented, and the news came to Paul. Immediately, Paul wrote the second Epistle, charging the church to forgive this one and to receive him back. If we do not do this, we may be taken advantage of by Satan in that he might devour such a repentant one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. How to Deal with the Divisions</H2><P>In dealing with the divisions that have separated themselves from the genuine local churches and have broken the unique fellowship of the Body of Christ, I would like to present to you my proposal, and I believe that this is according to the holy Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Considering Them Divisive Sects</H2><P>First, we should consider these divisions as divisive sects, like the denominations, not according to their condition but according to their standing, their ground. If you were to go to a meeting of the divisive ones, as a pretense they might behave in a very spiritual way. This kind of behavior is a matter of their condition. In this book I have used the illustration of marriage. Marriage is based upon the chastity of the wife, not upon her niceness. A wife may be very nice, but if her husband is Mr. Smith and she begins to call herself Mrs. Jones, regardless of how nice, humble, and submissive she may be toward her husband, the base of her marriage will be annulled. The base of a marriage is not the wife's condition but her chastity. If a wife is chaste, even though at times she may not treat her husband nicely, that is, even though her condition may be somewhat poor, she still has the proper standing as a wife. Concerning today's situation among us, we need to exercise the proper discernment. We must discern whether a certain group of believers is a genuine church or a division, not according to their condition but according to their standing, their ground. Regarding one's condition, it is possible to pretend, but concerning the ground on which one stands, no one can pretend. We are either on the proper ground or we are not. Just as a woman cannot pretend to have one unique husband, we cannot pretend to be on the proper ground of the church in the unique fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Not Recommending Any Believer<br>in the Local Churches<br>to Have Any Share in the Divisions</H2><P>Second, we should not recommend any believer in the local churches to have any share in the meetings and activities of the divisions. Nevertheless, there may be some who attend the Lord's table meeting in a local church and, after taking the table, they leave to go to a meeting of the divisive ones to listen to a message. If any believer in the local churches would attend the meetings and share the activities of those divisions, the local churches should not put him away from the fellowship of the church, as long as he is not infected by and does not promote anything that is divisive. Our dealing with such a person depends on whether or not he has been infected by the "germs" of division, and whether or not he is passing on those germs to others. If he does pass on those germs, we must advise him not to do this. We cannot tolerate any germs of division.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Not Rejecting Any Believer<br>Who Does Not Promote Anything Divisive</H2><P>If any believer who is meeting with any of these sectarian divisions would attend the meetings of the local churches, or contact the believers meeting in the local churches, he should not be rejected, as long as he does not promote anything divisive.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Considering as Divisive and Rejecting Anyone Who Promotes Sectarian Divisions</H2><P>However, anyone who is aggressive for and promotes the sectarian divisions should be considered divisive and should be rejected after a first and second admonition (Titus 3:10). I believe that this is the fair and scriptural way to deal with the divisions that have separated themselves from the genuine local churches and have broken the unique fellowship of the Body of Christ. Anyhow, according to the apostles' teaching in the New Testament, anyone who makes the division, who is divisive and bears the "germs" of division, that is, who is factious, sectarian, we should refuse them (Titus 3:10) and turn away from them (Rom. 16:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE NATURE, GROUND,<br>AND CONDITION OF A LOCAL CHURCH</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:2; Rom. 16:16b; Eph. 4:3; Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rom. 16:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; Rev. 1:11</H1><P>In this chapter we shall consider, second, the nature, ground, and condition of a local church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Nature</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Church of God,<br>Possessing the Divine Nature of God</H2><P>Concerning the nature of a local church, first we must realize that the church is the church of God (1 Cor. 1:2). A local church must be a church of God, possessing the divine nature of God. The title "the church of God" denotes not only that the church belongs to God, but also that the church must have the nature of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Churches of Christ,<br>Being in the Element of Christ</H2><P>Second, the churches are the churches of Christ (Rom. 16:16b). A local church must be a church of Christ, being in the element of Christ. Every element has a nature, and the nature is the essence of the element. Christ is the element of the church, and God is the nature of the church. God is in Christ; this indicates that the nature is in the element. A local church must possess the divine nature of God and be in the element of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Ground</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Genuine Oneness of the Body<br>of Christ&#151;the Oneness of the Spirit</H2><P>The ground of a local church is the genuine oneness of the Body of Christ, that is, the oneness of the Spirit. Ephesians 4:3 charges us to be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit. The oneness of the Spirit is the oneness of the Body of Christ, which is the basic element of the unique ground of a local church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. In the Limit of the Boundary<br>and Jurisdiction of a Locality&#151;<br>the Ground of Locality</H2><P>The genuine oneness of the Body of Christ must be practiced with the unique ground of locality within the limit of the boundary and jurisdiction of the locality in which a church exists, that is, on the ground of locality, as with the church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1), the church in Antioch (Acts 13:1), the church in Cenchrea (Rom. 16:1), the church in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2), and the seven churches in the seven cities in Asia (Rev. 1:11). All these churches were on the local ground, the ground of locality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Condition</H2><P>The condition of a local church may fluctuate and may differ from that of all the other local churches, just as the conditions of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 differed from one another. The church in Ephesus was in one condition, and the church in Smyrna was in another condition. All the seven churches were different in their conditions. However, although the conditions of the churches may differ, the ground of the local churches remains the same. Because the condition of a church may fluctuate, our recognizing of a local church should be based upon its nature and ground and not upon its condition.</P><P>A local church is preserved from being divided by its ground, not by its condition. The unique ground&#151;the unique oneness of the Body of Christ, plus the unique ground of locality&#151;preserves a church from being divided. The condition of a certain church may be good, but that does not assure that the ground of that church is right. A local church may be low in its condition, yet it is still a genuine local church as long as it keeps the genuine ground of the oneness of the Body. On the other hand, a local church may be high in its condition, but it is a division, a local sect, as long as it does not care for the genuine ground of the oneness of the Body of Christ expressed in its locality. We may use marriage as an illustration of this principle. The ground of a marriage is the chastity of the wife. As long as a wife is chaste, she has a proper standing, even though her character may be rough. She may not be loving or kind&#151;this is her condition&#151;but this does not annul the ground of her marriage. However, if her husband's name is Smith, and she begins to call herself Mrs. Jones, even if she is loving, kind, humble, and submissive toward her husband, her calling herself Mrs. Jones annuls the ground of her marriage. A wife's base in her marriage is her chastity. In Revelation 3:8 the Lord praised the church in Philadelphia for not denying His name. It is a terrible thing for a wife to deny her husband's name. That annuls the base of their marriage. Regardless of how good a wife may be in character or in daily life, if she denies her husband's name, she has lost her base in the marriage life. The ground of a local church is the very base upon which we recognize that church. We recognize a church not because its condition is according to our preference. Our recognizing of a church depends upon its ground, and this ground is composed of two things: the oneness of the Body and the locality in which the church exists. Concerning the ground of locality, the principle in the New Testament is "one city, one church." In a particular city there should not be more than one church. The condition of a local church can change, and sometimes it does change; but the ground of a local church should remain unchanged permanently.</P><P>In the past two years, some have left the genuine local churches and have begun to meet in a divisive way. They may say that they are not a division but are simply a group meeting of the church. However, these are not genuine group meetings but sectarian divisions, because they do not care for the oneness of the Body or for the ground of locality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE FACTORS OF A DENOMINATION (SECT)</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Acts 2:42</H1><P>In this chapter my third burden is to show you the factors of a denomination. A denomination is a sect. However, there is a difference between a denomination and a sect: a sect is not a denomination if it does not denominate itself. The divisions that have been produced among us in recent years have not yet denominated themselves. Hence, they are not yet denominations, but they are surely sects.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Special Teaching</H2><P>The first factor of a denomination or a sect is a special teaching that differs from "the teaching of the apostles" (Acts 2:42) in the entire New Testament, such as baptism by immersion, the presbytery (to administrate the church by the eldership), head covering, the keeping of days, diet, or a particular stress on a certain point of prophecy. All of these matters may be scriptural, but we should not make any of these a special teaching. It is right for us to have all our practices according to the Bible. Thus, in our practice we baptize people by immersion and we have the eldership, but we do not make these things particular items that divide us from other believers. Certain Christians divide themselves from other Christians over the matter of baptism by immersion. If a believer desires to be received into their membership, they require him to be baptized by immersion in their baptistry, by their pastor, and in their water. If he is baptized by immersion in another place and by other people, they will not recognize him. This is a special, particular teaching that divides these believers from other Christians, making them a sect and a denomination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. A Special Fellowship</H2><P>The second factor of a denomination is a special fellowship based upon a special teaching in a realm narrower than that of "the fellowship of the apostles" (Acts 2:42). The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship of the entire Body universally, covering all kinds of genuine believers. Romans 14 tells us that we must receive different kinds of genuine believers, regardless of what days they observe or what dietary regulations they keep. Whether they eat herbs or eat meat, they are genuine believers because they believe in the Lord Jesus. Thus, we must receive them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. A Special Name</H2><P>The third factor of a denomination is a special name, either according to a special teaching or according to a particular practice, that designates a certain group of believers who are of the same teaching or the same practice. The taking of such a name denominates a particular sect, making it a denomination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Any of the Three Factors<br>Being Adequate to Make a Division</H2><P>Any of the above-mentioned three factors is adequate to divide the believers from others who are different from them in teaching or in practice. Therefore, although we should practice things such as baptism by immersion, the presbytery, and head covering, we should not make these things a special item that divides us from others. Furthermore, we should not make them our creed, and we should not designate ourselves by a name, such as Lutheran, Baptist, or Presbyterian, that is according to a particular teaching or practice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE DISCERNING OF THE ONE BODY</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 11:29-30; 10:17; Eph. 4:4</H1><P>My fourth burden in this chapter is the discerning of the one Body. First Corinthians 11:29 says that we need to discern the Body. Moreover, it says that if we do not discern the Body, we will suffer some kind of discipline by the Lord.</P><P>The first item we need to discern is the bread on the Lord's table. The bread on the Lord's table should be a symbol not only of the Lord's physical body, but also of the Lord's mystical Body, which is universally one (Eph. 4:4). Although we may take the Lord's table in many different cities around the globe, we all are taking just one bread, because the bread we partake of is a symbol of Christ's mystical Body, which is universally one. Thus, 1 Corinthians 10:17 says, "We who are many are one bread, one Body; for we all partake of the one bread."</P><P>Any bread on the Lord's table that does not signify the Lord's one universal Body but the body of a certain sect is divisive. The denomination in which I grew up in mainland China had their "communion" at regular intervals of time. Each time they made a strong announcement that whoever was not a member of that denomination had to leave the premises. The bread that they partook of was not a symbol of the Body of Christ; it was a symbol of the sect of that denomination. We should not partake of that kind of bread, that kind of "communion," or that kind of table. We should not have any share in it; it is a sign of a sect.</P><P>If we partake of such a divisive table without discernment, we participate in a division, which is condemned by the apostle (1 Cor. 11:29-30). Some who have recently left us to form divisions are taking the Lord's table. They have told people that they are simply a group meeting that is having the Lord's table. Should these group meetings be considered as proper and genuine meetings of the local churches? If a proper, genuine group meeting has the Lord's table, that table will be the table of a local church, with the bread as a symbol of the entire Body of Christ. That is a practice that keeps the oneness of the Body. Suppose, however, that we have a group of believers who originally were meeting with the church, but because of certain reasons, they left the church and keep themselves separate from the church, without having any fellowship with the church. Suppose, further, that these believers have what they call the Lord's table. Such a table immediately becomes a symbol of division, a symbol of a sect. Hence, 1 Corinthians 11:29 charges us to discern. When we partake of any bread on a table that is called the Lord's table, we must discern carefully whether that bread signifies the universal Body of Christ, without division, or not. If it does not, we should not partake of it. If we do not discern, and partake of such a thing, this is condemned by the apostle, that is, by the Lord.</P><P>Some of the new believers among us may wonder what the difference is between the Lord's recovery and Christianity. In this book with the supplementary word we have seen, first of all, that we are here for the recovery, and second, that we are here for the oneness of the Body. We are here in the recovery of the Triune God, Christ, the Spirit, life, the believers, the church, the church ground, and the practice of the local churches. In total, we are in the recovery of the oneness of the Body of Christ. Thus, we need to conduct ourselves properly, and we also need to exercise our discernment because of the confusion that is around us. As long as there are divisions, there will be confusion. So we must be careful and look to the Lord that we may be able to discern the situation among us.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>HOW TO HAVE<br>A DEFINITE BEGINNING<br>OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY<br>IN A LOCAL CHURCH</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19; John 21:15; 1 Pet. 2:2; 1 Thes. 2:7, 11; Eph. 4:12</H1><P>In this chapter we want to see how to have a definite beginning of the God-ordained way in a local church. We  need a definite start, a definite beginning, of the God-ordained way. The churches may agree with the God-ordained way, but there has not been much practice of this way. This is because the traditional way of Christianity, the way of one man speaking and the rest listening, makes people lazy and idle. One speaker is hired to do the work of many. They are only required to give their offerings and listen to some speaking. But to take the God-ordained way makes everyone busy. All of the believers must be exercised to visit people with the gospel. The success of this God-ordained way has been fully proven, but there is the need of our faithfulness in offering our body as a living sacrifice to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY<br>TO MAKE THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY CLEAR<br>TO THE CONGREGATION OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>We should take the opportunity to make the God-ordained way clear to the congregation of the church. There are many printed messages concerning the God-ordained way that we can read and study. Then we can take some time in the regular meetings of the church to speak to the saints, making the God-ordained way clear to them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT PUSHING THE CONGREGATION<br>TO TAKE THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</H2><P>We should not push the congregation to take the God-ordained way. We should just present the knowledge of this way to the saints. Whether they would take this way immediately or wait is up to them. I believe that at least ten percent of the saints will accept our word and will start to practice the new way. We can go on with these ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LEADING ONES<br>AND SOME OF THE LEADING SEEKING ONES<br>TAKING THE LEAD TO PRACTICE, IN A DEFINITE WAY, EACH STEP OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</H2><P>The leading ones and some of the leading seeking ones should take the lead to practice, in a definite way, each step of the God-ordained way. In nearly every church there are, besides the elders, some leading seeking ones. The elders and these seeking ones should take the lead to practice the God-ordained way. We should not tell the saints to go out to knock on doors. That will not work. The leading ones in the church are the "head sheep." They have to go out and others will follow their example.</P><P>Besides attending the regular meetings of the church, the leading ones and the leading seeking ones should set aside their time once (better twice) every week for three hours to practice the new way. We should not start to practice the God-ordained way and then forsake the regular church meetings. We still should attend the regular church meetings while we are practicing all the steps of the new way.</P><P>First, we need to get sinners saved and baptized in a solid way (Matt. 28:19). It may be hard for us to gain new ones in the United States. But if we would be faithful to the Lord and budget our time once or twice every week for three hours to go out to reach people, we can gain two remaining fruit every year. Be assured that this will happen if we are faithful to go out year-round every week for three hours. We only need to do this for forty-five of the fifty-two weeks of the year.</P><P>After we have baptized two or three, we do not need to baptize more. We need to take care of the ones we have baptized by going to their homes. We need to feed these new believers in their homes once or twice every week for an appropriate period of time (John 21:15; 1 Pet. 2:2). The amount of time we spend with the new ones in home meetings depends upon our discernment of their situation. If we feel that they are still young, we need to feed them more. In the course of our labor, we will baptize a number who do not remain in the church. But we should always exercise to have two or three new believers under our care as our children, nourishing them as a mother and entreating them as a father (1 Thes. 2:7, 11). We are the parents, the mother and the father, of the new believers. We need to raise them up as our children.</P><P>Every group of four of the leading ones and the leading seeking ones should bring the two or three who are under their care together to practice the group meeting to learn how to fellowship with one another, how to pray for one another, how to care for one another, how to shepherd one another, and how to teach one another by mutual questions and mutual answers, that they all may be perfected to do the work of the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12). In the group meetings we should not do anything according to the old way. We need to get into the printed ministry that has been released on the group meetings so that we can carry them out in an organic way. The teaching in the group meetings should not be carried out by one person. In these meetings everyone is a student and everyone is a teacher. The teaching is carried out by the mutual asking and answering of questions. If a new one says that she does not know why she has to be baptized, all of the attendants can say something to answer her question. When everyone speaks, their speaking becomes a good message. Then everyone not only learns the truth but also learns how to speak, how to answer, and how to teach. Everyone can ask, and everyone can answer. After much study, we have found that this is the best way to have the group meetings. In this way all can be perfected to do the work of the building up of the Body of Christ, that is, to prophesy. Only prophesying can do the work of the building up of the organic Body of Christ.</P><P>We should take the tutoring and coaching way to train all the ones under our care to prophesy first in the group meetings as an exercise and then in the church meetings as a practice. Eventually, nearly all the ones under our care will be able to prophesy. Many of the saints have a heart to prophesy, but they do not know how to do it. We need to teach them. Most of the saints in the churches now prefer to have the meetings of mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14 with all speaking for building up. They do not want to go back to the old way. When only one person speaks, he is overburdened and the audience eventually gets tired of his speaking. When many saints speak in the church meetings week after week, this maintains the freshness. Whenever we function in a meeting, that meeting is the best to us. If we do not function, we may say that the meeting was poor. When we function and are expecting to function, the meeting becomes an enjoyment to us, and we desire to come to the meeting. When all speak in the church meetings, this stirs up every member of the Body.</P><P>We need to pray definitely for the purpose of carrying out the God-ordained way in all the churches with much patience and learning. The leading ones and some of the leading seeking ones should also fellowship with the rest of the saints that they may gradually, one by one, participate in the learning and practice of the God-ordained way. Some of the saints will follow the leading ones to practice the new way. But the leading ones will have to contact the others to fellowship with them so that they can gradually enter into the new way.</P><P>The leading ones and the leading seeking ones should also, if possible, visit the other churches that have advanced in the God-ordained way, that such a visit may render some mutual help in the carrying out of the God-ordained way. There needs to be the traffic among the churches that we may learn of others. In this way all of us will receive the mutual help in carrying out God's ordained way to organically build up the Body of Christ.</P><P>Practicing the God-ordained way requires our diligence. We must set up a certain time every week to practice the new way. This is not an easy thing. If we do not budget our time, it will be wasted. For the Lord's sake, we should dedicate at least three hours a week to the Lord to go to visit people. We can join with others in a team to carry this out. In principle, we should not let anything frustrate us from keeping this time set apart for the Lord's interests. If we dedicate this time to the Lord, we can yearly have two remaining fruit living in the church life.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>PRACTICING THE PRIESTHOOD<br>OF THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO<br>THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</H1><P>We have surely seen the Lord's blessing since we have taken His ordained way. There are a good number of new ones among us who have been saved into the Lord's recovery in recent years. Many of them are very open and seeking. This is very encouraging. This is the result in the blessing of the Lord's new way. Thank the Lord that we are here for this way, yet thus far one thing has not been ministered into our being.</P><P>We always think, talk, act, work, and do things according to what our being is. We were meeting, serving, and preaching the gospel in the old way for many years. Our practice in the past was too much in a natural way. Our thought concerning meeting, serving the Lord, and carrying out the preaching of the gospel so that sinners might be brought to the Lord is still according to the natural concept. The natural concept today in Christianity is to have preaching meetings. We believe in the preaching by one professional person who has great capacity, ability, gift, and function. I would not say that this does not work. It does work to a certain extent. But through these recent years, under the Lord's mercy, the Lord has shown me that this way is natural.</P><P>Then we may ask, "What way is not natural?" The personal contact with people is the way which is not natural. Recently, a number of small churches have been raised up in southern California. These churches were not started by any worker or by any professional work. They began through brothers who moved to these new places. A number of the working saints among us could not afford a house in a big city, so they moved to suburbs and small towns. The dear saints in these small places brought in new ones, but not through preaching meetings or conferences. They brought them in through personal contact.</P><P>A group of about five or six families may move to a new locality. Then they can gather together with the Word, with the Spirit, in the Lord's name, and in the light of the recovery. When the saints move to new places, they just need to live the recovery. When ten saints are raised up in a new place, they may simply come together and have the Lord's table. They do not need to declare that they are taking the ground. Although elders have not been appointed among them, they have spontaneously become the church there. The raising up of these new churches is evidence of the profit of gaining people for the Lord by our personal contact.</P><P>Thousands of people were saved in Jerusalem in the early days of the church. But eventually the Lord allowed a great persecution to occur. Acts 8:1 says, "And there occurred in that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and all were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles." All the saints, thousands of them, were scattered to preach the gospel. Verse 4 says, "Those therefore who were scattered went throughout the land announcing as the gospel the word." Their being scattered issued in the spreading of the gospel. New ones were brought in not by preaching meetings but by each saint's personal preaching and personal contact with others. I did not see this in the past as emphatically as I do now.</P><P>Years ago I thought that in order to gain people, we had to have a proper preacher with a big meeting. The saints could be used as a means to bring people to this meeting. By listening to the preaching, these people could be saved. We did this for years. I thought in the past that this practice was needed and was prevailing. Today I realize that it was not that prevailing. During the past seventy years of our history, from 1920 to the present time, that way never brought us an increase of over twenty percent. I have been in the recovery for sixty-one years, and I have seen this through my experience. We found out that the old way of one person speaking and the rest listening was not that satisfactory.</P><P>By the Lord's mercy, the recovery has spread to all the continents. There are over thirteen hundred churches throughout the earth. Most of these local churches, though, are small. Of course, according to history, there has not been a church in Christianity which has continuously had an increase of thirty percent. If any church had a continual increase of even twenty percent, that would be a very flourishing church. We have not reached this percentage of increase in a continual way. We have to admit that the old way of having preaching meetings with a gifted preacher is not the spiritual way. That is the natural way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONTACTING PEOPLE BY OURSELVES<br>DIRECTLY, PERSONALLY, AND CONTINUALLY<br>TO BEAR REMAINING FRUIT</H2><P>Now I want to come to my point. If you would receive mercy from the Lord to live Him, to live for Him, and to preach Him to gain sinners for Him, just do it yourself. Do not trust in any preacher. Do not expect to get help from any speaker. Just gain people for the Lord yourself. Surely you can save one person within one year. I am burdened that we have a breakthrough in this matter. I am looking to the Lord that each one of you would make a decision to get one person saved for the church life every year. In the natural realm, it is normal for people to have children. But today for us Christians who love the Lord, it seems difficult to bring forth a spiritual child. The Lord told us in John 15 that He is the vine and we are the branches (v. 5). He appointed us to go and bring forth remaining fruit (v. 16). We all should desire fruit that remains.</P><P>In these recent years, we have stressed the truth concerning fruit bearing in John 15 again and again. We may have prayed, "Lord, we hate barrenness. We want to bear much fruit." But the bringing forth of fruit among us has not entered into the God-ordained, practical way. We are still mostly in the natural way. We may wonder what the God-ordained, practical way is. We need to realize that as believers, we must and we should bear fruit. We have to bring forth children. Then we must gain a certain amount of skill in bringing forth fruit. We have to learn how to bear fruit and to practice fruit bearing continually.</P><P>As believers, as members of Christ, and as branches of the vine, we must bear fruit. The Lord said that if any branch did not bear fruit, it would be cut off (John 15:2a, 6). To be cut off is not to suffer eternal perdition but to lose the enjoyment of Christ in the organic union with Him. It is serious not to bear fruit. Many of us, however, do not have a serious consideration about our barrenness.</P><P>Some brothers and sisters have been faithful in the recovery and for the recovery for many years, but I have observed that they have not borne fruit. They love the church, they are for the church, and they support the church financially, but they are not bearing fruit. They should realize that not to bear fruit is a serious thing before the Lord. The Lord wants us to have a spiritual life in the church, to go to the meetings, to worship Him, and to live Him. But what is all this for? If all the saints in the church were like this, yet no one bore any fruit, the church would eventually die out. If the people of a nation did not bear children, the nation would eventually become extinct. The most basic, crucial, and vital thing is for us to bring forth children.</P><P>By His mercy, I have found out that to bring forth spiritual children, you must make a serious decision to contact people directly. Do not trust in preachers and in preaching meetings. Just trust in your direct, personal, continual contact with people. I assure you that if you make such a decision, you will at least bring two people to the Lord yearly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A SIMPLE WAY TO BEAR REMAINING FRUIT</H2><P>I would like to present a simple way to bear fruit. First, you should make a vow to the Lord. You can pray, "Lord, as one of Your branches, I realize that I must bear fruit according to Your charge in John 15. If I cannot get one sinner saved within a year, this is a shame. Lord, every week I will spend two or three hours to contact people for their salvation." This is the principle. This does not mean that you have to spend two or three hours at one time in one day. You may spend some time in the morning to consider how to contact and save your unsaved relatives. You may spend twenty-five minutes to pray and make a record of these relatives. These twenty-five minutes should be reckoned as part of your two to three hours of labor in the gospel every week. In the evening you may write a letter to one of your relatives to find out how he is doing, opening the door for you to have further contact with him. The time spent in writing this letter is also a part of your gospel labor. Let us suppose that you have five unsaved cousins. If you labored three hours a week on these cousins in a concentrated way for one year, surely at least one of them would be brought to the Lord.</P><P>In order to be fruit-bearing branches of Christ, we need to be revived by the Lord day by day. Our publication called The Holy Word for Morning Revival has been a help to the saints to be revived by the Lord every morning. The most effective way to live the Christian life is by having a vital, living, active morning watch with the Lord. We should get two verses from the Scripture to live on every day and then contact people for the Lord in a definite way. In addition to this, we need to bear fruit. The reason why we do not bear fruit is because we do not practice contacting people directly, personally, and faithfully.</P><P>I would beg you elders to learn to have a start in this. You yourself have to do it. Do not expect others to do it. You yourself do this one thing. Practice personally contacting people every week. Contact them individually. You can contact your relatives, friends, neighbors, colleagues, classmates, etc. You need to plan and schedule your time so that you contact two or three individuals every week. You should pray, "Lord, I do not want to contact them in a natural way. I do not want to have natural talk when I meet with them. Lord, show me the vital way, the living way, to bring them to You." If you pray such a prayer, the Lord will show you. Today there is the need of some faithful doers in the practice of fruit bearing.</P><P>We need to practice contacting people. We may contact someone without any success or result. Then we can go to the Lord to repent and open to Him for His adjustment. He will impress us to go back to them in a certain way. When we follow the Lord to contact people according to His way, they will be saved. As we go out to contact people one by one, we will find out the proper way from the Lord. We will also find out the right persons to visit. We will learn not to waste our time. We have found that just to knock on doors in a general way can be a waste of time. We must look to the Lord to get a proper candidate for our labor. Then we need to work on him in a proper way. This is the successful way to labor in the gospel. The ones on whom we labor should be those with whom we are acquainted, either directly or indirectly. In this way the time we spend will be worthwhile.</P><P>Whether or not this can be worked out depends upon our endeavoring. We cannot just make an announcement in the meeting, encouraging others to go. We ourselves have to go. We should start by ourselves and then get a companion to labor with us. After half a year, we can bring forth four new ones who will labor in the same way that we are. For the destiny of the church in our locality, this is needed. We have wasted too much of our time. We must make a budget to be very economical in the way that we spend our time. We need to redeem our time by praying for our acquaintances and relatives, writing them letters, and sending them booklets. Then we can make appointments to go see them. As we labor, we need to learn with an honest and sincere heart. We need to learn how to talk to people and how to gain them within a short period of time. If we endeavor like this, we can bring at least two persons to the Lord yearly as remaining fruit. We may baptize more than five, but out of the five, two will remain in the church.</P><P>Keep this in mind&#151;you must practice this yourself. I beg you to forget about having preachers and preaching meetings. That does not work so well. Just practice visiting people one by one personally and directly. Then after a short time, maybe two or three weeks, other saints will follow you to be your companions. Then you will have a start of the practice of fruit bearing in your locality. You must spend your time on the right persons in the right way. In order to gain a valuable result, you must labor.</P><P>Do not trust in preachers with large preaching meetings. That will waste your time and delay others. You yourself must have a start in the practice of fruit bearing in such a strict way. Every week you should spend two to three hours to contact individuals. You should carry this out as a business. Then you will see the results. I hope and pray for this. I believe that the Lord will eventually work this out, making each one of His lovers a winner of sinners.</P><P>You must go to contact people one by one by yourself directly through planning. You do not necessarily need to go out to knock on doors. We have found that going out to knock on doors is good, but it does not work that definitely. We must take a way so that we can bear fruit in a definite way. Just plan how to contact your acquaintances. Every week you should spend two to three hours on the gospel in this way. Do not send others. You must make a vow with the Lord that you would plan, schedule your time, and find a way to contact your acquaintances directly, at least once a week. If you take any other way, the result will not be that definite. The definite result only comes out of your plan and out of your schedule. Otherwise, you will waste your time.</P><P>You do not need to announce anything to the church. If the saints in the church remain the way they are, do not blame or condemn them. Rather, go along with the church, and help it to go on. But you yourself need to labor in a definite way to gain people. New ones will then be brought into the church life through you, and everyone will see this.</P><P>I would especially like to talk to the elders among us who are full-time. Among the saints, you have to be the examples, the living ones who get three to five people saved every six months. Then you can labor so that one or two of them will remain in the church life. It is not pleasant to see our co-workers serving the Lord full-time and yet not bringing anyone to the Lord within a year. We must labor in the gospel definitely. We have to bring forth some children by ourselves. We should be able to point to some who are our spiritual children. We have to study how to contact people ourselves. We still have much to learn in contacting people. Just to copy what others do does not work. The Lord will show us. If we are definite and desperate to gain people, we will find a way.</P><P>You need to contact people directly and individually, laboring in the gospel two to three hours every week. You should find out who is available for you to contact and then contact them directly and continually over a long period of time. You will gain one of them. If you take this way of directly contacting people one by one, I can assure you that you will bring two people into the church every year. You should make a decision and tell the Lord that you will spend two to three hours every week in the gospel. Then ask the Lord to lead you to contact people one by one. You should not stop going to the church meetings. You should still live your regular church life. You do not need to promote what you are doing. You just need to go and do it. Then gradually some will see what you are doing, and they will join you.</P><P>We have tried many ways in the last six years, and they may work, but they do not work satisfactorily. Only the way of contacting people directly brings a satisfactory result. We need to plan how to contact our acquaintances. We have to keep working on one of them directly, individually, and continuously. To get someone saved and established takes about six months, and to bring them into the church will take another six months. We may think that to bring one or two a year into the church life is too slow. But this slow way is actually the quick way. If twenty are meeting together in a locality, and five of them bring two people into the church life, that is a fifty percent increase. I can assure you that this can be worked out. Any other way will waste our time.</P><P>As branches of the Lord, we should give Him three hours a week for the gospel. Then we can pray, "Lord, lead me, teach me, and give me the wisdom in planning, in scheduling my time, in making appointments, and in talking to people." Then we should practice this directly and definitely. Surely we will gain people for the Lord's kingdom.</P><P>We have to change our concept concerning having a preacher with a preaching meeting. We ourselves need to labor directly to bring one or two into the church life yearly. This should be a goal in our labor. We love the church, but we may not have brought one person into the church in the past five years. We must have a definite beginning. We must practice contacting people to bring definite fruit into the church. We also need to practice the church life in group meetings and in larger prophesying meetings. This is really needed. But we need the adequate number as a base for our practice of the church life. The elders need to work two to three hours in the gospel every week to bring one or two remaining fruit into the church within a year. If the elders do this, others will rise up to follow. We should not give any announcement about this or promote it. We have been doing this for years, with little result. Promotion does not work. We need to labor ourselves to build up a living example.</P><P>This is altogether up to our decision. Would we still remain in the natural way, or would we turn to this way, a way full of the need for learning? A working brother's job may occupy him to the uttermost, but he should still endeavor to save some time every week for definite laboring in the gospel. Many of us have been busy working for years with little result. We must change our way.</P><P>We must have a plan for reaching people. We should make a list of all our acquaintances and study their situation. Then we can work on them according to our study. This is the way to gain the proper persons. We should not leave our bearing of fruit to fortune. It is not a matter of fortune but a matter of labor. We all have acquaintances for whom we can pray. We need to consider them and pray for them. We need to study their situation and decide when the best time would be for us to visit them. Farmers do not labor in a loose way. They study the situation of their land, their crops, and the weather, and they labor accordingly so that they can reap a proper harvest. We need to be the same way in our labor to gain people. We must have a plan and a schedule to labor on people two to three hours every week. We need to learn how to gain people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LABORING IN A PERSONAL WAY<br>FOR THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>I would ask the elders if they are happy about the increase in their locality. We must make a strong decision to labor in a personal way for the increase of the church. We should schedule our time for the weekly preaching of the gospel. For the Lord's recovery we all need a turn from barrenness to fruitfulness. We need the new ones. We need "new blood," newly saved ones. All the local churches must pay attention to this. If our number remains the same year after year, the saints may eventually lose interest in serving. Instead of being busy in the church life, they may become busy in a negative way. Mothers with young children are consumed with taking care of them. They do not have much time for other things. The only rescue for us is to change our way so that we can gain the increase. This is the only remedy.</P><P>If we cannot gain a thirty percent increase in a year, we should consider that as a failure. A twenty percent increase is good, but not that good. If twenty out of one hundred saints take this way, they can bring in at least thirty yearly. We do not need the whole church to work in this way. But it is altogether reasonable, logical, and possible that one-fifth of the saints will work in this way. Then we can gain a thirty percent increase yearly. This increase will stir up the interest of the whole church.</P><P>This burden has been on my heart for a long time. The increase of the local churches is disappointing. Many churches have been existing for years with under one hundred saints. This has caused me great concern. In the physical realm, the parents are eventually concerned that their children have children. If the parents have five children, and none of them has any children, the parents will be bothered and disappointed. Not to beget children is a serious thing. The increase of the churches is the key point to us today. I have been in the Lord's interest for about sixty-five years. I have no trust in any kind of revival. We found out by history and through our history that big gospel campaigns do not work for the long run.</P><P>The Lord needs some of His saints to practice the priesthood of the gospel according to His ordained way. Then the Lord will have a way. The way of revival with big speakers does not work so well. What we need today is the proper increase due to our labor. If we labor faithfully, we will see the result. We need at least twenty percent of the saints among us to labor in this way. These ones can bring a thirty percent increase to the church. This will lay a foundation for the Lord to start a solid building up of His Body. In the local churches, the basic number with the basic, promising members is short. We need solid members for the solid building. We have to look to the Lord for His mercy that this work could be started among us.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE NEED IN THE ELDERSHIP<br>IN THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY<br>AND<br>THE NEED FOR MORE FELLOWSHIP<br>AMONG THE CHURCHES<br>IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H1><P>In this chapter we first want to see the real and scriptural way for the elders to shepherd the churches. I am burdened for this because we have had a change in our practice of the church life. The Lord's mercy has brought us through to our present situation. Even though I still expect to see more, I feel comforted that the Lord has brought His recovery into His ordained way. No one can deny that we are now in a changed situation.</P><P>But we need to see that for the fulfillment of the Lord's ordained way, the eldership is crucial. Whether the new way will be a success or a failure all depends upon the eldership. The eldership is the key point, the crucial point. We need to see what the eldership should be and what the eldership should do in the Lord's ordained way. I have the burden in this chapter to present a real need in the present situation in the Lord's ordained way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRACTICE OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES<br>DEPENDING UPON THE APOSTLES' TEACHING<br>AND THE ELDERSHIP</H2><P>From the very beginning of the Lord's recovery, we have seen very clearly that the practice of the local churches depends upon two things&#151;the teaching and the eldership. The New Testament shows us clearly that the building up of Christ's Body is based upon the apostles' teaching (Acts 2:42). In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, "Upon this rock I will build My church." For centuries the interpretation of "this rock" has not been properly understood. The rock upon which the church is built is surely Christ Himself, but we need to consider the context of Matthew 16:18 to see something deeper. The Lord was asking His disciples who He was. Eventually Peter said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" (v. 16). The Lord Jesus responded to Peter by telling him, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" (v. 17). The Lord was asking the disciples who He was, but eventually what came out was a revelation concerning Christ being the rock. Therefore, the rock in Matthew 16, strictly speaking, does not refer to Christ directly but to the divine revelation concerning Christ.</P><P>We can see from the Epistles that the Body of Christ, expressed through the local churches in many localities, is built upon the revelation of Christ. The apostles' teaching is the revelation. If we only had the four Gospels and Acts without the Epistles of the apostles in the New Testament, our knowledge concerning Christ would be limited. The Gospels tell us about Christ in His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. The Epistles go on to tell us about God's economy and His eternal plan to have the Body of Christ.</P><P>The Body of Christ is not directly covered in the four Gospels. Of course, in the Gospel of John the church is revealed as the Father's house in chapter fourteen. The Lord said that in His Father's house there are many abodes (v. 2). The many abodes are the many members of the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:5), which is God's temple (1 Cor. 3:16-17). This is adequately proven by John 14:23, which says that the Lord and the Father will make an abode with the one who loves Him. The church is also revealed as the vine tree in chapter fifteen and as the newborn child in chapter sixteen. But the church as the Body of Christ is not directly mentioned in the four Gospels. Without the Epistles, we cannot see that Christ desires to have a Body.</P><P>John 3 shows us that Christ is the Bridegroom and the church is the bride as the enlargement and increase of the Groom. Of course, the Epistles show that the bride, the increase of Christ as the Groom, is the Body of Christ, the enlargement of Christ. This is like Eve being the enlargement of Adam, the increase of Adam. Eve is a type of the church as Christ's counterpart to be His Body. Even though the bride is mentioned in John 3, we could not thoroughly understand who the bride is without the Epistles. The Body of Christ is clearly taught and unveiled in the apostles' teaching.</P><P>Acts 2:42 says that all the newly saved ones were together to continue their life in the apostles' teaching. The apostles' teaching became the very sphere and element of the building up of the church. Ephesians 2:20 says that the church is being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. The revelation the apostles and prophets received concerning Christ is considered the foundation upon which the church is built. The building of the church upon Christ as her foundation is according to the apostles' and prophets' revelation. I hope that we all can see this.</P><P>Many recognize that Christ as the rock is the foundation of the church. Christians today are divided, not over Christ as their foundation but by different teachings. The denominations are not built upon Christ according to the apostles' teaching, but the building up of the local churches depends upon the apostles' teaching.</P><P>Once we come together in the name of the Lord, taking Him as our foundation, what shall we do? To build up the church, the proper teaching is needed. When Brother Nee brought the recovery to us according to the revelation he had received at his time, he actually brought in the teaching. We all stood for the Lord according to his teaching. Of course, our standing and doing was according to the Bible. However, although the Bible is one, the interpretations are many. Christians have argued, for example, over the way to baptize people, and they have been divided because of this. This is just one example of many divisions over different teachings. The basic need for the building up of the Body of Christ is the apostles' teaching. We should have no particular teaching other than the teaching of the apostles, which is the teaching concerning Christ's person and redemptive work and concerning God's economy in faith (2 John 9-11; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; Jude 3; Titus 1:4).</P><P>If we do not have the apostles' teaching, what shall we do? This is like sailing without a compass. Without the apostles' teaching, we do not have the compass, and we do not know the direction to take. Thank the Lord that in His recovery, by His mercy, we do have the apostles' teaching. In the recovery He has given us this clear view.</P><P>The apostles' teaching includes two main and crucial items. These items are revealed in Ephesians 4 and 1 Corinthians 14. Ephesians 4 speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father (vv. 4-6). Many Christians would agree with these seven "ones." But many would not agree with the revelation in verses 11 through 16. These verses are also a part of the apostles' teaching as a continuation of the seven "ones." They tell us that all the gifted persons are for the perfecting of the saints. Who practices this today? These verses also speak concerning the oneness of the faith and the winds of teaching. They go on to speak about the Body building itself up through the joints of supply and through each one part operating according to its measure. The application and practice of these verses cannot be seen in Christianity.</P><P>First Corinthians 14 is also a part of the apostles' teaching. This chapter reveals that the church meetings are meetings of mutuality, not meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening. All the attendants in the meeting should be speakers. Where can such a thing be seen today? Without the practice of Ephesians 4 and 1 Corinthians 14, how could the Body of Christ be built up? We must hold and practice the entire teaching of the apostles, without selection according to our preference.</P><P>The second need for the building up of the church is the eldership. The New Testament shows us that the building up of the Body of Christ, including all the local churches, involves the gifted persons&#151;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers (Eph. 4:11-12). These are the ones who give the apostles' teaching. The building up of the Body of Christ also involves the elders. It is the elders who put the apostles' teaching into practice. The apostles teach not only the saints in the churches but also the elders of the churches. Then the elders put the apostles' teaching into practice. The elders should never separate themselves from the apostles' teaching. For the building up of the church, we need the apostles' teaching and the eldership to practice it. We may have the apostles' teaching, but what about the proper eldership to carry it out?</P><P>The eldership is altogether a matter of shepherding. The elders should shepherd the church and take care of the church according to the apostles' teaching. The apostles' teaching in the New Testament shows us that Christ builds up His Body through all of His members. Ephesians 4 shows us that Christ as the ascended Head gave the gifted persons to perfect all the saints to do the same work as they do to build up the Body of Christ. This is the way that Christ takes to build up His Body. The gifted persons should not replace the other saints. They should teach and perfect the saints so that the saints can do the same thing that they do. Then all the members have a share in the building up of the Body. All the members should be put to use. Deformed Christianity puts most of the members aside and leaves the function to a special group of clergy.</P><P>We have to admit that over a period of time, we gradually drifted back to the practice of deformed Christianity. Eventually, the elders among us nearly replaced the saints. All the things of the church were in the hands of the elders and on the shoulders of the elders. The eventual result of this practice was that everyone was fired and replaced with a clergy. The saints were not replaced with Christ but replaced with the elders among us. I am concerned that although the way among us has been changed, our old practice actually still remains. The things concerning the building up of the Body of Christ are still mostly in the hands of the elders.</P><P>I would like to give a testimony of my experience in this matter. After the Second World War, the central government of nationalist China moved back to Nanking. In 1946 the saints in Nanking invited me to come and visit them. Eventually, they asked me to move there with my family to stay with them. I moved there in 1947. They had a meeting with me, which could have been considered as a meeting to initiate me into the service of the church there. I told them in the first message that I had a heavy burden to come to Nanking. Then I said that I was going to unload my burden and transfer it from my shoulders to their shoulders. While I was with them, I did this.</P><P>The elders should realize that the way that our Head, Christ, takes to build up His Body is to use all of His members. In Matthew 25 there is a parable about the Lord's slaves. Some have five talents, some have two talents, and others have one talent. The Lord treasures the one-talented ones. The problem among us is that we trust too much in the five-talented and two-talented ones. By trusting too much in these two categories of people, we spontaneously and unconsciously annul the one-talented ones.</P><P>The God-ordained way which has been brought into the Lord's recovery in these recent years is prevailing to recover the functioning of the members of the Body of Christ. This way annuls the clergy-laity system. Actually, this way revives and resurrects the "laity." Through the God-ordained way, the clergy is buried and the laity is resurrected. I am concerned, however, that in some of the churches the eldership is still replacing the saints. In a certain locality, many new ones may have come into the church. They may be full of joy and rejoicing, but after five years they may become calm. They become calm, and the leading brother who helped them becomes more active. If such a situation is to be resurrected, the so-called clergy must be buried, and all the saints must be resurrected.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEARNING TO PREACH THE GOSPEL AND<br>TO PROPHESY IN THE NEW WAY</H2><P>In the previous chapter I was simple to stress that we need to have the individual, direct contact with sinners through the proper skill. A better machine sometimes requires higher skill to operate. In the Lord's recovery, the spreading of the gospel is a great thing. All sinners have been captured by God's enemy, Satan. They are kept under Satan's hand and in his kingdom. It is not that simple to get them out of his hand. This is the highest profession in the universe, and it requires the highest skill and the top technique.</P><P>Contacting people individually to transfer them into the kingdom of God is the highest spiritual "machine." Today people need to learn to use the computer because this is the computer age; otherwise, they will not be able to work effectively. We also need to learn to preach the gospel. We cannot change the truth of the gospel, but the way to preach the gospel must be changed and improved according to the Lord's way to meet His need. If we still remained in our old style of eldership, I would be very grieved. We need improvement. The truth can never be changed, but our practice should be improved all the time. The eldership in its shepherding is for the purpose of raising up all the saints, all the members, to function.</P><P>In our preaching of the gospel, we have to learn, but we may not have the heart to learn. We may be filled up with our old way. By God's mercy and grace, we have agreed to take the new way, to let the church go on in this way. But I am concerned that our taking of the new way is still by the old way. Actually, the "cargo" is still the old way. We may have improved our way of preaching the gospel, but that improvement may still be in the old way. The practice of one man preaching and the rest listening is the practice of the old way. The new way is to contact sinners individually and directly. This is the "computer way." I beg all of you who are for the recovery to learn this way.</P><P>In addition to learning the new way of preaching the gospel, we also need to be brought into the organic practice of prophesying for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ. There is a great need in the eldership today. If we are going to shepherd a church with the desire to make it living, we must know how to do two things in the "computer way"&#151;gospel preaching and prophesying. Prophesying is not just a matter of standing up and releasing yourself by speaking in the meeting. There is a difference between prophesying, testifying, and ordinary speaking. Ordinary speaking is not prophesying. A person may speak a lot and still not prophesy. We may have the label of practicing 1 Corinthians 14, but in actuality we do not have the practice of 1 Corinthians 14. Our label may say one thing, but the cargo is different from the label. If the elders want their church to be living, fresh, and even refreshing, they must know how to preach the gospel and prophesy. They themselves must do these two things. These are the terms for us to fulfill the need in our present situation.</P><P>Now I would like to say a word of love, advice, and warning. We should not think that we will abandon the churches which are in the old way. That is absolutely wrong. We will not abandon anyone or any church. Rather, we would still take care of them and help them. It does not matter whether a church is high or low, living or not living; it is still the church. We still have to bear the burden to take care of that church. We should never criticize, despise, or form parties. We must maintain the present churches. Otherwise, the Lord's recovery is finished. If we lose the churches, we lose the recovery.</P><P>On the one hand, you elders must take care of the church and participate in the normal church life. On the other hand, you should practice the new way, the "computer way." The elders should take the lead to practice the "computer way" of contacting sinners. Then within a short time your practice will influence others. Others will rise up to follow you. You do not need to make an announcement. You do not need to promote this in the meeting. On the one hand, you should just go along with the church. On the other hand, you should practice the "computer way" to save sinners. Nobody will condemn you as long as you do not promote, criticize, despise, or form parties among the saints. Rather, all will appreciate what you are doing.</P><P>There are a number of saints who will not be able to take this way, but they will still appreciate your taking of the new way. I appreciate all the saints who are able to use a computer, even though I myself do not use one. We should sympathize with the saints who do not feel that they can take the new way. But at least we should expect that one-fifth of the saints will take the "computer way." If one-fifth take this way, the "computer age" will be brought in. Not everyone in the United States can use a computer, but many people can. The using of the computer is gradually spreading into all parts of society. At the initial stage, I only expect one-fifth of the saints in the church to know and practice the "computer way." I believe that this will issue in a thirty-percent increase yearly.</P><P>This fellowship is very crucial. We need to be the forerunners who take the new way, the God-ordained way. We all need the Lord's grace to have a change in our concept in shepherding the church. First, you have to release everything concerning the church out of your hand, and let the saints share in these things. You need to be revolutionized with this thought. It is hard to ask the saints to take the "computer way" if you do not take it first. You should take the lead to learn the "computer." Then the "computer age" will come into the Lord's recovery. Our way of contacting sinners is the most effective and quick way. This way will change the entire structure of the Lord's recovery.</P><P>There are some churches in the recovery that have had about the same number for over ten years. The saints merely come together in a routine way every week. There is no "new blood," no new element. Today we need the spreading and the increase. I hope that within the next few years there will be more local churches in the United States. I beg you elders to have a change in your concept, in your view. Then you should sacrifice something for the Lord to learn these two things&#151;the "computer way" of preaching the gospel and the "computer way" of prophesying. You do not need to promote these two things. You do not need to charge the saints or rebuke them for not prophesying in the meetings. You should take the lead to learn. Then others will follow you, and you can encourage them.</P><P>You must contact some of the saints meeting with you to shepherd them. Shepherd them into the proper morning revival and daily victory. On the one hand, you should practice this. On the other hand, you should go to tutor the saints one by one. We need to contact sinners one by one and tutor the saints one by one. Our work should be a one-by-one work. Gradually, you will gain someone to do what you are doing. If you elders expect the church to be revived in a general way, it will never happen. This has been an unfulfilled dream in Christianity for centuries. You should work on people one by one. Go to contact sinners one by one and go to tutor the saints one by one. You do not need to give messages in the meeting to encourage them, advise them, or rebuke them. Do not rebuke, charge, or impose things on them. Just do it yourself directly. Then you will see a change in your meeting every week. If you tutor the saints one by one, you will gradually gain a good number of saints to function in the meetings. This is how to shepherd the church in the God- ordained way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CHURCHES<br>IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>I am also concerned about the lack of fellowship among the churches in the Lord's recovery. Our giving to meet the need of the churches should be done by individuals and by the churches in fellowship. We do not have the practice of centralization, especially in financial matters. If the church in your locality has a burden for another church, you should just give directly to them. Then you will be in fellowship with the church to whom you gave the gift, and they will be brought into fellowship with you. The New Testament shows that the apostle Paul had the burden to help the churches in Judea in their financial need, and he brought the other churches into this burden. This practice was to help the churches to communicate, to fellowship, with one another directly. We need more fellowship among the churches today. We also need a number of brothers in the work to travel through the needy churches to have fellowship with them and to bring them into the fellowship. There is the need for the "blood circulation," the fellowship, to reach all the parts of the Body.</P><P>Many of us need to go out to get acquainted with the churches. The circulation of the spiritual blood will become a strong factor in the Body to neutralize all the differences and take away any troubles. Perhaps some in certain areas may be afraid of being confused if others come to visit them. But there is nothing in the New Testament which indicates that the apostles tried to avoid confusion by exclusion. According to Paul's writing, we realize that Apollos was not fully one with him in the work. Apollos was somewhat a factor of confusion, but Paul still recommended him (1 Cor. 16:12).</P><P>Based on this I want to advise us to open up our city, our region, and our country to the recovery, to all the saints. In the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the word of the Lord to a particular church is the word of the Spirit to all the churches. On the one hand, in the eyes of the Lord, all the churches are distinct, but on the other hand, they are all the same. The Lord's way is not to federate the churches, nor is it that the churches should be independent and separate from one another. All the churches should be dependent on one another and help one another.</P><P>Some of the co-workers may want to keep their locality or area of the country independent and, to some extent, isolated. According to our history, when this happened in the past, turmoil came out of these isolated areas and cities. Through the Lord's mercy, the recovery has reached every continent. It is hard for the recovery to go on if we are lacking in communication, in fellowship. But to have fellowship, to have communication, we must try our best to avoid controlling. When we fellowship with other churches, we should not have the consideration of being under them. No church is under any other church. All the churches are on the same level. On the other hand, none of the workers should have the thought of controlling the churches that they visit.</P><P>All the churches need to be open to the fellowship in the Body. There are no Californian churches or Texan churches. In the Lord's recovery, we have to be fully open to the Lord and open to one another. We should not be afraid that some different practices or teachings will come to our place. We need more fellowship among the churches. This will neutralize the differences among us. If you have been working in one place for years, it might be good for you to take the initiative to go to another place. One brother among us was captured for the church life in Odessa, Texas. Then he went to Los Angeles, to Anaheim, to San Bernardino, and back to Anaheim again. His going to San Bernardino was a great help to himself and to others.</P><P>I hope that my fellowship in these two chapters will impress you and protect you in the Lord's recovery and in His ordained way, so that the Lord would use His recovery through His ordained way to build up His Body. If you keep yourself isolated in your environment and situation, that will be a loss to you and to the Lord's interest. Furthermore, if you do not strive and struggle by sacrificing to pay the price to learn the "computer way" in contacting people for the gospel and in prophesying for the building up of the church, you will be behind in the Lord's move. The Lord's move is going on. To be kept in the Lord's recovery, we must keep ourselves open to one another. Moreover, the only way that can speed us up into the Lord's age, the Lord's move with the God-ordained way, is for us to pay the price and endeavor to enter into the practice of the new way, the "computer way."</P></body></html>
