   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EARTH COVERED WITH THE EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF CHRIST S VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ s train envelopes the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First this train was in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then it descended to Jerusalem and spread to Antioch, Philippi, Corinth, and Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, it spread to Asia and then to the western hemisphere.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now the long train of Christ is wrapping the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Compared to this train, the earth is very small.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is covered by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though the church has become degraded, it cannot be denied that nothing is more prosperous and far-reaching in human history than the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I left the mainland of China thirty-three years ago, there were not more than four million Christians in China.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Recently I read a newspaper article which says that now in China there are forty million believers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, we have learned that in just one county in a certain province there are one hundred forty thousand believers pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This proves that God is living and that Christ is mighty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Communist countries are known for being atheistic and for restricting the activities of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But after thirty-three years, there are ten times more believers in China today than there were in 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the stretching, the lengthening, of the long robe of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His train cannot be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more there is persecution of the Christians, the farther His long robe extends.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have also read that today in Russia the number of those who attend church services is five times the number of those who attend in England.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This reminds me of an article I read in 1944.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Stalin had asked the United States for aid.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>President Roosevelt told him that because so many American taxpayers were Christians, Russia would have to open the churches once again before aid could be given.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Roosevelt pointed out that his people could not help one who persecutes Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Stalin thought that since the churches had been closed for years, there probably were not many Christians left.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, he promised Roosevelt to open the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To his great surprise, at Easter, 1944, crowds of Christians gathered into the church buildings for Easter worship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ the Lord is full of divine attributes and human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In history there has never been a person with so many attributes and virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now the expression of His virtues and attributes makes up a long train, a train that covers the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This train is the church, the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Praise Him that we all are parts of Christ s long robe!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>CHRIST WITH THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The tunic, the long robe, the ephod, the breastplate, and the shoulder-pieces typify Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Regarded as a whole, these garments signify Christ expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the basic significance of the priestly garments.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But on the breastplate were engraved the names of God s redeemed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This no doubt signifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, upon the priestly garments we have the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that upon Christ, signified by the garments, we have the church, signified by the breastplate and the two shoulder-pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, the breastplate and the shoulder-pieces were set into the ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This indicates that the church is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ has His fullness, and this fullness is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The breastplate, the shoulder-pieces, and the long skirt all typify the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As we consider the garments worn by the high priest, we see that the most beautiful and precious part is the breastplate and the shoulder-pieces and that the longest part is the skirt.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The most precious and beautiful part and the longest part signify the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the breastplate and the shoulder-pieces were removed and the skirt were cut off from the high priest s garments, the garments would be without fullness and beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This indicates that without the church, Christ s expression would be lacking in fullness and beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today the beauty of Christ and the fullness of Christ are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In other words, the church is Christ s fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The picture of the high priest s garments shows clearly that the beauty and fullness of the garments consist of the breastplate, the shoulder-pieces, and the long skirt.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The significance of this is that today Christ s beauty and fullness are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to our view, the church may be degraded and pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But the Lord has His view of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to His view, the church is lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is not disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What the enemy, Satan, has been doing may be compared to the activities of a naughty boy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One day the Lord Jesus will say, Satan, is there anything more you can do?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If not, go to the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now I shall come in to clear up the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the eyes of the Lord, the church is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is true even today.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hallelujah for the clear picture of Christ with the church portrayed in the garments of the high priest!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The main elements of the high priest s garments are linen, gold, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Linen signifies humanity, gold signifies divinity, and precious stones signify transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Also, there are various colors: blue signifying heavenliness, purple signifying kingliness, and scarlet signifying redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As we consider the garments of the high priest, we truly see a portrait of Christ with the church.</S>
