BEING THE LAW OF BONDAGE</h2>
<p>The Old Testament law, the law given through Moses, was a law of bondage (Gal. 5:1). Because we are not able to keep the Old Testament law, we are bound by it. The law says, &ldquo;You shall not covet&rdquo; (Exo. 20:17a). A missionary in China once preached the gospel to his cook, explaining that all people are sinners and need salvation. However, the cook resisted, claiming that he was a good man who never sinned. The missionary wisely did not argue with the cook but instead began to talk about a fine horse that the missionary owned. The cook immediately began to think about the missionary&rsquo;s horse and how he could obtain it. The next day, when the missionary spoke again to the cook concerning all men needing salvation, the cook again claimed to be a good man who never sinned. The missionary then asked what the cook had been thinking about since their previous conversation. The cook admitted that he had been thinking about the missionary&rsquo;s horse and how to obtain it. The missionary pointed out that this was covetousness and was a sin, and the cook was convicted.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW TESTAMENT LAW<br />
BEING THE LAW OF FREEDOM</h2>
<p>Because no one can keep the Old Testament law, it is the law of bondage. Because the New Testament law, which is written upon our hearts, frees us, it is a law of freedom. Romans 8:2a says, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Today we are under the law of freedom, not under the law of bondage. The law of freedom is written not on stone but upon our hearts. Many saints have testified that as they were going to an ungodly place, although they were outwardly claiming to be liberated, something bothered them within. This inward feeling, sensation, or consciousness is the function of the law written upon our hearts. This shows that we are indeed under a law. Regardless of how much we believers may declare that we have been liberated, there is always a living law within us. Whenever we do something that offends God, this living law within rebukes us. Although we are always under the inner law, if we obey this law, it immediately frees us.</p>
<p>Many people are under the bondage of movies. A young brother may lie to his mother, telling her that he is going to the library when he is actually going to a movie theater. After returning home, the young brother may lie again when his mother asks about what he studied. By telling two lies, both of which will be judged by God, this young brother has shown that he is bound by movies. However, the law written in our hearts can free us from such bondage. This law frees us by troubling us. Before being saved, a young man may have felt fine and even proud after deceiving his mother in such a way. After being saved, however, something within will bother him both about going to a movie and about lying to his mother. Thus, the law of freedom bothers us, troubling us within. This law is very patient. If we disregard the troubling within, this law will simply continue to trouble us. Sooner or later, we will be subdued because a bothering element has been written upon our hearts.</p>
<p>Apparently, to be a Christian is to have peace. Actually, however, after becoming Christians, we do not always have peace. We are often bothered by the One who is within. This bothering One will not stop His bothering. He may continue bothering us for years. We will never convince Him to allow us to do certain things. He will patiently and gently continue bothering us until He subdues us. When He subdues us, the law within becomes the law of freedom. The law of freedom can thus free us from the bondage of movies or anything else.</p>
<p>We should not think that today we are not under any law. Christians are under the strictest law; it binds us even in minor points. This law, which is within every believer, requires not only that we speak the truth but also that every word be accurate. The more we love the Lord, the more this law will operate by troubling us. Before being saved, we were lawless, but after being saved, we become people of law. God&rsquo;s law is written upon our hearts. In 1 Corinthians 9:21 Paul says, &ldquo;I am not without law to God but within law to Christ.&rdquo; We are under the law to Christ. There is a new law in the New Testament, the law of freedom, which is also called the law of Christ (Gal. 6:2). We are under the law of freedom, the law of Christ. Every Christian is a lawful person, a person under law. This law is stricter and finer than the old law. If we have only a little pride within us, although no one may perceive it, the law within will condemn our pride. We all need to realize that we are under this law.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW TESTAMENT COMMANDMENTS</h2>
<p>Those who misuse Romans 6:14 as a justification to live lawlessly say that as New Testament believers we should not be under any commandments. However, there are far more than ten commandments in the New Testament. The first commandment in the New Testament is &ldquo;repent and believe&rdquo; (Mark 1:15); the second is &ldquo;be baptized&rdquo; (Acts 2:38). Other commandments in the New Testament are &ldquo;love one another&rdquo; (John 13:34), &ldquo;unceasingly pray&rdquo; (1 Thes. 5:17), and &ldquo;always rejoice&rdquo; (v. 16). If we do not rejoice, we are disobeying God&rsquo;s commandment.</p>
<p>Another commandment in the New Testament says, &ldquo;In nothing be anxious&rdquo; (Phil. 4:6). To be anxious is to worry. Parents know that the more children they have, the more anxieties they have. My mother often worried about her second daughter, my sister, who was teaching hundreds of miles away in another province. One morning my mother was nearly weeping and seemed to be angry with me. I asked, &ldquo;Mother, what happened?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;It has been four weeks since we received a letter from your sister, but you have not said a word. Last night I dreamed that she is very sick. You do not have a heart for your sister.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Mother, this was only a dream. Be at peace.&rdquo; However, this only made her more upset. I did not understand that what she really wanted was for me to send a telegram to check on my sister. She did not say this but instead rebuked me with the intention that I would understand her heart. I said many things to appease her, but nothing worked. Finally, she said, &ldquo;Why are you so dull? Don&rsquo;t you know that you should send a telegram?&rdquo; I immediately ran to send the telegram, and that afternoon the reply came from my sister that all was well. When we are anxious about anything, we commit a sin, for the New Testament says, &ldquo;In nothing be anxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Romans 12:2a says, &ldquo;Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; Verse 11 says, &ldquo;Do not be slothful in zeal, but be burning in spirit, serving the Lord.&rdquo; These also are commandments. If our spirit is not burning, we are disobeying a commandment. Therefore, we cannot say that we are not under any commandments. The New Testament is full of commandments that are even finer than the law in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Second Timothy 2:22 says, &ldquo;Flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&rdquo; This is a commandment to the young people. The young people should not believe that they cannot overcome their flesh and that they should therefore allow their flesh to do whatever it desires. This is terrible lawlessness. Young believers should heed the commandment to flee youthful lusts.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
