<h1 class="title">THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST IN FIRST CORINTHIANS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 12:4, 7-8; 16:16; 1 Cor. 1:2; 3:2a, 6, 9, 12a; 5:7b-8a; 12:13, 3b; 15:45b</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to see the enjoyment of Christ in 1 Corinthians. This book has been used by many different Christian groups and even by many great Christian teachers. The Brethren used this book very much for their doctrine, and the Pentecostal brothers have used this book very much for their gifts. The Brethren put out at least a few expositions on this book. They pointed out that in this book there are more than ten problems solved by different doctrines, such as the doctrine of head covering, the doctrine of resurrection, and so forth. They also spoke concerning the doctrine of the way Christians should meet in chapter 14. The Pentecostal brothers used this book very much for their gifts. They mostly used chapters 12 and 14, quoting verses from these two chapters for their exercise of the gifts.</p>
<p>But 1 Corinthians 8:1 says that knowledge does not build up but puffs up. Knowledge damages the building. The Corinthians got the knowledge and they had the gifts, but they were still babes (3:1). The gifts did not help them to grow. Regardless of how many gifts they exercised, they were still babes. They were not merely childish but babyish. We are burdened today to show the Lord&rsquo;s children the real way for the recovery of the building up of the Lord&rsquo;s church. It is absolutely not with doctrines or with the gifts.</p>
<p>We need to read the pure Word and not care for the religious and cultural traditions we received from the past. We have been under the covering of human culture and religion. These two things are strong veils that prevent us from seeing. The Lord&rsquo;s Word is here to take away our veils. We need to see that 1 Corinthians belittles knowledge. Knowledge does not build up. It only helps you to be proud. Thus, we have to drop the doctrinal knowledge, which does not build up but puffs up. The Corinthians had many gifts, but they were still babyish and even carnal, fleshly. This shows that 1 Corinthians is surely not for doctrines or for gifts.</p>
<p>Now we need to consider what this book is for. All the verses referred to in the Scripture Reading of this chapter are marvelous. But nearly all these verses have been missed or neglected in Christianity. Many of us have read 1 Corinthians, but have we ever paid attention to verse 2 of chapter 1 as the opening word of this book? The Bible has sixty-six books, and each book opens with a special word. For instance, Genesis 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; John opens in this way: &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God&rdquo; (1:1). Matthew opens with the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David and the son of Abraham (1:1). Paul wrote fourteen books, and each of his books also opens with a special word. That special word indicates the real content of the book.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING CHRIST AS OUR PORTION<br />
BY CALLING ON HIS NAME</h2>
<p>In the opening word of 1 Corinthians Paul says, &ldquo;To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours&rdquo; (1:2). Paul wrote to the church in Corinth and then to everyone in every place who calls upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. This Christ is both theirs and ours. Christ is ours. He is our enjoyment, our portion, so we have to call upon Him. To call upon Him is to eat Him.</p>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw how to enjoy the Lord from the Gospel of John. The Lord Jesus is nothing less than God Himself. But He is not the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God, the unprocessed God. At one time God was far away from any creature. But one day God came into a virgin and was born out of her. By this He became a man. Is this not a process? The infinite God came into humanity. He picked up humanity and put on humanity. After His birth He was processed through human living for thirty-three and a half years. He passed through many trials, tests, temptations, sufferings, and much poverty. Surely this is a process. Then He was betrayed, judged, and crucified. He was buried and came out of death into resurrection. Surely this is also a process. According to Exodus 12, the lamb for the passover could not be eaten raw. It had to be roasted with fire (v. 8). That is a process. Christ was really put into a kind of oven. There He was burned; He was processed to be our food, our life supply.</p>
<p>Throughout the centuries the Lord has been recovering things, and He is still recovering something from His holy Word today. In these days the Lord has recovered from His Word the matter of eating, and He has richly recovered all the things concerning Him as our food. To be our food He needed to be processed, and He was. Jesus today is no longer the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God. Today He is the processed God good for food. He has been processed to also be our spiritual drink and spiritual air. We have seen this clearly in the Gospel of John. The way to enjoy Christ is to drink Him, to eat Him, and to breathe Him.</p>
<p>The Bible is so meaningful. God did not give us one book of the Bible with the complete revelation. The truths are scattered throughout the Bible. The Bible is like a puzzle with many small pieces. We have to put these pieces together to see something. God put something in John, something in Matthew, something in 1 Corinthians, something in Romans, something in Ephesians, and something in Revelation. If you have the divine way to put the pieces of the puzzle together, piece by piece, from the different books of the Bible, you will see a wonderful picture.</p>
<p>John tells us that Christ is God Himself to be our enjoyment. For our enjoyment He was processed, and now He is ready for us to take. To take Him is to eat Him, to drink Him, and to breathe Him. But still John does not tell us adequately how to breathe. John would say, &ldquo;I tell you only that Christ is the processed God for your enjoyment, and to enjoy Him is to drink Him, eat Him, and breathe Him. If you want to know how to breathe Him, you have to go to another brother. Brother Paul will tell you.&rdquo; Now we come to Brother Paul. Brother Paul would say, &ldquo;If you are going to eat, drink, and breathe, you have to call, &lsquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&rsquo;&rdquo; This is why Paul wrote 1 Corinthians to the calling people, to those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. In the whole Bible there is not another book that opens like 1 Corinthians. This book was written to all who, in every place, call upon Christ, who is both theirs and ours. Christ is our portion. He is yours and mine. We can enjoy Christ as our portion by calling on His name. To call on Him is the unique way to enjoy Him.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
