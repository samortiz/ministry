   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The First Section</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being to Remember the Lord and</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Second Section</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Being to Worship the Father</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The pattern of remembering the Lord in a local church is our family inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first section of the bread-breaking meeting is to remember the Lord, and the second section is to worship the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Matthew 26:30, after the Lord Jesus established His supper, He led the disciples to sing a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that after leading the disciples to remember Him, the Lord led them to worship the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hebrews 2:12 says, I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This clearly points out that in the Lord s resurrection, He is leading His many brothers to worship the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not be indifferent concerning the second section, in which we worship the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should spend ten to fifteen minutes to properly worship the Father with prayer, praises, and hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During the second section of the meeting, we should take the Father as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After there has been much worship and praise to the Father, it is inappropriate to call a hymn concerning the Lord s precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hymns concerning the Lord s precious blood should be sung while the Lord is remembered and not during the worship of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It may be that a newly recovered saint, who has an appreciation for the Lord s precious blood and does not know the difference between praising the Lord and worshipping the Father, calls the hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this case we should sing the hymn and not change it; otherwise, he may not come to another meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As he continues to attend the meetings, he will understand the difference between praising the Lord and worshipping the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Testimonies Needing</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>to Follow the Flow of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we give a testimony in the bread-breaking meeting, we must learn to sense the atmosphere of the meeting and not interrupt it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The meeting may progress to a stage where it requires prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If our spirit is keen, when someone begins to pray, we will realize the need for more prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not call another hymn, because this will dissipate the atmosphere of prayer, and it will be difficult to continue the prayer after singing a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we must develop a spirit of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To give a testimony during the bread-breaking meeting, one must follow the flow of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This does not mean that you should not give a testimony before the bread or the cup is passed, but that you must have the assurance that your testimony will not interrupt the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you do not have the assurance, it is better to wait until after the remembrance of the Lord and the worship of the Father before you give a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The bread-breaking meeting usually lasts about one and a half to two hours after which there is still twenty to thirty minutes for the brothers and sisters to fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>PREPARING FOR INCREASE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we expect the number of saints in the church to increase twofold, the number of small groups should also increase twofold.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At present there are three hundred sixty groups; a twofold increase means an increase of another three hundred sixty groups.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every month we should add thirty groups.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The responsible brothers in the twenty-one halls should begin to prepare and plan how to divide the halls into districts and groups.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the number of saints increases, there is the need to add more groups.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is also the need to decide which groups should come together in districts to break bread.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Besides this, there should also be a way to keep attendance so that we know who comes to the meetings regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should also consider where the groups should meet.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I hope that all the halls will consider and observe this matter so that you may know which groups should be combined together to have a bread-breaking meeting, how many bread-breaking meetings there should be, and where the meetings can be held.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In addition to the bread-breaking meeting, we also need prayer meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are twenty-one halls in the church in Taipei, but there are only seven hundred saints in the prayer meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, we should also consider which groups should be combined.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The responsible ones in the halls and the experienced saints in the groups must consider how to carry out the bread-breaking meeting as well as the prayer meeting in the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not every small group will have a prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>KNOWING THE ESSENTIAL AND ECONOMICAL ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have considered the two sections of the bread-breaking meeting: for the remembrance of the Lord and the worship of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We will now consider the person of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is an essential and an economical aspect of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Due to the fact that some theologians did not have a clear view concerning these two aspects, the essential aspect and the economical aspect of the Triune God, great mistakes have been made in church history.</S>
