[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE ONE THE BACKGROUND AND SUBJECT OF THE BOOK Scripture Reading: Phil 1:1-18, 27-30; 2:1-5, 12-16; 3:2-11; 4:2-3, 14-19
[2]  In the Bible there are two books which are concerned with experience rather than with doctrine.
[3]  But if we get into the depths of these books, we shall find that they are sister books and that both are concerned with the experience of Christ.
[4]  At the time the book of Philippians was written, the Judaizers were exercising their influence over the believers in Christ 3:2-4 .
[5]  B. The Judaistic Believers Preaching Christ because of Envy and Strife
[6]  According to 1:15-18, some were preaching Christ because of envy and strife and out of rivalry.
[7]  Those who preached Christ in this way were the Judaistic believers, believers in Christ who held to the Jewish religion and who were bringing certain aspects of Judaism into the church life.
[8]  Even though the Philippian believers participated with Paul in the furtherance of the gospel, there was still at least some amount of dissension among them 1:27; 2:1-4; 4:2-3 .
[9]  In the four chapters of Philippians we see Christ as the One lived out and magnified, Christ as the pattern, Christ as the goal, and Christ as our inward strength.
[10]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE TWO THE CHURCH IN PHILIPPI Scripture Reading: Phil 1:1-11, 19, 27; 2:1-2; 4:2, 14-18
[11]  In Philippians 1:1 Paul says, Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons.
[12]  NEEDING MORE KNOWLEDGE AND DISCERNMENT A. In Love That Abounds
[13]  The excellence of Paul s writing is shown in the way he did not directly point out the defect of the Philippian saints.
[14]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE THREE PAUL S SUFFERING FOR THE GOSPEL
[15]  AND HIS ENJOYMENT OF GRACE Scripture Reading: Phil 1:7-8, 12-14, 16-17, 28-30
[16]  I. PAUL S SUFFERING FOR THE GOSPEL A. In Bonds
[17]  When Paul wrote to the Philippians, he was suffering for the gospel.
[18]  In 1:14 Paul goes on to say, And most of the brothers being confident in the Lord in my bonds are more exceedingly daring to speak the word of God without fear.
[19]  Far from being a discouragement, Paul s imprisonment was an encouragement, an encouragement to the brothers to speak the word of God without fear.
[20]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FOUR THE DIFFERENT PREACHINGS OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Phil 1:15-21
[21]  In 1:7-11 Paul uses a number of important terms.
[22]  In verse 8 he even refers to the inward parts of Christ Jesus.
[23]  In 1:15 Paul says that some also preached Christ out of good will.
[24]  These were the ones who had fellowship, participation, in the preaching of the gospel with Paul and worked together with him for the defense of the gospel, preaching Christ out of love.
[25]  It is commonly thought among Christians that as long as we all believe in Christ as the Savior, worship the same God, teach the Bible, and preach the gospel, everything is all right.
[26]  Although all Christians believe in the same Lord Jesus, worship the same God, teach the same Bible, and preach the gospel, they may have different ways of preaching Christ.
[27]  In 1:19-21 there are three crucial expressions: the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ v. 19 , Christ shall be magnified in my body v. 20 , and to me to live is Christ v. 21 . In this message we shall consider the first of these expressions, the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[28]  At the time of the conception and birth of Christ, the term Holy Spirit was used Luke 1:35; Matt 1:20 .
[29]  This title of the Spirit is related to holiness, sanctification, and separation unto God.
[30]  Since the Spirit of Jesus has particular reference to the Lord s suffering, and the Spirit of Christ, to His resurrection, the Spirit of Jesus Christ is related both to suffering and resurrection.
[31]  The book of Revelation refers to the seven Spirits of God Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 .
[32]  These seven Spirits are the seven lamps of fire burning before God s throne and also the seven eyes of the Lamb.
[33]  In the light of God s Word, we see that the Spirit we are enjoying today is not only the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit; this Spirit is not even limited to the Spirit of Jesus or the Spirit of Christ.
[34]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE SIX MAGNIFYING CHRIST BY LIVING HIM Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19-21
[35]  In verse 20 Paul said, According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.
[36]  In Paul s bodily sufferings, Christ was magnified, that is, shown or declared great shown to be without limitation , exalted, and extolled.
[37]  In verse 21 Paul goes on to say, For to me to live is Christ.
[38]  Christ could be magnified in Paul s body because Paul lived Christ.
[39]  The word for in verse 21 helps us to see that Paul could magnify Christ because to him to live was Christ.
[40]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE SEVEN THE BEST CHOICE OF PAUL Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19-26
[41]  Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is announced, and in this I rejoice, yes, and I will rejoice.
[42]  In verse 21 Paul says, For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
[43]  In this verse we have a contrast between Christ and gain.
[44]  Although in a sense it may refer to Christ, it refers to Christ in a different way, not to the Christ we experience by living Him.
[45]  Verse 23 says, But I am constrained by the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for it rather is much better.
[46]  Under those circumstances, we would expect him to long to be with Christ.
[47]  In verse 26 Paul says, That your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence again with you.
[48]  If we would experience Christ, we, the believers, must be able to boast, rejoice, and glory not only in Christ Himself, but also in someone in Christ.
[49]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE EIGHT STANDING FIRM IN ONE SPIRIT,
[50]  STRIVING TOGETHER WITH ONE SOUL Scripture Reading: Phil 1:27-30
[51]  The basic concept of the book of Philippians is the experience of Christ.
[52]  If we would have a proper understanding of Philippians 1 and the extraordinary expressions used in it, we need to see that the controlling concept, the governing factor, of the whole book is the experience of Christ.
[53]  We should interpret Paul s expressions not according to our natural understanding, but according to Christ.
[54]  Virtually every point in this book is related to Christ and the experience of Christ.
[55]  In 1:27 Paul says, Only conduct yourselves worthily of the gospel of Christ, that whether coming and seeing you or being absent I may hear the things concerning you, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together in the faith of the gospel.
[56]  If we would stand firm, we must be in one spirit.
[57]  If we would strive together, we need to be with one soul.
[58]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE NINE THE BELIEVERS SUPPORT TO THE APOSTLE Scripture Reading: Phil 2:1-4
[59]  The first four verses of Philippians 2 are one long sentence.
[60]  Verses 1 and 2 say, If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any tenderheartedness and compassions, make my joy full, that you think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing.
[61]  The way the Philippians could make Paul s joy full was to think the same thing, even the one thing 2:2 .
[62]  According to the context of the entire book, the one thing must refer to the subjective knowledge of Christ and experience of Christ 1:20-21; 2:5; 3:7-9; 4:13 .
[63]  Christ, and Christ alone, should be the centrality and universality of our entire being.
[64]  Our thinking should be focused on the excellency of the knowledge of Christ and the experience of Christ.
[65]  The kind of lowliness Paul speaks of is not our natural lowliness; it is the lowliness of Christ, as illustrated in verses 7 and 8.
[66]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE TEN TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PATTERN Scripture Reading: Phil 2:5-9, 12-13
[67]  In the foregoing message we considered Paul s appeal to the Philippian saints to make his joy full.
[68]  It concludes with Paul s word about holding forth the word of life so that in the day of Christ he could boast that he had not run in vain nor labored in vain.
[69]  Our mind should be occupied by Christ not merely in an objective, doctrinal way, but in a subjective, experiential way, in the way of allowing Christ to spread from our spirit into our mind and to take full possession of our mind, even to saturate our mind with His.
[70]  Furthermore, we shall be joined in soul, and our mind will be occupied with knowing Christ, experiencing Christ, pursuing Christ, and gaining Christ.
[71]  In 2:5-8 Paul presents Christ as our pattern.
[72]  However, when I was young, I was taught only about the objective aspect of Christ as our pattern.
[73]  I was told that in His life on earth Christ set up a pattern and that we should follow in His footsteps.
[74]  Let us now consider verses 5 through 8 in more detail.
[75]  In verse 5 Paul says, Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.
[76]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE ELEVEN THE EXALTATION OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Phil 2:9-11; Eph 1:19-22; Acts 2:36
[77]  In this message we shall consider the exaltation of Christ 2:9-12 .
[78]  The exaltation of Christ in 2:9 is actually the manifestation of resurrection power.
[79]  According to 3:10, Paul aspired to know the power of Christ s resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings.
[80]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that in 2:5-8 we have Christ as our pattern and that this pattern is the crucified life within us.
[81]  My burden in this message is to relate the exaltation of Christ to our spiritual experience.
[82]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE TWELVE WORKING OUT OUR SALVATION Scripture Reading: Phil 2:12-16; Eph 2:5-8; 2 Cor 13:3a, 5; Rom 8:11; Eph 1:5
[83]  Philippians 2:10 and 11 say, That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[84]  We have seen that the name is the expression of the sum total of what the Lord Jesus is in His Person and work.
[85]  In the name of Jesus every knee will bow, and every tongue openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[86]  In Ephesians 2:5 Paul says that we have been saved by grace.
[87]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE THIRTEEN HOLDING FORTH CHRIST Scripture Reading: Phil 2:14-16
[88]  These verses continue Paul s word about working out our salvation.
[89]  In verse 12 Paul charges us to work out our salvation, and in verse 13 he tells us that God is operating in us.
[90]  The title of this message is Holding Forth Christ.
[91]  To hold forth Christ is to live out Christ, to express Christ, and to work out our salvation.
[92]  Here we have five important, interrelated matters: working out our salvation, obeying God, living Christ, expressing Christ, and holding forth Christ.
[93]  The other four expressions living Christ, expressing Christ, holding forth Christ, and working out our salvation are unusual and even extraordinary.
[94]  May we all be exercised to speak of living out Christ, expressing Christ, holding forth Christ as the word of life, and working out our own salvation.
[95]  In order to have the experience of Christ revealed in the book of Philippians, we need to have Christ as our pattern, we need to have the Triune God operating in us, we need to be children of God with the divine life and nature, and we need to be luminaries positioned to reflect Christ.
[96]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FOURTEEN A DRINK OFFERING POURED OUT UPON
[97]  THE SACRIFICE OF THE BELIEVERS FAITH Scripture Reading: Phil 2:17-18; 2 Tim 4:6; Rom 15:16
[98]  . Since everything Paul covers in the book of Philippians is related to the experience of Christ, this must also be true of the drink offering referred to in 2:17.
[99]  If our experience of Christ has not come to the point where we have been constituted as a drink offering, we have not yet experienced Christ to the uttermost.
[100]  As a result of their experience of Christ and enjoyment of Christ, the believers have a constitution which Paul terms faith.
[101]  In the eyes of God, this faith is so excellent, beautiful, and marvelous that He considers it a sacrifice offered to Him.
[102]  Paul, after experiencing the Lord for so many years, especially during his imprisonment, became a constitution of heavenly wine that could cheer God and make Him happy.
[103]  In this message we have seen that the drink offering is an offering additional to the basic offerings; that the basic offerings typify various aspects of Christ; that the drink offering is a type of Christ enjoyed by the one offering Him, an offering that fills the offerer with Christ as heavenly wine and makes him wine to God; and that the apostle became such a drink offering through the enjoyment of Christ so that he could be poured out upon the sacrifice of the believers faith.
[104]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE APOSTLE S CONCERN FOR THE BELIEVERS Scripture Reading: Phil 2:19-30
[105]  In 2:19-30 we see Paul s concern for the believers.
[106]  Immediately after referring to himself as a drink offering poured out upon the sacrifice and priestly service of the believers faith, Paul speaks of sending Timothy and Epaphroditus, two intimate co-workers, to the saints in Philippi.
[107]  We may wonder why Paul turned to such a matter, which seems to have no relationship to the experience of Christ.
[108]  However, if we get into the depths of this portion of the book of Philippians, we shall see that it is definitely related to the experience of Christ.
[109]  In these verses we find a strong hint that even Paul s concern for the believers was the concern for the things of Christ and for the genuine experience of Christ.
[110]  Not many of us may realize that to experience Christ and to enjoy Christ is actually to care for the church, and to care for the church is to experience Christ and enjoy Him.
[111]  The book of Philippians deals very much with the soul of believers.
[112]  We must strive together with one soul in the faith of the gospel 1:27 ; we must be joined in soul, thinking the one thing 2:2 ; and we must be like-souled, genuinely caring for the things of the Lord 2:20-21 .
[113]  In the book of Philippians the experience of Christ is the key point, and the secret of the experience of Christ is to be one in soul or joined in soul.
[114]  Although Paul had a number of co-workers, only of Timothy could he say that he was like-souled.
[115]  This short phrase opens a window through which we can see the secret for us to experience Christ in a way which issues in a true concern for the churches.
[116]  However, if we experience Christ only in our spirit and are not one in soul with others who love the Lord and are seeking Him, our experience of Christ will be limited.
[117]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE SIXTEEN BEING LIKE-SOULED AND RISKING OUR SOUL Scripture Reading: Phil 2:19-30
[118]  In this message I would like to give a further word on the matters of being like-souled and of risking our soul.
[119]  Concerning Timothy, Paul says, I have no one like-souled who will genuinely care for what concerns you 2:20 .
[120]  Regarding Epaphroditus, he says, Because for the work of Christ he drew near even unto death, risking his life, that he might fill up your lack of service toward me v. 30 . Without spiritual experience, we cannot have an adequate understanding of Paul s thought in these verses.
[121]  It is very important to realize that if we hold such an attitude because of differences in the soul, this will cause our experience of Christ to be limited.
[122]  We shall not be able to experience Him to the full extent.
[123]  Rather, our experience of Christ will be limited to what we experience in our fellowship with Him in the spirit.
[124]  Years ago, I read an article which said that before a believer can become a martyr, he must first have the attitude of a martyr.
[125]  If we do not have the heart to sacrifice our mind, emotion, and will for the sake of the Body of Christ, we shall not be able to sacrifice our physical life in martyrdom.
[126]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE SEVENTEEN THE THREE POSITIVE ASPECTS
[127]  In verse 3 Paul continues, For we are the circumcision, who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.
[128]  They serve as priests by the Spirit of God, not by the ordinances of law; they boast in Christ, not in the law; and they have no confidence in the flesh, but have their confidence in the Spirit.
[129]  Paul could also be confident in the fact that he was of the tribe of Benjamin.
[130]  This was a lovely and faithful tribe, among whom was the royal city of Jerusalem with the temple of God Deut 33:12 .
[131]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN COUNTING ALL THINGS LOSS
[132]  ON ACCOUNT OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Phil 3:7-8
[133]  Philippians 3:7 and 8 say, But what things were gains to me, these I have counted loss on account of Christ.
[134]  But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them to be refuse that I may gain Christ.
[135]  For thousands of years, Satan, the enemy of God, has been using religion, philosophy, and culture to possess people and to keep them from experiencing Christ.
[136]  OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Phil 3:5-8
[137]  In 3:8 Paul says, I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.
[138]  The excellency of the knowledge of Christ is derived from the excellency of His Person.
[139]  But when Christ was revealed to him by God Gal 1:15-16 , he saw that the excellency, the super-eminence, the supreme preciousness, the surpassing worth, of Christ far exceeded the excellency of the law.
[140]  The knowledge in 3:8 is not the knowledge that belongs to Christ, the knowledge that Christ Himself has; it is our subjective knowing of Christ.
[141]  When Paul was still in Judaism, he was blind to the all-inclusive Christ.
[142]  Christ existed as the all-extensive One, but Paul was totally ignorant of Him.
[143]  Although Paul did not know Christ and was blind to Christ, he was nevertheless persecuting Him.
[144]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE TWENTY TO BE FOUND IN CHRIST Scripture Reading: Phil 3:8-9
[145]  If we would have a proper understanding of 3:9, we should not isolate it from verse 8.
[146]  I have suffered the loss of all things, Paul declares, and count them to be refuse that I may gain Christ, and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God based on faith.
[147]  According to these verses, Paul suffered the loss of all things and counted them to be refuse in order to gain Christ and be found in Him.
[148]  Furthermore, Paul s desire was to be found in Christ in the condition of having the righteousness which is of God based on faith, not of having his own righteousness.
[149]  This indicates that he aspired to have his whole being immersed in Christ and saturated with Christ so that all who observed him could discover him in Christ.
[150]  It is one thing to have a doctrinal understanding of being found in Christ; it is quite another thing to be found in Christ in our daily living.
[151]  I am burdened that we must not regard Paul s word in 3:8 and 9 as mere doctrine.
[152]  We need to consider seriously before the Lord just where we are right now.
[153]  When others meet us, where do they find us in Christ or in some good thing that is not Christ Himself?
[154]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE SEEKING TO KNOW CHRIST,
[155]  If we do not have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ v. 8 , we shall not be found in Christ, for it is having the excellency of the knowledge of Christ which makes us willing to suffer the loss of all things and count them as refuse in order to gain Christ and be found in Him.
[156]  Our daily living is an indication of what we are and where we are concerning the experience of Christ.
[157]  We may talk a great deal about Christ, but in our daily living we may not actually be in Christ.
[158]  When we are in the church meetings or with the saints, we may have a lot to say about Christ.
[159]  During the years we have been in the Lord s recovery, we have come to know that the Lord is the all-inclusive Spirit and that we are one spirit with Him.
[160]  Yes, we have seen the vision that Christ is our life, that He is the life-giving Spirit, and that we are one spirit with Him, and we talk a great deal about Christ.
[161]  It is to minister Christ to the saints that they may grow in the divine life, which is Christ Himself, and may advance in the experience of Christ and enjoyment of Christ.
[162]  According to Paul s sequence, first we receive the excellency of the knowledge of Christ by seeing the vision of Christ; second, we count all things to be refuse; third, we gain Christ and are found in Him; and fourth, we know Christ, experience Him.
[163]  It is crucial that we see a vision of Christ and thereby receive the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.
[164]  I can testify that by giving so many messages on Christ from the book of Colossians, I have been greatly helped to have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.
[165]  According to Colossians, Christ is the portion of the saints, the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation, the Head of the Body, and the Firstborn from among the dead.
[166]  If we have gained the excellency of the knowledge of Christ from Colossians, we shall be able to testify not only that Christ is peace and joy, but that He is the portion of the saints, the mystery of God, and the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead.
[167]  Rather, he speaks of gaining Christ and being found in Him; of knowing Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of Christ s sufferings; and of being conformed to His death.
[168]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO CONFORMED TO CHRIST S DEATH
[169]  It is easy to see that material things may be substitutes for Christ in our lives or may frustrate us from enjoying Him.
[170]  Even though we may love the Lord very much and daily take time to pray ourselves into the Spirit, in our actual living we may live in things other than Christ.
[171]  This illustration of a carnation seed is in keeping with the revelation of the New Testament.
[172]  As reborn ones, we have the seed of God within us.
[173]  According to 1 John 3:9, the seed of God remains in all those who have been born of God.
[174]  Most Christians only put to death the negative aspects of their natural life.
[175]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE GAINING CHRIST BY PURSUING HIM Scripture Reading: Phil 3:12-14 I. NOT YET PERFECTED, BUT PURSUING
[176]  In 3:7-11 Paul gives us the way to experience Christ.
[177]  In verses 12 through 14 Paul applies to himself the things presented in verses 7 through 11.
[178]  In verse 12 he says, Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue, if also I may lay hold of that for which I also have been laid hold of by Christ Jesus.
[179]  If Paul needed to say that he had not already obtained or was not already perfected, even though he had so much growth in life and so much experience of Christ, how much more should we have such an attitude about ourselves!
[180]  The first aspect of the way to pursue Christ is that we do not consider ourselves to have gained.
[181]  The goal toward which we are pursuing is the full enjoyment of Christ, and the prize is the extra enjoyment of Christ.
[182]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR HAVING THE SAME MIND
[183]  AND WALKING BY THE SAME RULE Scripture Reading: Phil 3:13-16
[184]  In verse 16 the Greek word for walk is stoicheo, which means to walk orderly.
[185]  Whatever state we have attained to in our spiritual life, we all must walk by the same rule, in the same path, as the apostle did; that is, to pursue Christ toward the goal that we may gain Him to the fullest extent as the prize of God s calling from above.
[186]  It is crucial for us to see that the basic and governing principle of the Christian life is that we gain Christ.
[187]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE AWAITING CHRIST FOR THE TRANSFIGURATION
[188]  In order to have an adequate understanding of 3:17-21, we need to know Paul s basic thought in these verses.
[189]  In chapters one and two Paul s intention was to have communication, fellowship, between him and the believers in Philippi that he might share his experience of Christ so that the believers might be encouraged to have a full participation in his enjoyment of Christ.
[190]  We may also liken national characteristics that occupy our soul to a tumor which grows in a person s stomach until there is room for little else.
[191]  In our psychological stomach a tumor has grown and has taken over nearly all the room which should be reserved for Christ.
[192]  In verse 20 Paul goes on to say, For our citizenship is in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[193]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX THINKING THE SAME THING
[194]  In reading the Bible we should not take anything for granted.
[195]  In the first two chapters of Philippians we see the fellowship, the spiritual traffic, between the apostle and the believers.
[196]  As we have pointed out, the third chapter is concerned with two kinds of dealing the dealing with the soul and with the body.
[197]  In reading the book of Philippians it is important to find out what are the basic factors which motivated Paul in his writing.
[198]  The basic factor within Paul motivating him to write this concluding word was the need to show the expression of a life that lives Christ, that takes Christ as the pattern, that counts all religious, philosophical, and cultural things as refuse, and that enjoys Christ as everything.
[199]  The first aspect of the expression of a life that lives Christ is forbearance.
[200]  Then the peace of God will guard our hearts and thoughts in Christ Jesus v. 7 . The peace of God saves us from worry and anxiety.
[201]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT EXCELLENT CHARACTERISTICS
[202]  OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: Phil 4:5-9
[203]  In the foregoing message we began to consider certain excellent characteristics of the Christian life, pointing out that in 4:5-9 we have the expression of a life that lives Christ.
[204]  In this message, a continuation of the preceding one, we shall go on to see six governing aspects of a life that lives Christ.
[205]  Next Paul goes on to mention whatever is well-spoken of.
[206]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE THE APOSTLE S SECRET
[207]  OF SUFFICIENCY IN CHRIST Scripture Reading: Phil 4:10-13; 3:9
[208]  In chapter one, Christ is the life for us to live; in chapter two, Christ is the pattern for us to follow; and in chapter three, Christ is the goal and the prize for us to pursue.
[209]  This means that he was instructed in the secret of how to enjoy Christ, how to take Christ as life, how to live Christ, how to magnify Christ, how to gain Christ, and also how to have the church life.
[210]  The secret of the Body is to take Christ as our life, to live Christ, to pursue Christ, to gain Christ, to magnify Christ, and to express Christ.
[211]  They have not learned how to take Christ as life, how to live Christ, how to take Christ as their pattern, and how to count all religious, cultural, and philosophical things as refuse in order to gain Christ.
[212]  According to 4:10-13, Paul applies the secret he has learned to his circumstances in prison.
[213]  As a prisoner in Rome, he was far away from many of the believers and from many churches which had been raised up through his ministry.
[214]  My reason for dwelling on this matter is to point out that our circumstances are always sovereignly arranged by God.
[215]  In the Christian life we experience both night and day.
[216]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE THIRTY THE BELIEVERS FELLOWSHIP
[217]  IN THE APOSTLE S NEED Scripture Reading: Phil 4:10, 14-20
[218]  In verse 18 Paul continues, But I have all things and abound; I have been filled, receiving from Epaphroditus the things from you, a fragrant odor, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.
[219]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE PAUL S GREETINGS AND HIS BLESSING Scripture Reading: Phil 4:21-23
[220]  In the closing verses of chapter four Paul extends a brief word of greetings vv.
[221]  Paul s best regards to the saints were that they would live Christ, magnify Christ, take Christ as their pattern, hold forth Christ, count all things loss in order to gain Christ and be found in Him, pursue Christ, lay hold of Christ, and do all things in Christ.
[222]  When Paul says, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, he means that the supply and enjoyment of the Triune God by and through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ should be with us.
[223]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO GRACE, SALVATION, THE SPIRIT, AND CHRIST Scripture Reading: Phil 1:7b, 19-21a
[224]  In 1:7 Paul tells the Philippians, Both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel you are all partakers of my grace lit.
[225]  Then in verses 20 and 21 he says, Even now Christ shall be magnified in my body...For to me to live is Christ.
[226]  Let us now consider the meaning of the words my grace.
[227]  If we consider this expression in the context of the entire book of Philippians, we shall see that the grace which was Paul s grace was nothing less than the Triune God whom Paul enjoyed and experienced and of whom Paul was a partaker.
[228]  Because of the defense and confirmation of the gospel, Paul was persecuted, arrested, and imprisoned.
[229]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY
[230]  In the foregoing message we considered four important terms: grace, salvation, the Spirit, and Christ.
[231]  In this message we shall go on to consider the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ for magnifying Christ.
[232]  In like manner, in reading 1:19 we should ask why Paul speaks of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and not of the Holy Spirit nor of the Spirit of God.
[233]  In this message we come to the crucial point of how we can have this kind of salvation.
[234]  Notice what Paul says in verse 19: For I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[235]  The true understanding of the Spirit is lacking among Christians today.
[236]  Even though many of us have heard messages on the compound Spirit, we may have little more than doctrinal knowledge.
[237]  In this Spirit is all he needs: the death of Christ and its effectiveness, the resurrection of Christ and its power, and Christ s divine nature and human nature.
[238]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR TO LIVE CHRIST BY THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19-21; John 14:17-20; 6:57, 63; 2 Cor 3:6b, 17a; Gal 5:25; 1 Thes 5:17-19
[239]  During my early years as a Christian, no one told me what was the goal of being a Christian.
[240]  Of course I was taught that we were saved in order to go to heaven.
[241]  We had heard of living for Christ, living out Christ, and living by Christ, but not of living Christ.
[242]  To live by Christ and for Christ and to live Christ out are all somewhat different from simply living Christ.
[243]  The Gospel of John reveals that, as those who believe in Christ, we need to live Christ.
[244]  John 6:57 says, As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me. Just as the Lord Jesus lived because of the Father, we should live because of Him.
[245]  As we have pointed out, the Lord Jesus, referring to the day of His resurrection, said, In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you John 14:20 .
[246]  He also said that because He lives, we shall live also v. 19 . According to John 14:19 and 20, we live in Christ in the way of coinherence.
[247]  Due to their lack of knowledge, some Christians have done strange things in order to experience the Spirit.
[248]  THROUGH THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19-21a; 2:12b-13a, 16a; John 1:1; 6:63; Eph 6:17b-18a; 5:18-20; Heb 4:12; Col 3:16-17; 2 Tim 3:16a
[249]  On the one hand, we work out our own salvation; on the other hand, God operates in us.
[250]  In verse 13 Paul exclaims, For it is God who operates in you.
[251]  God operates in us, and we cooperate with Him.
[252]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX THE RICHES OF THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY
[253]  OF THE SPIRIT EMBODIED IN THE WORD Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19; 2:12b, 16a; Eph 3:8; 5:18-20; Col 3:16-17; 1 Tim 4:6; 6:3
[254]  The basic thought of the Bible is that the Triune God desires to work Himself into man so that man may take Him as life and live Him.
[255]  Although this matter is so crucial in the Bible, many Christians today do not pay attention to it because they are preoccupied by ethical, cultural, religious, and philosophical concepts.
[256]  It is not sufficient to understand the Bible we also need to eat the words of the Bible.
[257]  If we receive the riches of Christ by pray-reading the Word, it will not be necessary for us to decide to do good or to improve ourselves.
[258]  We shall live a life full of the basic elements of Christ s riches.
[259]  In our living there will be divinity, humanity, the experience of Christ s death, and the strengthening in His resurrection life.
[260]  As you live Christ, having a daily life full of divinity, humanity, Christ s human living, death, and the fragrance of His resurrection, you will magnify Christ.
[261]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN THE RICH WORD, THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY,
[262]  AND UNCEASING PRAYER FOR LIVING CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 3:16-17; Eph 5:18-20; 1 Thes 5:17-19; Phil 1:19-21a GOD S ECONOMY VERSUS THE NATURAL CONCEPT
[263]  There is a great difference between God s economy and the natural human concept.
[264]  Now we come to the crucial matter of where to find the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive drink.
[265]  In Colossians 3:17 Paul goes on to say, And in everything, whatever you do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.
[266]  What does it mean to do all things in the name of the Lord?
[267]  In order to live Christ, we must realize who Christ is and what Christ is.
[268]  As those who have been redeemed, saved, and regenerated, we have God s life and nature.
[269]  How marvelous that fallen human beings can declare that we have the life and nature of God!
[270]  We have the nature of God because we have been born of Him.
[271]  When Christians are asked about the Holy Spirit, they often say that the Spirit is the third Person of the Godhead.
[272]  In the New Testament we see that the Spirit and the Word are one.
[273]  The Lord Jesus said, The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life John 6:63 .
[274]  We should not separate the Holy Spirit whom we have within us from the holy Word which we have in our hands.
[275]  It is crucial for us to see that the fullness of the Godhead embodied in the Son becomes the unsearchable riches of Christ, that the riches of Christ, the Son, are realized as the bountiful supply of the Spirit, and that this bountiful supply is now embodied in the Word.
[276]  When we read the Word and pray-read it, we can touch the essence and substance of the Word: the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[277]  Perhaps now you can understand why this message has such a long title: The Riches of Christ Realized in the Bountiful Supply of the Spirit and the Bountiful Supply of the Spirit Embodied in the Rich Word of God.
[278]  If we would live Christ, we need to read the Word and pray-read it in such a way that we partake of the fullness of God, the riches of Christ, and the bountiful supply of the Spirit.
[279]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-NINE TO PARTICIPATE IN
[280]  According to God s economy revealed in the New Testament, the goal of the Christian life is to live Christ.
[281]  Now I realize that the central thought of the Bible is not only Christ, but also to live Christ.
[282]  As Christians, we differ in the measure of Christ we have within us.
[283]  Some have given more ground to Christ; others have given Him less room to grow in them.
[284]  No doubt Paul s measure of Christ was full.
[285]  In verse 19 Paul says that his circumstances will turn out for his salvation through the petition of the saints and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[286]  According to verse 20, we see that the salvation Paul expected to experience was that instead of being put to shame, in everything Christ would be magnified in him with all boldness.
[287]  Thus, for Paul s environment to turn out to be for his salvation means that it would turn out for the magnification of Christ in him.
[288]  The words, To me to live is Christ in verse 21 are an explanation of what it means to magnify Christ.
[289]  In verses 15 and 16 Paul continues, That you may become blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life.
[290]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FORTY TO PARTICIPATE IN
[291]  Colossians 3:16 says, Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.
[292]  Because many of us were born into Christianity, raised in Christianity, and even constituted of Christianity, we must admit that, at least to some extent, we are still under the influence of the religion of Christianity, especially in the way we gather together for the meetings.
[293]  In these verses Paul says, Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.
[294]  Notice that in Colossians 3:16 Paul tells us to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly, but in Ephesians 5:18 he tells us to be filled in spirit.
[295]  When we put these verses together, we see that we should be filled in spirit with the word of Christ.
[296]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FORTY-ONE CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN US
[297]  BY HIS WORD INHABITING US Scripture Reading: Eph 3:8, 16-17a, 19b; 6:17b-18a; Col 3:16; Phil 2:16a; John 14:23; 15:4, 7
[298]  On the one hand, in Ephesians 3:8 and 17 Paul speaks of the riches of Christ and of Christ making His home in our heart; on the other hand, in Colossians 3:16 he charges us to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly.
[299]  Now we come to a very crucial matter: the need to receive the Word day by day.
[300]  We should not have the attitude that because we have acquired a certain amount of knowledge during our years as Christians, there is no need for us to come to the Word daily.
[301]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FORTY-TWO DOING EVERYTHING
[302]  Many Christians do not realize that as believers we should experience Christ subjectively.
[303]  The Bible reveals that God s desire and intention is to work Christ into us.
[304]  What could be more subjective than having Christ wrought into our very being?
[305]  As the extensive, all-inclusive One, the One anointed by God, Christ wants not only to dwell in us, but also to make His home in us.
[306]  Doing all things in the name of the Lord Jesus is related to letting the word of Christ saturate us and permeate us.
[307]  We are filled, saturated, and permeated with the Word by praying, singing, and psalming the Word and giving thanks to God the Father for the Word.
[308]  Therefore, we have Christ as the pattern of our salvation and we must work out our own salvation according to God s operation in us.
[309]  The issue of God s operation within us is that we hold forth the word of life v. 16 . Hence, the four basic elements in 2:5-16 are Christ, salvation, God, and the word of life.
[310]  The salvation in 2:12 is not salvation from the condemnation of God or from hell.
[311]  After saying that Christ was exalted and given a name above every name, that every tongue would confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, and that we must work out our own salvation according to God s operating within us, Paul suddenly tells us to do all things without murmurings and reasonings.
[312]  Philippians 2:13 says, For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.
[313]  The little word for at the beginning of verse 13 connects it to verse 12.
[314]  This indicates that we can work out our own salvation because God is operating in us.
[315]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR THE WORD OF GOD BEING THE EMBODIMENT
[316]  OF THE LIVING GOD Scripture Reading: Phil 2:13, 16a; John 1:1-2, 14; 6:63; Heb 1:1-2; 2 Tim 3:15; Acts 6:7; 12:24; 19:20
[317]  God s deeds also include incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, descending as the Spirit, and, in the future, Christ s second coming, the kingdom, and the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem.
[318]  We must turn away from traditional theology and come back to the pure Word of God.
[319]  Based upon the revelation in the Word, we may say that today our God is the processed God.
[320]  When we contact the Word in a proper way by reading and praying, we experience the current of the divine electricity.
[321]  If we do not experience God operating in us when we spend time in the Word, we must be wrong in some way.
[322]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FORTY-FIVE THE WORD OF LIFE
[323]  IDENTICAL TO THE LIVING CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:1-2; John 15:5, 7-8; Col 3:16; 1 John 2:14b; Rev 1:2-9; 19:13
[324]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that the word of life is the embodiment of the living God.
[325]  Now we shall go on to see that the word of life is identical to the living Christ.
[326]  First John 1:1 and 2 say, That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; for the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us .
[327]  It is crucial for us to realize that, having passed through the various steps of a process, the Triune God today has become the Spirit.
[328]  John 7:39 says, The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
[329]  Although the Spirit of God has always been in existence, this verse nevertheless says that the Spirit was not yet.
[330]  Many believers throughout the centuries had the practice of praying with the Word of God.
[331]  In the Bible light is one with life, life is one with love, love is related to holiness, and holiness, to righteousness.
[332]  These divine attributes light, life, love, holiness, righteousness, and power are actually the Triune God Himself coming to us as the Spirit through the Word.
[333]  When we contact the Triune God as the Spirit through the Word, we experience Him as our light, life, love, holiness, righteousness, and power.
[334]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FORTY-SIX CHILDREN OF GOD SHINING AS LUMINARIES
[335]  Those who have been listening to my messages for many years sometimes wonder why I always have something new and fresh to minister to the saints.
[336]  The more I pray-read 2:14-16, the more I realize that we can give message after message on these verses.
[337]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FORTY-SEVEN THE CONSTANT SALVATION
[338]  IN OUR PRACTICAL LIFE Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19-21; 2:12-16
[339]  According to the book of Philippians, there is a salvation which is constant in our practical life.
[340]  Many of us have been Christians for years, but we have never heard anything about this constant salvation.
[341]  In Philippians 1 and 2 we see a constant salvation that is, on the one hand, for a particular person in a particular situation and, on the other hand, for all believers in the common situations of daily life.
[342]  Under God s sovereignty, we may become a person in a particular situation.
[343]  In this message we shall see that we may have constant, daily salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and the inward operation of the indwelling God.
[344]  The bountiful supply of the Spirit also includes the divine attributes and the human virtues.
[345]  God is love and light, and He is holy and righteous.
[346]  What can save us from our murmurings and reasonings?
[347]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FORTY-NINE THE DIVINE AND RICH PROVISION
[348]  In 2:5-16 Paul not only speaks of constant salvation and its source, but also shows us the divine and rich provision for this salvation.
[349]  Although we cannot share in Christ s redemption, we need to be partners with Him in His human living, especially in His emptying Himself, humbling Himself, and in His not grasping equality with God as a treasure.
[350]  When I was young, I learned that in 2:5-11 there are seven steps in the Lord s humiliation: emptying Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men, humbling Himself, becoming obedient, being obedient unto death, and being obedient unto the death of the cross.
[351]  I was also taught that, as Christians, we should follow the Lord Jesus in these steps.
[352]  I realized from my experience that the traditional teaching of imitating Christ does not work, for I simply did not have a nature that could follow the Lord in this way.
[353]  In verse 15 Paul says that we shine as lights in the world.
[354]  Because we have the divine life and nature, we have become luminaries reflecting Christ as the real sun.
[355]  Whenever we cooperate with God s inward operation according to the divine life and nature, we shine with the light of Christ.
[356]  The fifth aspect is found in the phrase holding forth the word of life v. 16 . In 1:19 we have the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and in 2:16 we have the word of life.
[357]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FIFTY THE SACRIFICE OF YOUR FAITH Scripture Reading: Phil 2:17-18; 1:25; 3:9; Eph 1:13; 2:8; 3:17; Gal 2:20; 5:6; Col 1:3-4; 2:12
[358]  In 2:17 Paul says, But if even I am poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and priestly service of your faith, I rejoice and rejoice together with you all.
[359]  In this verse Paul speaks of the sacrifice and priestly service of your faith, a phrase which is difficult for students of the Bible to understand.
[360]  Ephesians 3:16-19 says that when the Father grants us according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into our inner man, Christ will make His home in our hearts by faith.
[361]  Then, being rooted and grounded in love, we shall be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth, length, height, and depth, and know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[362]  Something within us will be strengthened to realize that Christ is making His home in our hearts, that we are being rooted and grounded in love, that we are apprehending the dimensions of Christ, and that we are even being filled unto all the fullness of God.
[363]  To have the enjoyment of Christ is to have the joy of faith.
[364]  Paul speaks of the joy of faith in Philippians 1:25: And being confident of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of the faith.
[365]  Paul was constrained by two things: the desire to depart and be with Christ and the need to remain in the flesh for the sake of the saints vv.
[366]  Through the enjoyment of Christ, we experience Christ, gain Christ, and possess Christ.
[367]  We need to strike the match and experience the burning that we may gain Christ, experience Christ, enjoy Christ, and possess Christ.
[368]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE TO BE FOUND IN CHRIST
[369]  The excellency of the knowledge of Christ does not refer to Christ s knowledge; it refers to our knowledge of Christ.
[370]  We have pointed out that there is a certain requirement or condition for being found in Christ.
[371]  It may seem to us at times that we are found in Christ.
[372]  To repeat, we need to be found in Christ in the righteousness of God through the faith of Christ.
[373]  To have a proper understanding of 3:9 we should consider it according to the context of the whole book of Philippians.
[374]  In 1:19 Paul speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[375]  In the same principle the expression the Spirit of Jesus Christ does not mean that the Spirit simply belongs to Christ; it means that the Spirit is Christ.
[376]  Just as the Son of God is God Himself, so the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself.
[377]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO TO OBTAIN CHRIST BY EXPERIENCING
[378]  This process of obtaining Christ, as revealed in verse 10, is to know Him by knowing the power of His resurrection.
[379]  However, if we would know the power of Christ s resurrection, we must share in His sufferings and know the fellowship of His sufferings.
[380]  In a very real sense, Christ s sufferings have not yet been completed.
[381]  As we partake of Christ s sufferings for the Body, we are conformed to His death.
[382]  When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was dead to everything other than God, including His family and relatives.
[383]  When we are willing to suffer for Christ and His Body, we also shall be dead to everything other than Him, and we shall live only to Him.
[384]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-THREE TO OBTAIN CHRIST
[385]  BY ATTAINING TO THE OUT-RESURRECTION Scripture Reading: Phil 3:10-14
[386]  According to grammar, the out-resurrection in verse 11 is the goal of what Paul is seeking in verse 10.
[387]  In these verses Paul says, To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, if by any means I may attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead.
[388]  In verse 10 we see that Paul aspired to know Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.
[389]  He wanted to know Christ, experience Christ, and enjoy Christ.
[390]  Paul counted all things refuse in order to gain Christ v. 8 and be found in Him v. 9 , to know Christ, the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, that he might attain to the out-resurrection.
[391]  This incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ has become a seed sown into us.
[392]  The Christ we have received is not a natural Christ, but a resurrected and transformed Christ.
[393]  But the Christ we experience today is a Christ altogether in the new creation.
[394]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-FOUR PURSUE TOWARD THE GOAL FOR THE PRIZE
[395]  To be in the out-resurrection means to leave everything of the old creation and to be brought into God.
[396]  Although Lazarus was resurrected, he neither left the things of the old creation nor was he brought into God.
[397]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-FIVE THE UNIQUE MIND AND THE UNIQUE WALK Scripture Reading: Phil 3:15-16; Gal 5:25; 6:15-16
[398]  In Philippians 3 we have a revelation of a unique Person the excellent, all-inclusive Christ.
[399]  To answer this question we need to consider Paul s word in verses 13 and 14: Brothers, I do not yet reckon myself to have laid hold, but one thing forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
[400]  In verse 15 Paul says that if in anything we are otherwise minded, this also God shall reveal to us.
[401]  We cannot deny that we have received revelation from the Lord concerning the all-inclusive Christ.
[402]  Only God s revelation can cause us to have this mind, the unique mind, the mind which was in Paul and in many who love the Lord Jesus and seek Him.
[403]  This is a mind not to pursue a work or a movement, but to pursue a life which is absolutely out of the old creation and in God.
[404]  In our reading of the book of Philippians it may seem that Paul s thought in 4:1-7 is not nearly as high as that expressed in the first three chapters.
[405]  In chapter one he speaks of living Christ and magnifying Him; in chapter two, of taking Christ as our pattern, of shining as lights in the world, and of holding forth the word of life; and in chapter three, of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ and of pursuing toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
[406]  Philippians 4:1-7 is part of Paul s concluding word to chapters one, two, and three.
[407]  What he says in 4:1-7 is based on what he has previously written about living Christ, magnifying Christ, taking Christ as our pattern, knowing the excellency of Christ, pursuing toward the goal, and living in the out-resurrection.
[408]  At this point we need to consider in a fuller way the meaning of forbearance.
[409]  Forbearance means that we are easily satisfied, even with less than our due.
[410]  Immediately after speaking about forbearance, Paul goes on to say, The Lord is near.
[411]  As I have indicated, I do not oppose the understanding that this refers to the nearness of the Lord s coming.
[412]  Nevertheless, according to experience, not according to doctrine, I would say that this word refers to the Lord s presence with us today.
[413]  After speaking about living Christ, magnifying Christ, taking Christ as the pattern, and pursuing Christ as the goal, Paul indicates that we need to live this Christ as our forbearance.
[414]  BUT WITHOUT ANXIETY 2 Scripture Reading: Phil 4:1, 4-5, 11-13; 1 Tim 3:3; Titus 3:2; James 3:17
[415]  In 4:5 Paul says, Let your forbearance be known to all men.
[416]  In this book Paul is saying that we need to live Christ, take Christ as our pattern, pursue Christ as our goal, and experience Christ as our power.
[417]  The Christ whom we live becomes the forbearance we exercise and make known.
[418]  If we do not make known our forbearance, we shall have Christ only in doctrine or terminology, but we shall not have Christ in our experience.
[419]  The life of the Lord Jesus is the best illustration of forbearance.
[420]  The Lord Jesus said to them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? v. 17 . With a rebuking tone, one of the disciples answered, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? v. 18 . Appearing not to know anything, the Lord asked, What things? v. 19 . Then they proceeded to tell Him about Jesus of Nazareth, One they described as a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people.
[421]  In 1 Timothy 3:3 Paul indicates that the elders in a local church need to be forbearing.
[422]  If the elders do not have adequate forbearance, the church in their locality will not be built up.
[423]  We may even say that the Bible is a book of forbearance and that, as revealed in the Scriptures, God Himself is forbearance.
[424]  It is not easy to make our forbearance known to all men.
[425]  This requires growth, in both our human life and our spiritual life.
[426]  In the foregoing message we emphasized the need of forbearance in our married life, family life, and church life.
[427]  In 4:11-13 we see the relationship between contentment and forbearance.
[428]  In verse 11 Paul testifies, I have learned, in whatever circumstances I am, to be content.
[429]  In verse 12 he goes on to say, I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to be in want.
[430]  If we see the continuation here, we shall realize that forbearance requires prayer.
[431]  In verse 6 Paul says, In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
[432]  We have repeatedly emphasized that the book of Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ.
[433]  To experience Christ we need to live Him that we may magnify Him 1:20-21 .
[434]  We have seen that anxiety is opposed to forbearance.
[435]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-ONE A LIFE FULL OF FORBEARANCE
[436]  BUT WITHOUT ANXIETY 6 Scripture Reading: Phil 4:4-7; 1 Thes 5:16-18; Job 1:20-22; 2 Cor 4:16-17; 12:7-9
[437]  In chapter one we see that we should magnify Christ by living Him; in chapter two, that we should take Christ as the pattern of the Christian life; and in chapter three, that Christ is far superior to all things of religion and culture and that we must count all things loss in order to pursue Him and gain Him.
[438]  Second, forbearance comes from God, and anxiety comes from Satan.
[439]  Furthermore, we saw that to live Christ as our forbearance is to have a life free from anxiety.
[440]  If we are truly one with the Lord in our experience and something negative happens to us, we need not be anxious or troubled.
[441]  If we are not one with the Lord in a practical way, virtually every person, every matter, and every thing will bother us.
[442]  ACCEPTING THE LORD S WILL Experiencing His Sufficient Grace
[443]  We have seen that to overcome anxiety we need to pray and have fellowship with the Lord and worship Him.
[444]  Then with thanksgiving we need to make our petitions known.
[445]  When we do this, we may think that the Lord will always answer us and give us what we ask.
[446]  However, the Lord denied Paul s request, and said to him, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness v. 9 . Therefore, Paul could declare, Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
[447]  Whether or not we can exercise forbearance in difficult situations depends on the kind of realization and practice we have.
[448]  If we realize that a particular situation is of the Lord, that it is needed to perfect us, and then thank Him for it, we shall not be anxious or threatened.
[449]  If we realize that everything is the Lord s assignment and if we accept His will and thank Him for it, we shall be able to say with Paul, For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man is consumed, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day.
