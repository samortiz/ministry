<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Bruising the Head of the Old Serpent</H2><P>As the seed of woman, in His humanity, He would bruise the head of the old serpent&#151;Satan (Rev. 12:9; Heb. 2:14). In order to destroy a serpent, one should not touch its tail. Instead, the serpent's head must be bruised. Hebrews 2:14 reveals that Christ bruised the head of the old serpent on the cross. On the cross He destroyed the devil.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Satan Tempting the Man<br>to Sin and Rebel against God</H2><P>Satan tempted the man, whom God created for Himself, to sin and rebel against God. He also imparted himself in his sinful nature into man to be man's nature, constituting man a sinner, dead in his spirit (Gen. 3:1-6), making himself one with man (Matt. 16:23; John 6:70; 8:44; 1 John 3:8a). We are not sinners because we sin; we sin because we are sinners. In Adam we have been constituted sinners. From the day that man fell Satan became one with man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Having the Might of Death</H2><P>Satan has the might of death, holding man in slavery through the fear of death (Heb. 2:14-15), but Christ came as a man, as the seed of woman, to destroy Satan and to rescue fallen man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Becoming the Sacrifice<br>for the Redemption of Fallen Man</H2><P>As the seed of woman, in His humanity, He would become the sacrifice, shedding His blood (Heb. 9:22) for the redemption of fallen man, covering him as his righteousness, signified by the coats of skins of the sacrifice (Gen. 3:21; 1 Cor. 1:30a; Phil. 3:9), and making him alive (Rom. 1:17; 5:18b). Christ was made our righteousness, and we have been made alive in Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Opening the Closed Way to the Tree of Life</H2><P>As the seed of woman, in His humanity, Christ opened the closed way for sinners to take God as the tree of life&#151;the source of the divine life (Gen. 3:22-24; Heb. 10:19-20). After man's fall the way to the tree of life was closed due to the requirements of God's glory, righteousness, and holiness. Later, Christ died to fulfill all these requirements, and by this He opened the closed way for man to partake of God as the source of the divine life.</P>
