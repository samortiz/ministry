   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we want to see how the cross is related to the divine fellowship, the fellowship of the two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The divine fellowship is a particular capacity of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This fellowship has two aspects the vertical aspect by the Holy Spirit between us and the Triune God and the horizontal aspect by the human spirit among us believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second Corinthians 13:14 is a verse which shows us the vertical aspect of the divine fellowship by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse speaks of the grace of Christ, the love of the Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Triune God is referred to in this verse Christ, the Father, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, three things are covered grace, love, and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just as the Spirit is the consummation of the Divine Trinity, fellowship is the consummation of love and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Love is the source, grace is the course, and fellowship is the application.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The application is the consummation of the flow of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Divine Trinity, the Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the application of what the Triune God is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This application is the consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we have the Spirit, we have the Son and the Father because the Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With this Spirit there is the particular capacity of the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the vertical aspect of the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Philippians 2:1 speaks of the horizontal aspect of the divine fellowship, the "fellowship of spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This refers to the regenerated human spirit of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The divine Spirit regenerated our human spirit with the divine life John 3:6b , and now our human spirit is mingled with the divine Spirit Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The divine Spirit is for vertical fellowship, and the human spirit is for horizontal fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These two aspects of the divine fellowship are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we have the vertical aspect with God, it will bring us to the horizontal aspect with our fellow believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are in the horizontal aspect of the divinefellowship, we are also in the vertical aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These two aspects of the divine fellowship are woven together.</S>
