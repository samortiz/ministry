   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to the Prophet's Intercession</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>in Begging for Mercy</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jeremiah 15:1-4 gives Jehovah's answer to the prophet's intercession in begging for mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jehovah said to Jeremiah, "Even though Moses and Samuel were to stand before Me, My soul would not turn toward this people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Send them out of My sight and let them go" v. 1 . God was so disgusted with Israel that He wanted them taken out of His sight.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If they asked the prophet where they should go, he was to say, "Thus says Jehovah, / He who is for death to death, / And he who is for the sword to the sword, / And he who is for famine to famine, / And he who is for captivity to captivity" v. 2 . Jehovah went on to say that He would visit them with four kinds of punishment: the sword to slay, the dogs to tear, and the birds of heaven and beasts of the earth to devour and destroy v. 3 . Finally, He said that He would make them a horror among all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem v. 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>G. The Punishing Jehovah's Sighing</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>for His Punished People</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verses 5 through 9 are a record of the punishing Jehovah's sighing for His punished people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 6 is of particular interest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"You have forsaken Me, / Declares Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>/ You keep going backward, / And I have stretched out My hand against you / And have destroyed you; / I have become weary of repenting."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Again and again God had determined to punish Israel, but He had repented.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now He told Jeremiah that He was weary of repenting and would repent no more.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows how evil Israel had become and how patient God had been with them.</S>
