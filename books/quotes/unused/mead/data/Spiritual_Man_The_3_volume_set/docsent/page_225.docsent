   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LOVING THE LORD SOULISHLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, let us issue a warning here.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not think that we can love the Lord by our self.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord rejects all that comes out of our self.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even our love for Him is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the one hand, if a believer does not have a deep love for the Lord, He is grieved; on the other hand, even those who love the Lord can grieve Him because they love Him in their souls.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a believer exercises his soulish power to love the Lord, this love is not pleasing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The believer's love, even for the purpose of loving the Lord, should be completely under the control of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today there are too many who love the Lord with a worldly love; it is rare to see a love that is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What does this actually mean?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Believers primarily receive the things of God with their human hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They speak about their Father God; they call the Lord their "dear Lord"; and they remember the sufferings of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When they do this, their hearts are filled with joy and the sensation of love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They think that this feeling is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Perhaps when they think of the cross of the Lord, they cannot help but shed some tears, as if they have an unspeakable, burning love toward the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But these things pass through their life like a ship that sails through the sea without leaving any trace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such is the love of many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But what kind of love is this?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the kind of love which only causes one's self to feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not loving God but loving the feeling of happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The outward appearance of the Lord's sufferings moves their heart, but the truth contained therein does not influence their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How powerless have the sufferings of the Lord Jesus become in the hearts of today's believers!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When they think about these things, they become proud of how they love the Lord and of how others cannot compare with them!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When they talk about these things, they are like heavenly people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But, actually, they have not yet left their pitiful self one bit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When you listen to their talk, you think that they love the Lord very much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You praise and admire them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But actually they love themselves completely.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reason they remember the Lord, talk about the Lord, and long for the Lord is just because this makes them feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When they do this, they feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They do these things because their goal is to obtain happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such remembrance causes their "spirituality" to feel comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, they continue to remember the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is soulish and earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not from God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, it is not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is the difference between spiritual love and soulish love?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is very difficult to tell the difference outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, every believer can distinguish the source of his own love.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The soul is our self.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, all that is soulish cannot be separated from the self.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A soulish love towards the Lord is one that is from the self.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Loving God for the sake of obtaining a happy feeling for the self is loving God soulishly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the love for God is spiritual, then there is nothing for the self mixed in with it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is loving God for His sake, for the sake of loving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Any love for God that is for self-happiness or any other reason, totally or partially, is from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moreover, if we look at the fruit of this love, we can also tell its source.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If it is soulish, this kind of love does not have the power to help a believer to be permanently delivered from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He has to labor and struggle to stay away from the attractiveness of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, if the love is spiritual, worldly things and matters are naturally abandoned because of this love.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The believer looks down upon them and reckons them as something to be hated.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He no longer has his eyes on the world because the glorious light of God has blinded his fleshly eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After having this experience of loving God, he does not esteem himself highly because of it; rather, he humbles himself, as if he has diminished before men.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The nature of God's love is forever changeless.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our love is very changeable.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we love God with our own love, our love toward God grows cold when we feel unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After a long period of trial, it surely fails because the believer loves God with his own love; he loves God for his own sake, for his own happiness, etc. Therefore, when he cannot obtain the expected happiness, he shrinks back.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If it is the love of God, no matter what situation or position he is in, he still loves God without any change.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"Love is strong as death;/jealousy is cruel as the grave/...Many waters cannot quench love,/neither can the floods drown it" S.S. 8:6-7 . If a believer truly loves God, regardless of his circumstances and feelings, he still loves God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Soulish love ceases when the effect of the emotion ceases; spiritual love is strong, cruel, and does not let go.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord often causes a believer to experience what he considers to be painful in order that the believer would not love God for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When the believer loves the Lord with his own love for himself, he has to sense the Lord's love in order to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But when the believer loves God with God's love and for God, God does not let him sense His love.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Instead, God wants the believer to believe in His love.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the beginning of one's Christian life, the Lord always attracts the believer to feel His love in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After the believer experiences this, He leads him to take a much deeper journey.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God does not let him feel His love, but He causes him to believe in His love.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should pay attention to the fact that deeply tasting the Lord's love is a step which must be experienced by every believer who desires to go on in a deeper way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only by the attraction of the Lord's love can the believer leave all for the Lord and come forward to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the initial stage of the believer's spiritual life, it is necessary and helpful to have the sense of the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is something the believer should pursue.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After the experience of feeling the Lord's love and after a suitable period of time, the believer should not "hold on" to this kind of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Otherwise, his spiritual life will suffer damage.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There are different kinds of experiences for different stations on the journey of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is appropriate and profitable to have a certain kind of experience at a certain station.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But if a believer desires to maintain the experiences of the previous stations up to the last station, he would have to go backwards or remain at a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After the believer feels the Lord's love, the Lord wants him to believe in His love; therefore, shortly, but not immediately, after he experiences the feeling of His love, God no longer causes him to sense His love.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then He wants him to believe that His love is still unchanging.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If, after an experience of feeling the Lord's love, a believer suddenly does not have the same feeling, he should realize that this is the time for him to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He should not be alarmed.</S>
