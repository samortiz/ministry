   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION SEVEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ANALYSIS OF THE SOUL 1 THE EMOTION CHAPTER ONE THE BELIEVER AND THE EMOTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When a believer has not experienced the sure work of the cross, which is brought about by the Holy Spirit, he may have experienced deliverance from sin yet still be soulish and unable to overcome his own natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the foregoing chapters we have spoken concerning the believer's soulish life and work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we carefully study the soulish conduct and action of a believer, we see that both issue from his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although the soul includes three primary parts the mind, emotion, and will most soulish believers live by their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can almost say that they are controlled by their emotion in their soulish life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is because the emotion appears to occupy a greater part than the mind and the will in human life; its work also appears to assume a greater role in daily human living than the other parts of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we can see that nearly all the actions of soulish believers originate from their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE FUNCTION OF EMOTION</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our human feelings joy, happiness, cheerfulness, excitement, sighing, irritation, stimulation, despondency, sadness, grief, depression, misery, sorrow, agitation, confusion, anxiety, enthusiasm, coldness, affection, fondness, covetousness, compassion, kindheartedness, preference, likes, interest, desire, expectation, pride, fear, remorse, hate, etc. all come out of our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All work related to our thinking issues out of the mind, our thinking organ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All work related to our decision-making originates from the will, our decision-making organ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Aside from our thoughts, decisions, and their related works, all other functions issue from the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our multitude of diverse feelings are the function of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since emotion comprises such a vast area, nearly all soulish believers are emotional believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Human emotion is very complicated because it comprises a vast area.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to help believers understand, we will subdivide emotion briefly into three major parts: 1 affection, 2 desire, and 3 feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These three parts cover three aspects of the emotion's function.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a believer can overcome these three aspects, he will soon enter into a pure spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In short, our human emotion comprises what we commonly call the "seven passions," which are nothing less than the different feelings we have in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whether it is a feeling of love, hate, joy, grief, excitement, despondency, interest, or indifference, all of these comprise the different feelings in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, they all belong to the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we pay attention to the diverse feelings in our emotions, we will see that our emotion changes easily.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the world there are probably very few things that are as changeable as emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can feel one way one minute and feel another way the next.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Emotion changes according to feelings, and the latter changes very rapidly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, if one lives by emotion, his life is without principle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man's emotion always has a reactionary function.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that when man's feeling is active in one direction for a while, an opposite reaction is bound to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, extreme happiness is followed by sorrow, high excitement by great depression, and burning fervor by a feeling of deep withdrawal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even in the matter of affection, although it may begin in love, after a period of time certain influences may change one's feelings, when the intensity of hatred can far exceed the earlier love.</S>
