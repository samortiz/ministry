   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO CONCERNING THE USE OF REFERENCE BOOKS AND OTHER WRITINGS 2 ACQUIRING A PROPER FOUNDATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that we should not bring in any distractions or frustrations to the Lord's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I do not mean that we do not have the liberty to read the old books.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not exercise any control over the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Please do not think that in my fellowship concerning the way to use the reference books and other writings I intended to control the saints from reading others' writings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You are free to go to any books, but if you go to the books I would say you run a risk, and you will probably waste your time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you ask for my advice, I would say that you had better not go to others' books until you have finished the course of the Life-study Messages and the Recovery Version with the footnotes to get a strong footing and a proper foundation which gives you the best discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then it is safe for you to go into other books.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>SPIRITUAL BOOKS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I would also like to give an illustration of having the proper discernment in reading the spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Pilgrim's Progress, which was written by John Bunyan, an Anabaptist, was one of the top selling books next to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was even more popular than George Cutting's Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment, which is a booklet concerning the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Despite the popularity of Pilgrim's Progress, if you look into this book with some discernment, you can see that there is very little stress on Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The main theme of the book is that Christians need a full separation from worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Pilgrim's Progress helps one to get out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I was in the Southern Baptist elementary school in China, Pilgrim's Progress, translated into Chinese, was a textbook in the classes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many Christians received the help from that book to be separated from the world, but they could scarcely see any stress on Christ as life in it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>SPIRITUAL BIOGRAPHIES</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I also would like to fellowship with you concerning the reading of spiritual biographies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The better Christian biographies are those concerning people like Hudson Taylor, George M ller, D. L. Moody, and Charles Spurgeon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All these biographies are profitable in a number of points concerning the individual Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They are very helpful to some extent, and I personally have received much from these biographies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I read most of them in my youth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must realize, however, that the Lord's recovery has brought us absolutely back to His New Testament economy and the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must also realize that the twenty centuries of church history are a history of the deviation from these two points the New Testament economy and the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, not one of the spiritual biographies is cleansed from the matter of division.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I appreciate Hudson Taylor's life greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I received much help from his life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must realize, though, that even with him the element of division was still there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There was nothing wrong with him picking up a burden to bring the gospel, the Lord's name, and the Bible to China.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was altogether God's doing and I do believe that the burden which came to him was from God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I appreciated that from my youth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am not speaking this in a light way, because we have paid very much attention to the China Inland Mission which was founded by this dear brother.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We always considered that this was the top mission to China and was very scriptural, spiritual, and evangelical.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After we had seen God's New Testament economy with God's New Testament ministry, however, we could not absolutely say amen to this mission.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This does not mean, however, that we were as strong as John Nelson Darby was concerning Hudson Taylor.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the late 1800's the Lord raised up Hudson Taylor with a burden to bring the gospel to China.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This was during the same time when the Brethren Assemblies were very prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John Nelson Darby and George M ller were living at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These two brothers were the top brothers among the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They eventually held different opinions concerning the matter of receiving the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Darby felt that since denominations were condemned by Paul as something of the flesh and thus something sinful 1 Cor 1:10-17; Gal 5:20 , anyone who joined a denomination or remained in a denomination was a "companion of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He felt that the Brethren Assemblies could not receive a "companion of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To join the Brethren Assembly, you must leave the denominations absolutely and officially.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They used to ask people to write a letter to their denomination asking them to take their name off the membership roll.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It had to be very official.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This was the reason why Darby was condemned as being very exclusive, and we cannot agree with him in this point.</S>
