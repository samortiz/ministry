God is a God of blessing. He continually blesses His people. In the Old Testament, God's blessing to the people of Israel was threefold. Numbers 6:24-26 says, "Jehovah bless you and keep you; Jehovah make His face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; Jehovah lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace." Here we have the threefold blessing of the Divine Trinity&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The first is the blessing of the Father: the Father blesses us and keeps us. The second is the blessing of the Son: the Lord Jesus makes His face to shine upon us and is gracious to us; He is light and grace to us. The third is the blessing of the Spirit: the Spirit lifts up His countenance upon us and gives us peace; the Spirit is the presence of God with us, bringing with Him peace. This blessing of the Divine Trinity is not related mainly to material things; it is related mainly to the Triune God being gracious to us, appearing to us, and being seen by us.</P><P>In the Old Testament, God promised blessing to those who honor their parents, saying, "Honor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee" (Exo. 20:12). In Deuteronomy 28:3-6 we see the blessing promised by God to the children of Israel: "Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the field. Blessed shall be the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground and the fruit of your animals, the offspring of your cattle and the young of your flock. Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl. Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you be when you go out."</P><P>When we come to the New Testament, we see another threefold blessing of the Divine Trinity given by God to the believers. Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all." The love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit speak of the Triune God being with us as our blessing. The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as our life for our enjoyment. The love of God is God Himself as the source of the Lord's grace, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit Himself as the transmission of the Lord's grace with the love of God to be our portion. When we partake of, experience, enjoy, and receive this processed Triune God, we have the blessing.</P><P>In the New Testament also, God promises blessing and longevity to those who honor their parents: "Honor your father and mother..that it may be well with you [that you may receive the blessing], and that you may live long on the earth" (Eph. 6:2-3). In 1 Corinthians 3:21-22, God promises blessing to the believers, saying, "All things are yours, whether..the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours." Third John 2 says, "Concerning all things I wish that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers."</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
