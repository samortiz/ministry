[1]  In this chapter we want to see what the church is to God and Christ and how the elders should be to the churches.
[2]  HOW THE ELDERS SHOULD BE TO THE CHURCHES Needing to Have a Vision concerning the Church
[3]  Not only the elders but also all the believers, every saved one, should have a proper interest in people, a proper concern in others' spiritual welfare.
[4]  We should always be very concerned for our fellow members, and we should lead the new ones among us into the same condition of concern.
[5]  In 1 Timothy 5:17, Paul speaks of those elders "who labor in word and teaching."
[6]  Hundreds of messages on Christ as life have been given and printed, but I am concerned that many elders among us have not come into a full, thorough view concerning Christ as our life.
[7]  HAVING AN INTEREST CONCERNING PEOPLE'S CONDITION WITH THE LORD, WHICH MINISTERS LIFE IN THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST
[8]  We must first pick up a concern for people and go to contact them.
[9]  In a local church the first thing that is needed is for the elders to contact people.
[10]  As we have seen in the previous chapter, the elders must be apt to contact people and must build up the habit of contacting people.
[11]  As we have seen, the purpose of the elders' contact with people is to gain them for the increase of the kingdom of God, for the feeding and raising up, for the perfecting of the saints, and for the building up of the Body of Christ through prophesying.
[12]  Brother Nee testified that he received much help from Sister M.E.
[13]  In Romans 12, when Paul desired to help the saints in the church to be built up to be living and functioning members, he first said, "And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind" v. 2 . Regardless of what we are, if we touch the building up of the Body of Christ, our entire being must be transformed.
[14]  If we are to serve the Lord in a deeper way, we must know that both good and evil are versus life.
[15]  When people come to the elders, the elders may be tempted to "measure" them to see whether or not they are up to a proper standard, that is, whether they are right or wrong, good or evil.
[16]  We may be aware of the temptation extended to Eve by Satan, but we may not realize that every day we are under the temptation to contact others in the realm of the knowledge of good and evil.
[17]  We must be full of discernment but outside of the realm of good and evil without criticizing, despising, and judging others.
[18]  If we are in the spirit, full of life, we will be full of discernment, but we will have no criticizing, despising, or judging.
[19]  We will be able to minister life to anyone who comes to us because we will not care to remain in the realm of good and evil.
[20]  If we are humble and see our past in the light of this word, we will realize that many times we have fallen into this temptation and did not do anything to help the church in life.
[21]  In the church the only effective way to contact people is to minister Christ as life.
[22]  AVOIDING SUPERIORITY COMPLEX, ARGUMENT, OFFENSE, OR ANY FORM OF HUMILIATION
[23]  In contacting people, the elders must avoid superiority complex, argument, offense, or any form of humiliation.
[24]  If we know that someone has done something improper, we should not touch it.
[25]  We must have a strong burden to touch the person, but not his sin or failure.
[26]  If we do not know someone's sins and failures, they may be helped by us when we touch them.
[27]  We must contact such a brother as if we knew nothing about him and in a way full of life and full of Christ.
[28]  In their contact with people, the elders should minister Christ to them to meet their need Eph 3:8; Col 1:28 .
[29]  They should minister Christ to everyone the stronger ones and the weaker ones, the overcoming ones and the defeated ones, those with a good background and those with a bad background.
[30]  If we would practice to always seek a way to get people to open to us, to find the proper utterance to touch people's spirit, to catch the proper time to dispense Christ either by a verse or by our inspiration, and to know how to create an appetite to cause people to hunger and thirst after the Lord, the attendance in the church will be increased.
[31]  Question: How does one overcome in a situation in which he sees people's failures and his contact with people has become spoiled?
[32]  Question: If someone comes to us and tells us about his own failures, should we stop him or listen to him and try to give him a helping word?
[33]  If their speaking is criticism concerning others' failures, it is best to stop it, but we have to exercise our wisdom in doing so.
[34]  Question: If a person is in an improper situation, how should we regard him in relation to the Lord's table?
[35]  Answer: Only the Lord knows what to do or say in such a case.
[36]  We may think that we are holy, but when we get into the Lord's presence, our conscience tells us that we are not holy.
[37]  CHAPTER SIX THE ELDERS' EVALUATION OF PEOPLE Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:4; Luke 14:21, 23; 1 Cor 1:26-29; 12:22-25
[38]  In this chapter we want to fellowship about the elders' evaluation of people.
[39]  Among the saints in Corinth, there were not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many highborn; but God has chosen the foolish of the world that He might shame the wise, and the weak of the world that He might shame the strong, and the lowborn of the world and the despised, things which are not, that He might bring to naught things which are, so that all flesh should not boast before God 1 Cor 1:26-29 .
[40]  We should not exercise ourselves to have a clear sight.
[41]  We should be blind spiritually because we know no one according to the flesh; everyone who is in Christ is a new creation 2 Cor 5:16-17 .
[42]  OF THE ELDERS 1 Scripture Reading: Rom 15:16; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; John 15:5, 16 FULFILLING THE NEW TESTAMENT
[43]  His father, as an Old Testament priest, made many offerings as types of Christ, but John did a new thing, offering repenting sinners to be the members of Christ that God in His economy might have the church as the Body of Christ.
[44]  The apostle John stressed fruit-bearing in his Gospel, telling us that we are the branches of the divine vine, the organism of the Triune God John 15:5, 16 .
[45]  In Revelation, John speaks not of the fruit-bearing branches but of the priests of the New Testament in the church, the kingdom age, and in eternity 1:6; 5:10; 20:6 .
[46]  Paul's concept was that he was working on the believers for Christ, ministering Christ to them that he might present them full-grown in Christ Col 1:28 as sacrifices to God.
[47]  The spiritual responsibility of the elders is to take the lead among all the members of a local church in gospel preaching to get the new materials for the building up of that local church.
[48]  The most crucial and key point in leading a sinner to be regenerated and saved is to lead him to exercise his spirit in prayer to contact the Lord Jesus as the Spirit that he may be enlivened.
[49]  The one we contact may say that he does not know how to exercise his spirit.
[50]  We can tell him that it is to speak a little louder in prayer and speak from the depths of his being, and we may also demonstrate the exercise of the spirit to him.
[51]  It is true that whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved, but many have only called on the Lord shallowly and not from their spirit.
[52]  He may have prayed many times without touching the Lord, but we must help him to pray again until we sense that he has touched the Lord and he senses that he has been touched by the Lord.
[53]  God fulfills not only what we ask for the church, but also what we think concerning the church, and God is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think for the church through the power which operates in us.
[54]  All of these factors have caused us to reconsider the Lord's move in Europe.
[55]  We should not allow Europe to be lost, but neither should we do anything in a quick way according to our natural thought.
[56]  In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship concerning the spiritual responsibility of the elders.
[57]  The first priest of the New Testament was John the Baptist.
[58]  If we do not have fruit-bearing, we cannot have the increase, and if we do not have the increase, we cannot build up the Body of Christ Eph 4:12 .
[59]  In order to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we must build up a habit of the normal way for the spreading of the gospel Acts 8:4-5 .
[60]  In order to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we must learn how to bring people to have a personal contact with the Lord by their spirit directly.
[61]  CHAPTER NINE FEEDING THE NEW BELIEVERS Scripture Reading: John 21:15; 1 Thes 2:7; 1 Pet 2:2-3
[62]  The first step of the God-ordained way is the preaching of the gospel according to the New Testament priesthood of the gospel.
[63]  You could even save your time by arranging to have a ten minute morning watch with each of them.
[64]  You could contact the same three persons every morning to pray-read with them, fellowship with them, and enjoy Christ with them in a very brief way.
[65]  A number of the new churches in the Lord's recovery are growing fast, but many of the older churches, which have been existing for twenty years or so, have had very little increase.
[66]  A church established in 1970 with fifteen saints may still be under fifty today.
[67]  We have been very busy meeting, taking care of the church, and managing the church, but it seems that there has been little result to our labor.
[68]  Many Christians today do not know that the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior, is a life-giving Spirit and that we have a regenerated spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 8:16 .
[69]  Thus, the first meal we have to feed the new believers with is that our Savior today is a life-giving Spirit and that we have a spirit.
[70]  The real significance of the pope is in the papal system, and the real control of the saints is in the clergy-laity system.
[71]  What the Lord wants in the new way is for us to leave the papal system and the clergy-laity system.
[72]  In our elders' training thus far, we have seen that we need to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel.
[73]  We need to preach the gospel according to the way of the New Testament.
[74]  Then we have to have group meetings to equip, to teach, and to perfect the members of the Body of Christ so that they all will be able to do the same work that the gifted persons do to build up the Body of Christ.
[75]  Finally, we need to attain to the stage of every member of the church prophesying in the church meetings for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ and as the new man.
[76]  The elders should spend time and energy to teach each one of the attendants of the group meetings.
[77]  This is why Paul said in Acts 20 that he taught the saints publicly and from house to house and that he admonished each one of them night and day with tears vv.
[78]  Formerly in our practice, we only had one or two speakers in the meetings.
[79]  Today some may think that, if we arrange to have eight to ten speakers in the meetings, we have mutuality.
[80]  The elders have to spend a great deal of time to stir up the brothers and sisters to have a heart to learn to prophesy.
[81]  We must change our philosophy and logic and drop everything of the old way.
[82]  In order to keep a good, excellent, and beautiful order in the church, the elders should remember to avoid three things.
[83]  First, each of the elders should not regard himself as higher, more experienced, or better than the other elders.
[84]  CHAPTER TWELVE KNOWING THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4; Acts 2:42; 15:1-34; Rom 15:25-27; 16:1-4; Acts 19:21; 20:16; 21:12-13, 17-19; 1 Cor 1:12; Gal 2:8-9; Acts 18:24; 19:1a; 1 Cor 1:12; 4:6; 16:12
[85]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You for Your economy and for Your sovereignty over us today that we all could be gathered together at this time and in this place.
[86]  The door is also wide open to the Lord's recovery in Russia.
[87]  We have signed the order to have altogether one and a half million books printed in Russian.
[88]  The Problem of the Thought of Being a Hero
[89]  I was humble, because I did not know much about life, the Spirit, Christ, or the church as the Body of Christ.
[90]  In the recovery we have been suffering and suffering from 1922 up to now because of these three things: the pride of the younger ones, the thought of being a hero of the middle-aged ones, and the opinions of the older ones.
[91]  Everything may be all right with us now, but these problems are within us.
[92]  We should be serious in taking the eldership in the recovery.
[93]  We have to fear the Lord as our Head.
[94]  In the church life, we all have to learn to be subject one to another.
[95]  Not only should the young ones be subject to the older ones, but also the older ones should be subject to the young ones in the fear of Christ Eph 5:21; 1 Pet 5:5 .
[96]  If we remain in the recovery in our pride, our thought of being a hero, or our opinions, we will be the first ones to suffer, and we will cause the church to suffer.
[97]  I am concerned that in the Lord's recovery, the brothers in a certain country may consider that the work there is their work.
[98]  If we want to be those who are in the practicality of the Body, we need to keep the oneness of the Body and maintain a good order in the Body.
[99]  Today in all of Christianity, the reality of the Body is absent because there is no oneness.
[100]  At this point in our fellowship concerning knowing the Body, I would like to add a word concerning those saints whom the Lord used to recover the experiences of the inner life.
[101]  Brother Austin-Sparks's second visit to us created a big problem, and all the saints were tested.
[102]  They began to say that they just wanted Christ and did not care for the church.
[103]  Regardless of how much you care for Christ and have experienced Christ, if you meet in a way that does not care for the truth of the church, your meeting is a division.
[104]  I told them that if they did not take care of the truth concerning the church, especially the church ground, they would be divided again and again after they left the recovery.
[105]  When these dissenting ones came to me, I told them that regardless of what they did, I would not make any division or set up new churches.
[106]  But I also told them that I would not tolerate anything that was against the truth.
[107]  Later, they began to say that once an apostle establishes churches and appoints elders in them, he should keep his hands off of these churches.
[108]  KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE BODY Keeping the Oneness of the Spirit
[109]  To keep the oneness of the Body is actually to keep the oneness of the Spirit because the Spirit is the reality and the essence of the Body.
[110]  To keep a pleasant, good, and beautiful order in the recovery, we need to be subject to one another in the fear of Christ Eph 5:21 .
[111]  No one can deny that having a good speaker speak every Lord's Day helps people to a certain extent, but the annulling and killing of the saints' function is hidden in this practice.
[112]  If someone takes the way of one man speaking and the rest listening for more than ten years, the ones under his speaking, who received much help, will be annulled in their function and their capacity of speaking for the Lord.
[113]  Now that we are practicing the God-ordained way, many new ones among us are being raised up in a proper way to be functioning members of the Body of Christ.
[114]  I hope that we will rise up to drop everything other than Christ and to carry Christ as our ark, to carry the Body of Christ as our tabernacle, and to follow the truth as our pillar of fire in the night and our pillar of cloud in the day.
