   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SUBDIVISION ACCORDING TO</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the best way to subdivide the Bible and is the way we recommend.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are three categories in the Old Testament and three categories in the New.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The nature of the three categories in both Testaments is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. The Old Testament</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>History: From Genesis to Esther there are seventeen books on history.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It begins from God s creation of the universe and continues until the Israelites were returned from captivity to rebuild the temple and the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the history and journey of God s people before Him; it is everything that they have passed through before God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Experience: There are the five books of poetry: Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There may be some history records in these books, but they are not on history.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are also some prophecies in them, but their main emphasis is not prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These five books emphasize the spiritual experiences of God s saints before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If there were only the history in the preceding category without the experience that followed, we could only see the historical facts without understanding the inward condition under those circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These five books of poetry in the Bible precisely describe the inward condition of the chosen people before God under various circumstances and experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we read these five books of poetry, we can find out the spiritual experiences of these people before God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Prophecy: From Isaiah to Malachi there are seventeen books.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are seventeen books of history at the beginning, and seventeen books of prophecy at the end, with five books of experience in the middle, making up a total of thirty-nine books.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>B. The New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>History: The four Gospels plus the Acts are five books on history.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The four Gospels cover the experiences of the Lord Jesus on earth together with the experiences of His disciples in following Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Acts shows us how the disciples testified for the Lord everywhere they went.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These five books are all on historical facts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Experience: These are the twenty-one Epistles from Romans to Jude.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These twenty-one books speak of the Christian experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Gospels and Acts show us what Christ and the Christians encountered.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They show us their activities, their moves, and their works.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The twenty-one Epistles explain to us the inward spiritual experiences of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Prophecy: There is only one book, the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether it is the Old Testament or the New Testament, they both begin with the history, then proceed to tell of the experiences, and end with the prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For the individual Christians, the order is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, we have our history before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Next, we develop some spiritual experiences during the course of the history, and then there is the hope and the anticipation for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Old Testament recounted much history and many spiritual experiences; then at the end, it spoke of the saints being filled with hope and anticipation of the coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The New Testament is written the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There are many facts and experiences, and then at the end, there is an expectation and a hope, which is the return of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No Christian can avoid these three steps.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are the history, the experiences, and the expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>V. SUBDIVISION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>ACCORDING TO THE JEWS OR THE RABBIS</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Old Testament was originally in the hands of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some teachers among them were authoritative Bible expositors.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Jews called them rabbis.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The word rabbi means teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the ancient time, the subdivision of the Old Testament among the rabbis was like what the Lord Jesus said in Luke 24:44.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In other words, the Lord s word in Luke 24:44 was based on the subdivision of the Old Testament into three categories by the rabbis.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A. The Law of Moses</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These refer to the Pentateuch.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sometimes the Jews abbreviated the Pentateuch as Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the Jews mention Moses, sometimes they are not referring to the person Moses, but to the five books of the Law written by him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These five books are sometimes simply called the Law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the Jews refer to the Law, they mean the Pentateuch.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, among the Christians and the Jews, there are five different ways of referring to the first five books of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are referred to as the Pentateuch of Moses, as the Pentateuch, as the Law of Moses, as the Law, and as Moses.</S>
