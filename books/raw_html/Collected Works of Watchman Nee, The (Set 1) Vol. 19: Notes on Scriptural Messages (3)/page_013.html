<P>One day I was conversing with a brother, and I asked him a question. It was strange that Paul asked Timothy, who was quite young, to ordain elders. Are not elders supposed to be quite elderly? How could he, being so young, ordain elders? Is this not illogical? How could Timothy ordain elders? Please remember that God has a different way of numbering a person's days. You may be sixty years of age but have had only one month before the Lord; or you may be twenty years of age and have had only ten years before the Lord. Your days are counted from the time you are saved. The days before you were saved were not counted; they were put aside. Today I am not talking about your years before you were saved and how they were not counted. Therefore, I will only say this much.</P><P>Now let me say a few words to the believers. Not only are the days before a person's salvation not counted; even after a person is saved and believes in the Lord, not every single day is counted. You may have believed in Him for five years, but that does not mean that you are five years old. Please remember that the number of years is one thing, and age is another thing. This does not make sense according to the world's mentality. However, it is quite true in the spiritual sense. You may have been born again for fifty years and not be fifty years of age.</P><P>Did we not just read two verses that we can use as a comparison? Let us read it again carefully that we may understand how God numbers days. Let us read Acts 13:18-22 very carefully and see how many years there were between the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and the time that Solomon built the temple. Paul said, "And for a time of about forty years He carried them as a nurse in the wilderness...And after these things, for about four hundred and fifty years, He gave them judges...and God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. And when He had deposed him, He raised up David for them as king [ for forty years]." How many years are there? Forty years plus four hundred fifty years is four hundred ninety years. Four hundred ninety years plus forty years twice is five hundred seventy years, which plus three years of Solomon's reign up to the time of the building the temple becomes five hundred seventy-three years. Therefore, from the time of Exodus to the fourth year of Solomon when he built the temple was five hundred seventy-three years.</P><P>Now let us see what is recorded in 1 Kings 6:1: "And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the Lord." Here it says four hundred eighty years, not five hundred seventy-three years. There is a difference of ninety-three years! There must be an error either with the book of Acts or with the book of the Kings. Otherwise, why would there be such a discrepancy of years? They both recorded the period from Exodus to Solomon's building of the temple. There must be an error in one of them, or both of them are wrong. But you cannot say that, because the spiritual principle in them is the same.</P><P>Let us read the record in Acts. Forty years in the wilderness is correct. Saul's reigning for forty years is also correct. David's forty years cannot be wrong. The temple was built in the fourth year of Solomon's reign; therefore, only three years were past when he built the temple. All these years cannot be wrong because the Israelites were reigning at that time. But during the age of the judges, the Israelites were captured several times. Let us see how many years they were captured away as slaves. Judges 3:8 says, "Therefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years." This was the first captivity which lasted for eight years. The second time was recorded in verse 14 of the same chapter: "So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years." "And the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles. And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel" (4:2-3). This can be considered as the third captivity because the Israelites at that time did not have their own judges and were completely in the hands of the Gentiles. "And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord: and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years" (6:1). This was the fourth time. Another time was recorded in 13:1: "And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years." The Israelites lost their freedom and had to serve the Gentiles altogether five times. How many years in total? Eight plus eighteen plus twenty plus seven, and finally another forty years must be added together. How many years are there altogether? Exactly ninety-three years, no more and no less. This matches the difference between Acts 13 and 1 Kings 6; both are ninety-three years. It is apparent that Paul counted those ninety-three years, but they were not recorded in the first book of the Kings. Therefore it has only four hundred eighty years, whereas it should have been five hundred seventy-three years!</P><P>Why were those ninety-three years not counted? There was a reason. Those were the lost years! Oh, whenever we are captured, lose our freedom, serve the Gentiles, and do not have our own judges are the times when we do not have any years to be counted. Now we have gone one step further. We see that not only were we dead before we were born again, but even after we are saved and have eternal life, God considers many days to be dead. Even if we have been redeemed and belong to God, if we are entangled by the world and sold to Moab, the days in which we do not freely serve the Lord are days when we cannot be considered as God's children, and they cannot be counted. The days when we are serving man but are not serving God are lost. We need to count from the day we were saved until now. How many days have we belonged to ourselves? How many days have we been free? How many days have we been controlled by others? How many days can be countable before God? Perhaps we may say that we have believed in the Lord for five or eight or ten years. Yet how many of these days were spent foolishly? How much time should be discounted? We have wasted too many days. Will these days before the Lord add up to even one year? The days that are spent according to our own will or the will of another, the days in which we fall away from God, will be forgotten. Oh, let us ask, "Have I spent any days before God? Do I have a beginning in the first month?" This is the first question. Then the second question is, "I have been born again for many years, yet how much time have I wasted? How much time is counted before God?" The days we spent as a slave and without fellowship are lost. How many days do we have before God? This is a matter of utmost importance!</P>
