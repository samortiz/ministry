   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE GIFTS GOD PLACED IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 12:28-31 Paul speaks concerning the gifts God has placed in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 3 through 11 emphasize the Spirit, verses 12 through 27 emphasize the Body, and verses 28 through 31 emphasize administration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 28 says, And God has placed some in the church: firstly apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church here refers both to its universal and local aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From verse 12 through 27 the church is considered the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Body is an organism for Christ as the believers life to grow and express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church is an assembly for God to operate His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, in chapter twelve in dealing with the gifts, four matters are emphasized: speaking, the Spirit, the Body, and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Speaking ushers us into the Spirit, the Spirit brings us into the Body, and the Body keeps us in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, Ephesians 4:4 speaks of one Body and one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are in the Body, we have the Spirit, for the Body preserves us in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If this is our situation, the Body is not divided; rather, it remains one in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then the Body is qualified for the carrying out of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Body in the sense of being the church is the means for God to administrate on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Body as the church is the assembly of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Body of Christ is an organism to grow Christ and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The assembly of God, the church, is the means for God to carry out His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, we go from speaking, to the Spirit, to the Body, and, ultimately, to God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord s coming back will be the ultimate consummation, the peak, of His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What we are doing in the Lord s recovery is preparing the way to bring Him back.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hallelujah for speaking, the Spirit, the Body, and administration!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All this is to bring the Lord Jesus back.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 28 Paul mentions apostles, prophets, and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The apostles are those who are called and sent by God 1:1; Rom 1:1 to preach the gospel that sinners may be saved to be the materials for the building of the church, to establish the churches Acts 14:21-23 , and to teach the divine truth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Their ministry is universal for all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The prophets are those who speak for God and speak forth God by God s revelation, and who speak sometimes with inspired prediction Acts 11:27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Teachers are those who teach the truths according to the apostles teaching Acts 2:42 and the prophets revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both prophets and teachers are universal as well as local Eph 4:11; Acts 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 28 Paul also refers to helps and administrations.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The helps or helpers, helpings, must refer to the services of the deacons and deaconesses 1 Tim 3:8-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The administrations or administrators, governings, refers to the eldership in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 28 Paul lastly mentions various kinds of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the second time the speaking in tongues is listed as the last of the aspects of God s operation in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In verses 29 and 30 Paul asks a number of questions: Are all apostles?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Are all prophets?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Are all teachers?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Are all workers of powers?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do all have gifts of healing?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do all speak in tongues?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do all interpret?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Of course, the answer to all these seven questions is no. Speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues are again, the third time, listed last in Paul s writing because they render the least profit to the church 14:4-6, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In verse 31 Paul says, But earnestly desire the greater gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And yet I show to you a way of excellence.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To earnestly desire the greater gifts is to be zealous for them, to delight in them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The expression greater gifts indicates that some gifts, like speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues, are smaller because they are less profitable to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It also indicates that we should desire earnestly the greater gifts, like prophesying and teaching, which are more profitable for the building of the church 14:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To have these greater gifts we need to grow in life unto maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are developed, by growth in life, out of the initial gifts 1:7 we received when we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul concludes verse 31 by saying that he would show the Corinthians a way of excellence.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The way to have the greater gifts is love.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This way is fully defined in the following chapter.</S>
