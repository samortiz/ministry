   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE LIVING ACCORDING TO THE VISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CENTRAL LANE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF PAUL'S COMPLETING MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord has shown us much concerning the central lane of Paul s completing ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I believe that the revelation and vision concerning God s eternal purpose in the central lane of Paul s completing ministry has never been opened as thoroughly and as clearly as it has been opened today among us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, it is one thing to see the vision, and it is another thing to live in the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may receive the vision yet not be in the reality of the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today, among the many local churches in the Lord s recovery, there are few problems, and the situation is pleasant and encouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nevertheless, we need to realize that our living does not adequately match what we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have seen the central lane of Paul s completing ministry, but we do not have the living to correspond with our vision.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a great need.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since the first century the central lane of Paul s completing ministry has been included in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We thank the Lord for Paul s fourteen Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What needs to be recovered today is mainly the things revealed in Paul s ministry, which is strengthened by John s mending ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John s ministry mentions the lampstands, which are the local churches Rev 1 3 , but without Paul s ministry as a basis, we could not understand much about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The basic revelation concerning the church is in Paul s writings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only Paul s Epistles reveal the great mystery Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ Col 2:2; Eph 3:4; 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What has been lost in the past centuries is mostly the revelation in Paul s Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the purpose of the Lord s recovery up to the present has been mainly to recover this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not think that we already see the full revelation in Paul s Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to see much more.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul s Epistles are like a great field that contains many riches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We still need to explore this field.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord used Brother Watchman Nee to lay a foundation in His recovery, and He has been going on based on that foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to humble ourselves to see that there is a shortage in our daily life of a practical living according to the vision that we have seen in Paul s Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to see still more of this vision, but we already see more than we are practicing in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, we have seen something, at least doctrinally, concerning the central lane of Paul s completing ministry, but on the other hand, we are short of a daily living that matches what the Lord has shown us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although we have seen something, we do not pay adequate attention to what we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As leading ones, we are often distracted by outward things, such as our work or the problems in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, such problems are mainly due to a lack of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our daily walk does not adequately correspond to our vision concerning the central lane of Paul s completing ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I recently visited a church, a leading brother took me to see the church s new meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, my burden is not for the churches to build meeting halls but for all the saints to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Of course, meeting halls are useful and necessary, but what the Lord wants in His recovery is not our building of halls but our living of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our primary concern should not be anything outward but whether we are living the self or living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not be satisfied with merely knowing the truth; we must also seek to experience it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our living should not remain the same after listening to many messages.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some saints begin to talk in a secular way as soon as a meeting is dismissed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This kind of talk is like the birds in Matthew 13:4 and 19 that come to snatch away the word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Recently, based on Romans 8:4, we saw the matter of walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To see this is a great help, but we need to consider whether we are daily practicing to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To walk according to the spirit is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord wants a people who have such a walk and such a living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through the years the churches have had some growth in life, yet our living of Christ is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Moreover, our growth is slow because our living is short.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our growth may be helped or frustrated by our living.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, we should not be satisfied to see some growth in life; we must seek to have a proper living, which will produce normal growth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our living needs to match our vision.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the leading ones meet in the various localities, they should pray and fellowship concerning their living of Christ in their daily lives.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our real responsibility is our living, and our living should be according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As leading ones, we know from our experience that when we are living Christ, we are best able to care for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must see the need for our living to match our vision.</S>
