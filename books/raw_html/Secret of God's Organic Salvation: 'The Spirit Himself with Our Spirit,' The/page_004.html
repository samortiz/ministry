<h2 class="head1">I. THE DIVINE TRINITY&rsquo;S SEEKING<br />OF THE LOST SINNERS</h2><p>Luke 15 unveils the seeking by the Triune God of the lost sinners. Man was created by God but became fallen, and now fallen men are lost sinners. However, in order to fulfill His desire for His good pleasure, God still loved the lost human race, and two thousand years ago the Triune God came to rescue the lost sinners.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Second of the Divine Trinity<br />Coming to Seek the Lost Sinners</h2><p>The Second of the Divine Trinity, the Son, came to seek the lost sinners outside of them objectively as a shepherd seeks his lost sheep (Luke 15:4). This seeking was outside of the lost sinners and on the cross. John 10 proves that Christ&rsquo;s seeking is objective, outside of us, and on the cross. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep&rdquo; (v. 11). It was through His death on the cross that the Lord Jesus laid down His life for us. This was His seeking us objectively on the cross.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Third of the Divine Trinity<br />Coming to Seek the Lost Sinners</h2><p>Then the third of the Divine Trinity, the Spirit, comes to seek the lost sinners with the enlightening Word within them subjectively in their heart, as a woman seeking her lost coin by lighting a lamp (Luke 15:8). Whereas the Son&rsquo;s seeking is objective on the cross, the Spirit&rsquo;s seeking is subjective and within the sinner&rsquo;s heart. First, in the eyes of God we are the lost sheep, and, second, we are lost coins. We were lost and common, but the Triune God came to sanctify us from being common. This is the initial sanctification of the Spirit to separate a lost sinner from among all the others unto repentance to God for the receiving of Christ&rsquo;s redemption (1 Pet. 1:2; see Chapter Two, point II.A.1.). Here the word <i>unto</i> means &ldquo;resulting in.&rdquo; The initial sanctification of the Spirit results in repentance.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE SECRET OF REGENERATION</h2><p>Let us now begin to consider the secret of regeneration.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Spirit of Reality<br />Coming to Convict the Sinners</h2><p>The Spirit of reality, who has sanctified the lost sinners unto repentance, comes to convict the lost sinners concerning three things: concerning sin, which is from Adam; concerning righteousness, which is of Christ; and concerning judgment, which belongs to Satan (John 16:8-11). Sin is from Adam. We all were born sinners in Adam, and thus we all are sinful. But God has a way to rescue us, and this rescue is a matter of righteousness, which is not only of Christ but which is Christ Himself. In Christ and by Christ God has rescued us from sin into righteousness. We were sinners, but through our believing into Christ, we have become righteous before God. Judgment is for Satan. Anyone who does not believe into Christ to be righteous will suffer Satan&rsquo;s judgment.</p><p>The Spirit&rsquo;s coming to convict concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment involves three persons&mdash;Adam, Christ, and Satan. Sin entered through Adam (Rom. 5:12), righteousness is the resurrected Christ (John 16:10; 1 Cor. 1:30), and judgment is for Satan (John 16:11), who is the author and source of sin (8:44). In Adam we were born of sin. The only way to be freed from sin is to believe into Christ, the Son of God (16:9). If we believe into Him, He becomes righteousness to us, and we are justified in Him (Rom. 3:24; 4:25). If we do not repent of the sin that is in Adam and believe into Christ, the Son of God, we will remain in sin and share the judgment of Satan for eternity (Matt. 25:41). These are the main points of the gospel. The Spirit uses these points to convict the lost sinners.</p>
