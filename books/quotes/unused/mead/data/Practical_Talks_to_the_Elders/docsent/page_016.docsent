   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But whatever you practice, whatever you experience today, must be the things of the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This ministry is one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul did not have one ministry and Peter another.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Especially after the training on the Epistles of Peter, you can see how much they were both one in the unique ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The coming training will be on John s Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You will see that these three Paul, Peter, and John were one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They had one ministry, the ministry, the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This does not mean that Peter used the same terminology and way of presentation as Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Their terminology and presentation differ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Especially John s differs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet they were all on the central lane.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now I understand Peter s word at the end of his two Epistles, where he said, Even as also our beloved brother Paul...wrote to you 2 Pet 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Fifty years ago I thought it was good of Peter to recommend that the saints read Paul s writings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now, however, I have begun to understand in a deeper way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Peter meant that what he ministered in his two Epistles was the same as what Paul had ministered.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Maybe what Paul wrote is hard for you to understand, but don t twist it; if you do, you are twisting the Scripture v. 16 . These two apostles ministered the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now I understand Paul s word in 1 Timothy, where he charged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently 1 Tim 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They might teach according to the Scripture yet different from the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is the New Testament ministry?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul told us in that very chapter: the economy of God 1 Tim 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is the economy of God?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Chapter three calls it the mystery of godliness 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is the mystery of godliness?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the focus of God s economy; this is the central lane of the Lord s New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do have the full assurance that the Lord has given this ministry to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From the first century apostles up till now, this ministry has never been as definitely and clearly commissioned to Christians as it is to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do have the assurance to boast that we have surely seen what the Lord s New Testament ministry is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I can boast that I am one of the co-workers of the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because of this I was one with Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I was with Brother Nee, I did not preach anything other than what I had heard and learned of him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was not that I did not know other doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If I had wanted to, I could have had a successful work by myself in northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But when Brother Nee asked me to Shanghai to be with the co-workers there, I went to the Lord and saw one flow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only this one thing, brothers, has preserved me: to be always one with Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thank the Lord, He has preserved me even till today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After fifty years, I am still here.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many have come and gone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some of those who left are still alive.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you consider their present situation, however, you will realize that not one is under the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They have no way to go on, because there is no way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is only one way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even in this country, consider the ones who left us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How are they doing?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I never spoke anything to tell the saints to oppose them or to be careful of them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>My work, as I have said many times, has no wall.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It has no defense.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How about what happened in 1978?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What is that today?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Again, they have no way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God is the unique source.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is only one God, one Savior, one Lord, one way, one testimony, one ministry, one flow, one throne, and one goal.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Where are we?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Praise Him!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are in the one way, the one flow, the one ministry with the one goal.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The opposers say I speak this way to threaten people not to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That is their devilish thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I have never had such a thought.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>My thought was loving, not threatening; I just wanted to warn you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Out of a loving heart I wanted to tell you the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I spoke this way with the brothers from Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Look around you, I said.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even in Hong Kong, where is there a way?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you do not believe in this Lord Jesus Christ, you have no lord to believe in. If you don t worship this God because you don t want to worship the same God as Witness Lee , try to find another god to believe in. You will not be able to find one.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But human beings are stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once they leave, it is hard for them to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Very few have come back.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do you believe those who left have satisfaction?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They may say that the way they are taking is satisfying, but I don t believe their words.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>With me, however much opposition I face, however heavy the burden is, I have the full satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I have no doubt that I am in the way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we see this, we will practice the matters of the central lane and experience them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We will live this.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then we shall use our meetings time after time, maybe four or five meetings a week, week after week, just for this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is like digging a well.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You don t dig one spot, and then another, and another.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What is the use of a thousand holes and not one bucket of water?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You have to dig and keep on digging until water springs up.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the way to work.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is the way to build a local church.</S>
