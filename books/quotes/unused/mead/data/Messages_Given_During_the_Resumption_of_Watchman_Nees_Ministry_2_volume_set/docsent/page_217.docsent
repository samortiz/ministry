   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Giving to the Poor for the Purpose of Being Delivered from the Power of Mammon</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today, some people are bound by the world, but the bondage of money is more serious than the bondage of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why do we have to give to the poor?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To give to the poor is not merely for the sake of the poor ones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is for the purpose of delivering ourselves from the power of mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we do this, we promptly take care of the problem of money in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some people think that to spend money on the poor people is for the sake of the poor people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is true that it is a good thing for a poor person to be saved through our giving.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But even if he is not saved, it is still a good thing for us to give.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A person who cares much for money will go into eternity alone; no one will thank him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But those who spend money on others will find others welcoming them in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who offer up themselves in laboring must also offer up themselves in material giving.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is one thing to be poor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is another thing to have the kind of poverty that Paul refers to, which enriches many 2 Cor 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today, the amount of excess we have is the amount of sin we have.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The amount of excess we have is the amount of idols we have.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>CONCERNING SUBMISSION TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brother Lee asked: How can one see the authority of the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First Finding Out the Deputy Authority</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Nee answered: With some people, their submission seems to be a selective one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to practice submission, the first thing to ask is who is above me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we go to work in the secular world, the first thing we ask is who the boss is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do not get this question settled, we will not be able to do a proper job, not to mention the possibility of being punished.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The same principle applies to working in an office or in any institution.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For many people, the first thing that comes to their mind when they sit down is how to be the boss.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such people need to learn a serious lesson of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Submission is a lesson that a man has to learn before God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to be disciplined to such an extent that we bear a submissive nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever any brother or sister or co-worker goes to a place, he or she has to find out who his or her authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, the brothers and sisters who are staying at our guest houses have to submit to the authority in that house.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When they come to the meeting, they have to submit to the ushers and have to sit where they are told to sit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every house that you stay in has its own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A Christian should learn to look for authority and to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All those who pretend to be the head do not know what headship means in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Submission without Any Preference</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have never seen a man who says that he knows the Head, yet does not submit to Christ's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A person who knows the Lord will never be selective in the matter of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, Brother Witness' children cannot be selective in their submission to their father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a brother or a sister has never learned to submit to every deputy authority assigned by the Lord, he is under the greatest deception.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible says that there is no authority except from God Rom 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are very few places in the Bible that talk about direct submission to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Most of the time it talks about submission to man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Wherever we go, what we have to do is to submit, and not to criticize freely with our lips.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If others give you some special authority, that is up to them; what you have to do is to learn to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many people have never learned the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Everywhere they go, they tear down the authorities, and they do not bridle their tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This kind of people are rebellious ones.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May the Lord be merciful to us, that we will not be wild Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Not only should we not be selective in our submission; we should be actively seeking after the ones we should submit to.</S>
