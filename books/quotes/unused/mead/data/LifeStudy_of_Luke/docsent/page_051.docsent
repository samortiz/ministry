   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SEVENTEEN THE MINISTRY OF THE MAN-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS HUMAN VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH HIS DIVINE ATTRIBUTES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN GALILEE 7 Scripture Reading: Luke 7:36-50</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Luke 7:36 8:21 covers four matters: the Man-Savior forgiving sinners 7:36-50 , being ministered to by women 8:1-3 , teaching with parables 8:4-18 , and identifying His real relatives 8:19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First we see that sinners are forgiven not because of their love, but because of their faith in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Faith, not love, is what causes us to experience the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second, the saved ones, those whose sins have been forgiven, follow the Lord and minister to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Third, those who have been forgiven and who now love the Lord, follow Him, and minister to Him should grow in life and shine as lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Fourth, eventually such ones become the genuine relatives of the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From this we see that the four matters covered in 7:36 8:21 go together in our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this message we shall consider 7:36-50, and in the following message we shall cover 8:1-21.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A CASE OF THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Christian life begins with the forgiveness of sins through our faith in the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 7:36-50 Luke presents in a very effective way a case of the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here we have a vivid description of a sinful woman experiencing the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This portion of the Gospel of Luke is an affectionate account of the case of the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A Pharisee and a Sinful Woman</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Luke 7:36 says, Now a certain one of the Pharisees asked Him that He would eat with him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And entering into the Pharisee s house, He reclined at the table.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this verse Luke does not say that the Pharisee prepared a feast and invited the Lord Jesus to eat with him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, Luke tells us that the Pharisee asked the Savior to eat with him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This may indicate the Pharisee asked the Lord in a rather cold manner; that is, he did not give Him a warm invitation full of affection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, the Man-Savior went into the Pharisee s house to eat with him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For whose sake did the Man-Savior go to the Pharisee s house?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Did He do this for the sake of the Pharisee or for the sake of the woman?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I believe that He did this for the sake of both the Pharisee and the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In His omniscience the Man-Savior knew that the woman would come into the house.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may say that by accepting the Pharisee s request that He eat in his house, the Lord afforded the woman an opportunity to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Otherwise, this woman who was sinful and who was known for her sinfulness may not have had a way to contact the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By accepting the Pharisee s request to come to his house to eat, the Lord gave an opportunity to this saved sinner to express her love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 7:36-50 Luke does not tell us what the host did to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is nothing to indicate that the Pharisee was polite and loving toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually, Luke does not say very much about the host.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, he has much to say concerning what the woman did to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verses 37 and 38 say, And behold, there was a woman in the city who was a sinner, and learning that He was reclining at the table in the Pharisee s house, she brought an alabaster flask of ointment; and she stood behind Him at His feet weeping, and she began to wet His feet with her tears, and to wipe them with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet affectionately and anointed them with the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The hair is the glory of the woman 1 Cor 11:15 , the top part of her body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>With her top part she wiped the Savior s feet, the lowest part of His body, loving Him with her glory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The woman kissed the Lord s feet affectionately, that is, in love, and she anointed them with the ointment v. 38 . This ointment indicates the great worth and sweetness of the Savior to the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even the Savior s feet were worthy and sweet to her.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In verse 39 we see that the Pharisee criticized the woman and despised her: But when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he said within himself, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, because she is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A considerable crowd in Nain, having witnessed the Man-Savior s power of resurrection, recognized Him as a great prophet 7:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yet the Pharisee wondered if He were a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He not only doubted concerning the Savior, but also despised the woman as a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By His divine attribute of omniscience, the Man-Savior knew what His host was saying in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because He is God, He knows what is in man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 40 says, And Jesus answered and said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And he says, Teacher, say it.</S>
