<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Dispositional Sanctification</H2><P>[In subjective sanctification we are saturated with God dispositionally. Separation can take place rather easily and in a very short time. But to be saturated dispositionally takes a long time. If we are faithful to the Lord, we shall be saturated with the nature of God day after day. God intends to saturate us with Himself, and we need to soak up God in our being. This requires time. This is the process of being made holy.]</P><P>[In order to accomplish this God has been processed into the available Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). Before being processed He was not available to perform this subjective work of sanctification. Before He was processed He was able to create the world, but He was unable to enter into His creature. Although He could do many things outside of us, He could not come into us until He had passed through the complete process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. Since being processed, He has become and still is the available Spirit of life. Now, like the air for breathing (John 20:22), it is so easy for Him to enter into us. As the available Spirit of life, God has come into our spirit, making it life. Since Christ, the life-giving Spirit, is in us, our spirit is life because of righteousness (Rom. 8:10). The Lord has made our spirit life by regeneration. Now, as the Spirit of life in our spirit, He is spreading Himself from our spirit into our soul&#151;into our mind, emotion, and will. Eventually, He will even expand into our mortal body. In such a way God saturates us with Himself. This saturation is called sanctification. Through this saturation God works Himself with His holy nature into our entire being, into our spirit, soul, and body (1 Thes. 5:23). Thus, our whole being will be fully permeated, sanctified, with His holy nature. We are presently undergoing this process of sanctification.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. SANCTIFICATION BY THE WORD<br>AND THE SPIRIT</H2><P>This sanctification takes place by the Word, which is truth, and by the Spirit, which is the Spirit of truth. In the Gospel of John the Word and the Spirit are mentioned often. In 6:63 the Lord said, "The words I speak unto you are spirit and are life." In 17:17 He prayed, "Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth."</P><P>[Actually, the Word and the Spirit are one. I thank the Lord that so many of us have come back to the Word and are getting into the Word every day. As we come to the Word every morning, outwardly we touch the Word, but inwardly the Spirit touches us. By the Word and by the Spirit, both of which are the reality, we are sanctified.]</P><P>[Suppose the young people touch the Word with the Spirit in morning watch and then go to school. Throughout the day at school, this word of truth will work within them to separate them and make them different from their classmates in their behavior, actions, work, thoughts, and feelings. Something is working within them to sanctify them, to make them holy.</P><P>By taking the Word in this way, we have the clear conviction that something of the Lord has been wrought into us. This is not the mere knowledge of the Bible or of things concerning the Lord. It is the reality of the Triune God living, moving, working, and separating us. This makes us different from the worldly people. I can tell by the faces of the young people that they are graced by the Lord's presence. What a blessing! Every morning we can touch the living Word and have the divine reality infused into our being. In this way the Triune God is transfused into us.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUMMARY</H2><P>After regenerating our spirit, God desires to saturate our entire being with Himself. This is the Spirit's work of sanctification. The sanctification of the Spirit is of two aspects: before justification and after justification. Before justification, the Spirit works to bring us to repentance. After we repent and are justified, the Spirit continues to sanctify us on two sides, positionally and dispositionally. A practical way to be sanctified is by being touched by the Spirit in the Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Why do we say that sanctification is more than just not sinning?</li><li>What are the two aspects of sanctification?
