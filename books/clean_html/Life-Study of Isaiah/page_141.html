<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. IT BEING BETTER FOR THE RIGHTEOUS<br>AND THE GODLY TO DIE THAT<br>THEY MAY BE SEPARATED FROM THE WICKED</H2><P>Isaiah 57:1 and 2 indicate that it is better for the righteous and the godly to die that they may be separated from the wicked. "The righteous man perishes,/And no one takes it to heart;/And godly men are being swept away,/While no one considers/That the righteous man is being swept away from evil./He enters into peace;/They rest in their beds,/ Each who walks uprightly." The righteous and godly ones are the ones who come to God, contact God, and enjoy God. The wicked, however, are busy with other things and do not care for God's seekers. When the righteous die and rest in their beds, no one takes it to heart. The word beds in verse 2 signifies graves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE EVILS OF THE WICKED OF THE HOUSE OF JACOB</H2><P>Verses 3 through 10 describe the evils of the wicked of the house of Jacob. These wicked ones were busy with many things, but they would not come to the Lord and contact Him. Today, we also may be busy, even with our morning revival, and not have any contact with the Lord. We need to learn at every moment and during every action to touch, taste, eat, and enjoy the Lord. We should not only touch the Lord, but we should also be touched by Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE WICKED OF THE HOUSE OF JACOB<br>NOT REMEMBERING JEHOVAH AND NOT FEARING HIM</H2><P>The wicked of the house of Jacob did not remember Jehovah and did not fear Him (vv. 11-13a). This means that they did not care for Him. Today we may care for such things as reading the Bible, singing hymns, and coming to the meetings but not care for touching the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. JEHOVAH'S BLESSING<br>TO HIM WHO TAKES REFUGE IN HIM</H2><P>In 57:13b-21 we have Jehovah's blessing to him who takes refuge in Him. Every day of our life is a storm. We need a refuge, and the refuge is the Lord Himself. To take refuge in the Lord is to get into Him and stay in Him to enjoy Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Inheriting the Land<br>and Possessing Jehovah's Holy Mountain</H2><P>"He who takes refuge in Me will inherit the land/And possess My holy mountain" (v. 13b). When we stay in the Lord, taking Him as our refuge, we enjoy Him, and eventually we will inherit Him as the land and possess Him as our high mountain.</P>
