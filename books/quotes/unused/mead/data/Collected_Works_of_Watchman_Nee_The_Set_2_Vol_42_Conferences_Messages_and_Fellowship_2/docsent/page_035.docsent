   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A RELEASED, UNBOUND, AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TRANSCENDENT SPIRIT IN THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: What should we do when we are depressed in the meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: You should have a released spirit in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If your spirit is oppressed by some kind of burden, you will not be able to release others from a bound spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you are conducting a meeting, and you are pressed down by some burden, it will be impossible for you to set the spirit of the congregation free.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A weighed-down spirit cannot express the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only a released spirit can express the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When you come to the meeting, your spirit must be released and must be without any burden.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only then will the meeting receive your help.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>My shoulder can only bear one burden at a time; it cannot bear two burdens at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My shoulders must be empty before I can take up another burden.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a man comes to the meeting with a burden already, you cannot give him another burden.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A worker should not wait until he comes to the meeting before he unloads his burden.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you come to a meeting with a burden, you must learn to give your burden to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there are burdens that you cannot put away, burdens that are inexplicable and hard to pinpoint, you have to push them away with your will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The words that come out of a Christian's mouth are very powerful; they can be like the orders in an army.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You can tell God, "I want this burden removed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I repudiate this burden."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only should you pray, but you must also declare to God, the angels, Satan, the evil spirits, and to everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You must declare and command the burden to go away in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When you open your mouth to repudiate it, the burden will drop.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes you may be depressed even though nothing is apparently suppressing you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Your spirit is debilitated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At these times you have to lift up your own spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This kind of depression of the spirit is not caused by anything outside of you; rather, your spirit is suppressed by your own feeling of coldness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A depressed spirit is different from a burdened spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A depressed spirit has no particular burden; it has sagged because of the coldness surrounding it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Under such circumstances, one should not deny the condition with the will, but stir up the spirit with the will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The best way to stir up the spirit is to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Praise can bring a person to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You have to exercise your faith to lift up your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You have to say to God, "Although I am surrounded by darkness, I will still praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although my spirit is vacillating, You are on the throne and You never waver."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you refuse to believe in the environment and instead give praises to God, your spirit will be lifted up to the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When a spirit is depressed and cannot be freed, it is sometimes very effective to practice foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a brother who is burning in spirit comes to you while you are cold, he will have the power to wash your feet, and your spirit will be lifted up by him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DECLARATION</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Question: Sometimes I worry and do not have the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Prayer does not work at such times, yet my declaration does.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Answer: One day when the Lord was going on His journey, He became hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He saw a fig tree from a distance, but the tree did not have any fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What did the Lord do?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He said to the tree: "May no one eat fruit from you forever!"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Mark 11:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The next day the disciples found the Lord's word fulfilled the tree had withered from its roots.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why did the tree wither from its roots within a day?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the disciples saw this, they realized the power in the Lord's word, and they told the Lord what had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord told them to have faith in God, and that those with faith could ask whatever they will and God would give it to them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those who have faith can even ask a mountain to be removed and God will do it for them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Mark 11:23 is not an ordinary prayer, but a declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord did not say, "Whoever kneels down to pray..."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He told them to declare.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He said, "Whoever says to this mountain..."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Praying to God is not dealing with the mountain, but saying directly to the mountain, "Be taken up and cast into the sea."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here the Lord did not say that we would receive an answer according to what we pray, but according to what we say.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We often pray for God to remove everything that hinders, frustrates, and bars us from pressing forward, things such as anxiety, worries, and sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Sometimes God will answer such prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But many times such prayers avail little.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord wants you to say to the "mountain," "I oppose and reject in the name of the Lord everything that suppresses and frustrates me."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You must declare and give command.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord did not say to the disciples, "Dear disciples, we must pray and ask God to dry up the tree."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He did not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He gave a command.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many troubles and sicknesses can only be driven away by such commands; they are like the marching orders that a general gives to his soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These kind of words are declarations of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the book of Acts, the apostles exercised this key.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Peter and John saw the lame man at the door of the temple which was called Beautiful, and they said to the lame man, "In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene rise up and walk" 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They cast out demons by speaking directly to them and casting them out in the name of the Lord 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is declaring with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>With some things you have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>With other things you have to declare.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you practice this, you will save yourself much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The way to reject unwanted thoughts is also by declaring one's stand.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When you reject Satan's thoughts in the name of the Lord, Satan can do nothing but flee away.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Both Peter and James told us to withstand the devil 1 Pet 5:9; James 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is withstanding the attack of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You do not have to pray for the demons to go away; instead, declare and command them to go away in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There are certain conditions which we must fulfill before we can do things in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Being in the name of the Lord means having a part in the Lord and being granted all the rights that come from the redemption of His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we have such a faith, our speaking in His name will be effective.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In Acts some men tried to cast out demons in the name of the Lord 19:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Although the words were right, the name of Jesus had nothing to do with them and did not produce any effect on them.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is not the words we say that makes our declaration effective, but the union with this name through faith that makes the declaration effective.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Lord is the Christ, and we are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When we are one with Him, His power will flow to us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>No formula will work.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The only thing that will work is faith.</S>
