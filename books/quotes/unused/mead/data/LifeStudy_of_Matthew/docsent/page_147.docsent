   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE THIRTY-EIGHT THE UNVEILING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE KINGDOM S MYSTERIES 4</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall continue to see the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the parable of the tares reveals, the constituents of the kingdom are the sons of the kingdom, who have the divine life within them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the tares, the sons of the Devil, have come in. Because of these false ones among the constituents, the kingdom in its outward appearance has become Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Formerly it was purely the kingdom of God, but now it has become Christendom with both real believers and false ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When many people talk about Christianity, they are actually talking about Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The kingdom of the heavens is not as large as Christendom, for the kingdom is smaller than Christendom and seems to be within it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The kingdom is real, composed of the genuine constituents who are the sons of the kingdom, the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the tares sown by Satan have caused a mixture among the so-called Christians in the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, which is Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE ABNORMAL DEVELOPMENT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>OF THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord arranged the parables in Matthew 13 in a very good sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First we have the parable of the sower, who sows the seed to bring forth the constituents of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then we have the parable of the tares sown by the enemy, the false ones among the constituent that cause the kingdom of the heavens to become Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Following the parable of the tares, we have the parable of the mustard seed 13:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A. The Kingdom of the Heavens</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being like a Grain of Mustard Seed</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 31 says, The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard seed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The fruit, both of the wheat in the first two parables and the mustard here in the third parable, is for food.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that the kingdom people, the constituents of the kingdom and the church, should be like a crop to produce food that satisfies God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Both wheat and mustard are good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In fact, it is very healthy and nourishing to eat wheat bread with mustard on it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, in both the second and third parables we see the thought of the evil one, the subtlety of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The evil one came in to sow tares among the wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As any farmer can tell you, tares greatly frustrate the growth of the wheat because they exhaust the fertility of the soil which is meant to nourish the growing wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the soil has been exhausted, wasted, by the tares, the wheat cannot grow properly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may apply this to our present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many false Christians have frustrated the growth of the genuine Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Wherever there are many false believers, it is difficult for the real believers to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the subtlety of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we shall see, the subtlety of the enemy with respect to the mustard seed is to cause it to grow into a huge tree that is no longer good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>B. The Heavenly King Having Sown</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>a Mustard Seed in His Field</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, what the Lord has sown is the grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But on the other hand, it is a grain of mustard seed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Both the grain of wheat and the grain of mustard seed signify Christ as food to us in different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is both the wheat and the mustard for our nourishment.</S>
