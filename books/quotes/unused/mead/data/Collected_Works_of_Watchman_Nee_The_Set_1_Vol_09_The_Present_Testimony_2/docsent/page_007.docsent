   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHERE DOES THIS LIGHT COME FROM?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First, Christ is our light.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 8:12 says, "Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus is light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we draw near to the Lord, we shall see light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Often we think that this is quite good and that is not bad.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when we tell the Lord the facts of a situation, asking Him for enlightenment, we find to our surprise that everything is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Day after day we think there is nothing wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But when we draw near to the Lord, everything is manifested to be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One is our own standard, while the other is God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we draw near to the Lord, we will realize that our standard is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a Christian does not pray much for a revelation of his real condition, you can guarantee in nine cases out of ten that this Christian is in error.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more we draw near to the Lord, the more we will receive the light of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Second, the Word of God is our light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Psalm 119:105 says, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 130 says, "The entrance of thy words giveth light."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These two verses may be very familiar to us, but if we read them carefully before God we will know how deep these verses are.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Is the path in which you are walking justified by man or is it justified by God?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The work of the flesh cannot escape the shining of the light of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not what man says; rather, it is what the Word of God says.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Day by day we should not follow our feelings in judging whether a matter is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, we must let the Word of God decide whether it is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We ourselves should not judge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, we should let the Word of God make the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Put yourself in the Word of God, and let the Word of God judge, let the Word of God point out your real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this reason, we must read the Bible more, and we must trust that the Holy Spirit would manifest the Word of God to us so that we may know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Third, Christians are our light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Matthew 5:14 says, "You are the light of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are very familiar with this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Normally we think that this verse speaks only of a Christian's good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But actually there is a very deep meaning here.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It says that a Christian is light.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A Christian can illuminate the true condition of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many Christians who are in the light of God, make other Christians afraid of seeing them because once they are seen, they will be condemned of their own sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A weak Christian is not afraid of seeing another Christian who is in the same condition.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when you come close to a Christian who is in the light of God, you feel shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You were proud, but after being shined upon by him, you feel shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You were dishonest, but after being shined upon by him, you feel shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brothers and sisters, we are the workers of God, serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you do not have the light of God, you will not be able to work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>People cannot be drawn closer to God by you if you do not have the light to illuminate them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you draw near to God and are controlled constantly by the light of God, spontaneously you will illuminate the real condition of the people who are contacting you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we want to obey the will of God and do the work of God, we need to be a light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When you come close to Christians who are near to God, they make you feel God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They do not make you sense their tenderness and humility; rather, they make you feel God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I began to work, I decided, at whatever cost, to obey the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I thought I was obeying the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, whenever I went to see Miss Barber, after talking and reading a few verses from the Bible with her, I was aware that I was still lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every time I saw her, I always felt something special God was there.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When you came close to her, you felt God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She had light.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>She was controlled by the light of God; therefore, when you came close to her, her light condemned your sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must remember one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whether by drawing near to Christ, by reading God's Word, or by being with other Christians, all the light we receive comes from the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is the Holy Spirit who manifests the unapproachable light in which God dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is He who manifests His glory, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By this we see the absolute standard of God, so that we see ourselves, know our own real condition, and realize how we fall short of the standard of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>THE POWER OF THIS LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The power of this light is the self-knowledge it renders to man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When a man gets into this light, it reveals to him his real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many believers are very self-vindicating, self-satisfied, and full of self-pride.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this condition no human words, explanation, exhortation, warning, or reproof can make them see their own fallen state.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only when God gives grace and shines His light upon them through the Holy Spirit will this kind of person realize how corrupt, fallen, and hypocritical they are.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the light of God comes, everything changes color.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the light of God, everything shows its true color.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Actually, no man can be saved without being shined upon by God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No man can progress in the spiritual path and no man can have an effective work without being shined upon by God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How can a sinner know that the Lord Jesus is the Savior?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Surely not by argument.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How can he know that he is a sinner?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Surely not by reproof.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>No matter what method you use, whether arguing with the most logical words, debating with the most sufficient reason, or warning with the most stern words; none of these can make a sinner realize his own sins and see that Jesus is his Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I am not saying that all these methods are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They have their place.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But they can only let people know mentally that they are sinners and that Jesus is the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>These methods can never cause them to see.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Every sinner is blind, and this kind of blindness keeps him from seeing the true light of the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Holy Spirit opens the sinner's eyes through the light of God, enabling him to see the light of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Seeing is a special blessing in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God reveals His Son in me.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is an experience common to every saved sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is most futile to get people to "receive Christianity," "believe in Jesus," and "become a Christian" by some beautiful thought, reason, warm feeling, emotion, music, tears, or argument.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The light of God, the light that God emanates through the Holy Spirit, is the first indispensable element.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The basic need is that a sinner must see his own condition and see the glory of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Getting him to shed tears, repent, be fervent, confess, and have good feelings are all futile.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Only seeing in the Holy Spirit can cause a sinner to truly believe and receive the Lord Jesus as Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is because you can never believe in what you have not seen, and you can never receive what you do not see.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Because you have seen from within, you believe.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Only this kind of faith is unmovable.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Only this will withstand trials.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The progress of the Christian life does not depend upon many exhortations, warnings, and teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is not a matter of telling a believer to be fervent, to do his duty, to read more of the Bible, or to pray more.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>All these are secondary; they are not primary.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The primary element is to see.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Therefore, when Paul wrote the letter to the Ephesians, though he knew that they were very good in the Lord and were not like the Corinthians who were so fallen morally, the first thing which he prayed for them was that God might enlighten the eyes of their hearts through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The progress of the Christian life is due to receiving the light of God, which opens a Christian's eyes and causes him to know the riches of the glory of God, and the greatness of the power of God that is given to him through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If a Christian cannot see these things and does not know how rich these things are which he has received from God, then progress is an impossibility.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Anyone who is doing special work for God must be a person who has been shined upon by God.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Only he who has been shined upon by God can judge his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Only he who has judged his own flesh can be used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>When the light of God comes, a believer is able to see how filthy he is because he has seen the holiness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He is able to know how unrighteous he is because he has seen the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He is able to know how corrupt he is because he has seen the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>After a believer has known himself this way, he will be like one who is truly circumcised, not trusting in himself at all not only not trusting, but deeply hating , but rather depending completely on the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Only this type of worker who is in the hands of God can be used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>And only this type of worker can have the sight of God, seeing the plan of God and understanding the goal of God.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Because many people do not have the light of God, they consider themselves to be marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Satan often cheats people by making them think that they have already obtained holiness and are sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Little do they realize that the reason they say this is because they do not have the light of God; hence, they do not know the corruption of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I am one who deeply believes in Christ being our life and that He can enable us to completely overcome sins.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>No Christian can excuse himself by saying that it is impossible for man to refrain from sin on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>But even if we are victorious, we cannot say that our flesh is not corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>There is a common error today: man either goes to one extreme or to the other.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Some think that since they are corrupt, it is impossible for them not to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Others think that since they have received Christ to be their victory, sin is eradicated from within them, and therefore, they are no longer corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Actually both of these are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Truthfully, we are victorious in Christ, but we are corrupt in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>A believer can have a life of complete victory over sin through Christ daily, and he can, at the same time, have the feeling that every day he is corrupt to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The feeling of decadence and corruption cannot deter his victory because it is Christ overcoming in him and not himself.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Likewise, his complete victory cannot remove from him the feeling of total corruption because the corruption of his flesh will not be changed in its nature by the deliverance of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Because so many have been deceived, thinking in their own small and dim light that they are so holy, sinless, and perfect in love, we need to see how many of the best and deepest saints in the Bible viewed themselves in the light of God.</S>
