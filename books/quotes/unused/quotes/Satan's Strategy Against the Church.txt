God's heart's desire is to work Christ into a people, to mingle Christ with these people, and to make these people a living Body to Christ
Immediately after God began this divine project, however, the enemy Satan intervened to frustrate and damage His plans
Human philosophy is the best of human civilization and culture, and the enemy utilized it to draw the believers away from Christ
Paul wrote to the Colossians telling them that Christ is the allotted portion of the saints and Christ must be all and in all to the saints
A mother, for example, may intend to give medicine to her child, but the child in his naughtiness does not cooperate
Good, sound, scriptural, and even spiritual teachings have been used by the enemy as a substitute for Christ Himself
They have been distracted from Christ by something which is very close to Christ, but which is not Christ Himself
After Satan began by using so many substitutes to usurp the place of Christ, he invented the clergy-laity system
We have been so influenced by our background in Christianity, so steeped in it, that this evil system is in our very bloodstream
The life has been replaced, the functions have been severely damaged, to say the least, and the whole Body has been divided
Regrettably, the church has been dominated by the substitutes of Christ, the clergy-laity system, and the divisions
There must be a group of believers who realize and experience Christ as their life and content and will take no substitute
All of them have abandoned the denominations, sects, and divisions and come to meet on the ground of oneness to practice the proper unity
