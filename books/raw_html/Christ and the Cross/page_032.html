        <h2 class="head1">THE POSITIVE FUNCTION OF THE CROSS&mdash;<br />
RELEASING AND TRANSMITTING THE LIFE OF GOD</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to release His life to man, but according to the law related to life, this life must pass through death in order to be released and transmitted. Hence, in order for God&rsquo;s purpose to be fulfilled, there is a need for the cross. In order to carry out His eternal plan according to His purpose, God determined to have the cross. The positive function of the cross is to release His eternal life and to transmit it into man for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<p>Most Christians consider the function of the cross merely in relation to redeeming fallen people from their sins. Such Christians believe that if man had not sinned and fallen, there would be no need for the cross. To these Christians the cross of Christ exists only because man sinned and fell; that is, to them the cross is needed only for the redemption of sins. This is a natural human view. The Bible, however, reveals that the function of the cross is not only for the redemption of sins but also for the release and transmission of God&rsquo;s life. The redemption of sins is not the positive function of the cross; rather, it is the negative function of the cross. The positive function of the cross is to release and transmit the life of God.</p>
<p>Thus, even if man had not sinned, there would still have been a need for the cross, because God had to pass through death in order to release and transmit His life. In other words, regardless of whether man needs to be redeemed from his sins, God had to pass through the death of the cross because His eternal purpose is to release and transmit His life. His eternal intention is to release and transmit His life through His death on the cross. Nevertheless, God in His foreknowledge knew that man would sin, and so He planned that the cross also would be for the redemption of sins. However, God&rsquo;s primary purpose is to release and transmit His life through the cross; His secondary purpose is the redemption of sins through the cross. God&rsquo;s primary intention with regard to the cross is not to redeem man from sins but to release and transmit His life. The positive function of the cross is to release and transmit God&rsquo;s life, and the negative function of the cross is to redeem man from sins.</p>
<p>The primary function of the cross does not depreciate or lessen the value of the cross in the Lord&rsquo;s redemptive work. We value and treasure the Lord&rsquo;s redemptive work and acknowledge the value of the cross in regard to our redemption from our sins. However, we are stressing the fact that there are two aspects to the function of the cross. It is easy to value the cross&rsquo;s function in redeeming us from sins and to neglect its function of releasing and transmitting the life of God. Hence, we are burdened to point out that the redemption of sins speaks only of the negative function of the cross. The positive function of the cross is to release and transmit the life of God. Both the positive and the negative aspects of the function of the cross are precious.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S LIFE-RELEASING AND<br />
LIFE-TRANSMITTING DEATH</h2>
<p>In John 12:24 the Lord spoke of the positive function of the cross, the releasing and transmitting of life, saying, &ldquo;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; There is life inside a grain of wheat, but if the grain does not die, the life within it cannot be released to produce other grains. If the grain dies, the life within it will be released and transmitted into many grains. The grain of wheat that the Lord referred to was Himself. Within the shell of Jesus&rsquo; humanity was the eternal, unlimited life of God. The Lord Jesus came to the earth in order to impart the life within Him into man and for man to receive this life. The only way that the life within Him could be imparted into man was through death. It was possible for His life to be released and transmitted only through death. He could not bypass this law.</p>
<p>If the Lord Jesus had not died, the life of God would have remained in Him and would not have been released from within Him in order to enter into many people. If the Lord Jesus had not been incarnated as a man and had not then died as a man, only He, as God&rsquo;s only begotten Son, would have had the life of God, but He would not have been able to share the life of God with others so that they could become God&rsquo;s many sons (Eph. 5:25). The Lord Jesus had to die, just like a grain of wheat, so that the life within Him could be released and transmitted to those who are joined to Him through faith. On the positive side, His death released and transmitted the eternal, unlimited life of God from within Him. This is the positive function of the cross, and it is also God&rsquo;s intention for the cross.</p>
<p>Many saints neglect the life-releasing and life-transmitting death in John 12:24. They know that the Lord&rsquo;s death redeemed them from their sins, but they do not know that the Lord&rsquo;s death released and transmitted the life of God. These saints overemphasize the redemptive aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s death, and they neglect the life-releasing aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s death. The Lord&rsquo;s word in verse 24, however, clearly reveals the life-releasing aspect of His death. If we consider the Lord&rsquo;s death as it is portrayed in this verse, there is no mention of the relationship between the Lord&rsquo;s death and the redemption of sins. The Lord spoke of a grain of wheat dying only in relation to the release and transmission of life. Although the Lord&rsquo;s death is for the redemption of sins, we must be clear that the Lord&rsquo;s death is not only for the redemption of sins but also for the release of His life. The Lord&rsquo;s death has both a redemptive aspect and a life-releasing aspect. The Lord&rsquo;s death has a redemptive element and a life-releasing element. We should value the life-releasing element of the Lord&rsquo;s death just as much as we value the redemptive element of His death.</p>
<p>There is a type in the Old Testament that gives a thorough portrayal of the life-releasing and life-transmitting aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s death. This type is the building of Eve. Eve was not created by God apart from Adam. Rather, she was built out of a rib that was taken from Adam&rsquo;s side when God caused a deep sleep to fall upon him (Gen. 2:21-22). Eve was produced out of Adam and was a part of Adam. Because she shared one life with Adam, she was one flesh with Adam (vv. 23-24). Ephesians 5 reveals that the type of Adam and Eve speaks of the mystery of Christ and the church (v. 32). God caused Adam to fall asleep and opened his side to produce Eve. In Adam&rsquo;s sleep, which typifies the death of Christ, there was no thought of sin or of redeeming Eve from sins. Adam&rsquo;s side was opened when he slept, and a rib was taken from his side. Similarly, when Christ died on the cross, His side was opened, and blood and water flowed out (John 19:34).</p>
<p>Adam&rsquo;s sleep and his side being opened were for the release of the life within him and for the transmitting of his life into Eve. Without this sleep, Adam&rsquo;s life could not have been released to produce Eve. This indicates that the death of Christ and the piercing of His side on the cross were for the releasing of His life and the transmitting of this life as water to the church. Without His death, Christ&rsquo;s life could not have been released to produce the church. In order to produce the church, Christ had to die. Therefore, the building of Eve and the imparting of Adam&rsquo;s life into Eve indicate that the Creator had to die to impart His life into us. Christ&rsquo;s body was broken so that the life within Him could be released. This aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death has nothing to do with the redemption of sins; it is altogether for the release and transmission of life. The positive aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death is for releasing the unlimited, divine life within Him and for imparting this life into us to make us the church. As the church, we share the life of Christ in order to become one with Him as His mysterious Body, just as Eve shared the life of Adam to became one flesh with him (Eph. 5:31-32).</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
