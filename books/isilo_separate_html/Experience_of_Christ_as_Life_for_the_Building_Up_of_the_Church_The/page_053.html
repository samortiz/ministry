The way is by the anointing of the compound Spirit, typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING SANCTIFIED BY THE ANOINTING</H2><P>We have seen that all the parts of the tabernacle with all its contents were not holy until they were anointed (Exo. 30:26-29). The anointing was the factor that made the entire tabernacle holy. This anointing sanctified the whole dwelling place of God. The word sanctify means to join something with God, to make something have the divine essence and nature of God.</P><P>To be sanctified is not to be sinlessly perfect, nor is it to be merely separated and changed in our position. Strictly speaking, to be sanctified means to be joined to God. Of course, if we are joined to God, we are separated. But this attachment to God is not only a change in position but also a change in disposition. By being sanctified our whole being is mingled with the divine, holy essence and transformed.</P><P>Romans 1:4 speaks of "the Spirit of holiness." Wuest's translation uses "divine essence" instead of "the Spirit of holiness." Thus, holiness is the divine essence of God's being. To be sanctified is to be joined, to be attached, to the divine essence. To be sanctified is to be made one with God and to make God one with us. This sanctification is carried out by the anointing Spirit, who anoints us with the divine essence of God.</P><P>We have seen from Exodus 30 that the compound ointment typifies the compound Spirit. The Spirit today is a compound. In the previous chapter, we saw all the ingredients of the compound ointment, which typify the ingredients of today's compound Spirit, who is anointing us all the time. The humanity and divinity of Christ, His death with its effectiveness, and His resurrection with its power have been compounded into the Spirit. The ability to bear responsibility and the building element are also elements of the compound Spirit. This is the bountiful Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19). All the elements of Christ's person and work have been put into this one Spirit, the compound Spirit.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> </body></html>
