<h2 class="head1">PLANNING FOR THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In order for the church to increase and spread, there must be a plan. The plan for a church should be based on the condition of the believers&rsquo; spiritual life, the social conditions in the church&rsquo;s locality, and the relationship between the believers and those in various social classes. The church in a locality must set a rate for increase at the beginning of each year. This rate can be ten percent, twenty percent, fifty percent, or even one hundred percent. For the past twenty years we have suffered a loss because we have conducted business without a plan (Luke 19:13). It is as though we have labored aimlessly for more than twenty years. As a result, our time has been wasted, and the Lord&rsquo;s work has been delayed. From now on, a church must make a plan at the beginning of each year.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei has made a plan for a one hundred percent rate of increase. Of the five thousand five hundred people currently in the church in Taipei, three thousand five hundred regularly attend the meetings, and one thousand five hundred are willing to make a plan. It will not be difficult for each of these one thousand five hundred to lead one person to salvation each year. But it will not be easy to achieve a one hundred percent increase based on the total number of saints in the church. However, as long as the plan of the church is carried out properly, it will be possible to reach this goal.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei has been divided up into three hundred fifty small groups that have already started to meet. The small groups are like an &ldquo;all-inclusive dose&rdquo; that solves every problem and heals every sickness. We have not increased, because we have neglected the practice of the small groups. Many other problems are related to our lack in the practice of the small groups. Now we must focus our attention on the small groups. As we begin to pay attention to the small groups, our sicknesses will be healed. Therefore, we should not be anxious about our plan, because the small groups will have a great impact on our increase and spread. Even now we can see some impact through the recovery of three to four hundred saints in just the past six to seven weeks. We should not relax because of this success; instead, all the co-workers, elders, and saints should be even more diligent to work on the small groups so that the small groups can be established.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PLANNING FOR DISTRICT MEETING HALLS</h2>
<p>We need to focus on a few matters concerning our plan for district meeting halls. First, the rate of increase set by the whole church must be accepted by those in the district meeting halls. If the church decides on a one hundred percent increase, no one should throw cold water on the idea and propose a fifty percent increase instead. We must learn to accept the plan set by the church. Second, the plan set by the church must be carried out and accomplished by those in every district meeting hall. The plan must be accepted and carried out with diligent effort. Third, the plans of the saints must be monitored and promoted on a monthly basis in the district meeting halls. A good company reviews its accounting figures monthly in order to see if it is meeting its annual goals. If a plan is not working, a company will make adjustments in order to achieve its goals. Similarly, we should not wait until the end of the year to review our progress. We must pay close attention to this every month in order to promote the plans of the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PLANNING FOR EACH BELIEVER</h2>
<p>The most important plan is the daily plan for each believer. Please accept our suggestions and work out a schedule for a personal plan according to the simple ways listed below.</p>
<p>First, develop a plan based on the number of your family members, friends, neighbors, and other acquaintances. If you know a hundred people, it is not appropriate to plan to lead only one person to salvation. However, it may be difficult to lead four people to salvation if you know only two people. Your plan should be based on the number of people you know. If you know a hundred people, you can plan to lead at least four people to salvation this year.</p>
<p>Second, you should make a list of those whom you plan to lead to salvation. Then you can seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading as to whom you should labor on first, and you can begin to pray over each name. Making a list is very helpful especially in the matter of prayer. Prayers for others cannot be general; you must name them in prayer one by one. You should be careful not to labor on too many people at the same time. Focus on eight to ten people, praying specifically for them by name.</p>
<p>Third, you should regularly contact the people on your list by phone calls, letters, and invitations. Give them Bibles, spiritual books, and gospel tracts. You should not be zealous for a month but then do nothing in the following months. If you try to do something every day, you will become exhausted. It is better to be regular, doing something once a week or even once every other week.</p>
<p>Fourth, you should allocate your time daily, weekly, and monthly according to the needs of your family and work responsibilities. In any case, an appropriate amount of time should be set aside specifically to contact people to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>Fifth, according to the allocation of time, you must faithfully carry out your schedule, week after week, month after month, expecting a harvest every season. Based on our experience, it is best to set aside at least one hour every week in order to contact people to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>You have to labor on these matters over the long term; nothing will be accomplished overnight. You may not see any results in the first few months, but if you continue month after month, you will see results gradually. If we practice this, everyone will be able to lead at least one person to salvation in a year. Only a person who is unwilling will be unable to lead at least one person to salvation in a year.</p>
<p>These are suggestions. May we work on them seriously and not treat them as if they are too difficult. Some people may think that this is difficult, because many saints have not led anyone to salvation, even though the church has been preaching the gospel for over thirty years. However, the past is the past, and beginning this year we can practice according to a schedule. In our daily life and church life we must set aside time specifically for preaching the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEARING FRUIT IN ITS SEASON</h2>
<p>To summarize, you should make a list of names, using a special notebook that contains a detailed record of your friends, neighbors, and acquaintances. Then examine it carefully, and select a few names to focus on this year. Then under the Lord&rsquo;s leading, labor on them, pray for them, regularly call them, write to them, invite them to dinner, and visit them. Continually contact them, giving them spiritual books, Bibles, and gospel tracts. Whenever there is a gospel meeting of the church or any gospel activity in your small group, invite them to attend. If everyone does this for the long term, there will be fruit in its season. This is a law.</p>
<p>If you do these things, you will lead people to salvation time and time again, just as a tree planted beside streams of water will yield its fruit in its season (Psa. 1:3), according to the law of life. When the operation of the law of life is coordinated with the arrangement of the outward environment, including such things as the number and places for various meetings, there will be spiritual progress. These two matters go hand in hand, and we should study them well.</p>
<p>I hope that we will have a new beginning this year. I believe that after six months we will see some practical results, and at the end of the year we will be strengthened by the realization that this way is both workable and under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
