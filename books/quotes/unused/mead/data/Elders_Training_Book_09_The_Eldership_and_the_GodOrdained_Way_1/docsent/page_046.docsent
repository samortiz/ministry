   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LEADERSHIP IN THE APOSTLES' TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Testament leadership in the Gospels was a person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That person was the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But from Acts to Revelation, the unique New Testament leadership became the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, neither Peter nor Paul controlled any church, but their teaching controlled.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can see this in 1 Timothy where Paul exhorted Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach different things other than the economy of God 1:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Different teachings are teachings which are different from the apostles' teaching concerning God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This teaching is the unique leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The apostles' teaching is our constitution which governs us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Peter and Paul did not govern the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is the teaching of the apostles, the teaching concerning God's economy, which governs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John told us that if anyone goes beyond the teaching concerning Christ, the New Testament teaching concerning Christ's person and redemptive work, we should not even greet this one 2 John 9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Such a person is a heretic who denies the divine conception and deity of Christ, as today's modernists do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to John's word, we should not have any contact with such an evil person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All of this proves that the governing leadership, after the time of the Lord Jesus, is not a person but the teaching of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE ERRONEOUS TEACHING OF IGNATIUS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With the Lord Jesus and with the early apostles, there was no organization.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Soon after the time of the early apostles, however, the wrong teaching of Ignatius brought in the human thought of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ignatius said that the overseers, or bishops, are higher than the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, the elders are local, and the overseers are regional.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But Acts 20 shows that the overseers are the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul called the elders to come to him, and he told them that the Spirit had placed them as overseers vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>17, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The overseers and the elders are the same persons, not two different classes of people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>History tells us that Ignatius was a very good brother, but he made a big mistake by introducing the wrong concept of overseers, or bishops, being above elders.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He brought in the thought of organization, which ruins the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His erroneous teaching eventually issued in the Catholic Church, a religious organization according to a hierarchical system of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The erroneous teaching of Ignatius was also the source of the episcopal system of ecclesiastical government.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The state churches and the private churches in Christianity have also adopted certain aspects of an organizational system of control.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is to follow the customs of society.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because we were raised up in Christianity and influenced by the practice of Christianity, we may understand the appointment of the elders in an organizational way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need the light to see that even the appointment of the elders is organic.</S>
