   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ONE PORTION NOT SUFFICIENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO REPRESENT A WHOLE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In interpreting the Bible, we have to pay attention to one more thing: one portion of the Word is not sufficient to represent the whole truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In other words, there is no truth that can be fully explained in a single portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, in reading and interpreting the Bible, we should pay attention to the words again it is written.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the word spoken by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 4:7.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Lord was tempted, the devil quoted to the Lord the words in Psalm 91 that God would give charge to His angels to bear Him up, lest He strike His foot against a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The devil argued that He could jump from the top of the temple and would not be hurt because there is such a promise in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is how the devil tempted the Lord Jesus with an isolated passage of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Lord heard that, He answered right away, Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows us that we cannot consider one isolated portion of the Bible alone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, we must consider two, three, or more portions of the Word together.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we neglect the principle of again it is written, but apply the words of the Bible in an isolated way, we will easily be deceived by the wiles of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the devil cannot stop someone from following the Bible, he will cause that one to quote the Bible in an isolated way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of course, Satan would wish that we do not do anything according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But many times, he knows that this is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All those who love and fear the Lord want to walk according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The devil cannot stop us from following the Bible or walking according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He can only use other ways, one of which is to cause us to follow the Bible in an isolated way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way we are driven to the extreme and forget the words that say again it is written.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This word again is too big a word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should put a circle around it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This shows us that when we follow the Bible, we should not do so in an isolated way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should consider both sides and even all sides.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No single portion of the Bible can represent the whole truth, in the same way that no one face of a house can represent the whole house completely.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even we ourselves are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we take a picture from behind, there is not a single hole in the head.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if we take a picture from the front, there are clearly seven holes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Any single side of a man cannot represent the whole person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The same can be said of the words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Any one portion of the Bible cannot represent the whole truth, and we have to be balanced in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, we have to remember the principle of again it is written.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>EVERY VERSE CONTAINING ALL THE TRUTHS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No single verse can represent the whole truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, every verse of the Bible contains all the truths.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the one hand, no single verse can include the whole truth, and to understand a truth, one cannot rely on one verse alone, but has to consider many other verses.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the other hand, in determining any truth, one has to consider every verse.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Each verse in the Bible contains all the truths.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One brother once said that any single verse in the Bible requires the whole Bible to explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is very true.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If one wants to understand Genesis 1:1, he has to understand the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the one hand, Genesis 1:1 cannot contain the whole truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the other hand, Genesis 1:1 includes all the truths of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, in determining any truth, we cannot rely on one portion of the Bible alone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead, we have to depend on all the words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In a similar way, the exposition of any single verse cannot be based on its own context; instead it must be based on the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Second Peter 1:20 says that no prophecy of the Scripture is of one s own interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The original meaning of this verse is that the prophecy of the Bible should not be interpreted according to its own context.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means to interpret any prophecy, one has to study all the prophecies in the Bible, and has to make decisions based on all the prophecies of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only then will the interpretation be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>V. NOT SACRIFICING ANY PORTION OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In determining a truth, sometimes many related verses indicate a certain meaning, but two or three among them cannot be explained in that kind of way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One cannot say that because there were only one or two verses that could not be explained that way, one can therefore sacrifice them and base the exposition on the majority of the verses.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If one does that, he is sacrificing a small number of verses.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As long as one or two verses do not allow a certain interpretation, we have to give up that interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to respect every portion of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only when an interpretation harmonizes with the whole Bible can this interpretation be considered reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Any verse that forbids a certain interpretation of the truth must not be sacrificed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Instead, that certain interpretation must be abandoned, and we must wait for God s further revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we study the Bible this way, we will not fall easily into error.</S>
