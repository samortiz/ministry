   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A CLASSMATE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Weigh Kwang-hsi, who passed away in 1988, was Watchman Nee's classmate.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The following is his testimony which he wrote in 1973:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For several years Watchman Nee and I were classmates at Trinity College, a school founded by the Church of England in the city of Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We were good friends and frequently studied and played together.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During our junior and senior high school years, we were both nominal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We both had some knowledge of the Bible, and we outwardly kept the Christian forms of baptism, holy communion, church attendance, Bible study, and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But we had never accepted in our hearts the Christ who was crucified for our sins and who resurrected on the third day, and we did not know Him as our personal Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We both loved the world and pursued the vanities of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Watchman Nee was pursuing scholastic attainment in the field of Chinese literature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He would frequently write articles for publication in the newspapers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The money he earned was spent on lottery tickets.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was also fond of the movies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I preferred sports and yearned for the fame and praise of men.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our first college year, his life suddenly changed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He became a fervent Christian and ceased pursuing the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He frequently testified to his classmates, exhorting them to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many schoolmates did believe in the Lord and began voluntarily to pray in the college chapel, even during weekdays.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He would frequently study the Bible in class; however, this did not seem to affect his grades.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He usually came out with the highest examination scores in every subject.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The lives of many of the students were changed by accepting the Lord, and the dormitory director admitted that some mischievous students, who had previously violated school regulations, had accepted the Lord and experienced a great change in their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a result, he found himself with fewer cases of violation of school rules by students.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Saved through Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Watchman Nee invited me to attend some gospel meetings, but I refused.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My heart was set on becoming famous in the sports world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day, however, he came to my room and preached the gospel to me alone, urging me to accept the Lord Jesus as my Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Though I attempted to argue with him concerning some religious problems, he would not argue; instead, he asked me several questions: "Have you sinned?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you know if your sins are forgiven?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you know if you are saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the time I didn't understand why, but in my heart I felt sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Later I realized that this was the convicting work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He preached the gospel to me, explaining that God loved me and gave His only begotten Son for me, and that if I would truly believe in Him, I would not perish but would have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When asked if I would believe in Christ, I said I would.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We knelt together and prayed, with him praying first.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then I prayed, asking the Lord to forgive my sins and thanking Him for loving and saving me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When I rose up, my heart was filled with joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I experienced a great change in my life and brought forth the fruit of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>My name had been one of the names on his prayer list, and the Lord answered his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Praise the Lord!</S>
