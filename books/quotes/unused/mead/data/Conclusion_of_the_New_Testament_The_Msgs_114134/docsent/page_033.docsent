   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-THREE THE BELIEVERS THEIR PRESENT 7</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall continue to see the significance of the believers being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>e. Into Christ to Put On Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>to Enter into the Organic Union with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The believers have been baptized into Christ to put on Christ, to enter into the organic union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ Gal 3:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be baptized into Christ is the way to be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Based upon the fact that we have been baptized into Christ, we can say that we have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To believe is to believe into Christ John 3:16 , and to be baptized is to be baptized also into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By both faith and baptism, we have been immersed into Christ, having thus put on Christ and having become identified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because we have been baptized into Christ, we now enjoy an organic union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to experience the organic union with Christ, we need to believe into Him and be baptized into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Believing and being baptized are two parts of one step.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First we believe into Christ, then we are baptized into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By believing in Christ we believe into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Greek preposition eis , used in John 3:16, 18, and 36, means into.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By believing in Christ we enter into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In addition to believing into Christ, which is inward and subjective, we also need to be baptized into Him, an act that is outward and objective.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need both the inward action of believing and the outward action of being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way we make one complete step to enter into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The step which begins with believing into Christ is completed by being baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way there takes place in full an organic union between the believers and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should never baptize believers in a ritualistic way, regarding baptism simply as an act of putting someone into water according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such a baptism is void of the reality of the organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we baptize a believer, we should exercise our faith to realize that we are baptizing that one not only into the water but also into a spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we immerse him into the water, we immerse him into Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When a person is baptized into Christ, he enters into an organic union, which is able to transform his whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Matthew 28:19 speaks of baptizing the believers into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and Galatians 3:27 says that we have been baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Christ in Galatians 3:27 is equal to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in Matthew 28:19.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, to be baptized into Christ is to be baptized into the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we baptize believers into Christ, we baptize them into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Galatians 3:27 tells us that as many as are baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To put on Christ is to clothe ourselves with Christ, to put on Christ as a garment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, in baptism we are immersed into Christ; on the other hand, in baptism we put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, to be baptized into Christ is to be immersed into Him as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When a believer is immersed into Christ, he automatically puts on Christ as his clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that the baptized one has become one with Christ, having been immersed into Him and having been clothed with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If Christ were not the life-giving Spirit, there would be no way for us to be baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How could we be baptized into Christ if, according to the traditional teaching of the Trinity, He were only sitting in the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For us to be baptized into Christ, Christ must be the pneuma , the air, the Spirit, all around us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we regard Christ simply as One in the heavens far away, we can practice baptism as a ritual, and people can be baptized without any realization of the significance of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, we cannot be baptized into a Christ who is only in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we can be baptized into Christ who is the pneuma , the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is proved by 1 Corinthians 12:13, where we are told that in one Spirit we were baptized into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Spirit here is the all-inclusive, processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Spirit, the processed Triune God, we have been baptized into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, for us to be baptized into such a reality, Christ must be the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever we baptize others, we should believe that the Triune God as the processed life-giving Spirit is all around them and that they are being immersed into this divine reality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have pointed out that to put on Christ is to clothe ourselves with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whenever we clothe ourselves in a certain way, we indicate that we intend to live in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In like manner, to put on Christ means that we live by Christ, in Christ, and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In particular, it means that we live out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ becomes the expression of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Immediately after we have been put into Christ and have entered into an organic union with Him, we need to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Day by day, we need to be clothed with Christ and express Him as we live in Him, by Him, and with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Romans 6:3 Paul again speaks of being baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although we were born in one person, Adam, we have been baptized into another person, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whether we were good or bad, we were born in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>By being baptized into Christ we get into Christ and become a part of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The meaning of baptism is to put the believers into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Baptism, therefore, is an extremely significant experience, for in it a spiritual transfer takes place.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Baptism is an act in which we put the members of Adam into the death of Christ, thereby transferring them out of Adam and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whenever we baptize others we need to have this realization.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We praise the Lord that we have been baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Although we were born in Adam, by baptism we have been identified with Christ in His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Through death and resurrection Christ was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even Christ Himself needed death and resurrection to transform Him from the flesh to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Likewise, through identification with Christ in His death and resurrection, we have been transferred out of Adam and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we were baptized into Christ, we were transferred from being a part of Adam into being a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Now we are no longer in Adam we are absolutely in Christ.</S>
