<H1 CLASS=TITLE>A MESSAGE BY THE BROTHERS<br>FROM NORTHERN KIANGSU</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 18<br>(Given in Shanghai on June 11, 1931)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. TESTIMONY BY MR. WU WEI</H2><P>Today I thank God for giving me the opportunity to meet all the brothers and sisters here. Today I will give a testimony and some teaching. During the conference in February 1928, three brothers came from Kiangsu. They were Brother Chi Yung-tung, Brother Chiu Re-jian, and myself. During that time no one told me anything specifically about leaving the denominations; I was enlightened and brought to an understanding of the matter through my reading of the books. (Mr. Nee did not mention this subject at all.) At that time I was definitely touched by the truth, and God was working in me in a particular way. Because of that, I have the opportunity today to testify concerning what has happened during the past three years.</P><P>What we experienced three years ago was the same as today; we had Mr. Nee preaching to us then. I think you are all very fortunate here. I was a member of a Presbyterian Church. During the conference, someone mentioned to me the matter of baptism and how one should meet according to the teaching of 1 Corinthians 14. When I heard the truth, I was troubled, and after the conference I was baptized. On that day five people were baptized together, including the three of us, another brother from Pingyang and one brother from Anhwei. After the conference I returned home with Brother Chiu, while Brother Chi remained in Shanghai for a few more days. While I was on my way, I wrote a letter of resignation to my denomination. At that time I struggled with two things. First, I was deeply acquainted with the elders in my locality. Second, I was the first one to be saved in my locality. I was afraid that by resigning, I would be misunderstood and slandered. But for the truth's sake, I had to obey. In my prayer, I received James 4:17, which says, "Therefore to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin." Since I knew it, I should act accordingly. If I did not act, I would be sinning. Subsequently, I did not consider the possible outward consequences and wrote a letter to my elders requesting to be removed from their list and to resign from my post as an elder. I mentioned four things in my letter: (1) one should worship according to the scriptural principles, (2) there should be the breaking of bread meetings, (3) I should be baptized, and (4) there should not be human organizations and denominational names. At the same time, Mr. Chi also wrote a letter from Shanghai requesting to be removed from their list and to resign from his preaching post. When his letter arrived, my letter also arrived. But our denomination did not give us an answer right away because they had to discuss the matter in their convention.</P><P>There was great turmoil within the Presbyterian Church because of this. People began to call together a convention to discuss this matter. In the end, they sent five representatives to me to persuade me to stay and told me that they were willing to follow two and a half of the four points I mentioned. The two and a half points were regarding the worship according to the principles of the Scripture. The elders and the preachers were allowed to administer the bread. As for baptism, those who had been sprinkled did not need to be baptized again, but those who had not been sprinkled could be baptized. As to the removing of the name, the convention had discussions about it and concluded that this could not be done. Furthermore, we were told that we should not resign from our post as elders and preachers. At that time the Scriptures that the Lord gave to me were 2 Corinthians 6:17: "Therefore come out from their midst and be separated," and Acts 5:29: "It is necessary to obey God rather than men." When we considered these two verses, we were happy to put aside human relationships and make the decision to leave. When they realized that our minds were set and that they could not stop us, some ill feelings arose and there was some slander, misunderstanding, and criticism. Brother Chi's home is in Su Chia-chui, which is thirty miles from my home, Yi-lin. He returned home. In his locality there was a meeting established by him and his brother already. In my locality another brother, Shu Shou-yue, joined me to leave the denomination. I was afraid that this brother left not for the sake of the truth, but for the sake of our friendship together. However, later I found out that this was not the case, and we began to have the breaking of bread meeting in Brother Shu's home.</P><P>At that time I felt very lonely and hoped to receive some help from letters from the brothers and sisters in Shanghai. Later Mr. Nee did send me a letter, but when I opened it, there were only these words: "Press on towards the mark, though lonely, unchanged!" This was a line quoted from a hymn in the Little Flock Hymnal. I was expecting some words of comfort or help. But there were only these words, and my heart sank. At that time I only had human concepts. However, after praying and considering these words, I received much help, and these words became a source of strength to me. We are in the Lord, and He is leading us to press toward the mark. For this reason we are not lonely.</P><P>Later more came to our meeting, and those who used to oppose us began to join us. We felt that we needed a place for meeting, and the Lord prepared a place for us which was a house I had prepared for myself during that period of time. We began to have the breaking of bread meeting there. We were not the only ones to do that. Mr. Chi and Mr. Chiu began to have the same kind of meeting in their localities. There was a Mr. Ding Yi-yuen from Dah-chiao, who was a preacher in Dah-chiao. He also left the denominations and began to meet with them. In this way, the four of us began to work together for the Lord in one accord. The Lord gave us different gifts to serve Him. Sinners were saved, and some also left the denominations to meet with us. But at the same time, there was much talk about us.</P><P>Once the Presbyterians had a conference in Salt City. One pastor quoted the words of Gamaliel in Acts 5, saying that if this move was of man, it would be overthrown, but that if it was from God, no one could overthrow it; instead, it would prosper. The words of this pastor opened a way for us. Not only were we not persecuted or slandered anymore, but the words actually testified for us. And not only did they testify for us, they opened a way for us to work in Salt City and other places. Soon, in five different places, there was the breaking of bread meeting with the number exceeding two hundred. The Lord raised up responsible ones from each locality who carried out the work God assigned to them, according to the gifts they received from Him. This is the condition and news of Kiangsu during the past three years. I have now finished my testimony. I am merely testifying for the Lord's truth. If any brother or sister here has heard the truth, they should obey. Now we have about two hundred people meeting. We dare not boast about ourselves; we are merely thanking God for His grace.</P>
