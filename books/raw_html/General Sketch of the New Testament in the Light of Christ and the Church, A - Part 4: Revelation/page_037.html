 <h2 class="head2">The Sons of God in Eternity</h2>
<p>Verses 5 and 6a say, &ldquo;And He who sits on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And He said, Write, for these words are faithful and true. And He said to me, They have come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End.&rdquo; As the Alpha and the Omega He is the start and the completion. At the end of the Bible He declares Himself to be not only the Alpha but also the Omega, meaning that once He begins something, He will complete it regardless of all the frustrations. We should not be disappointed. When we look at the condition of the church today, we may say that it is a mess. How can God accomplish His purpose with such a situation? However, we must remember that Christ is the Alpha and the Omega. He will complete what He has begun. After a long record of not only sixteen books of the Bible but twenty-six, thirty-six, forty-six, fifty-six, and finally sixty-six books, Revelation 21 and 22 eventually will come, because Christ is the Alpha, and He is also the Omega.</p>
<p>Verse 6b and 7 say, &ldquo;I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely. He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be God to him, and he will be a son to Me.&rdquo; To thirst in verse 6 is to thirst not merely after God&rsquo;s redemption or God&rsquo;s work but after God Himself as the living water. Verse 7 says that those who overcome will be not merely God&rsquo;s peoples as in verses 3 and 4, but God&rsquo;s sons. The peoples of God do not have God&rsquo;s life and nature. We are not merely the peoples of God but the sons of God, possessing God&rsquo;s life and nature.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Bride, the Wife of the Lamb</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:9 says, &ldquo;And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.&rdquo; This verse uses two terms, <em>the bride</em> and <em>the wife of the Lamb.</em> The bride is the wife on the first day of marriage. On the wedding day she is the bride, but afterwards she becomes the wife. The New Jerusalem will be the bride in the millennium for one thousand years, the wedding day, and will be the wife in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. Only the overcomers will be the bride in the millennium, but all the redeemed ones eventually will be the wife for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Holy City</h2>
<p>Verse 10 says, &ldquo;And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.&rdquo; In chapter seventeen the apostle John was brought into the wilderness to see the great city, Babylon, but here he is brought to a high mountain to see the holy city, Jerusalem. In order to see God&rsquo;s goal we must be on a high place, a mountain. The Lord&rsquo;s word concerning the kingdom in Matthew 5 through 7 was spoken on a mountain; those in the plains needed to climb the mountain to hear it. The parables in Matthew 13, however, were spoken on the seashore in a mysterious way; the crowd did not understand them. In order to understand the real meaning of those parables, the disciples had to enter inside the house to have an intimate conversation with the Lord (v. 36). Once again, though, the prophecies in Matthew 24 and 25 were spoken by the Lord on the Mount of Olives; those who listened to Him had to climb the mountain.</p>
<p>In the same principle, we must be in spirit and be brought out of the world to the highest level, to the mountain. Then we will see the vision of the goal of the divine purpose. Many Christians today cannot see the things in Revelation no matter how many times they read it. When they read chapters twenty-one and twenty-two, they are blinded. They do not have the light, the insight, because they remain on the &ldquo;plain.&rdquo; We need to be in spirit and be brought up to a high mountain. Then we will see the vision and have the real sight.</p>
<p>In 14:8 and 17:5 Babylon is the great city, but in 21:10 the New Jerusalem is the holy city. The principle of Babylon is to be great, but the principle of the New Jerusalem is to be holy. Do we prefer greatness or holiness? Today many seek to be great preachers, great ministers, and great evangelists, the greater the better. This is the principle of Babylon. We must learn to be small, the smaller the better. We must learn to be holy and separated. We should not make ourselves great or advertise ourselves. To be small requires that we are separated, but to be great requires much mixture. The more mixture something has, the more it becomes great. As Babylon the Great, the apostate Roman Catholic Church is great because she is a mixture of many things. The principle of the church and of the New Jerusalem is that it is a holy city, not a great city. The great city will be burned, but the holy city will be the Lord&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Her Glory and Appearance</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:11 says that the New Jerusalem had the glory of God: &ldquo;Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal.&rdquo; In 4:3 the appearance of God, the expressed God, is like jasper. This indicates that the entire city of New Jerusalem has the expression, the appearance, of God. In appearance the entire city is exactly the same as God. Both God Himself and the entire city are like jasper.</p>
<p>This means that the church must bear the appearance of God; it must be full of God&rsquo;s expression. We cannot be the expression of God if we are great rather than holy. The more we become great, the more we will lose the expression and appearance of God. We will have not jasper but bricks, with which the city of Babel was built. Bricks are composed of earthly material and are manufactured by man. What is the difference between Babel and the New Jerusalem? Babel was built with bricks, while the New Jerusalem is built with precious stones.</p>
<p>When the children of Israel were in Egypt, they took clay and straw and burned them into bricks, and with these bricks they built two treasure cities for Pharaoh. This was something of human manufacture. Today many so-called churches are building with bricks. To build with bricks equals building with wood, grass, and stubble in 1 Corinthians 3:12. God&rsquo;s building is built with precious stones which bear the same appearance and expression as God. How much we have to be purified, sanctified, separated, and made holy! We must be separated from all mixture. What kind of work are we going to do? Are we going to gather straw and burn clay to manufacture bricks and build with them?</p>
<p>When the children of Israel were brought out of Egypt, they received a vision from God to build the tabernacle. The tabernacle was full of gold, and the breastplate and shoulder plate of the high priest were full of precious stones. When the high priest was serving in the tabernacle, the scene there was full of gold and precious stones. This is a picture of God&rsquo;s building. The church must be a composition of precious stones built up together to express God and have His appearance.</p>
