<h2 class="head2">The Love of Material Things</h2><p>The fourth expression of the self is a love for material things. Some people not only love themselves; they love material things. Such ones are not yet delivered from the material world. For example, some people love food, money, or other things. These things are their idols. If someone breaks a favorite glass by accident or damages their treasures, they become very angry. Their love for material things is wounded. If a man's love for material things is not dealt with, his temper will always remain.</p><p>The fact that a man loses his temper easily has nothing to do with other people; it has to do with himself. Brother Lawrence once slapped his hand on a piece of wood, then on some glass, and then on the wall. He used the same hand to hit three different things, and the sounds produced were all different. He pointed out that the difference in sound was not due to the hand, but to the different kinds of materials hit. The same can be said about man's temper. It does not flare up because of the environment but because of the very nature within man. The environment only brings out the temper that is already within him. If a man does not deal with his self but only tries to deal with his temper, he is a foolish man. He will never be able to deal with his temper because he is only dealing with the symptom of his sickness; he has not touched the root of his temper.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ROOT OF TEMPER</h2><p>We have seen that temper is not an illness but a symptom. Yet from the symptoms, we often can diagnose an illness. If a man loses his temper, it means that there is something abnormal in him. There are four reasons for a Christian to lose his temper. First, a person who refuses the discipline of the Holy Spirit loses his temper. A man with a temper complains and gets angry when he faces adversity. Not only is he short of light from God, but he blames others as well. He will not accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit which is placed in his environment. Second, a person loses his temper because he is dissatisfied with God's arrangement. A man with a temper often is a man who is dissatisfied with his environment. No matter what God does to his environment, he is always dissatisfied. He always wants more. Third, a Christian loses his temper because he only cares for his own things. Some people are quiet by nature. They are only interested in their own things, and they have no interest in others' affairs. Everything they do is for themselves. They have no time for others. When others come, they feel bothered. If their work takes up too much time, they become angry. They cannot stand others' bothering. When others bother them, they condemn them and say that they are infringing on their freedom. Many people lose their temper because they care only for their own things. Hence, we should tell new ones that the root of all temper is the self. Fourth, a man loses his temper because of self-exaltation. Some people become mad and angry as a result of their struggle to exalt themselves. They think that others should not be the same as they are. They want to have everything for themselves and nothing for others. They are always jealous of others, not only in material things but in spiritual things as well. When they see others achieving something, they become jealous and angry. This is a very mean attitude. They have the same kind of feelings as Satan. They rejoice in the fall of those whom they dislike. They are sympathizers of Satan. Such ones are filled with jealousy in their heart. In order to be delivered from their anger, they must remove jealousy from their heart. When a man who knows God is exalted, he rejoices at others' exaltation as well. He will not trample upon others or debase others.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO ACCEPT<br />THE DISCIPLINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>Temper comes from the self. If a man has a temper, it is because his self is not dealt with one way or another. We have to learn to prostrate ourselves before God and be open to His shining. We should consider our own condition. Every day many things come upon us. We should bow our heads and say, "Lord, Your arrangements are always the best." Many cows and sheep are nervous under the hand of their shepherd because they do not know their master; they only see the rod and staff of the shepherd. If we only see the environment without seeing the Lord behind the environment, we will not be at peace, and we will easily lose our temper. But if we see that every situation is in our Shepherd's hand, having been measured by Him, we will be at peace. If we accept the Holy Spirit's discipline and God's arrangements, every negative problem will disappear. When temper tries to flare up, we will isolate the self and find deliverance in the light. In this way we will be able to rise to our feet quickly.</p>
