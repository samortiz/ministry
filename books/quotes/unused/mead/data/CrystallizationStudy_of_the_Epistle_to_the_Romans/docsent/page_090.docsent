   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. Sent by God, the Highest</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Authority, as His Ambassador</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is the highest authority in the universe; God sent Paul as His ambassador to the sinners to speak in boldness the mystery of the gospel Eph 6:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>An ambassador always represents a higher authority to contact and deal with others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God sent Paul as His ambassador to deal with the sinners, to speak in boldness the mystery of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If someone rejects you when you are announcing the gospel, you may say, Sir, I am an ambassador of God sent by Him to you .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You should not reject me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can be bold because we are God s ambassadors.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must speak in boldness the mystery of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The gospel actually is the good news of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In God s economy there are five big mysteries: 1 the Triune God; 2 the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ; 3 the consummated, compounded, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, and sevenfold intensified Spirit; 4 the Body of Christ; 5 the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should even have the boldness to preach the gospel by telling people about the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to be able to speak with boldness concerning the highest peak of God s revelation, telling people that God became a man in order that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of preaching does work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not be afraid and timid when we go out to announce the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This will cause people to reject us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must go out as God s ambassadors.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>G. Laboring as a Priest of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Romans 15:16 Paul said that he was a laboring priest of the gospel to offer the Gentiles to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Old Testament priests offered the sacrifices which typified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But today we, the New Testament priests, offer to God the saved sinners who have been converted into Christ s members.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are not announcing the gospel for soul-winning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That is too low.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, we want to convert sinners into members of Christ and offer them to God as sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the work of a laboring priest of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>H. To Announce</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must announce the contents of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that we announce God s incarnation to be a man, His living on this earth for thirty-three and a half years, and His going to the cross to die an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the negative side, He terminated everything of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He also terminated Satan, sin, the world, and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the positive side, through His death, He released the divine life within Him into His believers to germinate them with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then through resurrection and in ascension, He poured out the Spirit, and the church came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church is the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ is the house of God, the kingdom of God, and Christ s bride.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to speak these marvelous things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not be very concerned about whether or not others fully understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sometimes they understand much and they will still not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes they do not understand much, but they want to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must change our way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not take the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Take the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ as the Objective Savior and</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>the Subjective Indwelling Life-imparter</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must announce Christ as the objective Savior and the subjective indwelling Life-imparter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First Timothy 1:15 says that the faithful word is that Christ came into the world to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is Christ as the objective Savior of the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then Paul tells us in Galatians 1:15-16 that God was happy to reveal Christ in him that he might preach Him to others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not the outward Savior but the inward, indwelling, Life-imparter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul announced Christ as the indwelling One to others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Unsearchable Riches of Christ as the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The gospel preached today by Christianity is altogether too shallow, simple, and poor.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul announced the gospel of the unsearchable riches of Christ Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Mystery of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Ephesians 3:4 Paul spoke of the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to learn all these deeper, higher things to speak to others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the higher gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Mystery of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Ephesians 6:19 Paul said, And for me, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known in boldness the mystery of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The mystery of the gospel is Christ and the church for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose Eph 5:32 .</S>
