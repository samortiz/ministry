[2]  CHAPTER ONE TO KNOW THIS AGE Scripture Reading: John 7:39; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Exo 30:23-25; Rom 8:2, 9-11; Rev 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6 OUTLINE Not one of today's theologies, including the Nicene Creed, stresses adequately the following five critical points concerning the Spirit of God in the move of God's eternal economy: The Spirit that gives life was not yet before the glorification resurrection of Christ John 7:39.
[3]  The last Adam Christ in the flesh became a life-giving Spirit fulfilling John 7:39 1 Cor 15:45b.
[4]  I. NOT ONE OF TODAY'S THEOLOGIES, INCLUDING THE NICENE CREED, STRESSING ADEQUATELY THE FOLLOWING FIVE CRITICAL POINTS CONCERNING THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN THE MOVE OF GOD'S ETERNAL ECONOMY A. The Spirit That Gives Life Being Not Yet before the Glorification Resurrection of Christ
[5]  The Spirit that gives life was not yet before the glorification resurrection of Christ John 7:39b .
[6]  C. The Compound Spirit Typified by the Anointing Ointment
[7]  Third, not one of today's theologies stresses adequately the critical point concerning the compound Spirit typified by the anointing ointment a compound of one hin of olive oil with four kinds of spices and their effectiveness in Exodus 30:23-25.
[8]  The life-giving Spirit is not simple but is a Spirit that has been compounded.
[9]  D. The Spirit of Life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, Christ Himself, and the Indwelling Spirit All Referring to the Compound Spirit That Gives Life
[10]  Christ is Christ, and He is also the Spirit, for He has been pneumatized and has become the pneumatic Christ.
[11]  Furthermore, this Spirit who is of life, of God, of Christ, and Christ Himself dwells in us as the indwelling Spirit to dispense life to us all the time.
[12]  CHAPTER TWO TO ENTER INTO THE MYSTICAL REALM OF CHRIST'S HEAVENLY MINISTRY OUTLINE Passing through the physical realm of Christ's earthly ministry: In the physical realm of His earthly ministry, Christ is the Christ in the flesh: For thirty-three and a half years, from His incarnation to become the flesh to His all- inclusive death.
[13]  In His flesh Col 1:22 Christ carried out His earthly ministry by accomplishing God's judicial redemption, resulting objectively in God's: Forgiveness of the believers' sins Eph 1:7.
[14]  As the life-giving Spirit Rom 8:9-10; 2 Cor 3:17-18 , Christ is carrying out His heavenly ministry by accomplishing God's organic salvation subjectively in eight steps: Regeneration to generate the redeemed believers with His divine life that they may be born of God to be His children of His species John 1:12-13; 3:6b.
[15]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You that You have set us up as a particular people, a particular possession of Yours.
[16]  We thank You, Lord, that You have chosen us and have even appointed us with a commission to carry out Your eternal economy.
[17]  I. PASSING THROUGH THE PHYSICAL REALM OF CHRIST'S EARTHLY MINISTRY
[18]  Renewing is to have our mind changed in our religion, logic, and philosophy concerning the universe, mankind, God, etc., by the Spirit of truth with the revelations of the Scriptures, even to have Christ's mind replacing our mind through the consuming work of the cross Titus 3:5; Rom 12:2b; Eph 4:23; Rom 8:6; Phil 2:5; 2 Cor 4:16 .
[19]  Conformation is to be conformed to the full-grown image of the firstborn Son of God, who is the first God-man, as the prototype for mass reproduction.
[20]  He is God mingled with man and man mingled with God to live a God-man living that expresses all the attributes of God as human virtues for the expression of the divine glory in humanity, whose ultimate consummation, whose maturity in the divine life, is the New Jerusalem Rom 8:29; 1:4; Eph 4:14; Rev 21 . h.
[21]  CHAPTER THREE THE DIVINE AND MYSTICAL REALM OF THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT AND THE PNEUMATIC CHRIST Scripture Reading: John 14:10-11; Phil 1:19; Rom 8:9; 2 Cor 3:17-18; John 14:16-20; 1 Cor 15:45b; John 20:22; 16:12-15; 15:4-5, 8; 17:21, 23 OUTLINE The divine and mystical realm: The Son is in the Father, and the Father is in the Son John 14:10-11.
[22]  This indicates that the Father is embodied in the Son and the Son is the Father's embodiment, forming a divine and mystical realm.
[23]  The divine and mystical realm of the consummated Spirit and the pneumatic Christ Phil 1:19; Rom 8:9; 2 Cor 3:17-18: Another Comforter, the Spirit of reality, to be the reality of the Son realized as the Son's presence in the believers John 14:16-18.
[24]  The Spirit receives all that Christ has and declares to the disciples who were then in the reality of Christ's resurrection and in the divine and mystical realm of the pneumatic Christ for the producing of the assemblies which issue in the Body of Christ that consummates the New Jerusalem to express the all-inclusive Christ for His glorification in eternity John 16:14-15.
[25]  The believers must consider highly the entry into this realm, realizing that without Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit, without Christ being the pneumatic Christ, without Christ being the Lord Spirit, and without Christ being the Christ in resurrection and not only in the flesh, there is absolutely no way for the believers to participate in, experience, and enjoy the organic section of God's complete salvation in Christ.
[26]  Prayer: Lord, we believe that in these days You are speaking to us, unveiling the depths within You.
[27]  In John 7 we see that the Lord Jesus, the God-man, attended the Feast of Tabernacles.
[28]  In the next verse John, the author of this Gospel, gives a word of explanation: "But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified" v. 39 . We need to pay special attention to the words the Spirit was not yet.
[29]  Although the Spirit already was the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit, the Spirit that gives life was "not yet" in John 7 because the Lord Jesus had not yet passed through death for man's sin and had not yet entered into resurrection.
[30]  Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of John are a section.
[31]  At the beginning of this section the Lord Jesus indicated, in 14:1, that He intended to speak something to help us to believe into Him.
[32]  We have emphasized the fact that the Triune God is a divine and mystical realm.
[33]  As revealed in the first part of John 14, the Son is in the Father, and the Father is in the Son.
[34]  In verses 16 through 18 we have a word not only concerning the Father and the Son but also concerning the Spirit: "I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.
[35]  The Lord Jesus said that when the Spirit of reality came, He would guide the disciples, who would then be in the Spirit of Christ's resurrection, into all the reality concerning God's economy for the Body of Christ, who is the pneumatic Christ and the consummated Spirit.
[36]  Note: God's intention in His organic salvation is to join the believer's spirit with His Spirit as one spirit a mingled spirit 1 Cor 6:17.
[37]  To open the first section of regeneration: The Spirit of reality came to convict the sinners concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment John 16:8-11 , causing them to repent of their fallen condition and enter into the death and burial of Christ Matt 3:2, 5-6 .
[38]  The renewing Spirit is mingled with our regenerated spirit as one mingled spirit to spread into our mind to renew our entire being as a member of the new man by putting off our old man, that is, by renouncing and denying our old self Matt 16:24 , and by putting on the new man, that is, by applying what Christ has accomplished in creating the new man Eph 2:15 , by living and magnifying Christ through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19-21 Eph 4:22-24.
[39]  Prayer: Lord, we can never forget what a mercy and what a grace that You are the Spirit, even the life-giving Spirit and the sevenfold intensified Spirit.
[40]  Lord, You have created for us a human spirit, and in Your organic salvation the first thing You do is to regenerate our spirit.
[41]  B. The Spirit of Reality Germinating the Repentant Believers
[42]  First, we are convicted that we were born of Adam in sin and that we should take Christ as our righteousness.
[43]  The first aspect is His seeking sanctification by the Holy Spirit with the enlightening Word initially 1 Pet 1:2; Luke 15:8 ; the second aspect is the positional sanctification by the redeeming blood of Christ judicially Heb 13:12; 10:29 ; the third aspect is the dispositional sanctification by the Holy Spirit organically Rom 15:16; 6:19, 22 .
[44]  B. Signified by the Jasper Wall with Its Foundations of the New Jerusalem
[45]  The building of God as the building of the church, the Body of Christ, being by the transformation of the Spirit is clearly signified by the jasper wall with its foundations of the New Jerusalem Rev 21:18-20 .
[46]  CHAPTER FIVE "THE SPIRIT HIMSELF WITH OUR SPIRIT" THE KEY TO OPEN THE EIGHT SECTIONS OF THE ORGANIC SALVATION OF GOD 2 OUTLINE To open the seventh section of conformation: Conformation is the consummation of transformation.
[47]  Transformation is a gradual work to transform us into the glorious image of Christ 2 Cor 3:18 that needs a consummation and this consummation is the conformation to conform the transformed believers to the image of the firstborn Son of God the first God-man Rom 8:29.
[48]  Such a conformation is the full growth of the processed Triune God the Father embodied in the Son and the Son realized as the Spirit as the divine life in Christ Col 1:28 that grows in the believers unto maturity.
[49]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You for Your divine intention.
[50]  The sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit works to rescue the believers in the church in Thyatira from idol worship, fornication, demonic teachings, and the deep things of Satan to be the overcomers so that they may be rewarded with the authority over the nations in the kingdom age 2:18-29 .
[51]  CHAPTER SIX THE UNIQUE GROUND OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES OF GOD AND THE UNIQUE ONENESS OF THE UNIVERSAL BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:1-2, 9, 10-13; 3:3-4; Eph 4:3-6 OUTLINE The unique ground of the local churches of God 1 Cor 1:1-2, 9, 10-13; 3:3-4: The church of God the content of the church in its essence 1:2a.
[52]  Christ is "theirs and ours" Christ is the portion of the local saints in Corinth and of all the saints in whatever place, who participate in the fellowship enjoyment of Christ, into which all the believers have been called by the faithful God 1:2e, 9.
[53]  Prayer: Lord, how we thank You that You have brought us through all the previous fellowship.
[54]  Those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, are the constituents as the framework of the church 1 Cor 1:2c .
[55]  But we recognize and receive the individual believers in Christ who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, who are redeemed by His blood and regenerated by the Holy Spirit, and who are not factious Titus 3:10 , not making divisions Rom 16:17 , and not worshipping idols or living in sin 1 Cor 5:11 , even if they are still related to any of the above listed divisions.
[56]  C. The Blending of the Universal Body of Christ 1.
