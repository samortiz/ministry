   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>H. Leading the Children</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to the Knowledge of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Eighth, we must lead them to the knowledge of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A family altar is indeed necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Old Testament the tabernacle was linked to the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words the family is linked to service and consecration to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No family can go on without prayer and the reading of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is especially true with families that have children.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Meetings That Are on the Level of the Children</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some families fail in their prayer and Bible-reading time because their family meetings are too long and too deep.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The children do not understand what is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They do not know why you are asking them to sit there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I do not like it when families invite us to their homes to speak about deep doctrines and then force their children to sit with them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some home meetings go on for one or two hours about difficult doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is indeed a great suffering for the children.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet many parents have no feeling about this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The children sit there, but they do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, if the topic is on the book of Revelation, how can they understand it?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The home meetings must suit the children.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These family meetings are not designed for you; your meeting is in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not impose your standard on your family.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What you do in the family must suit the taste of your children and must be on their own level.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Encouraging and Attracting</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Another problem with some home meetings is that there is little love in them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is neither the father's attraction nor the mother's attraction that draws the children to these meetings; it is the whip that keeps them there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They do not want to join.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But they come because there is the threat of the whip.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you take away the whip, they will not come.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This will never work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You must think of some ways to attract them and encourage them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not punish them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Never beat your children for not attending your family worship hour.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you beat them once, you may create a problem in them for the rest of their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Parents must attract their children to the family worship hour.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not force them to come.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This will only result in terrible consequences.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Meeting Once in the Morning</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>and Once in the Evening</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We suggest having two home meetings a day, one in the morning and one in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The father should lead the morning time and the mother should lead the evening time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Get up a little earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The parents must not remain in bed after the children have taken their breakfast and gone to school.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you have children at home, you have to wake up earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Have a little time together before the children go to school.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Your meeting should be short, living, and never long.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps ten minutes is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Fifteen minutes is the longest it should be.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Never exceed fifteen minutes and do not be shorter than five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Ask everyone of them to read a verse.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The father should take the lead to pick out a few phrases and speak about them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the children can memorize something, ask them to memorize.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not quote a whole verse.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Ask them to remember the meaning of a sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At the end of the meeting the father or the mother should offer a prayer for God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not offer lofty or deep prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Pray about things that children can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not be long.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then send them to school.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Every time you sit down for your meal, you should thank the Lord for it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whether it is breakfast, lunch, or dinner, you should be sincere in your thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Help your children to give thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The evening meeting should be a little longer, and the mother should lead it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is not necessary to read the Bible at night, but the family needs to pray together.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In particular, the mother has to gather the children together and talk to them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>While the father is sitting next to her, the mother should encourage the children to speak up.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Ask them whether they had any problems that day.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Ask whether they fought with one another and whether anything was bothering them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If a mother cannot make her children speak up, something must be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is a failure of the mother to allow a barrier to exist between herself and her children.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The mother must be at fault if the children are afraid to speak to her.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They should be free to speak up.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The mother must learn to bring out the things that are in her children's hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If they do not want to speak up that day, ask them the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Guide the children.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Let them pray a little and teach them to say a few words.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This meeting must be living.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Ask them to confess their sins, but do not force them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There must not be any pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Everything must be done in a very natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Let them take some initiative themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If they have something to confess, let them confess.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If they have nothing to confess, do not force them.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There must not be any pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The pretense found in many children is the result of pressure from strict parents.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Children do not tell lies, but you can force them to tell lies.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The parents should lead them to pray in a simple way one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Make sure that everyone prays.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Finally, conclude with a prayer of your own.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But do not be long.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Once your prayer becomes long, children become bored.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Feed them according to their capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Once you try to do too much, you will overburden them.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Pray a few sentences with them and then let them go to sleep.</S>
