   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE WAY TO FREEDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A consecrated believer can fall into passivity in a foolish and deceived way for several years and still be ignorant of the danger of his own position.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He can become more and more passive as time passes, until the sphere of passivity becomes so great that it inflicts unspeakable pain to his mind, emotion, body, and environment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, it is essential to preach the true meaning of consecration to him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the previous chapters we emphasized the importance of knowledge because the knowledge of the truth is absolutely indispensable in rescuing one from passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without the knowledge of the truth, it is impossible to experience deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A passive believer falls into his condition because of deception, and the reasons for deception are foolishness and ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without foolishness and ignorance it would be impossible to be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>KNOWING THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to know the truth concerning all things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to know the truth concerning co-working with God; we have to know the truth concerning the work of evil spirits; we have to know the truth concerning consecrating ourselves; and we have to know the truth concerning supernatural things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the first step toward deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A believer must know the truth concerning the source and nature of all of his experiences before he has the hope of deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The believer is 1 deceived, 2 then he becomes passive, 3 then he becomes possessed, 4 then he is deceived into further passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, if a believer wants to be free, to avoid being possessed, and to avoid all the deception and passivity that come as a result of possession, he must remove the deception.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the first point deception is eliminated, then other points passivity, possession, and further deception and passivity will be disintegrated one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a person is deceived, he opens a door for evil spirits to come in. When a person is passive, he gives ground for evil spirits to stand and remain.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The result of this action is possession by demons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to be delivered from possession, one must remove the passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to remove the passivity, one must remove the deception.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to remove the deception, one has to know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the knowledge of the truth is the first step toward deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Indeed, only the truth can set men free!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since the beginning of this book, we have repeatedly warned the believers about the danger of all supernatural experiences such as signs, voices, miracles, wonders, flames, speaking in tongues, sensations, etc. . We do not mean that all supernatural experiences should be refused, rejected, and opposed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This would be unscriptural to say, because the Bible tells us that God has done many supernatural things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our purpose is to show the believers that there is not only one source of supernatural experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Evil spirits can imitate what God can do.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is very important to distinguish what is and is not from God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a believer has not died to his emotional life and earnestly seeks after experiences in his feeling, he will be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are not saying that believers should refuse all supernatural things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are simply advising the believers to refuse all of the supernatural things from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this chapter we want to point out the fundamental differences between the work of the Holy Spirit and that of evil spirits so that believers will know how to distinguish between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today believers are particularly susceptible to deceptions in supernatural things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because of these deceptions, they are possessed by evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We earnestly hope that a believer would spend the time to discern supernatural things to avoid being deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A believer should never forget that if the Holy Spirit gives him a supernatural experience, he can still use his own mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no need for him to be totally or partially passive to obtain such an experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even after receiving such an experience, he can still use his own conscience to discern what is good and evil, and he can decide to accept or reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There should be no compulsion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If evil spirits give a person a supernatural experience, they must first put him into a state of passivity; his mind must become blank, and all of his actions must be driven by an outside power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the basic difference.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In 1 Corinthians 14, the apostle speaks of the spiritual, supernatural gifts of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Among them, there are revelations, prophecies, speaking in tongues, and other supernatural expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The apostle admits that they all come from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But in verse 32 he tells us the characteristic of these divine gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The apostle said that if a prophet believer obtains something that is really from the Holy Spirit, the spirit that he has obtained will be subject to him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the Holy Spirit gives man numerous types of supernatural experiences, the spirit is still subject to him; the Holy Spirit will not go against man's will to use any part of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A man should still have control over himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only the spirit that is subject to the prophet is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Any spirit that demands the prophet's subjection is not from God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, we should not refuse all supernatural things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, we have to check whether or not the supernatural spirit requires us to submit to him passively.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a person who has received the gift of tongues or some other similar gift cannot control himself, if he cannot speak when he wants to speak and be quiet when he wants to be quiet, if he cannot sit still and is forced to throw himself on the ground, or if a power from outside controls him, this indicates that the spirit he has received is an evil spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the basic difference between the work of the Holy Spirit and the work of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The former wants man to have full freedom, while the latter want man to be passive.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, if a believer wants to know where his own experience comes from, he should do some checking and find out if he is passive or not.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This will solve all the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A believer is deceived because he does not know this basic truth.</S>
