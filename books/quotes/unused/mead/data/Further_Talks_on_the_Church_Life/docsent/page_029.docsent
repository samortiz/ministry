   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>No One Daring to Break the "Unity"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must take notice of one condition that prevailed after the Roman Catholic Church came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We know how the Roman Church was filled with heresy, idols, filthiness, and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why did no brothers or sisters in the church stand up to deal with the situation for eleven hundred years?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Could it be that no brothers or sisters had seen the heresies?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Could it be that they had not seen the idols?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Could it be that they had not seen the filthy sins?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the eleven hundred years following the fourth century, there were definitely some who saw the heresies, idols, and filthy sins, but not one dared to deal with them!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They feared that once they dealt with these things, they would immediately break the "unity."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"The church is one," they said.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"If we begin to deal with the idols, the church will be divided."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They felt that the sin of worshipping idols was great, but the sin of ruining the unity was even greater.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, even though they rejected the worship of idols themselves, they did not speak out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They feared that speaking out might ruin the unity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They knew of the heresies and they knew of the idols; moreover, they hated the heresies and they hated the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But even more, they hated to destroy the unity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, they simply avoided the heresies and idols; they dared not evoke any word, message, or action that might ruin the unity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For a period of one thousand one hundred years no one made any move; they continued to keep the unity of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the time of the Reformation, Martin Luther had no thought of forming another church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He thought that doing such a thing would be a serious sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, at the beginning his thought was to improve the Roman Catholic Church; the idea of forming another church was not in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was the inevitable force of history that brought about the formation of another church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Luther only wanted to improve the Roman Catholic Church; he had no intention of forming a new church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here we see one thing: The Roman Catholic Church believes in the unity of the church throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It believes that only one church should exist in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That is the reason, during the long history of Rome, that the children of God basically forgot that the "churches" were plural in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They only wanted the church in the singular.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even when Luther arose, he only saw a united church on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He did not see that God has churches in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, the unity that was upheld is something manifested in one church the international, worldwide, universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regardless of where this church stands, it is always the Church of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Shanghai it is the Church of Rome; in Moscow it is the Church of Rome; in London it is the Church of Rome; in Berlin it is also the Church of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Wherever it is, it is always the Church of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It does not call itself the Church of Rome; its proper title is the Catholic Church, the Universal Church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We call it the Church of Rome because we know it comes out of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It calls itself the Catholic Church because it is unified and universal; it includes everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In China it is called the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word catholic in Latin simply means universal and general, with no distinction in race or region.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No matter where it is, it is always one one in England, one in Japan, and one in Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As long as it comes out of Rome, it is called the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As a result, there is only "one church" on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must study the Scriptures carefully and accurately before God to ascertain whether or not the church on earth is one church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If it is only one church, we must say that the local church is wrong, and even the many denominations in Protestantism must also confess that they are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If there is but one church, we all have to go back to Rome; if we do not, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, we must study the Scriptures to see whether or not we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I know there are some Protestant friends who have said that the church on earth is one and that our churches in different localities are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to them, the church is always one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Please note that their word condemns them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the church is one, there is no reason for any of their denominations to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the church is one, then regardless of where it is, it must be the Church of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to numbers, the Church of Rome is the largest, according to history, it is the oldest church, and according to organization, it is one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If there should be only one church, that is, if the church of God or the church of Christ should be singular, then this would be the scriptural way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should all return to Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, the Bible does not teach this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the last century, John H. Newman, a contemporary of J. N. Darby, was a famous English clergyman.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was not only pious, but he had an excellent mind and wrote many books.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He was considered one of the most famous persons in the Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The hymn "Lead, Kindly Light" was composed by him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He believed that there was only one church in the world, so he started a movement in the Anglican Church to return to Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Of course, he was unsuccessful, because Revelation 2 and 3 clearly show that Sardis cannot go back to Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He thought that it was logical to leave the Anglican Church and join the Roman Church since there was only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After being received as a member of the Roman Church, he was promoted to the position of cardinal over England.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A cardinal is next in rank only to the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was not only a bishop but a cardinal.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There was only one cardinal in England; he was the archbishop of a large region.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When a pope passes away, the new pope is chosen from among the scores of cardinals.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many people have expressed regret for Newman, but in reading his books, I feel that his beginning was consistent with his end. I do not say that he was right, but his behavior matched his doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He believed in only one church; therefore, he went back to Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>One should not believe in one church and yet remain in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>One should not confess that the church is one and be a pastor in the Anglican Church or an elder in the Presbyterian Church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Newman was thoroughly consistent and uncontradicting.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>His end harmonized with his beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In this regard many people in the denominations cannot compare with him.</S>
