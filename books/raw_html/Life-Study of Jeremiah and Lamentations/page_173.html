<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THIRTY-EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SEPARATION OF THE CHURCH,<br>GOD'S NEW TESTAMENT ELECT,<br>FROM THE WORLD IN ALL ITS ASPECTS<br>FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF GOD'S ECONOMY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Jer. 46:1-28; 50&#151;51</H1><P>In this message I would like to give a further word regarding the nations in 46:1&#151;51:64.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR NEED TO KNOW THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE<br>OF THE HISTORICAL EVENTS RECORDED IN JEREMIAH</H2><P>Jeremiah is a book on God's economy. In the life-study of this book, my concern is not merely with the historical facts and sequence but with the spiritual significance of the historical events recorded in this book. To understand the events themselves is one thing, but to see the spiritual significance of these events is another thing. We may know the events but not know their spiritual significance. We should not read the stories in the Bible or study the Bible in black and white without knowing the spiritual significance of what we are reading or studying. Therefore, my burden regarding chapters forty-six through fifty-one is that we see the spiritual significance of Jehovah's punishment and judgment upon the nations involved with God's elect, Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EGYPT SIGNIFYING THE WORLD<br>OF MAKING A LIVING AND OF ENJOYMENT<br>AND BABYLON SIGNIFYING THE WORLD<br>OF REBELLION AGAINST GOD,<br>IDOL WORSHIP, AND SELF-EXALTATION</H2><P>The sequence in which Jeremiah covered God's punishment on Israel and His judgment on the nations is very significant. First, Jeremiah spoke concerning Israel's sin and Jehovah's punishment on Israel. Then he spoke concerning God's punishment and judgment upon the nations involved with Israel. In speaking concerning the nations, he mentions Egypt first (46:2-28) and Babylon last (chs. 50&#151;51). This indicates that, in God's view, the world is first Egyptian and then Babylonian. However, according to historical sequence, Babylon began first, from Babel (Gen. 10:8-10; 11:1-9). God called Abraham out of Chaldea, the land of Babel, into the good land. But later, when Abraham became weak, he drifted to Egypt.</P><P>Babel is the origin, the source, of man's worship of idols, man's rebellion against God, and human self-exaltation. After these things began, the world became Egyptian, with Egypt signifying the world in the aspect of making a living and having entertainment. At Babel man rebelled against God, worshipped idols, and exalted man's self, but at Babel there was no way to make a living or to have entertainment. Hence, according to the sequence in Genesis, Babel is mentioned first and then Egypt. During the time of famine, Egypt was nearly the only place that still had food (Gen. 42:1-2). Egypt was the place of security and enjoyment.</P><P>The book of Jeremiah presents us a picture of God's coming in to punish and judge the nations. According to this picture, the last nation to be judged is Babylon. When God judges Babylon, His judgment of the nations will be complete.</P>
