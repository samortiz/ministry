   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the years of 1933 and 1934, the church in Shanghai, the largest church in the Lord's recovery in China, needed land on which to construct a meeting hall to seat five hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At that time land was very expensive, and it was difficult to afford an adequate lot.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church needed property and prayed for it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1936 an elderly sister who was quite rich had some property very close to the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This sister loved the Lord and attended most of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When she learned of the church's need for such a piece of property, she had the desire to offer that land to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the same time, however, she was concerned for some of her children.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually, she decided to offer the property to the church for one-half of its value, which was between 25,000 and 30,000.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, the transaction was completed with the church paying half this amount, and the title deed being transferred to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While the plans were being drawn for the hall, that sister's daughter asked the church to include in the proposed meeting hall a stone with an inscription saying that the property for the building had been presented by the elderly sister for one-half its value.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Watchmen Nee absolutely refused to agree to this and quite a negotiation followed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Nee did not give one inch.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He would never surrender an inch to such a show of human glory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The daughter of that elderly sister likewise would not budge an inch.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, the deal was cancelled, with the title deed being returned to the family and the money being returned to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From 1936 until 1948, the church in Shanghai was not able to acquire a piece of land for a building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This caused the church to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, it was worthwhile for the church to suffer in this manner in order to keep the principle of the reality of the kingdom life in the matter of giving.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By relating to you this incident from our past history, you can see where we stand, and you can see the reality of the kingdom life in the matter of giving.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Never make a display of your giving.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why we do not like to reveal the amount of money people have offered to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In some of the cathedrals and church buildings, there are inscriptions indicating who donated certain objects.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, a bench may have an inscription declaring who contributed it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a shame!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If it were not for the American system of taxation which allows for tax deductions on contributions, we would not permit the offerers to make their names known in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In all the years in China, where there was a different method of taxation, we did not allow the saints to use personal checks for the offering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everyone used currency.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, no one knew where the offerings came from.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a good practice because it closes the door to the flesh and human vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The children of the kingdom must also have an inward purity concerning prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes you may be tempted to want others to hear when you are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is wonderful to shout, "O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jesus is Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, do not intend for others to know that you are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In a sense, it is better to hide your praying from others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Never make a display of your prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Concerning fasting, the Lord Jesus said that the Pharisees and hypocrites disfigured their faces when they fasted as if to say, "Look at me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I'm fasting."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus said, "When you fast, anoint your head and wash you face, so that you may not appear to men to be fasting" Matt 6:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whether in the giving of alms, in prayer, or in fasting, you should never make a show of your good deeds.</S>
