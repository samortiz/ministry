   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>According to Zechariah 12:1 it seems that God created only three prominent things: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This shows that only these three things are important and vital in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man has a spirit for God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here you have the purpose of the universe, the meaning of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The heavens with all the stars and planets are for the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The earth is not for the heavens but for man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without the earth, man could not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The earth is just right for us to live to fulfill our purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man is not for education, for clothing, for food, for housing, or for entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Man is good only for God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man is a God-bottle, a vessel to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not think about doing something for God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have received many wrong impressions from fallen Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We think that we have to worship God, serve God, do something good for God, glorify God, and be nice, loving, and humble.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I would ask you to forget about all this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God has no intention to have you be so humble and nice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's intention is to have you filled up with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No one would teach a Coca-Cola bottle to worship the Coca-Cola, serve the Coca-Cola, and do good to please the Coca-Cola.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the Coca-Cola bottle could speak, it would say that this is nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It would say, "I was not made for this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I was made just to be filled up with Coca-Cola.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I don't know anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I know just one thing: to be filled up with Coca-Cola!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As long as I am empty, I am nothing!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I am filled up with Coca-Cola, that's wonderful!"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the same way, when we are filled up with God, that is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are God-bottles who were made to be filled up with God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not care for being either humble or proud.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I care just for one thing I have to be filled with God!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am a container of God!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To contain God is my destiny!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some may argue with me by saying that there are verses in the Bible which tell us that we have to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I agree with you, but what about Romans 9:21 and 23, which say that we are vessels unto honor and vessels of mercy unto glory?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What about 2 Corinthians 4:7, which says that we have this treasure in earthen vessels?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this chapter I am not emphasizing the fact that we are servants of God or children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I want to hear you declare, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am a vessel of the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am a vessel of God."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a vessel, do you need to bow down and worship?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to be filled with Christ because we are His vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As God-bottles, we need a God-receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is Spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since God is Spirit, we need a spirit to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only our spirit can receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only our spirit can touch the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only our spirit can contain the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, God created the heavens and the earth and then man with a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Proverbs 20:27 tells us that man's spirit is the lamp of Jehovah ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A lamp is a container.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It contains the oil that gives the light.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have a human spirit, and our human spirit is a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is the container of God as the oil to give the light.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Christian life is not a matter of outward doing but a matter of an inward containing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not a matter of how much we do, work, and act outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is a matter of how much oil we are containing today.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We do have a container within us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That is our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The human spirit is the lamp of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then Ezekiel tells us that in God's salvation the first thing God does is to renew our deadened spirit, to make our spirit a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He puts a new spirit within us and then following this He puts His own Spirit, that is, Himself, into our spirit 36:26-27a .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then the Bible says clearly, "The Lord be with your spirit" 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Who is the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He is the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Second Corinthians 4:7 says that we have this treasure in earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now we all can declare, "We have this treasure in our earthen vessel."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I am earthen yet I have the treasure because I have a spirit within me as a recipient to receive the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now He is here within me, and He is my treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You have to exercise your spirit to release your treasure, to share with others the treasure you have in your spirit.</S>
