   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR BEARING FRUIT EACH YEAR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE ENJOYMENT OF THE RICHES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF CHRIST S LIFE Scripture Reading: John 15:1-2, 5-6, 16; 21:15; 2 Cor 12:15 OUR NEED TO BE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>TRAINED IN THE MATTERS OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to be trained for our service and preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The book of Romans covers the proper Christian life and church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since everything in this Epistle is a matter of life, the gifts mentioned in chapter 12 are gifts of life, not the miraculous gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can illustrate the difference between life and gifts with our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eating, drinking, and breathing, for example, are not miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Unless we have an extreme problem, we do not depend on miracles for the care of our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Likewise, to be trained for the preaching of the gospel is not related to anything miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Balaam s donkey did not need training when it received a miraculous gift to speak in a human language Num 22:28 , but everything related to life requires training.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Children need training in every aspect of their life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A small child cannot miraculously begin to speak at the age of two months.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, day by day and word by word, a mother trains her child to speak properly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Children must also be trained to eat properly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From birth, children have the ability to eat, but even that ability in their physical life requires some training.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As Christians we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have the divine life, and with this life there are many abilities.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, we are not superstitious to believe that as long as we have the divine life we can do everything and know everything already.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, we need training in every aspect of our Christian life and even the more in the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>GENUINE GOSPEL PREACHING</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BEING FRUIT-BEARING AS THE OVERFLOW</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>OF THE RICHES OF THE INNER LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke all speak in plain words concerning gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Matthew 28:19 says, Go therefore and disciple all the nations, Mark 16:15 says, Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel, and Luke 24:47 says, That repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Gospel of John, however, there are no such plain words concerning the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, chapter 15 speaks of fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to John, the Gospel of life, preaching the gospel is a matter not of mere speaking or teaching but of bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Life is not a matter of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is a matter of growing and bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although we are in the Lord s recovery, even now we are not fully recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To some extent we are still abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only in our meetings but in every aspect of the Christian life and church life, we are still under the influence of old, traditional, degraded Christianity, and our gospel preaching is no exception.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Deep within us is a subconscious misunderstanding and wrong influence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We consider that to preach the gospel is simply to speak a certain doctrine to people and that those who were born with eloquence can be the good, effective preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a poor concept caused by a wrong influence.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Genuine gospel preaching is fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In John 15 the Lord used the illustration of the vine tree to show that we, the branches of the vine, must bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we do not understand what fruit-bearing is, we can learn of the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Branches are not good speakers, but they are good fruit-bearers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Bearing fruit does not depend upon our speaking or eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It depends upon the riches of the life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Fruit-bearing is the overflow of the riches of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are short of life within, we will have nothing with which to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Fruit-bearing is a matter not of speaking or eloquence; it is a matter of the rich flow of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>TO NOT BEAR FRUIT CAUSING US TO BE CUT OFF FROM THE ENJOYMENT OF THE LIFE OF THE VINE</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many of us do not have the sense that if we do not bring people to the Lord, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We eat in peace and sleep in peace, imagining that we are normal.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is according to the wrong concept that we received from our background.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we lose our temper with our spouse, we immediately feel that we are wrong and are under condemnation, but if we have not borne fruit for many years, we may have no condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may feel that whether we bear fruit does not matter, as long as we are not wrong in other things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, a branch that does not bear fruit for a long time is seriously wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In John 15:2 the Lord Jesus said, Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Father takes away the branches that do not bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This does not mean that the branches are lost.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Being saved or lost is not the thought of John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Rather, this chapter shows that when we enjoy the riches of the vine tree, we bear fruit as the overflow of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, to be taken away from the vine is to be set aside from the enjoyment of the riches of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not to be cut off from the salvation of Christ; it is to be cut off from the enjoyment of the riches of the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the reason that many brothers and sisters do not have much enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They are in the church life, and they come to the meetings, but they have little enjoyment of the riches of Christ s life simply because they do not bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The way for us to enjoy the riches of the life of Christ is to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The more we bear fruit, the more we need the life supply and the more the life supply will come into us to meet all our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you would tell me, I do not feel that I enjoy the Lord very much, I would reply, Go and bear fruit!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then the riches of Christ will rise up within you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Regardless of how much we seek the Lord, the spiritual principle is that if we do not bear fruit, we are cut off from the enjoyment of Christ, the supply and riches of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How much we enjoy the riches of the vine depends on how much fruit we bear.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We may compare this to a water hose on a faucet.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We do not wait until the water flows to turn on the faucet.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Rather, as soon as we turn it on, the water comes.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If the vine tree does not afford us a supply, it is because we have turned off the faucet.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>To turn off the supply in this way is the Father s cutting off of the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Father does not cut the branches off of the vine in order to condemn them to hell, as some teach.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Again I say, John 15 is not about being saved or being lost.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Instead, it shows that we are all branches of the vine with the supply of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, we need to absorb the life-juice of the vine tree so that we may have the rich flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, in order to have the rich flow of life, we need to open our being, let the life flow out of us, and bear fruit.</S>
