<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Subject to One Another<br>in the Fear of Christ</H2><P>To keep a pleasant, good, and beautiful order in the recovery, we need to be subject to one another in the fear of Christ (Eph. 5:21). Not only should the younger ones be subject to the older ones, but also the older ones should be subject to the younger ones (1 Pet. 5:5). The elders should not be a special class in the church. Peter charges them not to lord it over the church (v. 3). On the other hand, the saints should respect the elders. The younger ones should respect the older ones, and the older ones should also respect the younger ones. The wives should respect the husbands, and the husbands should also respect the wives. Our subjection with respect is a mutual thing.</P><P>Not being subject to one another offends Christ as the Head. Actually, not being subject to one another is rebellion against the Head. This means that we have no fear of Christ in His headship. Paul tells us that we need to be subject to one another in the fear of Christ, who is the Head. Only the Head is superior. Only the Head should be unique and different from the Body. None of the members, even the apostle Paul, is in a special or super class.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Subject to One Another<br>Being the Way to Keep the One Accord</H2><P>Being subject to one another is the way to keep the one accord (Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24; 5:12; 15:25; Rom. 15:6). Even if your way is better, you should still take the other brother's way. Otherwise, there will be no one accord. If you are going to a place which has previously been under the work of some other co-workers, you should find out what has been taught by them. Then you should go along with them. If you do not care for what they have taught or done in the past and teach according to your preference, you will make trouble. We should always try to maintain a good, beautiful, nice, and pleasant order among us.</P><P>In February 1986 when I spoke concerning the one accord, I said that if some did not choose to take the God-ordained way, they should not criticize or oppose it. Otherwise, they would cause division. Thank the Lord that the church in Taipei has been fully turned to the God-ordained way. This turn was made after seven years of labor and ministry. When I returned to Taipei in 1984, we did not change the way to have the church meetings until more than three years later. Then we realized that the time was right to change from the way of one man speaking and the rest listening. We began to have a prophesying meeting, in which every attendant has equal opportunity to speak for the Lord. Thank the Lord that the majority of the saints in Taipei accepted this God-ordained way.</P>
