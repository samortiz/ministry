<h2 class="head2">The Law of the Spirit of Life</h2>
<p>Romans 8:2 says that the law of the Spirit of life has freed us in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death. The only thing we have to do for the law of the Spirit of life within us to operate is to &ldquo;switch it on&rdquo; in much the same way that we would switch on a light. Have we not been saved? Is not the Spirit within us? Why then would we not be simple enough just to &ldquo;switch on&rdquo; the law of the Spirit of life within us? With a lamp there is the current of electricity. In order to appropriate that current and cause the lamp to shine, there is no need for us to do anything beyond simply switching on the lamp. It is the same with the law of the Spirit of life. There is nothing for us to do except &ldquo;switch it on&rdquo; and never &ldquo;switch it off.&rdquo; If we are going to visit a brother, we need to learn to tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I praise You that You are within my spirit. That is good enough. Now I am going to visit my brother. I know that Your presence goes with me.&rdquo; Then as we talk with the brother, the Lord will be with us, and we will talk, fellowship, and act in the mingled spirit.</p>
<p>The law of the Spirit of life within us is very powerful. We can illustrate this with the law of gravity. When we throw something into the air, it comes down naturally because of the law of gravity. There is no need for us to struggle to bring down an object that we have thrown upward; the law of gravity will bring it down for us. The law of gravity is so powerful that an airplane needs much power to overcome it. If the law of gravity is strong, how much stronger must the law of the Spirit of life be? The law of the Spirit of life sets us free from the law of sin. Although the law of sin is strong, the law of the Spirit of life is more powerful. If we simply follow the Lord and go along with Him, the law of the Spirit of life will work powerfully for us. All we must do is &ldquo;switch it on.&rdquo; Whatever we need, whether humility or love, the almighty, omnipotent Christ will supply us. If we live in this reality, our Christian life will be very simple. It is possible for us to be a powerful Christian. The most powerful Christian is the simplest one. The most complicated Christian, however, is the weakest. Make yourself simple by &ldquo;switching on&rdquo; the law of the Spirit of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Mind of the Spirit</h2>
<p>Romans 8:27 speaks of the &ldquo;mind of the Spirit.&rdquo; When we align ourselves with the Holy Spirit, our mind is filled up by the Spirit and controlled by the Spirit. As a result, our mind will become a mind of the Spirit. However, sometimes our mind is not a mind of the Spirit but is instead a mind of trying to do good&mdash;a &ldquo;mind of love&rdquo; or a &ldquo;mind of humility.&rdquo; With such a mind, we try our best to do good, to love others, and to be humble. Instead of having such a mind, however, our mind must be a mind of the Spirit. Nothing but the Spirit should control and direct our mind. Our mind must be under the control, the direction, of the Holy Spirit. This results in our mind becoming the mind of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Romans 8:6 says that the mind set on the spirit is life and peace. When our mind is occupied by and filled with the Holy Spirit, life and peace fills our entire being. Within, we will sense that there is life and that everything is living, satisfying, and full of light. Moreover, there will be peace, comfort, and joy. When our mind is occupied, directed, and controlled by the Spirit, we will experience and sense the reality of life and peace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Leading of the Spirit</h2>
<p>Romans 8:14 says, &ldquo;For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.&rdquo; We need to be led by the Holy Spirit. Rather than making any kind of decision to do this or that, we should simply sense the Spirit&rsquo;s leading and follow the Spirit as He leads us from within.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Witnessing of the Spirit</h2>
<p>Romans 8:16 speaks of the Spirit witnessing with our spirit. It is not only that the Spirit witnesses and our spirit witnesses also. Rather, it is that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. This indicates that our spirit must take the initiative to witness first; then the Spirit will witness with our spirit. The fact that the word <em>our</em> is used in reference to the human spirit reveals that the Spirit of God today, the all-inclusive Spirit of the Triune God, dwells in our regenerated human spirit and works in our spirit. These two spirits are one; they live together, work together, and exist together as one mingled spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Help of the Spirit</h2>
<p>Romans 8:26 says, &ldquo;Moreover, in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness, for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.&rdquo; We may not know how to pray, but the Holy Spirit knows. Because He knows, He helps us pray. What we say when we pray out of our own knowledge cannot come close to matching what we utter when the Holy Spirit prays within us. When the Holy Spirit prays within us, He intercedes with unutterable groanings within our being. Such prayer has no words; it is only groaning. This is the best prayer.</p>
<p>We see that there are a number of things related to the Spirit in Romans 8. There is the law of the Spirit of life, the mind of the Spirit, the leading of the Spirit, the witnessing of the Spirit, and the help of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, causes these things to operate within us day by day. However, we must give Him the opportunity, the chance, and the ground to operate in such a way. If we try to keep the law and do good, the Holy Spirit will be disturbed by us, and we will interfere in His conformation work within our being. Hence, we have to cease all our doings, forget about the law, and simply give the ground, the liberty, the chance, and the opportunity to the Holy Spirit to let Him work in us and take care of us. Then we will sense the life and the peace.</p>
