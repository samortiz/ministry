   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. A Special Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second factor of a denomination is a special fellowship based upon a special teaching in a realm narrower than that of "the fellowship of the apostles" Acts 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship of the entire Body universally, covering all kinds of genuine believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 14 tells us that we must receive different kinds of genuine believers, regardless of what days they observe or what dietary regulations they keep.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whether they eat herbs or eat meat, they are genuine believers because they believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, we must receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>C. A Special Name</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The third factor of a denomination is a special name, either according to a special teaching or according to a particular practice, that designates a certain group of believers who are of the same teaching or the same practice.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The taking of such a name denominates a particular sect, making it a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>D. Any of the Three Factors</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Being Adequate to Make a Division</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Any of the above-mentioned three factors is adequate to divide the believers from others who are different from them in teaching or in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, although we should practice things such as baptism by immersion, the presbytery, and head covering, we should not make these things a special item that divides us from others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, we should not make them our creed, and we should not designate ourselves by a name, such as Lutheran, Baptist, or Presbyterian, that is according to a particular teaching or practice.</S>
