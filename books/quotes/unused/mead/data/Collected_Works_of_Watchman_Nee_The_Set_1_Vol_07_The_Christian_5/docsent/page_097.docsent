   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOTES FROM MY BIBLE 3 Issue No. 9 MATTHEW 28</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 5:"And the angel answered and said to the women, Do not be afraid, for I know that you are seeking Jesus, the crucified."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was not talking to the "shaking" Roman soldiers v. 4 . The Lord cares for His children!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>MARK 7</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 7:"But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is good to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if a person adds anything to God's commandment, it is vain even to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 29:"And He said to her, Because of this word, go.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The demon has gone out of your daughter."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, even if You try me in the most severe way and do not fulfill my wishes, but cause me to suffer in my heart and soul, may You grant me enough strength to say, "Lord, You are right!"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Humility and hope were the reason the woman was blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 32:"And they brought to Him one who was deaf and who spoke with difficulty, and they entreated Him to lay His hand on him."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A deaf person cannot hear God's commandments, whereas one who speaks with difficulty cannot communicate God's message.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most believers who are deaf have difficulty with speaking also.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The reason believers have difficulty speaking is that they are deaf.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Believers either have both or have none.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The people wanted the Lord Jesus to lay His hand on them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But He did not act according to their instructions, because He knows what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should know that our Lord is not under our direction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Oh, how often we direct the Lord in our prayers, rather than being directed by Him!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 33:"And He took him aside from the crowd privately and put His fingers into his ears, and He spat and touched his tongue."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Aside from the crowd" this was the first step the Lord took in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we want the Lord to heal our ears and tongue, He has to lead us aside from the crowd to meet Him face to face in solitude.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May the Lord's hand and His spittle heal us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>MARK 14</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verses 10-11:"And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went off to the chief priests to deliver Him up to them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And when they heard this, they rejoiced and promised to give him money.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And he sought a way to deliver Him up opportunely."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 10 implies a resolution in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But before the exercise of the will, there was first the exercise of the mind John 12:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The sequence of the devil's work of temptation is as follows: 1 First there is a thought in the mind vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>4-5 , 2 then the will agrees with the thought Mark 14:10 , 3 then the mind schemes to carry out what the will has resolved to do v. 11 , and 4 finally there is the actual carrying out 14:43 . These are the steps with which Satan tempts man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, we have to oppose him as soon as the thoughts come.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 31:"But he went on speaking more intensely, Even if I must die with You, I will by no means deny You!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And they all said similarly."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How safe it is to believe in the Lord's word and His enlightening!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although we trust so much in ourselves, the Lord is more trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Peter trusted in himself, whereas Christ trusted in the word v. 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is difficult to stand against one's own feeling to believe in God, yet it is more difficult to escape from the crisis that results from not believing in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verses 47, 50:"But a certain one of those standing by drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest, and took off his ear."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"And they all left Him and fled."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was because of the lack of watching and praying that there was such a blunder.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>MARK 16</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verses 3-4:"And they said to one another, Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away, for it was extremely large."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not be anxious for the things that are not yet here.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the things happen, the Lord will take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 6:"And he said to them, Do not be alarmed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are seeking Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He has been raised; He is not here.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Behold the place where they laid Him."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is a similar word in 15:47.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The phrase "saw where He was laid" in 15:47 proves that He was dead.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The phrase "Behold the place where they laid Him" 16:6 proves that He has resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord's burial, in retrospect, proves His death, and, in looking forward, proves His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The empty tomb is the evidence of His resurrection.</S>
