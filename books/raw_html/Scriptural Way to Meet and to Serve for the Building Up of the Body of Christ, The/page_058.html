 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">LEARNING TO TEACH OTHERS<br />
TO SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 5:13; 2 Tim. 3:15-17; Col. 3:16; Eph. 5:19; 1 Thes. 5:20; 1 Tim. 6:3; Acts 2:42</h1>
<p>In chapter sixteen, we saw that we need to be those who exercise to speak the word of the Lord with the Spirit. Not only must we ourselves speak the word of the Lord, but we also must teach others to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word. We do not have the habit of teaching others to speak the word of the Lord. If we are going to teach others something, we ourselves have to practice what we are going to teach. Because we do not adequately practice speaking the Lord&rsquo;s word, we do not have the habit of teaching others to do so.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO INCREASE THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE<br />
OF THE WORD OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>If we desire to teach others to speak the word of the Lord, we must do one basic thing, that is, we must increase our knowledge and experience of the word. Hebrews 5:13 says, &ldquo;For everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe.&rdquo; Babes are only capable of drinking milk, and they cannot take solid food. Verse 14 tells us that &ldquo;solid food is for the mature.&rdquo; The solid food in this verse refers to the word of righteousness mentioned in verse 13. The book of Hebrews also mentions &ldquo;the good word of God&rdquo; (6:5), which is the milk the Hebrew believers tasted when they believed in the Lord. The good word is the word of God&rsquo;s grace (Acts 14:3; 20:32) for our salvation. The word of righteousness is much deeper than the good word of God because it embodies the deeper thought of God&rsquo;s justice and righteousness in His dispensational and governmental dealings with His people. The good word, the word of grace, has been spoken much, but the word of righteousness which concerns God&rsquo;s dispensational and governmental dealings with His children is not understood by many Christians. We have to pick up a burden to practice the good word of God, that is, the word of grace for salvation, and we also have to practice the word of God&rsquo;s righteousness which is for God&rsquo;s dispensational and governmental dealings with us.</p>
<p>The more we increase not only our knowledge but also our experience of the word, the more we will be equipped to perfect others. Then when we go to take care of the new ones in the home meetings, we will have the rich materials in our being to use. When we go to a home meeting, we do not know what particular word will be needed. We must be like a pharmacy with many types of medicine stored within us. When we visit a home, we may not know what particular medicine the patient is in need of today. The many different kinds of people who are saved by the Lord through our gospel preaching will need help to begin their home meetings. This is why we need many different categories of the word stored in our being. This will enable us to open up our mouth and utter something to meet the particular need.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Based on the Scriptures</h2>
<p>We all have to gain an increase and an accumulation of the knowledge and experience of the word based on the Scriptures (2 Tim. 3:15-17; Col. 3:16a). To gain such an accumulation we surely need to study the Bible. In 2 Timothy 3:15-17 Paul pointed out to Timothy that he had gained a good foundation in the knowledge of the holy Scriptures from his childhood. Then he told Timothy what the Scriptures can do for the man of God. The Scriptures enable the man of God to &ldquo;be complete, fully equipped for every good work&rdquo; (v. 17).</p>
<p>I must charge you not only to pick up two verses daily but also to study the Bible daily. These two verses are to stir up your spirit for your daily life, but we still need to study the Bible. At least we should read the New Testament once a year. Furthermore, when we study the New Testament, we should not study it according to our preference. We should study according to the sequence of the books beginning with Matthew.</p>
<p>When I was young, I loved the Bible, but in my reading of the Bible I wanted to skip over the first seventeen verses of Matthew regarding the genealogy of Christ. At a certain point, I realized that there were many riches in these seventeen verses, so I began to study them. Based upon my study of these verses, I wrote <em>Gleanings from the Genealogy of Jesus Christ</em> in 1936. The content from this publication with some additional revelation is contained in the notes on these verses in the Recovery Version of Matthew. A number of seeking ones began to admire and appreciate the Recovery Version when they read these notes. This shows us that we should not despise any verse of the Bible.</p>
<p>Every verse of the Bible bears some particular significance. We must learn to study the New Testament according to its sequence. Do not merely select some of your favorite chapters to study. We need to study the Word to increase our knowledge of it, and we need to experience the word. We should not be inexperienced in the deeper word of God. A teacher must learn much more than what he needs for his teaching. In the public schools of the United States, a person must have a college degree to teach kindergarten.</p>
<p>Today we cannot see Christian groups practicing the proper Christian meeting according to what is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25. This is because many Christians would rather take the easy way. To endeavor to practice the meeting that is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 is a heavy burden. But if we take the grace, grace will bear the burden. We all need to experience the grace. We have to practice speaking, and then we have to learn to teach others to speak. For this we must increase our knowledge and experience of the word.</p>
