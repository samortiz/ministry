   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JAMES MESSAGE THIRTEEN A LIFE NOT FULLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACCORDING TO AND FOR</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY 1 Scripture Reading: James 1:1, 17-18, 21, 25; 2:2, 9-10; 3:13, 17; 4:4-5</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Gospel of Mark we see a life the life of the Lord Jesus that is fully according to and for God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By contrast, in the Epistle of James we see a life that is not fully according to and for God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message and in the message following we shall consider a number of points in the book of James that indicate a mixture of the New Testament economy with the Old Testament dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>James was a very godly man, and, humanly speaking, he was quite wise.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in instance after instance we see that James was occupied too much with Old Testament matters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No doubt, he was saturated, soaked, with the feeling, flavor, and atmosphere of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot find a strong indication with James that he passed through the Old Testament dispensation fully into the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Probably James had been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, according to his writings, I do not believe that he ever experienced a thorough termination and burial of himself along with all the things of the past, both good and bad,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>STILL KEEPING THE TWELVE TRIBES</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>OF THE OLD TESTAMENT DISPENSATION</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In his Epistle James still keeps the twelve tribes of the Old Testament dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is indicated by the way James begins this book: James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the dispersion 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fact that James addresses his Epistle to the twelve tribes in the dispersion may indicate the lack of a clear view concerning the distinction between Christians and Jews, between God s New Testament economy and the Old Testament dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>James may not have been clear that God in the New Testament has delivered and separated the Jewish believers in Christ from the Jewish nation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the expression twelve tribes in 1:1 is too old; it is something of the Old Testament dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to Paul s writings, the Jewish believers in Christ have been called by God out of the old dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the book of Galatians Paul even regards Judaism as the present evil age: Who gave Himself for our sins, that He might rescue us out of the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the context of the entire book of Galatians, the present evil age in Galatians 1:4 refers to the religious world, the religious course of the world, the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is confirmed by Galatians 6:14-15, where circumcision is considered a part of the world, the religious world, which is crucified to the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, Paul indicates in the book of Galatians that Christ gave Himself for our sins in order to rescue us out of the Jewish religious world, the present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The present evil age in Galatians 1:4 is equal to the perverse generation in Acts 2:40.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the day of Pentecost Peter told the people to be saved from this perverse generation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How, then, could such a godly person as James address his Epistle, which was written to Christian Jews, to the twelve tribes in the dispersion?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This certainly was contrary to God s New Testament economy.</S>
