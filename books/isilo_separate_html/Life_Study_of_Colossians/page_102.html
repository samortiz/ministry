In verse 4 he goes on to say, &ldquo;This I say that no one may delude you with persuasive speech.&rdquo; This indicates that at that time in Colosse the saints were being deluded through persuasive speech.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TRADITION OF MEN</h2><p>In verse 8 Paul says, &ldquo;Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.&rdquo; In this verse Paul gives us a serious warning about being carried off as prey through someone&rsquo;s philosophy and empty words. Such philosophy and empty deceit are according to the tradition of men.</p><p>Tradition is related to culture and has its source in culture. There can be no tradition apart from culture. Both religious people and philosophical ones are strong in their tradition. The more cultured we are, the more traditions we have. All peoples have their particular traditions. In ancient times the Jews had their traditions, and the Greeks had theirs. Furthermore, believers today have their Christian traditions, and we all have our individual traditions. The only way to have no tradition is to not have any culture. As long as we have some kind of culture, we shall have traditions. Some of our traditions may even be self-made and self-imposed. All traditions are according to man, for God does not have any traditions. Therefore, there are no traditions that are according to God.</p><p>In 2:8 the phrase &ldquo;according to the elements of the world&rdquo; is in apposition to &ldquo;according to the tradition of men.&rdquo; This indicates that the tradition of men and the elements of the world are identical. The world here refers not to the physical world, but to fallen mankind, the same as in John 3:16. The traditions are equal to the elements, and the men are equal to the world. Hence, the tradition of men is synonymous with the elements of the world.</p><p>In this verse Paul points out that philosophy and empty deceit are not according to Christ. The expression &ldquo;according to Christ&rdquo; is very important. It indicates that everything should be estimated and evaluated according to Christ. As we consider ourselves, our families, situations, and environment, we should evaluate them, not according to the tradition of men, but according to Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT INSISTING ON CERTAIN THINGS</h2><p>Verse 16 says, &ldquo;Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths.&rdquo; Here we see the matter of judgments and opinions. We make judgments because we insist on certain things. For example, if we insist on a certain way of eating, we shall make judgments according to what we insist on. On the other hand, we shall be judged by others because of it. If I insist that all the saints eat Cantonese food, I shall be judged by them. But if I do not insist on any particular kind of food, I shall not be criticized with respect to food. The same is true regarding drinking and the observing of days.</p><p>To say that we do not insist on anything means that we are neither religious nor philosophical. Those who are religious or philosophical always insist on certain things. Their insisting causes others to judge them and criticize them. Hence, if we are not to let others judge us, we ourselves should not insist on certain things.</p><p>In verse 17 Paul says that the items in the foregoing verse &ldquo;are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.&rdquo; We should not care for anything in place of Christ. If we care only for Christ, we shall not be judged.</p><p>Four times in chapter two Paul uses the words &ldquo;no one.&rdquo; In 2:4 he says that we should let no one delude us; in 2:8, that we should let no one carry us off as spoil; in 2:16, that we should let no one judge us; and, finally, in 2:18, that we should let no one purposely defraud us of our prize in humility and worship of the angels.</p><p>In verses 20 and 21 Paul asks us why we subject ourselves to ordinances about handling, tasting, and touching, since we have died with Christ from the elements of the world. In verse 22 we see that such ordinances are according to the commandments and teachings of men. We have pointed out that the elements of the world are man&rsquo;s traditions.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_101.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_103.html">Next</a> </body></html>
