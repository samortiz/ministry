   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE SIXTY-FOUR PROPHECY OF THE KINGDOM 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the section of the prophecy of the kingdom concerning the church covers two aspects: the aspect of being watchful and ready and the aspect of being faithful and prudent.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Watchfulness and readiness are related to our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all need to be watchful and ready for the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, a proper Christian should take care not only of the aspect of life, but also of the aspect of service.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For service, we need faithfulness and prudence.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, we need to be faithful toward the Lord and prudent toward our fellow believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we have seen, in chapter twenty-four both aspects are covered.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In life we need to be watchful and ready, and in service we need to be faithful and prudent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although both these aspects are covered in chapter twenty-four, they are not covered fully.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, in chapter twenty-five there is the need of a complementary word for each aspect covered in chapter twenty-four.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Matthew 25:1-30 completes the section in chapter twenty-four concerning the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The parable of the virgins 25:1-13 completes the matter of watchfulness and readiness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How to watch and be ready is revealed in the parable of the virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Matthew 25:13, the last verse of the parable of the virgins, says, Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This word, very similar to 24:42, indicates that 25:1-13 is a completion to 24:40-44 concerning watchfulness for rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matthew 24:32-44 is a section on watchfulness and readiness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Matthew 25:1-13 is also a section on watchfulness and readiness, the completion of the foregoing section.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the same principle, both 24:45-51 and 25:14-30 are sections on faithfulness and prudence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Matthew 25:30, which speaks of casting the useless slave into outer darkness, is parallel to 24:51.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that 25:14-30 is a completion to 24:45-51, which concerns faithfulness for the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Matthew 24:45-51 deals with the slave s unfaithfulness in fulfilling the Lord s commission.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Matthew 25:14-30 is still needed to deal with the slave s unfaithfulness in using the Lord s talent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although 24:45-51 tells us to be faithful and prudent, it does not show us how to be faithful and prudent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is revealed in the parable of the talents.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The way to be watchful is through the infilling of the Holy Spirit; it is by having the extra portion of oil.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By ourselves we can be neither watchful nor ready.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The only way to have the extra portion of oil is by the infilling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the way for us to be watchful and ready.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Likewise, the way to be faithful and prudent in the Lord s service is through the spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without the spiritual gifts, we do not have the ability to be faithful or prudent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our faithfulness and prudence depend upon the gifts we have received of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, in chapter twenty-five we have both the infilling of the Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit affords us the infilling for life and also the gifts for service.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It all depends upon the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How can we be watchful?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only by the infilling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And how can we be faithful?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only by the gifts of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One indication that the parables in chapter twenty-five are a completion of 24:32-51 is found in the numbers two and ten.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Matthew 25:1 says, Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Ten is the major part of twelve Gen 42:3-4; 1 Kings 11:30-31; Matt 20:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, these ten virgins represent the majority of the believers, who will have died before the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The two men or two women in 24:40-41 represent the remaining believers, who will be alive until the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The two men in the field or the two women grinding at the mill represent the living believers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, when the Lord s parousia comes, the majority of the believers will have died.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In chapter twenty-four we have the rapture of the living believers, but this chapter says nothing about the dead saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is covered by the parable of the virgins in 25:1-13.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The fact that the virgins became drowsy and slept v. 5 indicates that they died.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the eyes of the Lord, when a saint dies, he goes to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, the ten virgins, who all fell asleep, represent the dead saints.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the Bible God s people are of the number twelve, for this number represents the whole body of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Bible one way the number twelve is composed is of ten plus two.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Ten denotes the majority of twelve, and two signifies the remainder.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For example, two of the twelve apostles asked the Lord to let them sit on His right hand and on His left hand, whereas the other ten were indignant.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the Old Testament ten tribes rebelled against the house of David, whereas only two remained faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The principle is the same here in chapters twenty-four and twenty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In chapter twenty-four we have the two and in chapter twenty-five we have the ten.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the ten and the two are put together, we have the whole body of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At the time of the Lord s coming, the majority of the believers will have died.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only a small number, the remainder represented by the two men in the field or the two women grinding, will be alive.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, 25:1-13 is the completion of 24:40-41.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Another indication that chapter twenty-five is the completion of chapter twenty-four is found in the fact that one of the men and one of the women were taken and the other man and other woman were left.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Why was one taken and the other left?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The answer is not found in chapter twenty-four, but in chapter twenty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The reason one was taken was that he was filled with the Holy Spirit, and the reason the one was left was that he lacked the extra portion of oil.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Let us now consider the parable of the virgins, the parable for watchfulness, verse by verse.</S>
