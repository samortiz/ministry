   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION 2 Date: Morning, July 2, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Kuling</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother James Yen: If a man is depressed, discouraged, and bound, is it because his outward man is not broken?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How should such a person break through his condition?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Watchman Nee: Two things can happen when a man is depressed in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, when a man acts according to his outer man, he does not need to exercise his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As such, this will not be a time when he feels any depression in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He may feel a sense of depression in his spirit only when he comes to the meeting, prays, or reads the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is because there is a demand for being spiritual in doing such things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The underlying reason many people are depressed and bound in the meetings is that they are confronted with spiritual demands.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there is no spiritual demand, there will not be any spiritual pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, if we physically jog up Kuling Mountain, we will not feel any spiritual pressure, because there is no spiritual demand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This does not mean that the meetings or prayers or reading the Scriptures make a person oppressed in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The person must be oppressed and bound in his spirit beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a spiritual demand comes, this oppression is accentuated, and the person becomes conscious of his spiritual depression.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a man is spiritually depressed, it shows that there is something fundamentally wrong with his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a man is walking or going about his secular business, he does not have any spiritual need and he does not feel any spiritual pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He experiences spiritual pressure only when he is faced with spiritual demands.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is what happens in the majority of cases.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Second, in a few cases there are exceptional reasons for spiritual oppression.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes when most of the people are spiritually depressed in a meeting, the remaining ones can be affected by such depression.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A few members may become spiritually oppressed because of a satanic attack or other supernatural frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Their spiritual depression in the meeting can affect others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When a meeting is faced with this oppression, one individual is not enough to bring about a breakthrough; there is the need for concerted opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If one member in the meeting suffers the assault of oppressive forces within, those who are sensitive will sense death spreading in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With the first condition, there is the need of some fundamental dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a man is under oppression for too long, he will treat this as a normal experience, and he will not know what liberty in the spirit means.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>With the second kind of pressure, the remedy is to exercise the spirit to throw off this oppression.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sometimes it takes three or five persons to break through in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who are sensitive in their spirit can react to this opposition in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They can recoil in their spirit, or they can push away this oppression with their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Su: What does it mean to be enlightened?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Watchman Nee: Ephesians 5 is the only place in the Bible that defines light.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to that chapter, light is "everything that makes manifest" v. 13 . The word revelation in Greek is apokalupsis.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Apo is to open, and kalupsis is a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, revelation simply means the removal of a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Light is related to revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be enlightened means to receive a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once light comes, revelation comes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Revelation is determined by the amount of light received.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's revelation is what we receive through His light; it is the effect of this light in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When light comes from God and reaches us, we have revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The end result of light is revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Light of life is one of many kinds of light from God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It emanates from the Lord's life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When sin is present in the church, there is no speaking, no prophets, and no light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the Lord shows us the light, however, we will have sight and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Without revelation, we will not see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When God gathers His people together and speaks to them, this speaking constitutes light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we see the light, we must fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It does not matter how we fall.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not have to be that clear; there is no need to know whether we are falling forward, backward, to the left, or to the right.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The sunlight finds us; we do not search for it with our lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once a man sees light, he will have revelation, and that is all that counts.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He will only need to praise; he will not need to plead for light.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is God's responsibility to give us the light.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we have a word from the Lord, we have light, and when light comes, we see, and that is all that counts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we do not have light, we need light, and when light comes, we only need to open our eyes wide.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once we see the light, we just need to thank and praise Him; there is no further need to search for light.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As soon as light comes, revelation follows.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many times we suffer much because we try to search for the light.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If a man does not fall before God in the face of light, but instead looks for more light, he will lose what little light he has.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If a man does not obey the light that he has received from God, but insists on asking for more, he will lose the light he has received.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Enlightening is God's concern, while revelation is the enlightenment we receive in our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once light comes, it kills.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Light is the greatest destroying factor.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Once light comes, we fall and wilt; there is nothing we can hide under the light.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many harmful organisms in this world are killed by light.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Under the light of the sun, everything is manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Confusion comes when we try to look for sunlight with a lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have to set our eyes on the greater things, not be confined by the dimmer lights.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God's light is found in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Today the Holy of Holies is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Personal pursuits can easily lead to darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A man cannot get any light from analysis or mere supplication.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He cannot find God through introspection.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God's light is found only in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>All is well when the church has prophets and divine speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When these things are present in the church, everyone will receive light from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is disastrous when the church does not have any speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When a church has the divine speaking, it has light.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We like to see men being exposed, being brought to light, and receiving revelation once they step into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Light comes from the ministry of the word, and the ministry of the word functions within the church.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Light is found in the church, not in individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We have to receive light from God's word before we can serve others with this light.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Brother Chow: What is required in the ministry?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Watchman Nee: Our job is not just to be preachers, but to be apprentices.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We must learn the lessons ourselves before we can lead others to the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Perhaps our capacity should be eighty pounds of weight, yet we can only carry one or two ounces.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We have to receive much from the Lord before we can be constituted with the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Unless we meet this demand what can we give to the Lord or to others?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Peter said that we should not think that the fiery ordeal among us, coming to us for a trial, is anything strange 1 Pet 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We should not be surprised by any experience we encounter.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The more trouble we encounter, the more we are equipped to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The more experience we have, the more we can meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The trials that we suffer equip us for the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We have to allow many troubles to come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We should refuse to pass on any message that is merely doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We must speak what we have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If a man rejects all the little dealings that come his way, he is disqualified from serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We must learn the lessons ourselves before we can teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We must learn before we can give, before we can lead.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>A disciple means an apprentice.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Christ's salvation is not a philosophy, doctrine, teaching, or ideal.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>What we speak must be what we have learned.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Many people may think that this is too difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>It is not too late for us to change our profession, but if we want to take this way, we have to learn the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>It is not enough to pick up doctrines, teachings, and dogmas.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Doctrines are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We must go through many experiences ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We can only be useful after we have been thoroughly dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>What then is required of the ministry?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>It requires that we learn and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The amount of ministry depends on the amount of experience we have.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The standard of ministry is determined by the standard of our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This is the reason we have to be "violent"; we have to be willing to take the dealings, and we have to endeavor to pursue.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If a man is entangled by small things, he will become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Therefore, we should never be mindful of small gains and losses.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We have to develop a greater capacity, a greater view.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The Lord has to deal with us in a thorough way before we can arrive at a rich ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We should not settle for a poor ministry; we should strive for a great ministry, a rich ministry.</S>
