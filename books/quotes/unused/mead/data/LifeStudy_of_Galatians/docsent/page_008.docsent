   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LIVING PERSON OF THE SON OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The crucial point in this message is that this living Person, God s Son, is versus man s religion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This was true at the time of Saul of Tarsus, it has been true throughout the centuries, and it is true today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead of focusing his attention on this living Person, man has a natural tendency to direct his attention to religion with its tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But from Genesis 1 through Revelation 22 the Bible reveals a living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God cares only for this living Person, not for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The record of the experience of the disciples with the Lord Jesus on the mount of transfiguration illustrates this Matt 17:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After bringing Peter, James, and John up into a high mountain apart, the Lord Jesus was transfigured before them, and His face shone as the sun, and His garments became white as the light Matt 17:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Along with the other two disciples, Peter saw the Lord s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He also saw Moses and Elijah speaking with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although it is doubtful that Moses and Elijah were in glory, they nonetheless were speaking with the glorified Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to Matthew 17:4, Peter said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make three tabernacles here, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In making this suggestion, Peter was elevating Moses and Elijah to the same level as that of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was heir of the centuries-old tradition concerning Moses, who represented the law, and Elijah, who represented the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To the Jews, Moses and Elijah were the representatives of the entire Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, even on the mount of transfiguration, Peter was zealous for the traditions regarding Moses and Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But while Peter was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, in Whom I delight; hear Him!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Matt 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moses and Elijah then disappeared from the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the disciples lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that in the eyes of God there is no place for religion or tradition only the living Person of His Son has a place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>TREASURING TRADITIONS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>IN PLACE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man has a natural tendency to appreciate traditional things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How people treasure their traditions!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, the Seventh-Day Adventists treasure the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They fondly cling to the tradition of the seventh-day Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But according to Colossians 2:16, the Sabbath is a shadow of which the reality, the body, is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now that Christ has come, we should turn from the shadow to the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, like the Jews of old, today s Seventh-Day Adventists treasure the shadow and neglect Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is our day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is not only our real Sabbath, but the reality of every day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How foolish to treasure the seventh-day Sabbath when we can enjoy Christ as our real Sabbath and as the reality of every day!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some Christians treasure certain things that are far more ridiculous than this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Have you heard that some preachers are occupied with the lengthening of legs?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Where is Christ in such a practice?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who specialize in the lengthening of legs should call themselves leg-lengtheners, not ministers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To associate the lengthening of legs with the name of Christ is to use His name in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today millions of Christians are occupied with miracles, healing, prophecy, speaking in tongues, the so-called manifestation of gifts, and head covering, but few are occupied with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What a pitiful situation!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For seven and a half years, I was with a very strict Brethren assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>During my time with them, I heard a good number of messages on the books of Daniel and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In these messages a great deal was said about beasts, horns, toes, and certain periods of days.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As a young man zealous for knowledge, I was somewhat satisfied by that kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But although I heard many messages about different aspects of prophecy, I did not hear very much concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Actually the book of Revelation is not focused on beasts, toes, and horns; it is focused on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This book is a revelation of the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even the book of Daniel reveals Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nevertheless, the messages given in that Brethren assembly were by no means centered on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you attend the so-called Sunday morning services in today s Christianity or go to Bible studies held by Christian teachers, you will hear about many things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But rarely will you hear a message in which Christ is unveiled and ministered to the Lord s people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This indicates that today, as it has been for centuries, religious people are zealous for religious things and for traditions, but not for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A great many Christians care for religion and traditions, but they do not care for the living Person of Christ.</S>
