   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE TURMOIL AND THE COMFORT PRACTICING THE GENERALITY OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord s recovery came to us through Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Throughout the years we have learned that we should not try to unify the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the beginning of the Lord s recovery in the United States in Elden Hall, Pentecostal people sometimes came among us and spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The leading ones looked to me to do something, but I told them not to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I said that since they are Pentecostal, let them be Pentecostal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If they like to speak in tongues, let them speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is what we mean when we say we need to practice the generality of the church life, as I shared in the book entitled The Speciality, Generality, and Practicality of the Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The messages in that book were given in the summer of 1971.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because we are not denominational, but general, the brothers who come into the Lord s recovery have the liberty to practice what they want.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do not have the control.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every denomination has their particular creed and belief.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Based upon their creed and belief, they control people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Among us there is nothing like this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our trust is in the Lord as the Spirit and the life within the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Throughout the years we have given many messages on the Lord as the Spirit living in us that we may enjoy His life to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The apostle Paul was very general in his practice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was general to such an extent that he was even convinced by James to go to the temple to help people consummate the Nazarite vow Acts 21:18-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On this occasion Paul went too far, so the Lord came in to cause a big tumult to stop him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord would not tolerate his participating in a strict Judaic practice such as the Nazarite vow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord stopped him in order to keep the truth of the gospel clear to the coming generations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, this does show that Paul was a person who would be so general in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have been speaking in the church for sixty-one years, since 1932.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Throughout these years I have passed through many things, so the events of the recent turmoil among us were not a new experience to me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such rebellion and opposition have been repeated throughout the New Testament and throughout our history.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul was condemned of cheating others 2 Cor 12:16 ; the Lord Jesus was cheated; and we have been cheated and falsely condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But we still have to practice the generality, and we do not want to do anything to control anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul did not try to control things and neither do we.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>BEING SIMPLE AND SINGLE IN THE MIDST OF TURMOIL</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever there has been a turmoil, we have learned to be simple by staying with the tree of life and staying away from anything related to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The general teaching in Christianity is that if you are going to be a preacher, you need to know the people to whom you are preaching, but our practice is different from this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes before going out to a certain place, the co-workers asked me what they should do and what I knew about the people there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I told them that if they had the burden from the Lord and felt led of the Lord, they should go and speak what the Lord leads them to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They should not try to know anything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is better not to know things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have learned that it is best to be simple, single, and uncomplicated, staying away from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The recent turmoil rose up mainly to put me down.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Certain ones decided not only to put me down but also to put me out.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now they are endeavoring to preach their kind of doctrine to accomplish this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They did much in this turmoil, but I did not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From the beginning Brother Nee and I have learned the lesson not to take care of these negative things.</S>
