   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Disregarding Christ as the Embodiment of the Triune God, Ordained by God to Be the Centrality and Universality of His Economy</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Jewish religion missed Christ and also disregarded Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible, there are many prophecies and types concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Jews missed all these prophecies and types because they regarded only the law and disregarded Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Outside of Christ and without Him, we do not have the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Jews think that they are worshipping God, Elohim, Jehovah, but they do not realize that Jehovah Elohim is embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The entire Triune God is in Christ, so outside of Christ we cannot find God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is God's address.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is God's home.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you want God, yet do not want Christ, you cannot have God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Jews also were the ones who desired to crucify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They shouted again and again, "Crucify Him!" and their voice won Mark 15:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They did not realize that this Christ as the embodiment of God was ordained by God to be the centrality and universality of His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you disregard Him, you disregard everything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ was typified by the tabernacle, the priesthood, and the offerings in the five books of the Law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God put something very substantial in the Torah.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These substantial things were the tabernacle and the corporate priesthood daily serving God in the tabernacle with all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Jews took these things formally.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They never understood what these things signified.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They did not realize that the tabernacle is a type of Christ John 1:14 to be God's dwelling place for God's people to contact God, to enter into God, and to enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Jewish people sinned, they knew that the law ordered them to offer a trespass offering, but they did not realize that this offering was a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They had the substantial types, but they did not understand their significance, so they spontaneously disregarded Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord's word in Luke 24:44 shows that He was prophesied in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Genesis 3:15 God promised that the seed of the woman would come to bruise the head of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That was a clear prophecy about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then God prophesied to Abraham that all the nations would be blessed through his seed, and that seed is Christ Gen 22:18; Gal 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Isaiah says clearly that a virgin shall bring forth a child whose name is called Immanuel Isa 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That child is God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was a clear prophecy concerning Christ, but the Jews disregarded it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Jews had the Old Testament, but they did not care for the prophecies concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>C. Becoming Formal in Letter, Deadening in Quenching the Spirit, Killing in Man's Communication with God in Life, and Contending with the Gospel of Christ in God's New Testament Economy</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Judaism became formal in letter and deadening in quenching the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Jewish religion kills man's communication with God in life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Judaism also contended with the gospel of Christ in God's New Testament economy 2 Cor 3:6; Gal 1:6-16; Phil 3:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Under the maneuvering hand of Satan, those in Judaism opposed the Lord Jesus Matt 12:9-14; Luke 4:28-29; John 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They also opposed the apostle Paul Acts 13:45-46, 50; 14:1-2, 19; 17:1, 5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Acts 21 tells us that the Jews from Asia saw him in the temple in Jerusalem and seized him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As they were seeking to kill him, the Roman commander stopped them and took Paul into custody vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>27-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Later, more than forty of the Jews formed a plot and put themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul 23:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, he was transferred from Palestine to Rome to be judged directly by Caesar 25:9-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was the way that the Jews persecuted Paul, the Lord's servant.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, we can see that they disregarded Christ, annulled all the spiritual things, and contended against the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>D. To Overcome Such a Satanic Religion by Holding to the Teaching of the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The way to overcome such a satanic religion is by holding to the teaching of the apostles the New Testament through the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit 2 Tim 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our "Torah" today is the New Testament, the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to hold to this teaching through the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
