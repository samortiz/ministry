We, as the many members, have all been baptized in one Spirit into one Body, and now we are all drinking of this one Spirit
Christianity has missed the mark because it does not care at all for the Body, nor does it care for the Spirit in the proper way
Many of those who would tell others that they are too religious are not clear themselves regarding what religion is
Religion is something related to God and to the service and worship of God, yet having nothing to do with God the Spirit
Although a certain thing related to God may be very good, it is religion as long as it is not related to the Spirit
If you pray to the Lord without praying in the Spirit, your prayer has nothing to do with the Spirit and hence is something of religion
At the beginning of Acts, the one hundred twenty did not form anything, start anything, initiate anything, or intend to do anything
From that time onward, whatever they did, whatever they said, and wherever they went was utterly a matter in the Spirit
Where Philip, an evangelist, was to go did not depend on his decision; instead, it depended upon the leading of the Spirit
The Spirit led Philip to preach the gospel to the eunuch, and it was the Spirit who caught Philip away after he had preached to him
All of us, especially the young people, must be impressed that in the Spirit there is no such thing as a movement
The Spirit must take the lead, the Spirit must do the work, the Spirit must do the speaking, and the Spirit must even do our living
We, the people in the church, must be those absolutely saturated with the Spirit and absolutely one with the Spirit
If so, then whatever we say is the Spirit's speaking, whatever we do is the Spirit's doing, and whatever work we do is the Spirit's working
In the whole book of Acts there was, strictly speaking, just one conference, and that took place in Acts chapter fifteen
Whenever we have a conference, we must have the assurance that whatever we decide is the decision of the Spirit
At the time of the Acts, Peter, Paul, and the other apostles were not qualified by themselves to make decisions or give instructions
Every one of us, from the leaders to the least among us, must be brought into the presence of the Lord to contact Him
By this we see that the apostles walked and worked not according to their own decisions, but only according to the Lord's leading
The tragedy of today's Christianity is that so many do not have the Lord's presence and do not care for the leading of the Lord
Perhaps after a year you will regret that you followed the so-called flow, for you never had any assurance from the Lord
If you move to a place without prayer and fellowship, you will be shaken when the tests, afflictions, and persecutions come
If you pray and fellowship, you honor the Lord, and you will also have the assurance that it is the Lord who is leading you
You will be so assured that your being there is the Lord's will and leading that you will be ready to die there
The older ones need the fellowship of the younger ones, and the younger ones even the more need the fellowship of the older ones
Counting only those who are seniors in college or who have recently graduated, the number of serving young people is over one thousand
They respect the older ones, and the older ones love them, pray for them, stand with them, support them, and sustain them
We love all believers in Christ, including those in the Catholic Church and in all the denominations and free groups
We all need to pray earnestly for the Lords recovery we need to pray earnestly that we would be kept in the Spirit and in the unique oneness
In this message we shall consider a number of crucial verses pertaining to the Spirit and to our experience of the Spirit
In His reply to her, the Lord Jesus said, 'God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality'
When we worshipped God in the past, according to our concept, we worshipped One who was great and mighty or One who was in the heavens
The Samaritan woman discovered that God was different from her concept of Him for God is Spirit and He is also a drink to satisfy our thirst
The proper worship of God is not to bow down before Him; it is to drink Him as the living water and to breathe Him as the living air
In other words, we must receive Him into us, not only drinking Him as the water, but also breathing Him in as the living air
Although we may live for many days without eating, we can go only a few days without drinking and only several minutes without breathing
Although you may be familiar with all these verses, my burden is that you daily and hourly experience drinking of the Lord
Matthew 2819 says Go therefore and disciple all the nations baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
In other words, to baptize believers into the name of the Triune God is to place them into the flow of the Triune God
Before someone believes in the Lord, he has nothing to do with the Triune God; he has nothing to do with the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
After a person believes in the Lord, we must exercise our faith to place him into the very reality of the Triune God
Today the reality of the Triune God is the flow of the Spirit with the course of the Son and the source of the Father
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all'
Far, we have covered two aspects of the Spirit: that God is Spirit and that the Triune God issues in the Spirit
As the Lamb of God the last Adam accomplished these two things on the cross taking away our sins and dealing with our self and natural life
When we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him as our Redeemer, it was the life-giving Spirit who came into us
Many believers do not realize that they received the Lord Jesus not only as the Redeemer and the Savior, but also as the life-giving Spirit
Although we received Him as our Redeemer, He came into us not only as our Redeemer, but also as the life-giving Spirit
If you ask believers where their Redeemer, the Lord Jesus, is, many lift up their eyes, point to heaven, and say, 'He is in heaven'
Rarely do you find a Christian who, when asked where the Lord Jesus is, will say with rejoicing, 'Christ is in me'!
Whenever we come to the Bible, we should not simply take in the letters by exercising our mind to understand what is written
Ephesians 6:17 says, 'And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God'
Although you may not have the intention to kill your hatred the living word that enters into you kills your hatred as you prayread the Word
The word of God has three main functions: the nourishing function, the killing function, and the furnishing function
We should not merely read and study the Scriptures with our mind; we must also exercise our spirit to contact the living word
If we do this, we shall receive the nourishment, experience the killing power, and be equipped with the divine elements
It is by this Spirit in the Word that we are supplied with the nourishment the killing power and the equipping with all the divine elements
Through that chapter my eyes were opened to see why the Spirit was not yet there when the Lord Jesus was speaking
After the resurrection of Christ, the Spirit of God was composed not only of divinity, but of many other crucial items as well
If you read the Old Testament carefully, you will see that several times olive oil is used to indicate the Spirit of God
A hin of olive oil is the basic element of this compound, and four spices are added to it: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia
When these spices are added to the oil, the oil becomes an ointment, a compound of five elements, the oil plus the four spices
In this compound ointment we have God signified by the number one and God's creatures signified by the number four
These three complete units of five hundred shekels signify the Triune God, and the hin of olive oil signifies the unique God
Myrrh signifies the sweetness of the death of Christ, and cinnamon signifies the sweetness of the effectiveness of His death
It surely indicates the power of Christ's resurrection, for Christ resurrected from the mud of death into the heavenly air
According to some lexicons, in ancient times cassia was used not only as a spice, but also as a repellent to repel insects and snakes
In this compound ointment we have the Triune God signified by the numbers one and three and humanity signified by the number four
In the Spirit of Christ there are many items divinity humanity the effectiveness of Christs death and the power of Christs resurrection
Later however in one of his messages he said strongly that the death in Christ in Romans 6 can be experienced only in the Spirit in Romans 8
He pointed out that the fact of having been crucified with Christ in Romans 6 can be experienced only by the Spirit in Romans 8
All of the Triune God plus humanity, the death of Christ, and the resurrection of Christ have been compounded into this life-giving Spirit
In this life-giving Spirit we have divinity, humanity, the effectiveness of the death of Christ, and the power of the resurrection of Christ
When you call on the name of the Lord Jesus, you not only drink of Him; you also put on the life-giving Spirit as a repellent
If the first thing in the morning you do not put on this repellent, the snake will attack you, and you may lose your temper during the day
If you call on the Lord's name a few times, you will not only drink of the living water, but also apply the repellent
Romans 8:9 reveals that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, just as Acts 16 reveals that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Jesus
The significance of the number five is that the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is for the bearing of responsibility
On the day of His resurrection the Lord came to the disciples by night, breathed into them, and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
The Lord's breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter
God's economy is entirely involved with this all-inclusive Spirit, who is the compound ointment whose anointing we must experience today
Within this Spirit there is divinity, humanity, the effectiveness of Christ's death, the power of His resurrection, and the ascension
We thank the Lord that by means of the clear view of all the books in the Bible, we see such a wonderful Spirit
In the Bible myrrh signifies the sweetness of Christs precious death and cinnamon signifies the sweetness of the effectiveness of that death
If we put all these items together, we must admit that they no doubt portray the details of the compound all-inclusive Spirit
The tabernacle with all its furniture and vessels and all the priests were anointed with this compound ointment, not merely with olive oil
Today we are not under the anointing of the Spirit that includes only divinity; we are under the anointing of the compound Spirit
In order to have this all-inclusive life-giving Spirit and to experience the Spirit, we must first be reborn or regenerated by Him
The more it tries, the more difficulty it has, because the Father is with the Son, and the Son is now the life-giving Spirit
As soon as a sinner confesses his sin to God and believes in the Son of God, he is born again of the Triune God
In the New Testament there are two lines of the experience of the all-inclusive Spirit: the line of John and the line of Luke
John used the symbol of water, saying that the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is like living water for people to drink
According to the writings of the Apostle John, the Spirit is the water for drinking and the breath for breathing
Besides John's line, the line of the inward aspect of the Spirit, we have the line of Luke, the line of the outward aspect
The Lord says that the disciples should wait in Jerusalem until they are clothed, enveloped, with power from on high
When you are alone in your room, you may drink all the water you want, but you do not need to be clothed in a particular way
You automatically drive carefully whenever you see a policeman in uniform because of the authority represented by that uniform
The highest gospel is that everything pertaining to the inward experience and the outward experience of the Spirit has been accomplished
To be saved is not simply to be forgiven of our sins or to be rescued out of hell, but also to have the Holy Spirit
There was no need to tell others that they were Christians; neither was there a need for others to discern who the Christians were
When you call on His name you will be filled with the Spirit saturated with the Spirit permeated with the Spirit and soaked with the Spirit
All the local churches must be calling churches, and every saint in the Lord's recovery must be one who calls on the name of the Lord
Corinthians 1:21 says, 'Now he who firmly attaches us with you unto the anointed one, and hath anointed us, is God'
All the ointment has been poured upon this unique anointed One, and from Him the ointment runs down to all His members
The ointment has been poured upon the anointed One, and since we are attached to this anointed One, the ointment runs down to reach us
There is something within you anointing you all the time, flowing and even running throughout your inner being
In the Lord's recovery we have the assurance that day by day something is running through us, doing an inward 'painting' work
The more we enjoy the flowing of the inner life and the more we enjoy the Lord together in the meetings, the more we have God within us
Simply by being in the Lord's recovery for several months, you will be able to testify that God has been painted into you
We have a divine paint, the compound ointment, the all-inclusive Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit, who is painting us day and night
After praying in this way, she will behave either like a scorpion or like a turtle, not like a mild, gentle dove
If you are bothered with your temper, do not try to adjust it, for the more you try to adjust yourself, the worse your behavior will be
We need to praise the Lord for the anointing that brings in the divine element and for the sealing that gives us the image of God
The whole of our inheritance will be the same as the foretaste, just as the whole piece of land was the same as the soil in the box
The foretaste is the guarantee that the full taste is coming; it is the guarantee of the whole inheritance, which is God Himself
What we are enjoying of Him today is the same in element, in taste, and in substance as what we shall enjoy in the future as the full taste
Although the anointing we enjoy today is rich and wonderful, it is simply the foretaste; the full taste is yet to come
The anointing brings us the divine element, the sealing gives us the divine image, and the foretaste gives us the divine taste
If you want to have a loose way of life, do not come into the recovery; for the recovery will stir up the anointing within you
We have the anointing, the sealing, the foretaste, the firstfruit, and finally the all-inclusive moving within us
In this message we shall consider three crucial aspects of the Spirit the Spirit of holiness the Spirit of life and the Spirit of sonship
Although Christ was the Son of God before His incarnation, within Him there was no humanity, but only divinity
After Christ's incarnation and before His resurrection, there was on earth a man with both the divine nature and the human nature
Prior to His resurrection, Christ was the Son of God according to His divine nature, but He was not the Son of God according to His humanity
In resurrection, Christ as the seed of David was designated as a man to be the Son of God by the Spirit of holiness
The book of Romans reveals that the only begotten Son of God has become the firstborn Son of God in order to produce many sons for God
Eventually, Romans is a book on the many sons becoming the many members of Christ in order that Christ may have a Body
If you do not know what the Spirit of holiness is and what the Spirit of life is, then you cannot know what the Spirit of sonship is
Christians may talk about the Body in Romans 12 without seeing that the members of the Body are the sons of God
To be a proper member of Christ's Body, we must know the meaning of the Spirit of holiness and the Spirit of life
In the entire universe there is only one nature absolutely different from all other things, and this is the nature of God
When Christ came as man, He put on human nature, but this human nature was not holy, for it was exactly the same as our nature
Holiness refers to a condition, a state of being, in which someone or something is different from everything other than God
The same thing took place in His resurrection: His physical body became separate, different, from all things other than God
Holiness is the state, or condition, of the element that was sown into our being when we believed in the Lord Jesus
The presence of God the Spirit in us produces the condition of being absolutely separate from everything other than God
Today such a Spirit is moving and working in us to saturate and permeate us inwardly with the condition of holiness
The reason few Christians realize this is that they are fully occupied with their works, activities, desires, and hopes
We have seen that holiness is a state, a condition, within us that is different from all things other than God
By this we see that if we would experience the sonship, the life, and the holiness, we must be one with the Spirit
By doing this, we are designated, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and even glorified to be the sons of God
The matter of husbands loving their wives is a religious, ethical teaching; it is not the basic revelation of the Bible
According to God's economy, Christ passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
We shall be the sons of God because this Spirit of holiness, life, and sonship will have saturated us thoroughly with what God is
Forget your concepts your understanding and your knowledge turn to your spirit open to the Spirit who is in your spirit and be one with Him
The all-inclusive Spirit who indwells us today is the sanctifying One, and His work of sanctifying takes place by His life-imparting
In this message we need to cover five matters: sanctifying, life-imparting, transforming, conforming, and glorifying
We have read a number of these writings, but none of them ever fully satisfied us, because they did not correspond to our experience
As we progressed in the experience of sanctification, we began to realize that it resembles what we have called teafication
No matter how experienced we may be in the spiritual life, this process of life imparting must still go on within us
Transformation is not outward change, correction, or adjustment; it is altogether an inward, metabolic change of our being
In the process of metabolism, a new essence is added to replace an old, to carry away the old, and to produce a new situation
Transformation is a divine metabolism wherein a new element is added to the old to discharge the old and to create a new situation
They are not the result of something new being added into our being to discharge the old and to create a new situation
Many of us were in the 'mortuaries' of religion for years, where hired 'morticians' attempted to beautify our faces every Sunday
When the rich nourishment of the food gets into you, it will discharge the old things and create a new condition within you
The saints in the Lord's recovery do not have outward correction, but they have a certain amount of inward transformation
When Christ as the nourishing element is ministered into our being, this element causes a metabolic change that transforms us
Rather, a carnation grows according to its own regulation, that is, according to the law of the carnation life
Because every plant has its life essence, life power, life law, and life shape, it is shaped according to its kind
You gave us a message saying that the life within would shape us, conform us, to the image of the firstborn Son of God
In that glorification, the transfiguration of our body, we shall be exactly the same as the firstborn Son in spirit, soul, and body
At that time we shall know for certain that we are the many sons, and Christ may say, 'I am the firstborn, and you are the many sons'
Although we should not try to improve ourselves, we do need to exercise our spirit to experience the wonderful all-inclusive Spirit
The seven Spirits of God are called the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne and also the seven eyes of the Lamb
Before you came into the church life you probably never heard a word about the seven Spirits of God being the seven lamps and the seven eyes
Revelation is not a book of new things; rather, it is the conclusion of the things revealed in the foregoing books of the Bible
The thought of seven lamps burning and shining before God is not new; it had already been presented in the Old Testament
God's administration cannot be separated from His testimony because God's testimony is for God's administration
No doubt the gold of the lampstand signifies that the source of the lampstand is the Father in the Godhead with the divine substance
The stand as the embodiment of the gold signifies the Son, the second in the Trinity, who is the embodiment of God the Father
In the lampstand we have the Father as the substance, the Son as the embodiment, and the Spirit as the expression
Zerubbabel was in the process of building the temple, and that stone with the seven eyes was for God's building
The seven lamps of the lampstand are the seven eyes of God, the seven eyes on the stone, and the seven eyes of the Lamb
The lampstand is for shining, the stone is for building, the Lamb is for redeeming, and God is for administrating
The lamps of burning fire are for God's administration, and the eyes are for the redeeming and building One's transfusion
The seven lamps are for God's administration to accomplish God's purpose, and the seven eyes are for Christ's infusing to perfect us
On the one hand, these seven Spirits are seven lamps shining, burning, searching, judging, and carrying out God's administration
On the other hand, these seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the redeeming and building Christ to infuse whatever Christ is into us
Today the life-giving Spirit is the seven Spirits of God as the seven lamps of fire burning to carry out God's administration
Whatever has been infused into us by the seven eyes of the redeeming Christ will be built into the New Jerusalem
Whenever you do this, the seven lamps turn into the seven eyes looking at you, and immediately you are once again under His transfusing
By the Lord's mercy, whenever you repent and apply the blood, you are immediately connected to the right consummation
If we repent and apply the blood of the Lamb, these seven Spirits of God immediately become the seven eyes of the Lamb
In the coming days many of us will be under this transfusing and we shall become the proper material to be built together into Gods building
If you listen to His speaking, you will immediately be under Christ's transfusing and infusing, and you will be immersed into Christ
Eventually these seven Spirits become the river of life flowing throughout God's building to supply the life that is needed
Eventually, the seven Spirits become the river of life flowing through the churches to bring us the life supply so that we may be nourished
Today He is the One who has ascended to the heavens, having passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection
With this God-man there is incarnation, human living, the all-inclusive crucifixion, the resurrection, and the ascension
Today God is the processed God with divinity, humanity, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
We call Him the all-inclusive Spirit because within Him we have God as well as the redeemed, uplifted, and resurrected humanity
In God's economy, this processed God, this all-inclusive Spirit, must be born into us, and we must be born of Him
To be saved means not only to have our sins forgiven, to be redeemed, to be justified, and to be reconciled to God
The more you praise the Lord for the gold within you, the more the gold will gradually increase from one ounce to several ounces
Many Christians understand this but in their practice they have little realization that they are worshipping God exclusively by their spirit
Some believers are very active in their thinking, feeling, and analyzing, but they do not exercise their spirit
Right now the Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in our spirit, and grace, the full enjoyment of the riches of the Lord, is also in our spirit
You simply need to realize that you have such a spirit within you and that you should do everything according to your spirit
When you are thinking about the past or about how your wife is treating you, bind your donkey to the vine and set your mind upon the spirit
The Bible reveals that man is a tripartite being composed of the spirit within the body without and the soul between the spirit and the body
The coming of Christ into our spirit makes our spirit a new being, which the Apostle Paul called the inner man
Formerly, our spirit was merely an organ, and there was no man, no personality, in it because there was no life in it
Because our spirit is now our inner man, every Christian is two beings: the old being in the soul and the new being in the spirit
When we say that we live by our spirit, we need to see that this means our spirit now has become a being with life in it
Formerly the two organs were the body and the spirit; now the second organ is no longer the spirit, but the soul
According to Acts 6 and 7, Stephen and Philip were people who lived, behaved, and walked in such a wonderful Spirit
Their soul, their old man with their old being and personality, had been crucified on the cross and buried with Christ
They had a new being, the inner man --Christ dwelling in their spirit and making His home in every part of their inner being
According to Acts 15:28, the Apostles made a decision with the Spirit, saying, 'It seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us'
Corinthians 53 and 4 reveal that Paul could attend a meeting of the church in Corinth in his spirit even when he was not physically present
Verse 4 says, 'In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ'
If you say that your emotion has been stirred, it indicates that you are still a soulish person, living in the old being in the soul
Paul was bold to declare that he and his co-workers were those living in their new being, in their new personality
If we see the light on the matter of the spirit as our real person, we shall see the book of Acts in a new way
The Apostles were people living in their new being, in their regenerated spirit indwelt by Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit
In spirit he saw the judgment of God exercised upon the world , he saw the Great Babylon , and he saw the New Jerusalem
In his spirit, in his new being, his new personality and person, John saw the churches, the world, Babylon, and the New Jerusalem
Our spirit is no longer an organ, and our soul is no longer our person; today our spirit is our person, and our soul is just an organ
Apart from all the foregoing messages on the Spirit, we would not be able to understand what it means to be a witness to the Lord
Collectively and corporately, the churches are the testimony of Jesus, but individually each of us is a witness to Jesus
Every one of us must be a witness to Jesus, a person saturated with Christ, immersed into Christ, and permeated with Christ
Of course, the Lord cannot actually be defeated, but due to our failure, the enemy may think that the Lord has been defeated
Our spirit will be very living, the testimonies will be fresh, and the atmosphere will be uplifted to the heavens
In this kind of meeting all death is swallowed up, the Lord is expressed, the Father is glorified, and we are nourished
In every locality the church must also take up the burden to care for the young people, especially for the unmarried brothers and sisters
Three things will attract people to the church: our daily walk, the rich meetings, and the proper communal life
We must have a daily walk that is uplifted meetings that are high living and rich and a communal life that is pure yet full of enjoyment
We all must learn the things related to the Lord's recovery in such a way that we shall be able to present them to others
Others refer to their church as the church on a particular street, indicating thereby that they do not know what the church really is
We ourselves must know what the church is and then learn how to present to others the truth in a pleasant, convincing, and attractive manner
Peter 3:15 says that we must be 'ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you'
Suppose someone asks you who the pastor of the church in Anaheim is, and you answer, 'Every one of us is a pastor'!
That would not be a proper answer; for it would cause others to think that you are not willing to talk to them
We need to learn how to present things to people in a pleasant way, in a way that is convincing, subduing, and captivating
If someone asks you what it means to turn to the spirit, that is an excellent opportunity to capture him by sharing something with him
Do not be bothered if they ask nonsensical questions, but use the opportunity to inject something positive into them
The second reason for going to the young people is the fact that so many young people are gathered in the schools
The older ones, those over twenty-seven, should not think that there is nothing for them to do or that they should retire
The young people in the church can invite others to the homes of the middle-aged ones and of the young couples
We need the youngest ones to go to the campuses, the oldest ones to pray, and the middle-aged ones to prepare their homes
Satan, the Devil, is behind this opposition, for he knows that the recovery will defeat him and bring the Lord Jesus back
Ask for his name, address, and telephone number and let him know that you would like to study the points and talk with him again
If you present matters solidly rightly and fairly the opposers sense of fairness will confirm what you say and something will get into him
Do not think that since Christ has become the life-giving Spirit, He is only great, majestic, and transcendent
Verse 19 says, 'And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power'
Verse 22 says that God 'hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church'
Neither our belief nor our unbelief alters the fact that all the Head has obtained and attained has been transmitted to the Body
When the collector of the half shekel asked Peter if his Master paid the tax, Peter immediately answered that He did
Prior to that, he was bold in a fleshly way, but actually very timid in following Christ, for he denied the Lord three times
On the day of Pentecost all that Christ had passed through, obtained, and attained was transmitted from the third heaven to the church
If we would experience the Body today, we must have a personal experience of the transmission that transpired on the day of Pentecost
The reason for this is that they do not have the vision of the transmission that has taken place from the Head to the Body
Ephesians 2:15 and 16 put the Body with the new man, telling us that the new man is the Body and that the Body is the new man
In order to create this new man and to produce this Body Christ abolished on the cross all ordinances rituals and different ways of living
In New York there is a group of Chinese Christians who emphasize the fact that in their meetings they have a Chinese flavor
Although Brother Nee did not care for that type of meeting, he realized that there should not be any ordinances among Christians
In Acts 10:9 through 16 Peter saw a vision of a great sheet and heard a voice saying, 'Rise, Peter; kill, and eat'
If we shout and others do not, or if we call on the Lord's name in a certain way and others do not, we may be troubled
No doubt we have received benefit from shouting and calling on the name of the Lord, but we must never make this an ordinance
The Body is not built directly by the gifted persons; rather, it is built directly by all the members of the Body
Ephesians 4:16 says that every part has a measure of function and that the Body is built up by the function of every part in love
If we are practically spiritual in the meetings of the church, both the spiritual gifts and other spiritual matters will be evident
Corinthians 12:2 says, 'Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led'
Whenever you speak concerning the Lord, you immediately release your spirit and increase your spiritual capacity
The best way for the sisters to conquer their temper is to utter thanks and praise to the Lord in the meetings
If the sisters are always silent in the meetings, they will find it easy to argue with their husbands at home after the meetings
Because some brothers and sisters are in the mind or the self, or are occupied by a dumb idol, they do not say anything in the meetings
The difficulty is that we are not accustomed to doing this because of the background and influence of today's Christianity
After mentioning the diversities of gifts in verse 4 Paul says in verses 5 and 6 And there are differences of ministries but the same Lord
Often those in the Pentecostal movement or the charismatic movement ask if we have the manifestation of the gifts in our meetings
When asked whether or not we have the gifts in our meetings, some brothers have answered incorrectly that we do not have them
In the meetings we have a great deal of the manifestation of the gifts, especially of the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge
After these two gifts, Paul lists faith, healing, miracles, prophecy, the discerning of spirits, tongues, and the interpretation of tongues
By the order of the gifts in these verses, we see that those in the charismatic movement today make the tail the head and the head the tail
The first two gifts are not tongues and the interpretation of tongues; they are the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge
Because we often have the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge in our meetings, we must say that we have the manifestation of the gifts
Of the nine gifts listed in 1 Corinthians 12, at least three the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, and prophecy are related to speaking
You may be familiar with the fact that in verse 12 we see the Body-Christ, the corporate Christ, not the individual Christ
Corinthians 12:13 says that in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body and that we were all made to drink of one Spirit
Practically speaking, to drink is to function, to call on the name of the Lord, and to utter something for the Body
Paul's intention in these verses is to tell those who, outwardly speaking, may seem inferior to others not to despise themselves
In the meetings, the brothers should be the ones to bear the responsibility because they are the stronger ones'
We all need to be converted and become like little children who gradually learn to speak without any consciousness of being smart or dumb
We in the church are a family, not a graduate school where everyone is studying for a master's degree or a doctoral degree
To temper something is firstly to heat it up and then to cool it down, as a blacksmith does when making an iron fitting
Because the head is on top, and the feet are on the bottom, the head may be very proud and think that it has no need of the feet
Many of the lower ones consider themselves not of the Body, and many of the higher ones think that they do not need others
Those who do not function must learn to function, and those who function more than they should must learn not to function too much
Of considering themselves not of the Body, they must be encouraged to be stronger and more aggressive than those who do function often
The Body is one, but the members are on different levels, just as the members of our physical body are on different levels beneath the head
Today in any Christian group there may be two categories of people: the self-despising ones and the proud ones
The proud ones, to the contrary, consider themselves superior to others and seem to say, 'I don't need anyone else
In the meetings of the church everyone must function, including the young ones, the new ones, and the weak ones
Thinking that it is a waste of time for those who are new young or weak to function in the meetings we may say What can the weaker ones do
From now on we must pray, 'Lord, grant that whenever we meet together we shall have the move of the whole Body'
If we come together exercising our spirit and ready to function, we shall be like players on a basketball team
In particular, we could never learn Hebrew to go to Jerusalem to have the church life there in preparation for the Lord's coming back'
Because of this feeling of disappointment, some of the older ones consider themselves as only good for retirement
Although the older ones are not suitable for work on the campus, they are the ones to bear the burden to pray for the young people
It would be very difficult for the young people to stay home and pray, because they are eager to get on the campus and contact people
If the older ones gossip and complain about being useless, our situation will be pitiful, and we shall not have the Body
We all, including the new ones, the young ones, the weak ones, and the old ones, need to be restored to the functioning spirit
If you function even a little in the meetings, your spirit will be stirred up, and you will be nourished, strengthened, and refreshed
If because you are so cautious you do not function, you will sense when you return home that you are lacking in inward strength
Whenever you function in a meeting, no matter whether the meeting is high or low, rich or poor, that meeting is rich to you
Whether a meeting is rich or poor as far as you are concerned depends on whether or not you function in that meeting
To have several speakers does not mean that you have the Body, for the Body is not made up of several members, but of all the members
At a certain point in our conversation, he said, 'Witness, the more cultured people are, the more they adorn their feet
We often damage the principle of the Body by adorning the head with many 'hats,' but not caring for the lower members, the feet
From now on, in all the churches and in all the meetings we must learn to clothe the lower members with more honor
Purchase 'shoes' for the adornment of the feet so that you may beautify these less honorable parts of the Body
In the seminaries men are taught to speak eloquently and are taught how to attract people and to entertain them
For the long run, we need meetings filled with speaking that is not eloquent, yet speaking through which Christ is expressed
We in the church life must no longer exalt eloquence, because the eloquent speakers create division and draw a following
In 1 Corinthians 12 Paul deals with those who have an inferiority complex and those who have a superiority complex
Some think of themselves as superior to others and like to dominate, to maneuver, and to do everything for the whole Body
In this portion of the Word Paul is doing his best to lower those with a superiority complex and to uplift those with an inferiority complex
To be genuinely spiritual means that all the weaker ones must function and that all the stronger ones must be limited to a certain extent
Only when every part of the Body participates in the present activities of the Body does the Body exist in a practical way
If you are eloquent, perhaps you should limit yourself and even speak in a halting way so that others will not be frustrated
Paul goes on to say And whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members rejoice with it
We need to learn to have such a mutual care not only in our private life, home life, and daily life, but also in the meetings
Most of the saints in the churches are cruel and merciless to the elders in that they do not help to bear the burden in the meetings
After listing various items in verse 28, Paul continued in verses 29 and 30 by giving another list: 'Are all apostles?
As we have seen, to temper the Body is firstly to uplift the inferior ones and then to lower the superior ones
Because the Apostle Paul knew the trouble, the disease, in the church at Corinth, he dealt with the matter of the miraculous things
We all would be attracted by this and would have no heart to listen to a heavy message on the Spirit of holiness or the Spirit of life
Although we appreciate miracles very much, the Apostle Paul took the lead to tear down this fascination with miracles
Rather, it is a composition of many members: strong ones and weak ones, big ones and small ones, comely ones and uncomely ones
If you have this concept, it is an indication that you do not know the meaning of prophecy in the New Testament
Why did Paul use the word 'first' before apostles and then speak of prophets and teachers as being second and third?
The reason is that even in Paul's time there was confusion in the Christian gathering caused by speaking in tongues
Paul's question about speaking in tongues is a problem to those in the Pentecostal movement or charismatic movement
Because the church was depressed, some decided to bring in the Pentecostal things in order to stir up the church
One of the sisters became bold and prevailing in the matter of speaking in tongues, and she caused the meetings to be focused on herself
Although no conference of the workers was held regarding it and no decision was made, spontaneously everyone dropped it
The host laid hands on the brother, and the wife told him to open his mouth and say something, but not to speak either English or Chinese
Although we knew Mandarin, Cantonese, and other dialects, we did not understand a word of this brother's 'Chinese'
If the tongues spoken today were recorded and examined by a linguist, the linguist would say that they are not genuine languages
These charismatic leaders have begun to debate whether what they are speaking should be called a tongue or simply a vocal sound
In 1963 a so-called prophecy was given in Los Angeles that there would be a great earthquake and that Los Angeles would fall into the ocean
The next year the same prophecy was given again, and an article regarding it was printed in a San Francisco paper
By reading 1 Corinthians 12 we can easily see that the greater gifts are those related to the apostles, the prophets, and the teachers
In chapter fourteen Paul is trying to impress us that we should care more for prophecy than for speaking in tongues
The most excellent way is, of course, revealed in 1 Corinthians 13, which is the direct continuation of chapter twelve
We may give material things to the poor and even offer our body to be burned and still have no profit, because we do not have love
In 3:1 he said, 'And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ'
If you read 1 Corinthians carefully, you will see that Paul's concept was that playing with the gifts is like playing with toys
If you read chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen, you will have to admit that the childish things are the gifts
No matter how much the young ones say that they do not play with toys, the fact is that they do play with them
When they hear this, they may be disappointed and say, 'Brother Lee has said that we are children playing with toys
Whenever we come together, we should see some elderly ones, some middle-aged ones, some young people, and some children
If, among the saints in the Body, there are a good number who are mature, there will be a balanced love among us
If we do not love properly, this means that we are not balanced or that we have not reached the standard of the growth in life
What is important is that we are an epistle of Christ, an epistle that speaks for Christ and that ministers Christ to others
Rather, he turned the attention of the church in Corinth to the need to have Christ written into the being of all the saints
If in the meetings there are none who have Christ written into them, you will have the sense that the meeting is empty
Simply by being present he enriches the meeting, because a great deal of Christ has been written upon him by the living Spirit
He needs many epistles with Christ written on them by the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit so that people may read Christ on them
At the same time, we need to be bright, unveiled mirrors reflecting the very Christ who has been written into our being
We need such a Body life, a Body life not only according to 1 Corinthians, but also according to 2 Corinthians
Romans 12, however, is much more advanced than 1 Corinthians 12 because the Body life there in Romans 12 comes after transformation
Romans 12 is different, because there transformation comes first and then the practice of the Body life follows
Before transformation, in 1 Corinthians 12, Paul mentioned the miraculous things and gifts such as speaking in tongues and interpretation
After transformation, in Romans 12, he said not a word regarding miracles, healings, tongues, or the interpretation of tongues
The church life in 1 Corinthians is before transformation, but the church life in Romans 12 is with transformation
Even if you just sit there in the meeting, you will reflect Christ and radiate something of Christ into the whole meeting
For the Body life, our body must be presented, our soul must be transformed, and our spirit must be set on fire
You may love the church and present your body to the church, but you may not have much transformation in your soul
The Body, the church, is not a matter of religion, teaching, theology, practice, serving God, or working for Christ
In Ephesians 4:4-6 Paul lists seven ones: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father
Everyone in the Lords recovery needs a clear vision that the recovery is basically and fundamentally the recovery of the oneness of the Body
The Catholic Church, the Protestant denominations, and all the independent groups are in a condition of confusion
It is according to God's ordination for a woman to have a husband, but she must take a husband within the bounds of God's ordination
If you look at today's Christianity, you will see that every group has a different husband with a different name
When those in the Lutheran denomination call themselves Lutherans, they indicate that they are married to Luther
The Lord's recovery is mainly to bring us back to the genuine oneness, to the unique husband, to the one Body, and to the one Spirit
After the return from Babylon, there were four groups: one in Syria, one in Egypt, one in Babylon, and one in the holy land
Although the groups in Egypt, Syria, and Babylon were divisions, the group of the recovered ones in Jerusalem was not a division
The Jews in Israel should say to the Jews in New York, 'Brothers, you are certainly part of the nation of Israel
Suppose there are twenty-eight members in the Smith family, but most are scattered all over the country and just three remain at home
The Smith family does include those in Hawaii, but they need to return home to be with the other members of the family
If we truly intend to practice the Body life, we need to see that locally we are the Body and that universally we also are the Body
At the end of each of the seven epistles there is the following word: 'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches'
Whatever was written to the church in Ephesus, for example, was a word that the Spirit was speaking to all the churches
Some who argue that the church in Jerusalem was higher than the others use as proof the fact that a conference was held there
The conference was held in Jerusalem because the apostles who had the ministry to build the churches were there
There was a difference, but the difference was not with respect to the church, but with respect to the ministry of the apostles
Suppose the church in Cleveland is not open to the other churches, but is afraid that the other churches might interfere with its affairs
Some of the brothers who feared that others might become a pope might have been the ones most ambitious to become a pope
We all need to receive mercy to drop this concept of a pope, a concept that may cause us to be sectarian, even in the Lord's recovery
Every saint desires to be in a church that is an open church, a church that is of God, of Christ, and of the saints
It is not sufficient even to bring them into the living room; you must also bring them into the secret chamber
If you come to Anaheim, you will find that everything from the skin to the innermost being of the church is open to you
Not only the elders, but also all the young ones, should be clear that the Lord's recovery is to bring us back to one Body and one Spirit
We do not have organization or division; and we do not have confusion, control, or a pocket version of the church
Everything must be public, everything must be for the saints, everything must be in the Spirit, and everything must be for the one Body
After staying with the Methodists a short time, they visited the Assembly of God and remained there for a while
The reason you were traveling, or wandering, so much in the past was that you did not know what the proper ground was
Many Christians today talk about the church and the Body, yet they have not seen the proper ground of the church
Because they lack the proper ground, the result is that they build up something one day and tear it down the next
God has had two peoples, one in the Old Testament, the children of Israel, and the other in the New Testament, the church
Although the church has now come into existence, it is nevertheless difficult to understand the church because it is a spiritual entity
Moses was charged by the Lord to command the children of Israel concerning the place where they were to worship God
In Deuteronomy 14:23 Moses said, 'And thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there'
Moses seemed to be saying, 'After you enter into the land, you must be careful where you eat the best part of your harvest
Rather, you must set it aside until the appointed times and bring it to the place which the Lord your God shall choose
It did not matter in what part of the holy land the Israelites lived, whether it was far to the north or far to the south
How could anyone say that it was not good to establish a worship center and to encourage people to come there to worship God?
The setting up of a worship center as a convenience to people in their worship of God may be good, but this does not make it right
If the northerners and the southerners had done this, there would have been two divisions among the Israelites
Without the regulations given in Deuteronomy 12, 14, 15, and 16, there would have been many divisions among the children of Israel
In the eyes of the Lord it was not right for the children of Israel to worship at any place other than the unique place God had chosen
During all the years of their history, the children of Israel have not been divided as far as the worship of God is concerned
As they ascended Mount Zion they repeated the words of Psalm 133 How good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!
Eventually, the Israelites who hated one another had to forgive one another so that they could sing the words of Psalm 133
As we all know, the time came when the children of Israel were scattered, some to Syria, some to Egypt, and the majority to Babylon
Even today, they are waiting for the recovery of the proper site, which is presently occupied by a Moslem mosque
While they were in Babylon, they were, of course, still the children of Israel and they could worship God; however, they had no temple
Because they were not actually in Jerusalem, they would still have been a division, no matter how close they were to Jerusalem
If a thousand Christians were gathered together and each stayed in his mentality, there would be a thousand divisions
She said, 'Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship'
The Lord Jesus answered, 'An hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality'
In type, Jerusalem was a figure of our human spirit, and the sacrifices used in the worship of God were figures of Christ
For this reason, the Lord Jesus told the Samaritan woman that today we must worship God in our spirit and in reality
In the spirit we maintain our oneness, and here we have no opinion, because we are not in the mind, but in the spirit
We need to worship God in our spirit and in the reality, which is Christ as all the offerings we present to God for His satisfaction
Anyone who knows the Lord's recovery will admit that her messages on the subjective work of the cross were part of the recovery
Penn-Lewis was raised up by the Lord, not many Christians knew the subjective aspect of the Lord's cross clearly and adequately
A young Baptist pastor who had been somewhat influenced by modernistic teachings was made clear regarding the Lord's salvation through Mrs
She had seen the subjective aspect of the cross, but he saw the principles of resurrection for the Body of Christ
How ridiculous it is to prepare the materials for building and to begin the work of building, yet not to know the site of the building!
It has a definite ground, but the ground is wrong, because the Baptist Church takes as its ground baptism by immersion
Today's Christians have truckloads of building materials, but they are driving around looking for a place to unload them
Sometimes they unload the materials on the wrong site, and after a period of time they shift the materials to still another ground
They did not dare to take this step, for they realized that the denominations would withdraw their financial support if they were to do so
For our map, we shall use certain cities mentioned in the New Testament: Jerusalem, Antioch, Ephesus, and Corinth
The testimony of the church eventually spread north to Antioch through some saints who moved there from Jerusalem
We know that in Ephesus there was not more than one church because Revelation 2:1 speaks of the church, not churches, in Ephesus
Through the ministry of Paul, the church spread from Asia Minor to Europe, and a church was established at Corinth
Due to the various choices, tastes, and preferences, they were divided, like the Corinthians, into four groups
The third group liked Paul better than Apollos because he had a direct contact with the Lord on the way to Damascus
Suppose the saints were divided into four churches: the church of Peter, the church of Apollos, the church of Paul, and the church of Christ
Surely he would not go to the church of Cephas, the church of Apollos, the church of Paul, or even the church of Christ
Those who say that they are of Christ would not agree with those who say they are of Peter, of Apollos, or of Paul
The ground is the site upon which the building is constructed, whereas the foundation is the bottom part of the building itself
Even those who say that they are of Peter, of Apollos, and of Paul would claim that Christ is their foundation
If those standing on the ground of unity numbered five thousand, they would all be bold to say that they are the church in Corinth
If the number were small, perhaps only fifteen, they would be weakened in this matter and afraid to say that they are the church
We need to be clear that the standing of the church does not depend upon any terms or conditions, but only upon the ground of unity
We need to be clear about this so that wherever we are, we shall be nothing other than part of the church in that locality
Even if there are just a small number coming together in a particular city, they are the church in that locality
Every denomination has a particular name, such as the Church of Christ, the Baptist Church, the Presbyterian Church, or the Lutheran Church
Once a group assumes a special name, it has become a denomination, for taking such a designation separates that group from all other groups
For them, the receiving of the believers is not based upon the faith, but based upon the baptism they practice
Any group that has a special condition, either a special teaching or practice, for the receiving of the saints, is a sect
They may talk with them about business or politics, but they will not have fellowship in common concerning spiritual things
Others limit their fellowship to those who have the same practice regarding the wine or juice used at the Lord's table
In a particular locality there may be a group of Christians who have no special name special practice special teaching or special fellowship
In addition to the local church in a city, an independent group may come into being that in nearly every respect is the same as the church
If a group of Christians has truly seen the ground of unity, they will say, 'We cannot have a separate administration
Perhaps there is a group that has no special name, teaching, or fellowship and that does not insist upon its own administration
We still need to examine whether or not they are willing to open themselves to have fellowship with all the other local churches on earth
They are no longer a local church, for a local church is part of the Body, one among many other local churches
Corinthians 11:20 says, 'When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper'
Anyone who eats and drinks at the Lord's table without discerning the Body eats and drinks judgment to himself
In 1 Corinthians 11:29 the Body does not denote the Lord's physical body that was crucified on the cross, but His mystical Body
We must take the Lord's table in a reverent way and in fear, lest we touch the Lord's Body without discernment
Because today is a day of confusion and division, we must discern what group of Christians is the genuine testimony of the one Body
If there is no division among us, our conscience will be clear, and we shall bear a strong testimony of the Lord's Body to the universe
The first class contains those doctrines that are not divisive, whereas the second class includes the doctrines that are divisive
Finally, all the saints in the churches are waiting for the Lord Jesus to come back to receive them to Himself
These are the basic doctrines, the doctrines that constitute the saving faith, the doctrines we must believe in order to be saved
Although these other doctrines are necessary and important, they are not the basic doctrines which constitute the faith
Are things such as speaking in tongues, pray-reading, foot washing, and calling on the name of the Lord basic doctrines?
Whether or not you practice speaking in tongues, pray-reading, or calling on the name of the Lord does not affect your salvation
If you do not believe the basic doctrines, you are not saved, even if your feet have been washed a thousand times
The young people must be warned not to go out and teach this particular view of the kingdom as a local church doctrine
Using them, however, does not make the churches a sect any more than eating chicken or drinking milk makes us sectarian
If those in a particular church believe that all Christians will be raptured at the same time, they are still the church
Others, including me, believe that the overcomers will be raptured first, whereas the defeated ones will pass through the great tribulation
Paul may be considered the greatest Apostle, but he was one who labored as a slave to serve the churches and to take care of them
When the elders are taking a proper lead the saints should not merely say Praise the Lord for the diligent elders who do everything for us!
In the New Testament to rule means to take the lead, and to be under the rule means to follow the lead and submit to the lead
Be at peace with others and do not create an atmosphere that leads to debate or controversy regarding doctrine
The more they fight, the more they will eat; the more they eat, the more they will grow; and the more they grow, the more they will fight
The old people are the old people, the young people are the young people, and the naughty ones are the naughty ones
We should be motivated, not by the desire for the increase of the local churches, but by the testimony of Jesus
We are not here for the increase of the local churches; we are for the bright, shining, strong, and aggressive testimony of Jesus
If Martin Luther had followed the historic church, there would not have been the recovery of justification by faith
When you meet an opposer who isolates certain sentences and twists our words, go to the book and read it yourself
We should insist upon the basic doctrines, those that constitute the faith and are necessary for salvation, but not on any other doctrines
We should not consider them as enemies or hopeless cases, but love them and try our best to present to them what we are enjoying of the Lord
