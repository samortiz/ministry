   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD BEING THE VAST LIFE IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church is a corporate entity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The characteristics, marvelousness, and intrinsic mystery of the church depend on God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is the church because she has God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If life is taken away from the church, the church would become ugly, withered, and dead.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the beauty, power, brightness, and ability of the church come from the fact that the life of God is her inward content.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This life is the life of Christ; Christ is God becoming flesh and coming into us through the Holy Spirit to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s life is in the Holy Spirit, and this life is the God who was in the beginning and the Creator who existed in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through the Holy Spirit, the life in the incarnated God came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, we have the life that created the universe and the life that is able to do great things in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This life is the greatest, highest, and most vital life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As believers, we have God s life in us, but we still need to ask about the condition of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Is it shallow and small?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When a child is little, he may roll and crawl on the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He can cry or laugh whenever he wants to cry or laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, an adult may not be allowed to do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is because there are varying degrees of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>An adult cannot do as he pleases like a child, because the life in him is mature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In contrast, because the life in a child is immature, he often does as he pleases.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This can be compared to an adult having five cubic meters of life and a child having only two cubic meters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Consequently, we need to frequently ask, How much of the life of God is in us?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Are there two cubic meters or five cubic meters?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In terms of time, God s life spans from eternity past to eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is eternal, without beginning and end. In terms of space, the life of God includes the heavens, the earth, and the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This life is too great; it transcends time and space in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such a transcending, great life is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Being a Christian is not a matter of human cultivation but a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I can testify that often I am not angry, because the life in me is not angry, nor do I argue with others, because the life in me is not arguing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The life in me, which transcends time and space, is so great that it prevents me from losing my temper and arguing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many people lose their temper because they have only two cubic meters of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They can remain angry for several months, and their anger cannot subside because they have only a small measure of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The life in some sisters is only two cubic inches; they have no capacity other than to lose their temper when they encounter certain situations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They have no response other than to lose their temper, because they are short of the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the reason they also criticize others, saying that someone is not good or is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The inward condition of their life is expressed outwardly in their environment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because it is in the nature of a cat to jump, it will meow if it is forbidden to jump.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such a restriction is the same as taking away its life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What else can a sister with only two cubic inches worth of life do except lose her temper and criticize?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such a person will not lose only her temper; she will also provoke others to anger, because this is her natural talent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the measure of life increases in her from being like that of a small cat to that of an elephant, she will spontaneously stop being a cat who jumps and cries whenever she wants.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As life grows, she will spontaneously stop losing her temper and will be able to be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, a certain kind of life produces a certain kind of result.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After we are saved, we have God s life within.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This life needs to grow in us every day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But exactly how much life do we have?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do we have two cubic meters or five cubic meters?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The God whom we know and serve has a great life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This life has a measure beyond that of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the life in us is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church is the church because of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The producing of the church depends upon God s salvation, and God s salvation depends upon life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After we are saved, we go to meetings, read the Bible, and pray in order to gain more life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we do not know this life, we are not living as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our Christian living depends upon experiencing Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The church consists of Christ, who is the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The content of Christ and the reality of the church depend on Christ as life; this life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now this life has entered into us to become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we know this life, our measure will be enlarged and our view will be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we know this life, our human life will have a wonderful, great change.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The great life that entered into us is not concerned with mere gain or loss.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This life does not require us to be concerned with whether or not we can work out the good and improve ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This life is both real and weighty in us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Just as God created the universe and everything in it, this life, which is Christ Himself, can do so much work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God clothes Himself with us to live and move in us; God created a small universe, a small world, in us, and He put Himself in the first place there.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>May God be merciful to us so that we would see this vision.</S>
