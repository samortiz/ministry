   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LIVING AS A STAR OF LIGHT A. His Brother Judah</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Indulging in Lust</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second gross sin, the indulgence in lust, also afforded Joseph an opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The indulgence in lust seen in chapter thirty-eight is a symbol of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this chapter Judah was utterly in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Judah behaved in a blind way, and blindness signifies darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If he had not been in blindness, in darkness, how could he have committed adultery with his daughter-in-law?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Where was his conscience?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Where was his eyesight?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His eyes had been blackened and blinded, and he was in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That evil woman in chapter thirty-nine, the wife of Potiphar, was also in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If she had not been in darkness, how could she have behaved in such an evil way?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, in chapters thirty-eight and thirty-nine we have a portrait of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. Joseph Overcoming Lust,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Shining in Darkness</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in the midst of this darkness we see Joseph as a bright star shining in the heavens 39:7-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Conducting himself as a shining star, Joseph seemed to be saying, "All you people are under darkness, but I am shining upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How can I, a bright star, do such a dark thing?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I cannot forget my dream.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>My dream controls me and directs me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a heavenly star, I would never sell my position."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you have this light as you come to these chapters, you will see that Joseph was one who lived a life that corresponded to his vision.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Joseph was not only a dreamer; he was also one who practiced, one who lived out, what he saw in his dream.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As today's Josephs, we also must have some dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Others should say that we are dreamers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many of my Christian friends consider me a dreamer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In talking about the overcoming life and the practice of the church life, they have said to me, "Brother Lee, these are wonderful ideas, but they are just dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one can live such a victorious life on this earth, and it is impossible to have the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must wait for that day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let's not dream any more.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, let's wake up from the dreams."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But I not only have dreams I practice what I see in my dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may think that I am merely a dreamer, but I am also one who fully puts my dreams into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I can testify that it is very possible to have an overcoming life and to have the practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not simply my dream; it is my practice and my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Like Joseph, I have had some dreams, the dream of the sheaves and of the bright stars.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By the Lord's mercy, I have lived according to my dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have behaved and conducted myself according to the vision I have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although some say, "These are merely dreams without any possibility of fulfillment," I must declare that these are heavenly revelations of the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you not believe that the victorious life is entirely possible?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And do you not believe that the practical church life is available today?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are not dreaming in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have a vision that controls us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all know what it is to lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am no exception.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not a good thing to keep our temper within us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the contrary, in a sense we feel better when we give vent to it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, when I am about to lose my temper, the vision of the sheaf comes, and the Lord asks me, "Are you a sheaf rising up?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you are, then what about your temper?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As soon as the Lord speaks to me in this way and I respond to Him, my anger is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even if I wanted to lose my temper, I would not be able to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is possible for us all to live without anger and loss of temper.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As you are about to lose your temper, the Lord may say, "Are you a sheaf?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Are you one in the church, in the Lord's recovery?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As soon as you say that you are a sheaf, your anger will vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Just as we all have anger, we also have lust.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you have no lust, then you must be a bench or a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every human being has lust.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The way to control our lust is to be subdued, controlled, and directed by the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Oh, we have a vision controlling us!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The people perish when they do not have a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Because we have seen the vision, it is very difficult for us to indulge in lust.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The function of the vision is similar to that of brakes in a car.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In times of danger, we step on the brakes.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The vision of the heavenly star is a powerful brake for our spiritual car.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are not driving a car that is without controls.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we are driving properly in the right lane, there is no need to use the brakes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But when the car begins to go out of control, the brakes work immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hallelujah for such a controlling vision!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many of us can testify that before we came into the church life, we were like a car without brakes.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But after coming into the church life, we saw the controlling vision, and powerful brakes were installed in our car.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Here in the church life we have the vision of the sheaf and the vision of the star.</S>
