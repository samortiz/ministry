   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FIFTY-FOUR AN UNSHAKABLE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to a very sober matter the unshakable kingdom 12:25-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The kingdom which we are receiving is unshakable v. 28 . Since this kingdom is unshakable, it is neither of the earth nor of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because we have such a doctrinal mind, we may argue with this statement, saying, What about the kingdom of heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Doesn t the Bible speak of this?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yes, the New Testament does speak of the kingdom of the heavens, but it also says that heaven will be shaken v. 26; Hag 2:6 . That heaven will be shaken proves that the kingdom which we are receiving is not of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although there seems to be a contradiction between the terms unshakable kingdom and the kingdom of the heavens, later on we shall see that there is actually no contradiction here.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I. FOR THE OLD COVENANT, THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>BEING SHAKEN AS A WARNING UPON EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For the old covenant, the earth was shaken as a warning upon earth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>25-26; Exo 19:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the old covenant was given at Mount Sinai, the earth was shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That shaking was a warning to the people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>FOR THE NEW COVENANT,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>NOT ONLY THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>BUT ALSO THE HEAVEN TO BE SHAKEN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>AS A WARNING FROM HEAVEN</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One day, for the new covenant, not only the earth but also the heaven will be shaken as a warning from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is according to the word in Haggai 2:6.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>ONLY THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>AND THE THINGS COMING OUT OF HIM</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>REMAINING FOREVER</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The earth and the heavens are shakable.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only the Lord and the things that come out of Him will remain forever v. 27; 1:11; 13:8 . This means that the kingdom which we are receiving has come out of the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hebrews 1:11, speaking of the heavens and the earth says, They shall perish, but You remain; and they all shall become old as a garment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The kingdom is actually the Lord Himself as the kingship within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have seen that faith is the Lord Himself as the believing element within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now, in the same principle, the kingdom is the Lord Himself as the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a help in realizing this matter, let us read Daniel 2:34 and 35.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The stone cut without hands is the heavenly Christ who was cut on the cross without human hands.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 44, referring to the toes of the image, says, In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 45 also speaks of the stone, saying, The stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These verses indicate that the stone, which is Christ, will eventually become a great mountain filling the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This great mountain is the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, the unshakable kingdom which we are receiving is Christ with His enlargement.</S>
