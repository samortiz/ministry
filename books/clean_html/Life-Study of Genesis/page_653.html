<H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(16) Recognized by the Children of Israel</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(a) The Whole Earth Being under Famine</H2><P>Genesis 41:56 says, "And the famine was over all the face of the earth," and verse 57 says that "the famine was severe in all lands" (Heb.). At the time of chapter forty-two the whole earth was under famine. This is exactly the situation today. A famine is a severe shortage of food, the means by which human beings maintain their existence. Food, however, not only maintains our existence, but also gives us satisfaction. When we eat and drink, we do not merely have the sense that we are maintaining our existence, but that we are being satisfied. When I am filled with good food, I am happy. Thus, a famine actually denotes dissatisfaction. The whole world today is dissatisfied.</P><P>The nation of Israel in particular is experiencing such dissatisfaction. This nation is aggressively striving and struggling to maintain its existence. If you visit Israel, you will certainly sympathize with them, for they definitely need protection and safety to secure their existence. Israel seems to need the Golan Heights and the settlements along the Sinai wilderness to secure its existence. The reason the nation of Israel is striving and struggling is that it is under famine, under dissatisfaction. The United States, the leading country on earth, is in the same situation. It also is experiencing dissatisfaction. We need to apply Genesis 42 to today's world situation. If we do, we shall see that the entire world is in a famine.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(b) Food Being Only Where Christ Is</H2><P>According to Genesis 42, food was to be found only where Joseph was (vv. 5-6). This indicates in type that food is only where Christ is. In other words, satisfaction can only be found in Christ. Where Christ is, there is satisfaction. Today, Christ is in the church. If you are in the church yet are not enjoying satisfaction, it indicates that you are in a famine. I can declare to all that I am not in a famine. Day by day I am nourished, filled, and satisfied with good food. Oh, the church is the land of satisfaction, the region of satisfaction, because Christ is here! Food, nourishment, and satisfaction are only where Christ is.</P><P>I truly sympathize with the nation of Israel. There is no need for them to struggle and strive or to negotiate with Egypt. They need to turn to Christ. The prime minister of Israel does not need to go to Washington or to Cairo; instead, he should carry out negotiations with Christ. If the Jews would call on Him, everything would be settled. Neither Cairo nor Washington can solve Israel's problem of dissatisfaction. The famine will end only when they turn to Christ and go where He is. Perhaps some saints of Jewish origin should write a letter to the Israeli prime minister telling him that the only person who can solve Israel's problems and give satisfaction is Christ. Some day the Jews will turn to the Lord Jesus. When they realize that all their struggles are in vain, they will be forced in their desperation to turn to Christ. Praise the Lord that we have taken the lead to turn to Him! We are pioneers in this matter. More than fifty years ago I turned to Christ, having come to the realization that I was in a land of famine and that I was very dissatisfied. We who have turned to Christ have found food, nourishment, and satisfaction, for the food is found only where Christ is.</P>
