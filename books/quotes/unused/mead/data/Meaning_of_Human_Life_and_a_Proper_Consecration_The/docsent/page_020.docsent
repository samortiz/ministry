   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT KNOWING THE CHURCH AS THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON 1 THE CHURCH BEING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE BODY AND THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the church as both the Body and the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to put on the new man Eph 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s intention in creating man was to gain a group of people on earth who have His image and likeness in order to express Him and represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God does not want to gain individuals to express Him; rather, He desires to gain a corporate man for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ephesians says that the church is the Body of Christ 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, the church does not refer to many individual believers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church is the Body, and the Lord is the Head of this Body, which is His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord needs a Body as His fullness for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church is not only the Body but also the new man 2:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE BODY AND THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is a significant difference between the Body and the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The emphasis in the Body is on life; the Body is an organ, not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My physical body is an organ it is not my person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My whole being includes not only my body but also the person within my body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Within my body there is not only life but also my person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Something that possesses life does not necessarily have a person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, a tree has life, but it does not have a person, because it does not have consciousness or a mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, a man not only has a body with life; he also has a person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church as the Body is a corporate entity with Christ as its life, and the church is also the new man with Christ as its person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Ephesians 3:17 speaks of Christ making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are God s temple, His dwelling place 2:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God desires to dwell in us not only to be our life but also our person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just as we each have a person, so the church as a great corporate man also has a person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A Christian who knows that the church is the Body of Christ is advanced.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the past many believers thought of the church as a place for worship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is superficial and low.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the early days of the recovery the Lord showed us that the church does not refer to a physical building; rather, the church is composed of all His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Later the Lord showed us that the church is not composed of individual believers; the church is a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is composed of a group of believers who are coordinated and built up to become a living Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Later, the Lord gave us further revelation to see that the church is not only the Body but also the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ephesians 1:22-23 says that the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then 2:15 says, Abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord created Jewish and Gentile believers in Himself into one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The new man cannot be an individual, because this verse says that the new man was created with two categories of believers: Jewish and Gentile.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, the new man is a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to verse 16, these two categories were reconciled in one Body to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The new man in verse 15 is the Body in verse 16.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In chapter 1 the Body is the church, and in chapter 2 the Body is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the above verses the church, the Body, and the new man refer to the same entity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church is the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ is the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are not only one Body but also one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For the one Body, life is needed, but for the one new man, a person is needed in addition to life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE CHURCH BEING THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>INDICATING THAT CHRIST IS OUR PERSON Our Old Man</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Having Been Crucified with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that Christ is not only our life but also our person.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ is making His home in our hearts with the desire to be not only our life but also our person.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our old man has been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Romans 6:6 says, Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him, and Galatians 2:20 says, I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our old man has been crucified with Christ, and now it is no longer our old man who lives, but it is Christ who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He desires to be our life and also our person.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ as our person is deeper than Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Receiving Christ Not as Power</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>but as Our Person</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>May the Lord have mercy on us and lead us into this new experience.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we dealt with our temper in the past, we would ask the Lord for power to overcome our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, now that we have received Christ as our person, we do not need to be concerned about the way to overcome our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It does not matter whether or not our old man lost his temper or whether he was meek or irritable.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>These things are over.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ is now our person.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hence, whether or not we lose our temper should not be our focus.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our focus should be to let Christ be our person.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We need to live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our focus is not whether we lose our temper but whether we take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our focus is not whether we love or hate others.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Our focus is to take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the past we would ask the Lord to give us the ability to love others.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Such a prayer does not seem wrong; however, it is religious.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As Christians, we know that we should love others, but since we are unable to do this, we depend on the Lord as our power, our ability, to love others.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is to ask the Lord to help us live by our old man as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In other words, we are still living by our old man, who is still here and is incapable of doing good but quite capable of doing evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Such prayers ask the Lord to empower us to do good and to reject evil.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, whether we did good or evil, we were still the person.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Formerly we were the person who did evil, but now we are the person who does good.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The only difference is that we now need the Lord Jesus to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This means that we receive Him as power, but we do not receive Him as our life and our person.</S>
