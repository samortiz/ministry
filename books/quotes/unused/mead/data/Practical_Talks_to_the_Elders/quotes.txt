[1]  The Need for the Focus of the Lord s Recovery
[2]  From what I have seen in going out to look at the situation and from what I have heard in fellowship from others, I have wondered if maybe the best we have is just like the Brethren assembly.
[3]  I tell you, I have the full assurance that what I have been sharing is what is on the Lord s heart.
[4]  However strong the opposition is against me, I believe the Lord has told me that this is what He wants and that I must let the saints and the brothers know that if they do not have this, they are not in the recovery.
[5]  But have we I speak from the depths of my being; I change the word we to you, singular you have you really seen a vision of God s eternal purpose, a vision of God s economy, of what God wants?
[6]  I surely hope, brothers, that we all here will be desperate.
[7]  How much is my daily life, my service to the Lord, my worship to God, my care of the church, and my fellowship with all the saints in this realization?
[8]  Am I in such a reality that, even if I talk with the saints about ordinary things, I bear a striking sign that my being, my person, my life, my living is all in this focus of God s economy?
[9]  I don t have the confidence that when I go to a church meeting there will be the focus of the Lord s central lane, of God s economy.
[10]  Now that this distraction is apparently over, the churches seem to be doing quite well, to be going on steadily.
[11]  From my observation, however, I would say that their attention is not fully centered on the focus.
[12]  Brothers, even if you visit five or ten churches, I doubt you will find one whose church life is really centered on the focus of God s economy.
[13]  I do not like to do that, but my burden is to tell you frankly and honestly that the actual condition of the churches is not that encouraging.
[14]  This is why I say we must pray desperately that we may see the Lord s real testimony today, His real recovery, His real move.
[15]  I think those of you who were with us in those years at Elden Hall will all agree with me that the recovery then was very pure.
[16]  I don t mean that all who were meeting with us had seen the focus; but the focus was there.
[17]  CHAPTER TWO THE PURENESS AND THE FOCUS THE CHINESE-SPEAKING MEETING
[18]  I feel burdened to release some messages in the Chinese language that can be sent out to every part of the earth where Chinese saints meet.
[19]  As to whether the Chinese-speaking saints in southern California come to these meetings, it is up to the churches.
[20]  I would like to say a word both to the churches and to the Chinese-speaking saints.
[21]  Thus, if you do not have this language difficulty, even if you are Chinese, you are not qualified to attend; that is, unless you have a burden for some Chinese-speaking ones.
[22]  In the Bay area, for instance, I did my best to avoid this trouble.
[23]  Some of you, I know, also tried to avoid this.
[24]  In fact, I am concerned that among some of you there is still the desire to avoid this.
[25]  If in your heart you are thinking, How good it will be if there is no Chinese-speaking meeting, you are trying to avoid this.
[26]  If you are unhappy with the church you are now attending and still think this is the time to start a church in your locality they all live in Palo Alto , this doesn t qualify you.
[27]  Before they came down last weekend, one of these four wrote me a long letter, asking why, if we preach the truth of one city, one church, we do not practice it.
[28]  Tonight I stand before you, about a hundred people, to say that it s hard for you to find anything of the church and the Lord s work related to me that is impure.
[29]  The prerequisite, however, in responsibility, in the eldership, in the leadership, is pureness.
[30]  If you are short of this, regardless of how careful you are, you will have trouble again and again.
[31]  If you check with the elders of the church in Anaheim here, I believe they will all agree that, whatever I do, whether I am happy or not happy, they never doubt my motive.
[32]  TAKING CARE OF EXTERNAL THINGS Necessary, but Not the Lord s Commission
[33]  Now I would like to share with you about Brother Nee s practice.
[34]  When I was preparing his biography, I collected a number of his writings to show how he worked.
[35]  Several times he mentions that the Lord s commission to him was not the external things of the work of the church life.
[36]  The Lord s commission to him was the testimony of Jesus, that is, to live a life of Christ in His death and resurrection.
[37]  Even the New Beginners Messages are not classified as part of Brother Nee s ministry under the Lord s commission; he specifically said the Lord had not commissioned him to give those messages.
[38]  In the last meeting I said that the church is the Body of Christ, that it is the fullness of the One who fills all in all, that it is the house of God, God manifested in the flesh, that it is the golden lampstand, that it is the bride, and that in its consummation it is the New Jerusalem.
[39]  What I have shared with you tonight is about the pureness and the focus.
[40]  We do need to have the external things like good meetings, proper Bible teaching, and good gospel preaching.
[41]  Thirdly, if you consider all of us who were there in the Lord s recovery in China, and then suddenly found that the mainland was lost, you will realize that thousands of us have been praying, crying to the Lord to remember that great country.
[42]  I give you this background so you will know why I have picked up this burden.
[43]  In the twenty years I have been in this country, I took no interest in the Chinese side.
[44]  As I prayed and considered the situation of the meetings, I recalled the revival that broke out in my city, Chefoo, in 1942.
[45]  But whatever you practice, whatever you experience today, must be the things of the New Testament ministry.
[46]  If you do not believe in this Lord Jesus Christ, you have no lord to believe in. If you don t worship this God because you don t want to worship the same God as Witness Lee , try to find another god to believe in. You will not be able to find one.
[47]  Again I say, to take this way to care for the church means that you have to sacrifice a lot.
[48]  I told her I surely realize my age, but I have offered my entire life for the recovery.
[49]  If there is a problem that I know is not solved, even if I lie down on my bed, I have no rest.
[50]  Brothers, I don t encourage you to sacrifice your health, your life, but in taking care of the church life do not consider your interest first.
[51]  I don t mean that you shouldn t take care of your family, but I mean that the church should come first.
[52]  I am pretty sure this prophecy will be fulfilled, unless you brothers who are elders sell yourselves not to the church but to the church where you serve.
[53]  In these days, whenever I have the time, I have been considering the Lord s recovery according to what I have seen all these past years.
[54]  As you know, it began there in China some sixty years ago, in 1922.
[55]  The first ten years I was not there, but later I heard the history.
[56]  What I fellowship with you tonight is based upon what I have seen and heard.
[57]  Because I do not have the time to visit the churches and help them directly, except in a limited way, I am burdened to put the things I have been considering into these practical talks and have them published.
[58]  In the New Testament we see firstly the unique Christ.
[59]  It is the Body of Christ, the church, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.
[60]  Let us consider the prominent apostles like Peter, John, Paul, and James.
[61]  Formerly I had an unconscious understanding that Peter s ministry was not the same as Paul s. However, while working on the Life-study of Peter, and in these recent days on the notes for John s Epistles, I have found out that these three great writers of the New Testament were all carrying out the one ministry.
[62]  Now that we have had the training on the Epistles of Peter, I think we can all see that though the terminology and presentation are different from Paul s, the ministry, or the focus of the ministry, is the same.
[63]  When I met Brother Nee, I realized that his work was in the same ministry as Paul s. Because of this, from the day that I met him I did everything as part of the one work.
[64]  We brothers who are taking the lead in the churches must see this focus clearly.
[65]  Prayer: We worship You that You have brought us all here tonight.
[66]  While things are quiet, there is a danger of losing the testimony.
[67]  Without the Spirit, we don t have the experience of Christ; if we don t have the experience of Christ, we don t have much life.
[68]  It is because on the one hand you are empty and on the other hand you will not give up.
[69]  You are taking care of a church, and the church has become empty, and you have become empty.
[70]  The New Testament does not give us a clear record of the families of the apostles or of the elders.
[71]  From Paul s words in 1 Corinthians 9:5, and also from Matthew 8:14, Mark 1:30, and Luke 4:38, we know that Peter had a wife; these are the only words in the New Testament concerning the families of the apostles.
[72]  In all the years I knew Brother Nee, I can testify that he never had any family friends among the saints.
[73]  As Mrs. Nee later testified, before they were married Brother Nee told her, I am taking you as my wife; I am not marrying you as a co-worker.
[74]  Of course, some have gone too far to the other extreme, saying that it is all up to the Lord s predestination so we don t need to do anything; if the Lord has not chosen our children, they will not be saved whatever we do.
[75]  These days I have been working on the three Epistles of John.
[76]  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, See, I have called by name Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all workmanship, to devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all workmanship.
[77]  And I, behold, I have given with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of everyone that is wisehearted I have given wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you lit.
[78]  If you do not have a heart to seek after the Lord s mind, to pick up the burden for the church life, God has no way to initiate anything with you.
[79]  But suppose you are Bezalel: you have the willingness to do something for God s building.
[80]  But you must realize that your natural capability has to be altogether abandoned.
[81]  God treasures your willingness, which He initiated, but your capability what you can do, what you know in God s estimation means nothing.
[82]  Elders in the church are not a special class; they do not have a special rank.
[83]  But this kind of human thought may have invaded us already; we may have in our understanding the thought that we have the rank of elders, that we are a special class.
[84]  In a doctrinal way it is easy to understand these things, but in practice it is only as you are open with complete emptiness to the Lord and praying continuously, that you will recognize how much honey you have brought in. You must put an end to that.
[85]  While I was in Houston for the Chinese-speaking conference, I got quite a burden for the Chinese population, especially the Christians.
[86]  I am grateful to the Lord that when I was young and seeking after biblical knowledge, He sovereignly brought me into touch with the Brethren teachings.
[87]  Probably from 1950 the light began to come about mingling.
[88]  In the inner life teachings of past centuries, the main word used to describe our relationship with God is the word union.
[89]  However, through the experience of the divine revelation in the Bible concerning the Triune God being our life, I came to realize that our relationship with God is not just a union; it is a mingling.
[90]  When I first began to minister on the matter of mingling, I didn t realize the word was mentioned in typology; I thought it was a new term used in my message.
[91]  The clearest writing in the New Testament regarding this, especially in John s writings, is John 14 through 17.
[92]  Even after all the messages I have given in Stuttgart and New York concerning the divine dispensing as revealed in these chapters, I still feel the burden has not gone.
[93]  In chapter fourteen the Lord begins by saying, I go to prepare a place for you...that where I am you also may be vv.
[94]  Thus, the Lord firstly told His disciples that He is in the Father and the Father is in Him; when He speaks, the Father does His works v. 10 . After this He said, I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter...the Spirit of reality...He abides with you and shall be in you vv.
[95]  The background to the Lord s word here is that the disciples were concerned about His leaving them, because He had said He was going to the Father v. 12 . The Lord was telling them they did not need to be concerned about His absence.
[96]  Every day I find I must confess to the Lord that I have not applied the Spirit enough, that I haven t walked in the Spirit sufficiently.
