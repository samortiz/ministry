   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST, OUR SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:23 Peter says that God the Father is the One who always judges righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that He governs in a righteous way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ put His trust in this righteous One.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this reason, Peter says that when Christ was on earth, He kept committing all to God the Father, who judges righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 24 says, Who Himself carried up our sins in His body onto the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose bruise you were healed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse speaks of Christ as our Savior, our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As our Savior, Christ carried up our sins in His body onto the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The tree is the cross made of wood, a Roman instrument of capital punishment for the execution of malefactors, as prophesied in the Old Testament Deut 21:23; Gal 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Literally, having died to sins means being away from sins; hence, having died to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the death of Christ, we have died to sins Rom 6:8, 10-11, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have died to sin so that we might live to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This living to righteousness is in the resurrection of Christ Eph 2:6; John 14:19; 2 Tim 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The bruise in verse 24 is a suffering that resulted in death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to Genesis 3:15, the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent, and the serpent would bruise the heel of the woman s seed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The bruising in Genesis 3:15 is related to the bruise in 2:24.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to verse 24, we have been healed by Christ s bruise.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the healing of death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We were dead Eph 2:1 , but Christ s suffering of death healed our death so that we may live in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>KEPT AWAY FROM SINS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>AND LIVING TO RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have pointed out that the phrase having died to sins literally means being away from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Christ carried up our sins onto the cross and died, that death accomplished many things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The death of Christ terminated us, and this termination can keep us away from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The best way for people to be kept from sins or from sin is for them to be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No matter how many sins a person may commit, once he has died, death separates him from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Peter speaks of being away from sins; Paul speaks of the one who has died being free from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through Christ s death we can be kept away from sins so that we may live to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Apparently, being kept away from sin terminates us; actually, it enlivens us so that we may live to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we have pointed out, by Christ s bruise we have been healed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that His death heals our death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Most of us are accustomed to Paul s terms, but we are not familiar with many of Peter s expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 24 alone, Peter uses a number of unusual expressions: the carrying up of our sins in Christ s body onto the tree, being away from sin to live to righteousness, and being healed by Christ s bruise.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christians do not use many of Peter s expressions in conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I hope that after reading these messages, you will begin to use Peter s terms and expressions in your fellowship and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 24 indicates that, as fallen human beings, we were dead and full of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But Christ put our sins upon Himself and carried them up onto the tree, the cross, where He suffered God s righteous judgment for all our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ s death on the cross was a bruise, and that bruise, that death, has healed our death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now we have become alive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the one hand, Christ s bruise that heals us keeps us away from sins through His death; on the other hand, this healing enlivens us so that we may live to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to our dead, fallen nature, our intention is toward sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But now that Christ has died to heal our death and to make us alive, we have a different intention.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because of the life of Christ within us, we live always with the intention toward righteousness, the inclination toward righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is our Savior, the One who died on the cross to terminate us and to heal our death wound.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The subjective aspect of the cross continues in our experience today by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The life-giving Spirit is working within us continually to carry out the subjective aspect of Christ s cross in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Daily we are undergoing the inward working of the cross of Christ, and daily we are being made alive so that we may live to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, it is not difficult to overcome sins, because through Christ s death we are being kept away from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His death has drawn a separating line. between us and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Being kept away from sins, now we are alive.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no need for us to strive or to try to energize ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We simply live, and this living always has an inclination toward righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the experience of our Savior saving us daily.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This understanding of Peter s word is according to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not have only the objective cross, but the subjective cross as well.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The objective cross needs to become subjective to us in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This depends upon the working of the life-giving Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we call on the name of the Lord and have fellowship with Him, the life-giving Spirit operates within us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Spontaneously we experience the subjective working of the cross to make a separation between us and sins so that we automatically live to righteousness.</S>
