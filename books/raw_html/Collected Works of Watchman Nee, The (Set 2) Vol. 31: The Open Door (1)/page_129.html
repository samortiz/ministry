<h2 class="head2">Ping-Yang,<br />Chekiang Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings to X:</p><p>Thank the Lord. Through The Open Door I have learned about the situation of the brothers and sisters and the condition of the churches, and feel very comforted! The region of Ping-Yang, Tai-Sun, and Fu-Ding is still very peaceful. All the works of the church continue toward the brothers and sisters and toward the Gentiles. Wenchow experienced terrible bombings. The brothers and sisters all fled to the countryside, so the church in the city became very empty. It is now gradually being recovered. Please do not worry. There are many poor brothers and sisters who experience much lack in their living. Some of the brothers in the region of Muo-Cheng, Ping-Yang, and Nan-Gang used to work in the pottery factories. The pottery industry has completely shut down because there is a blockade on shipping. As a result, these brothers have suffered the loss of their jobs. Thank the Lord. Although they are suffering, they are still relying on the Lord wholeheartedly, and they are living from day to day. This was how they lived in the past, and it is how they will live in the future. The Lord is the Alpha and the Omega. He is our only eternal trust. He is to be praised!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chen Chin-fa<br />April 4</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Greetings to X:</p><p>We feel so privileged to receive The Open Door, Issue Nos. 1-5. Please do not worry. The truth that Brother Nee presented in the second issue is very precious. We read it several times. We also see that the brothers are not afraid to suffer for the sake of the gospel. They dare to go into the remote regions, and we should remember them in prayer. We are sending X dollars for the printing of this publication. We hope you can send us an extra copy of future issues. May you be blessed with peace.</p><p>Your unworthy brothers,<br />Fan Yun-shan, Wen Jing-yi, Fan Pei-jen,<br />and all the brothers<br />April 6<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Chuenchow, Fukien Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear brothers in the Lord:</p><p>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ! We were led by the Lord to hold a conference in Chuenchow on March 16. We thank and praise Him for the grace and leading He gave through it, and we trust Him for our future in the course we must run and the work we must accomplish. Dear brothers, we are deeply conscious of our many shortages and failures in the past and of our weak and pitiful condition in the present. Thank the Lord! His grace is sufficient for us. We can please Him through His grace. Dear brothers, please pray much for us. The work in all places in Fukien has been cared for by the Lord since the beginning of the war. The churches in Lung-Yen, Changchow, Kulangsu, Ho-Shan, Tung-An, Din-Mei, Wu-Lu, Chai-Lin, Shui-Tou, An-Hai, Ban-Ling (An-Hsi), Shi-Shee, Chuenchow, Tseng-Mao (Hwei-An), Feng-Ting, Sien-You, Pu-Tien, Han-Jiang, Yu-Si, and Fu-Ching have all been preserved. The number of saved ones has increased. The regions of Dong-Jang of Fu-Ching, Dong-Yuan of Hwei-An, Juang-Shan of An-Hsi, Ying-Du of Nan-An, and Gu-Jai of Tung-An are new fields for the gospel. We hope that the Lord will revive His work in An-Hsi, Yung-Chun, Deh-Hua, Chang-Pu, and many places in western Fukien. Our conference ended on the evening of the twenty-third. We had three mornings of fasting and prayer with the brothers and sisters of Chuenchow. We deeply believe that the Lord heard all our prayers. Glory be to Him. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Wang Deng-ming, Chen Ke-san, Chai Tze-chung,<br />Deng Tze-cheng, Han Jin-siu, Lan Jin-yang,<br />Wu Den-jieh, Keh Lien-min<br />March 24</p>
