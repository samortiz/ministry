	 <h2 class="head2">Pastor Yu&rsquo;s Visits</h2>
<p>Pastor Yu was truly saved, and even though he was not so clear about the truth, he was a very proper person. When he came to visit me, he often would say nothing more than, &ldquo;I am here to see you.&rdquo; Sometimes, he would gently convey an invitation to attend the Sunday morning service. His words were not so direct, but I did not respond. He would come again a week later with the same approach; he would not speak much, but he would have a smiling face. Even though I knew that he wanted me to go to the Sunday service, I would not go. One day he came and just said, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, the New Year is coming. I am afraid that I will not be able to come and see you for the next few weeks. After the New Year, I will come again to visit you.&rdquo; I truly believe that Pastor Yu was praying for me during this time, and no doubt, my sister was desperately praying for me because she knew my condition. At that time, I was not saved, I was not attracted to the Lord, and I did not agree with Christianity. This is why my sister had such a burden for me and asked Pastor Yu to visit me.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Work of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>In 1925 I was nineteen years old and full of vitality. On the second day of the Chinese New Year, which was a Lord&rsquo;s Day, I should have gone out to have a good time, like the worldly people. However, something wonderful happened that day. When I woke up that morning, I had no interest in pursuing pleasure; in fact, I had no motivation to do anything. My mother earnestly hoped that I would attend the Sunday service, so that morning she prepared a delicious breakfast. After I was finished, she casually asked, &ldquo;Today is the second day of the New Year; do you plan to go anywhere?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I was thinking about going to Pastor Yu&rsquo;s Sunday service.&rdquo; My mother, of course, readily agreed with me, so I put on my Chinese long gown and went to the service. I had not been to a service for years, and the only reason I was willing to return was because of Pastor Yu&rsquo;s visits.</p>
<p>When we go to visit the saints, it is often better not to speak than to speak, and if we have to speak, we should not speak too much. All we need is a smiling countenance and a short visit of about half an hour. The Holy Spirit can do the rest. After we visit, we should not go back too soon. It is not unreasonable to wait for two weeks because another visit after a short period of time is like a doctor giving too much medicine to a sick patient. We do not need to be quick or rushed; rather, we should trust in the work of the Holy Spirit. We must believe that the Holy Spirit will work in this kind of visitation.</p>
<p>That year, on the second day of the New Year, I attended the service at Pastor Yu&rsquo;s denomination. Although the sermon was not outstanding and I did not really understand it, I felt that it would be good to go every week. Therefore, I made a resolution: &ldquo;From now on I will not go and play. I will work hard on my studies to receive a good education, and every Lord&rsquo;s Day I will go to this chapel to sit for an hour and a half.&rdquo; From then on I went to Sunday service every week. Three or four months later, Pastor Yu announced, &ldquo;Every season we have a baptism here. Whoever is willing may come next Saturday for an interview. If we feel that you are ready, we will baptize you the next morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Saturday came, I went. Pastor Yu was very familiar with me, and he introduced me to everyone, saying, &ldquo;There is no problem with Mr. Lee. His sister is studying in the seminary, his mother is a church member, and their household has been zealous for several generations, so he can be baptized.&rdquo; Thus, I passed the interview. Actually, I did not understand anything at the time. I knew a little about the Lord Jesus dying on the cross for me and that He loved me, but I did not know much beyond this. Since they were all so happy, I received the baptism by sprinkling and was admitted to the denomination that Lord&rsquo;s Day. I surely did not have much feeling, and I had never prayed once; I merely did what the denomination told me to do.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving the Lord&rsquo;s Calling<br />
and Consecrating Myself</h2>
<p>Two or three weeks after my baptism, an announcement was made about a young sister named Peace Wang, who was raised in China and was very powerful in preaching the gospel in Shanghai and Hangchow. All the local denominations jointly invited her to Chefoo, and although I did not care about the gospel, I was curious and wanted to hear this young sister preach. When I went into the meeting, I heard her speak about Satan usurping man based on Exodus 1, which speaks of Pharaoh usurping the children of Israel and not letting them serve God. Although she was only five or six years older than I, I was shocked by her speaking and singing in the meeting. I was born in Christianity, and I had heard many preachers, but her preaching was different from what I had heard in the past. There were about one thousand in the meeting, and as soon as the singing of the hymns began, many were subdued. I was no exception. I was affected deeply. At that time I had just made up my mind to concentrate on the pursuit of my studies in order to be successful in this world. I was anxious, restless, and intent on gaining the world. The words in Sister Peace Wang&rsquo;s message spoke directly to my current situation, and I was truly captured.</p>
<p>I will never forget that day. After the meeting was over, while I was on my way home, I stopped at a corner and looked up to heaven and said, &ldquo;O God, I believe in You, and I want You. If someone would give me the whole world, I would not want it. I only want You.&rdquo; I was determined to take my Bible and preach the gospel from village to village after I graduated from college. I did not want to do anything but preach the gospel; this was my prayer to the Lord when I was called. Little did I know that the Lord would bring me not only from village to village but also from continent to continent. Surely this is His leading.</p>
<p>Speaking about my salvation and calling by the Lord almost brings tears to my eyes. I will always remember Pastor Yu and be grateful to him. Later the Lord raised up a church in my hometown, and I preached the truth there. Around 1932 or 1933, Pastor Yu came to attend our meeting. He was so happy to see that a young man whom he had visited was preaching the truth. His visits were truly effective.</p>
<p>As long as we visit people, this is good enough. Many times, our words are not appropriate, and because we do not know their inner condition, it is easy to hurt them and cause them to feel bad. However, if we go with a cheerful countenance, they will be comforted and touched. They will feel that neither the Lord nor the church has forgotten them. This will give the Holy Spirit a great opportunity to work in them.</p>
<p>May we all grasp this principle. In the matter of visiting, we must first have a burden to pray and then visit according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading. It is good as long as we go. Our going is enough. This will bring comfort and encouragement to the saints, and they will sense both love and joy. We should not expect quick results in visiting. Looking for quick results often leads to the opposite effect and brings in much frustration. There is no need to exert too much energy; we only need to go and visit with a burden. I surely learned a great lesson related to this from Pastor Yu&rsquo;s visits.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE LORD&rsquo;S HEART AS OUR HEART</h2>
<p>We must take the Lord&rsquo;s heart as our heart and treasure the lost sheep (Luke 15:4-6), loving the brothers and sisters who have not been to a meeting for a long time and paying the price to find them. Although there is a price to pay in visiting people, requiring not only the expense of time and energy but even a considerable amount of thought, the price the Lord paid was much higher. We must have a spirit to lay these dormant saints on our shoulders like lambs and bring them back to the church. We must take outward actions and bear an inward burden. In this way, sooner or later they will be brought back to the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RELYING ON THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>As we seek out the saints, we must rely on the work of the Holy Spirit. I truly believe that my return to the meetings was altogether the work of the Holy Spirit; it was the Holy Spirit who brought me back. The work of the Spirit is likened in Luke 15 to a woman who lights a lamp to seek a lost coin. The Holy Spirit is able to shine upon the saints with the Lord&rsquo;s word and is willing to search for them until they are found (vv. 8-9)</p>
<h2 class="head1">LOVING PEOPLE WITH THE FATHER&rsquo;S LOVE</h2>
<p>We must love others with the Father&rsquo;s love. We all know the story of the father who eagerly welcomed his prodigal son in chapter 15 of the Gospel of Luke. When the son came to himself and thought about returning home, he considered the words of repentance that he would speak to his father (v. 18). On the day he returned home to his father, he said, &ldquo;I am no longer worthy to be called your son&rdquo; (v. 21), but the father said to his slaves, &ldquo;Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. And bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry, because this son of mine was dead and lives again&rdquo; (vv. 22-24). This shows that the father had only love toward his son.</p>
<p>We must take the Lord&rsquo;s heart as our heart. As our brothers and sisters return, our hearts must be filled with love for them, and we must minister Christ to them. The father spoke only of slaying the fattened calf in celebration of his son&rsquo;s return; he did not mention things from the past or touch his son&rsquo;s wounds. He forgot the past. Even if the dormant saints want to bring up their past, we must let them know that it is not necessary, because of the Lord&rsquo;s grace. We should only minister Christ to them. The robe in Luke 15 is Christ, and the fattened calf is also Christ. Thus, as our brothers and sisters return, we can minister what we have experienced and enjoyed of Christ according to the need. In this way, we will gradually recover them. I hope that we will receive this burden and actively stir up the small groups to seek out, visit, and restore the saints who have been absent from the meetings for a long time.</p>
