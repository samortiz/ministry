<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of five messages given by Brother Witness Lee in fellowship with serving ones in Taipei around 1952. The messages were originally published from 1964 through 1965 in <em>The Ministry of the Word.</em></p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">VISION AND REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 26:19; Gal. 1:11-12, 16; 2 Tim. 2:21; 3:14-15; Jer. 15:19; Job 42:3-5; Matt. 5:8; 2 Cor. 3:15-18</h1>
<p>A person who serves and works for the Lord must be called, and he must have a vision and revelation. Seeing a vision and receiving revelation are necessary matters for all the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISION AND REVELATION OF PAUL</h2>
<p>Paul is a pattern of a worker for the Lord in the New Testament, and he often spoke of his service. In Acts 26:19 he said, &ldquo;I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.&rdquo; This shows that his service and work came from a vision.</p>
<p>In order to serve God, one must have a vision from God. If a household servant works as he pleases and does not listen to the owner of the house, he will not be useful, and it would not be wise to hire such a person. A good servant asks what he needs to do because his work is not related to his own things. A servant should be willing to follow directions. This is a basic point in our service. It is a fearful thing when a brother brings only things that he sees as being good and proper into the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>All the education, teaching, and instruction that Paul received from his youth came from the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law. When he was serving God and persecuting Christians as Saul of Tarsus, his mind and even his whole being were constituted with these items. For Saul, the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law were not merely the content of his education; they were his very being. In his person he represented the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law. Without receiving a heavenly vision, it would not have been possible for Paul to bring anything but the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law into his service to God, because these things constituted his very being.</p>
<p>Consequently, when the Lord called Saul, He flashed a light around him that caused him to fall on the ground (9:3-4). When Saul fell to the ground, the elements of the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law also fell. As soon as the light of God&rsquo;s New Testament flashed around him, he could not stand; he fell completely. His entire being and all that was constituted into his being also fell. The Old Testament fell, Judaism fell, and the law fell. Everything within him fell.</p>
<p>After Saul fell, he asked two questions. First, he asked, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; (v. 5; 22:8). Saul was not an atheist. He believed in God; we may even say that he believed in God very much. His belief in God was the source of his zeal for persecuting the believers. Although he was very zealous for the God of his forefathers, he did not truly know God. This shows that it is possible to have much biblical knowledge but not know God. Even if Saul could have recited the entire Old Testament, he did not know God. He was zealous for God, and he knew the Scriptures, but he did not know God. In fact, he was even opposing God. Apparently, he was serving God; actually, he was opposing God. The Lord told him that he was kicking against the goads, like an ox that does not submit to its master&rsquo;s yoke (26:14). Saul&rsquo;s knowledge of God was so limited that when the light flashed around him and he fell, he did not know who was speaking to him from the heavens. He asked, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; The Lord replied, &ldquo;I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you persecute&rdquo; (22:8). Saul thought he was persecuting Christians, but the Lord said that he was persecuting Him, because the Lord was living in the Christians whom Saul was persecuting, such as Peter, James, and Stephen. Saul thought that he was persecuting Christians, but the Lord told him that he was persecuting the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>With this realization, Saul immediately asked a second question: &ldquo;What shall I do, Lord?&rdquo; (v. 10). The first question relates to knowing the Lord; the second relates to receiving the Lord&rsquo;s vision. The Lord said, &ldquo;Rise up and go into Damascus, and there it will be told to you concerning all the things which have been appointed to you to do&rdquo; (v. 10). From this point forward he began to have a vision. This vision cut him off from his previous service and brought him into the New Testament service. The Old Testament, Judaism, and the law, that is, his religious knowledge from his past, was terminated. This cutting off was signified by the outward blinding of his eyes. From that day forward his outward consideration of the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law was &ldquo;blinded,&rdquo; and the one who led others to oppose Christians now needed someone to lead him to Damascus. His outer religious &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; became blind, but his inner &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; were enlightened through revelation.</p>
<p>Whether we are newly saved or have been saved for many years, and whether we are an elder, a deacon, or a co-worker, our service will be according to God&rsquo;s standard only if our being has &ldquo;fallen&rdquo; to the ground and our &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; have been blinded. Without the blinding of our &ldquo;eyes,&rdquo; our past will not be terminated, and our inner &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; will not be enlightened to see the vision of God and receive the revelation of God.</p>
<p>This is the problem among Christians today. Many Christians are like Saul of Tarsus before the light flashed around him: their outer eyes are open, but their inner &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; are blind. There is much chaos in Christianity today, because many people have never been blinded and have never fallen to the ground. They bring religious things, like the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law, into their service. Hence, they cannot receive God&rsquo;s vision and revelation, and their service is related only to religious things, not to a heavenly vision.</p>
<p>Paul testified to King Agrippa that he was not disobedient to the heavenly vision from the day that he met the Lord on his way to Damascus (26:19). Paul&rsquo;s way of serving God came from a heavenly vision. When he saw this vision, the things of the Old Testament came to an end, and he began to take the New Testament way. This can be seen in relation to the practice of circumcision, which will never be forsaken by the Jews. After receiving a heavenly vision, Paul did not insist on this practice (Gal. 5:2-4, 6, 11). When he said to King Agrippa, &ldquo;I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,&rdquo; the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law no longer governed him. When he abandoned Judaism, he offended the Jews, and the Jews denounced him. However, Paul did not abandon Judaism according to his own will but because he saw a vision. He was bound with chains and made a prisoner because he was obedient to the heavenly vision (Acts 21:33; 26:29). In order to maintain the new, he had to abandon the old. In order to run the new way, he had to turn away from the old way.</p>
<p>In Galatians 1:15-16 Paul says, &ldquo;It pleased God...to reveal His Son in me that I might announce Him as the gospel among the Gentiles.&rdquo; Paul received more than an outward vision concerning a way; he received an inward revelation concerning life. When he said, &ldquo;I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,&rdquo; he was speaking of the way of his service, and when he spoke of God revealing His Son in him, he was speaking of inward life. He came to know Christ as life in his service to God.</p><h2 class="head1">VISION AND REVELATION<br />
BEING THE WAY AND THE LIFE OF SERVICE</h2>
<p>We need a vision for the way of our service and a revelation for the life of our service. Saul&rsquo;s way of serving God was not sinful, but it was a way that was according to the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law. When the heavenly light flashed around him, he knew that he could no longer take his old way. His old practices had to be abandoned, and he turned completely in his way of serving God. He did not pursue his former course; rather, he stopped. Nevertheless, it was not enough for him to change his outward way; his inner life also needed to change. His old way was unacceptable, and his old life had to be terminated.</p>
<p>Many in Christianity focus on the light that flashed around Paul on his way to Damascus, but few focus on the light of life that he received. Many speak of Paul&rsquo;s not being disobedient to the heavenly vision, but they miss his word in Galatians 1:16 concerning God revealing His Son in him. Working for the Lord involves more than an outward way or practice; it involves the matter of an inner life as well.</p>
<p>For example, some argue whether baptism should be by immersion or by sprinkling. I often tell people that baptism is not merely a practice; it is a matter that speaks of knowing the Lord inwardly in His death and resurrection. It is pointless if we merely make a change in an outward practice, but our inner life remains unchanged. If we change the broth but not the medicine in the broth, there will be no impact on the person who is sick. There is no value in changing outward things if there is no inward change. We need vision for our outward way and revelation for our inner life. Our way must be heavenly, whereas our life must be Christ.</p>
<p>A friend in the Lord once asked me, &ldquo;Why does your church not take interest in social issues? It is as if you are floating in the air above the earth.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I am a servant of God in order to speak for God; how can I take an interest in social issues? How can I be involved with earthly matters?&rdquo; A heavenly vision always makes people heavenly. The church is heavenly, and it should not be defiled by earthly things. Social customs and worldly practices are earthly, human matters; they are not matters related to the church. Although the church walks on the earth, she is not earthly; she walks a heavenly way on earth. The life of the church is also heavenly; it is Christ Himself. The church has a heavenly way and the life of Christ.</p>
<p>We must have vision and revelation in order to serve God. The way to serve God comes from the vision, and the life to serve God comes from revelation. Nothing human should be brought into the service to God, that is, nothing from our past, nothing that is Chinese, nothing that is foreign, nothing that is old, and even nothing that is new. No religious system, no person, no human method, no social practice, and no personal ideas are allowed in the service to the Lord. In his service as Saul, Paul brought the things from the Old Testament into his service, the things given by God to his fathers. From a human perspective, there is nothing better than the things that Saul brought into his service. We can bring in things that are Socratic or Confucian in nature, but these things cannot compare to the things of the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law, things that God wanted Saul to abandon. If God did not want these things, how could He have any regard for things that are merely social, worldly, and human? Simply because something reflects a current trend does not mean that it should be brought into the service of the church. The heavenly vision stops the earthly practices and methods of God&rsquo;s serving ones. The heavenly vision adjusts us.</p>
<p>In contrast, revelation causes us know Christ inwardly. Men such as Socrates, Confucius, Mencius, and even Bertrand Russell have spoken many words. However, we do not preach the words of men; we preach Christ Himself. Christ is the Word. John 1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God...And the Word became flesh&rdquo; (vv. 1, 14). The Word in these verses is not objective but subjective. We are not preaching dead letters, dead teachings, dead creeds, or dead doctrines. We are preaching the living Jesus, the living Christ, that is, the Lord Himself. Our speaking cannot be understood by mere mental exercise or outward Bible reading; rather, God must reveal His Son in us so that we may know the Son of God who is our life. This was the content of Paul&rsquo;s preaching. The source of his preaching came from a heavenly vision, and the content of his preaching came from revelation. His way was heavenly, and his content was the living Christ Himself.</p>
<p>Some Christian groups show films at their gospel meetings to boost their low attendance, and they advertise in order to increase the number of attendees. Then they show the film after the message so that attendees have to listen to the message first. This often causes the attendees to murmur about being forced to listen to a message. Some even leave before the film starts. When the film is finally shown, the content of the message is forgotten. When I speak to the brothers about this, I ask, &ldquo;Why do they do this?&rdquo; Certainly this practice does not come from a heavenly vision. We should preach the living Lord Himself, and our way of preaching should be heavenly and spiritual. Even if other Christian groups take the worldly way of using films to appeal to people, we should not adopt this practice.</p>
<p>Recently, the brothers and sisters have formed gospel teams and are going out with bass drums to preach the gospel enthusiastically. Nevertheless, within me there is a question: &ldquo;Is this sounding of bass drums according to a heavenly vision? Can it withstand the shining of the heavenly vision? Is the practice of gathering people through the sounding of a bass drum heavenly or earthly? Is there a heavenly power that is unsettling people and inclining them to hear the gospel, or are we merely summoning a crowd with drums?&rdquo; Some brothers say, &ldquo;Drumming is right; on the day of Pentecost men were gathered by a sound out of heaven as in Acts 2:2.&rdquo; Yes, they were gathered by sounds, but where did the sound originate from&mdash;heaven or earth?</p>
<p>This does not mean that we must never use drums; I am even responsible for starting gospel teams in 1948 in Shanghai and Nanking. Strictly speaking, the only question that matters is whether our way has a heavenly source. I am not against the going out of gospel teams, but we must see a vision and have a revelation in our service. We cannot bring worldly ways, human methods, social practices, or even ancient or modern ways into the service. We must not bring any human ways into the service.</p>
<p>It is not enough to have an outward way; we must also have life inwardly. God wants us to preach outwardly according to His inner life. God does not need us to preach the doctrine of baptism but to preach the reality of baptism, which is the crucified and resurrected Christ who is our life. With a heavenly vision the way to serve God will be clear, and with revelation the content of our service will be proper.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING A VISION TO SERVE THE LORD</h2>
<p>All God&rsquo;s serving ones must have a vision. From the Old Testament to the New Testament, every serving one of God had a vision. Abel offered sheep based on vision and revelation. Cain&rsquo;s offering of the fruit of the ground, however, was not according to vision or revelation. Many Bible readers feel that God was unfair to Cain. Both brothers brought an offering, but God had regard only for Abel&rsquo;s offering, not for Cain&rsquo;s offering (Gen. 4:3-6). When I first read this account, I felt that way, but gradually I realized that Abel offered sheep according to a vision, whereas Cain offered something out of himself. Abel&rsquo;s offering was based on a vision; God showed him the way, and he made an offering according to God&rsquo;s way. Thus, his offering was accepted by God (3:21; Heb. 11:4). Cain followed his own way with no regard for God&rsquo;s heart. Thus, God could not accept his offering. This can be likened to a servant doing something with no regard for his master&rsquo;s instructions. No master would hire such a servant.</p>
<p>Noah built the ark because he received a vision from God, not because he had a personal dream. In regard to the ark, he did according to all that God commanded him (Gen. 6:13-22). Similarly, Abraham&rsquo;s decision to leave Ur of the Chaldeans was not initiated by a personal decision but by a vision that he received from God (12:1-4).</p>
<p>The children of Israel were brought out of Egypt by Moses because he was sent by God, who said to him, &ldquo;I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt&rdquo; (Exo. 3:10). Later, God established the passover and, through Moses, instructed the children of Israel to prepare the lamb, to put its blood on the doorposts and lintel, and to eat the flesh of the lamb and the unleavened bread with their loins girded, sandals on their feet, and a staff in their hand (12:1-14) so that they could go out from the Egyptians (11:1-8; 14:1-31). All this was according to a vision that God gave to Moses. God commanded him, and he brought the children of Israel out according to God&rsquo;s command. After bringing the children of Israel into the wilderness, Moses did not presume to set up the tabernacle, altar, Ark, and golden lampstand according to his own pattern. Rather, he received revelation from God during the forty days that he was in God&rsquo;s presence. Moses built according to this heavenly pattern, and he set up the priesthood according God&rsquo;s instruction (24:12, 17-18; 25:1&mdash;31:11; 35:1&mdash;40:38). This involved service with revelation.</p>
<p>When Joshua succeeded Moses, God said to him, &ldquo;Arise, and cross over this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land which I am giving to them, to the children of Israel...Be strong and take courage, for you will cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give to them&rdquo; (Josh. 1:2, 6). When God revealed, Joshua acted. Samuel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel also were prophets with vision. No prophet served God without vision and revelation.</p>
<p>This was the situation in the Old Testament, but even more, it was the situation in the New Testament. The Gospels record the Lord Jesus leading His disciples for three and a half years, giving them vision and revelation so that they would receive heavenly sight. When the Lord died and resurrected, the Spirit of reality guided the disciples further into all the reality (John 16:13). The Epistles of Paul are full of vision and revelation (2 Cor. 12:1; Eph. 3:3-5). This is especially true of Revelation, the last book of the New Testament, which was written by the apostle John. <em>Revelation</em> in Greek means &ldquo;an unveiling of a mystery that has been hidden.&rdquo; The Lord showed John great revelations through many visions and signs, which became the content of the book of Revelation. Hence, the New Testament, from the Gospels to Revelation, is full of visions and revelations that God gave to man. We must have vision and revelation in order to serve God today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO SEE A VISION</h2>
<p>How can we see a vision? What is the way to receive a revelation? Although the circumstances related to seeing a vision and receiving a revelation are not the same for every person, the principles are the same. Visions come from God; they do not depend upon anything of our self. If God wants us to see, we will see; if God does not let us see, we cannot see. Nevertheless, we still bear some responsibility related to our heart, to our willingness to let go of worthless things, to wait on the Lord, to be pure in heart, and to be open to the Lord.</p>
<p>Although Paul was not seeking visions or revelations, God gave him a revelation (Acts 9:1-6). This was not only the case with Paul but also with Moses. Moses had completely forgotten about the children of Israel when he was shepherding sheep on Mount Horeb. Nevertheless, God came and charged him to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt (Exo. 3:1-10). Neither Paul nor Moses was seeking visions, but God gave them visions. It may seem as if they had no heart for God, but when we carefully look at the Old Testament and the New Testament, we can see that both Moses and Paul had a heart for God. Before Moses saw a vision from God, he struck down an Egyptian in an effort to deliver the children of Israel with his own strength. Even though he failed and fled to the wilderness (2:11-15), God remembered Moses&rsquo; heart for His people. Although his way was wrong, his heart was acceptable to God. The psalm of Moses says, &ldquo;The days of our years are seventy years, / Or, if because of strength, eighty years&rdquo; (Psa. 90:10). According to his own evaluation, his life was over when he was eighty years old. His way and his strength were completely gone. Nevertheless, this was the time when God gave him a vision, and God&rsquo;s vision was based on the desire that Moses had expressed forty years earlier. Paul&rsquo;s way was wrong as well; he was like an ox kicking the goads. This, however, did not mean that he did not want to serve God. Although Paul did not know God before he was saved, he had a heart to serve God. In this service, he even killed Christians. With even this misguided zeal, God gave Paul a vision. It is hard to find a case in the Bible of someone who had no heart for God suddenly receiving a vision. At a minimum, a person needs to have some heart for God in order to receive a vision.</p>
<p>Second, in order to see a vision, one must forsake the worthless and choose the precious (2 Tim. 2:21; Jer. 15:19). Everything of God is precious; everything that is not of God is worthless. God&rsquo;s children today cannot see visions or receive revelations, because they regard worthless things as precious. Some brothers and sisters have been in the church for nearly two decades, but their knowledge of the Lord is the same as it was twenty years ago because they treasure what is in their hands, whether it be material riches, business, or family matters, or even the spiritual lessons they learned years ago.</p>
<p>It is odd that they do not hold on to the precious but to the worthless. Even when they listen to messages, they do not receive the precious things. This is like eating the rind of a watermelon rather than the flesh of the watermelon. Some people cannot hear the central, precious word but only the superficial word. For example, a brother once asked me, &ldquo;If Jacob had four wives, why do we say that a man should have only one wife?&rdquo; I do not like to reply to these kinds of questions. Such questions are not even &ldquo;rinds&rdquo;; they are like mud on a watermelon rind. I wanted to say, &ldquo;David murdered someone, took his wife, and committed adultery. Should we learn from this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have seen many brothers and sisters who firmly hold on to what they have, but their unwillingness to let go prevents them from seeing visions. People who let go will see visions just like Paul, who dropped the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law. Only such persons can receive visions.</p>
<p>We must have a heart and be willing to let go of the worthless things. We must drop whatever we have from the past. God told Abraham to offer up Isaac, even though Isaac had been given to him from God (Gen. 22:2). This shows that even having Isaac was not equal to having God. If Abraham had refused to give up Isaac, he would have been regarding the worthless, and he would have forsaken God.</p>
<p>I would ask the elders if they regard the brothers and sisters in the church as their own children? Such a regard is right, because without such a heart, the elders are, at most, &ldquo;stepfathers.&rdquo; Every responsible brother in the church should regard the brothers and sisters as their biological children. However, if God asks the elders to leave their locality and go elsewhere, would they be willing to part from the saints? Even this should be regarded as a forsaking of the worthless for the precious. The church is precious, but in comparison to God, what is more precious? Whenever we hold firmly on to something other than God, we are finished. We do not even need to speak of holding on to matters such as the world, money, fame, or fortune. Once we hold on to something other than God, we are finished, and we will receive no vision.</p>
<p>If a brother bearing responsibility in the church cannot give up his opinions and cannot get along with the other brothers, he is finished. When I was in mainland China, brothers and sisters often said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you have a problem. You hardly ever listen to other people&rsquo;s reasonings. The more they reason, the less you listen.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You are right, but only in one respect. I do not mind listening to other people, but a person who likes to reason cannot receive any help. Hence, when a person holds on to his reasonings, there is nothing to be gained from listening.&rdquo; A person cannot be full of light when he holds on to something worthless and refuses to let go of it. Even if he is one hundred percent correct, he should not hold on to his correct reasonings. We should choose the precious and drop the worthless in every matter and on every point.</p>
<p>When I say, &ldquo;Do not contend&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do not reason,&rdquo; I do not mean that we should be polite in order to keep the peace with others; I mean that we need to see the treasure, which is God Himself. When we give no room to anything within us other than the Lord, we will be full of light. Everything other than God is worthless; only God is valuable. If we hold on to the precious, we will be full of light and vision.</p>
<p>We also need to learn to wait on God. Daniel 10 tells us that Daniel waited on God for three full weeks (vv. 2-3). Then the messenger of God came to tell him the things to come, to show him visions.</p>
<p>Our heart also needs to be pure. The pure in heart see God (Matt. 5:8). We must desire God and nothing other than God.</p>
<p>Finally, our heart needs to turn to the Lord. Second Corinthians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.&rdquo; Once our heart is turned to the Lord, the veil is taken away. Once the veil is taken away, our face is open toward the Lord. The Lord is the vision, the revelation, itself. Our seeing of the Lord is our seeing of the vision. If we are not open to the Lord, we cannot see the vision. In summary, we need to have a heart for God, to let go of the worthless things, to wait on the Lord, to be pure in heart, and to be open to the Lord. Then the Lord will shine His light at a time when nothing is covering us inwardly.</p>
<p>Not everyone who serves God in the same age sees a vision directly. The Bible shows that Paul received a direct vision, but Timothy&rsquo;s vision was received through Paul. There is no record in the Bible of Timothy receiving a direct vision himself. Everything that Timothy saw came through Paul. Hence Paul says, &ldquo;Continue in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from which ones you have learned them and that from a babe you have known the sacred writings&rdquo; (2 Tim. 3:14-15). This means that Timothy received a vision from Paul and through the Bible. Hence, not everyone who serves God in this age will receive a direct vision. In any case, we all must see the same vision and receive it according to the same principles.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">GIFT AND MINISTRY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:5-9, 18&mdash;4:2, 7-11, 16</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the matter of ministry. In the Chinese language the word for <em>ministry</em> has the same pronunciation as the word for <em>minister. Minister</em> speaks of the person, and <em>ministry</em> speaks of a person&rsquo;s work; the former refers to a person, and the latter refers to a thing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING FIVE BASIC ITEMS IN WORKING<br />
FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>A person who serves the Lord must know five basic items&mdash;calling, vision, gifts, ministry, and leading. Anyone who wants his service to be in line with God&rsquo;s will, that is, God&rsquo;s eternal plan, must have a thorough understanding of these five basic matters. If we serve the Lord without a clear calling, without any vision or manifestation of gifts, without being constituted with a ministry, and without any focus in our leading, at the most we will be a &ldquo;preacher,&rdquo; but we will not be a servant or messenger of the Lord. A servant who is raised up, sent, and used by the Lord will have a specific calling, a clear vision, a manifested gift, a living ministry, and a focused leading. These five items must have considerable ground and bear considerable weight within everyone who serves the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STOPPING ONESELF TO SEE THE LIGHT</h2>
<p>The book of Job speaks of a very God-fearing man, Job, and of his time on the earth (1:1). Of those who lived on the earth, Job was unreprovable. Even God told Satan that there was none like Job on the earth, a perfect and upright man, who feared God and turned away from evil (v. 8). Job&rsquo;s so-called perfection and self-righteousness, however, veiled his eyes so that he could not see God&rsquo;s light. Job was a good man, but the book of Job shows that he had no light and no revelation. Job feared God and was unreprovable, yet he had no light and did not live in God&rsquo;s presence. It is only at the end of the book, after Job meets God, that he said, &ldquo;I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear, / But now my eye has seen You&rdquo; (42:5).</p>
<p>Before chapter 42 Job was merely a self-righteous man who had heard about God but had not seen God&rsquo;s light. In chapter 13, he said, &ldquo;I would speak to the Almighty, / And I desire to argue with God&rdquo; (v. 3). Job was willing to argue with God, because he wanted God to explain his wrongdoing. This shows that Job was indeed perfect and upright; otherwise, he would not have dared to speak in this way. Job&rsquo;s friends told him that God, who is righteous, would have struck him only if he was wrong in some way. Job, however, rejected this argument. This also shows that Job had not found God. Though he was a perfect and upright man, a God-fearing man with righteous deeds, he had no light. God allowed Satan to deal with Job, not because of his faults but because he was too faultless.</p>
<p>God dealt with Job not because he was wrong but because he was so right that even Satan had nothing against him; he was so right that he was willing to challenge God and argue with Him. Those who are upright are often blind. Self-righteousness blinds us, and self-righteousness veils us so that we cannot see light and cannot see God.</p>
<p>Job&rsquo;s self-righteousness was detrimental to him; it was a problem to him and a frustration to God. Therefore, God did not value Job&rsquo;s perfection; instead, He allowed Satan to break, to strike, Job to the point that he became more and more confused. No book in the Bible records such lengthy quarrels as the book of Job. Of the forty-two chapters in Job, thirty-three are a record of his quarrels with his three friends. Job had fierce quarrels with these friends. His first friend quarreled with him in three sections (chs. 4&mdash;7; 15&mdash;17; 22&mdash;24), but Job was not convinced. A second friend also quarreled with him in three sections (chs. 8&mdash;10; 18&mdash;19; 25&mdash;31), but Job was not convinced. Then a third friend quarreled with him in two sections (chs. 11&mdash;13; 20&mdash;21), but Job refuted him as well. Together his three friends quarreled with him in eight separate sections, but Job countered them all. Lastly, Elihu came and quarreled with him in a final section (chs. 32&mdash;37). When Job finally met God, he said, &ldquo;Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?&rdquo; (42:3).</p>
<p>When talking with others, it is best to let them finish. God is very patient, and He let Job and his friends quarrel until they were finished talking and Job was finished refuting. When God came in, He did not say anything in the way of argument; instead, He asked Job questions (38:4&mdash;39:30; 40:15&mdash;41:34). The last chapters of the book of Job present God&rsquo;s questions to Job, none of which he could answer. Through those questions, Job was enlightened and immediately said, &ldquo;Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge? / ...I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear, / But now my eye has seen You; / Therefore I abhor myself, and I repent / In dust and ashes&rdquo; (42:3, 5-6). Job repented for his self. He did not repent for his bad self but for his good self, not for his corrupt self but for his perfect and upright self, which was veiled to God&rsquo;s light.</p>
<p>In order to see God&rsquo;s vision, God&rsquo;s light, we must stop ourselves and finish our &ldquo;talking.&rdquo; Some brothers and sisters cannot stop &ldquo;talking.&rdquo; They think that their views and insights are accurate and commendable. Recently, a brother came to see me and said, &ldquo;We should do this, and we should do that. It would be good if we do this and beneficial if we do that.&rdquo; I often have only one reply when I encounter such speaking. I say, &ldquo;It would be good if you could do it.&rdquo; I say this because a person who does not truly know what he is speaking about loses the Lord&rsquo;s presence when he does something on his own. Even though he thinks that his way is acceptable, he does not touch God. Thus, when he attempts to take his own way, he learns that his views and insights are not accurate.</p>
<p>Before Job touched God, he thought that he was the most proper person in the universe. In his self-righteousness Job said, &ldquo;Oh that I knew where I might find Him, / That I might come to His seat! / I would present my cause in order before Him, / And I would fill my mouth with arguments&rdquo; (23:3-4). This word shows that Job had not met God. Those who have not met God&rsquo;s shining have no comprehension of their foolishness and blindness. But when God came to Job and he saw God, he was subdued. After seeing God, Job&rsquo;s speaking indicated that he had merely heard of God by the hearing of his ear but that now he truly saw God. He realized that his words were without knowledge and that he had been hidden and veiled from God&rsquo;s shining. Thus, he repented even for his perfect and upright self (cf. 42:1-6). This shows that Job saw light.</p>
<p>We see light only when our &ldquo;talking&rdquo; ceases and we are still. I hope that all God&rsquo;s serving ones can see this. When we are still within and quiet without, God can come. When we speak, God does not speak. This is the difference between Mary and Martha. Mary was still, but Martha could not stop (Luke 10:38-42). Consequently, Mary gained the Lord&rsquo;s speaking, but Martha did not. Martha, however, did not miss the Lord&rsquo;s speaking because He would not speak to her; rather, she could not hear the Lord&rsquo;s speaking because she could not stop her self and be still.</p>
<p>In serving the Lord, every brother or sister must learn to be still and to not bring in his or her own opinions, insights, views, and ways. We should be able to say before God, &ldquo;I have stopped my whole being, and I have finished my speaking.&rdquo; When we read the Bible and draw near to God in this way, we will have vision and light, and we will be able to know the way that God wants us to take and the work that God wants us to do on the earth.</p>
<p>If we have no vision and no light, there must be some problem, but the problem is not on God&rsquo;s side, it is on our side. Without a vision we can only serve the Lord with our own opinions, insights, views, and ways. Thus, our &ldquo;work&rdquo; will only be our work, not God&rsquo;s work, because we will not have a vision of God or of our place in His work.</p><h2 class="head1">GIFTS BEING LIMITED IN BENEFIT</h2>
<p>In addition to vision and revelation, service also involves gifts. Gifts follow vision. Vision involves seeing the Lord and seeing the content of His service. In order for vision to result in ministry, there is a need for gifts. For example, I can buy a fish and bring it home to eat, but I still need to know how to cook it. If I do not have the gift of cooking a fish, I will not be able to feed anyone. Thus, even if we have been called and have received a vision, we will not be able to carry out this vision without gifts. Gifts speak of the spiritual capacity that is needed in order to carry out spiritual matters. Hence, in learning to serve the Lord, we must seek and exercise our gifts so that we may have the spiritual capacity to carry out spiritual matters.</p>
<p>Gifts, however, have only a temporary benefit in the service. Consider a locality that has brothers and sisters who have been saved for a short period of time and saints who have been saved longer but do not have much spiritual knowledge. After the Lord raises them up to meet, there is a need for speaking in the meetings, so the burdened brothers pray, &ldquo;Lord, raise up some among us to speak!&rdquo; When a brother gets up to speak and sounds quite good the first time, even better the second time, and nearly perfect the third time, it seems as if their prayer has been answered. Then everyone rejoices, thinking that God has raised up Brother So-and-so as a gift to speak.</p>
<p>This brother then begins to read the Bible even more, and he also reads and considers spiritual books. When he speaks, many are moved, and he can speak on anything, including loving the Lord, consecration, being broken, being dealt with, taking the way of the cross, Christ living in us, and our living in the Lord. It even seems as if Paul could not speak as well as this brother if he were among us today. We need to realize, however, that the speaking of this brother comes out of his gift, not necessarily his constitution. He may be able to speak about the breaking of the cross and about living in the Lord, but whether or not he has been broken by the cross and lives in the Lord is another matter.</p>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;Does this mean that the brother has done something that he should not have done?&rdquo; No, his speaking is not a problem, because it has been useful in the meetings. However, when a person who has been raised up by the Lord has only gifts, it can become a problem if he serves the Lord merely according to his gift for an extended period of time. The gift of a serving one must become a ministry so that the church can be built up.</p>
<p>Consider the matter of the breaking of the cross. This brother may have spoken twenty or thirty times on the breaking of the cross, yet he may not manifest a life that has been broken by the cross. Messages on the breaking of the cross may come forth from his gifted mouth, but a life that issues from the breaking of the cross may not be evident within him. Such a constitution cannot be obtained after a few days of prayer; the constitution of ministry cannot be obtained merely by prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GIFTS NEEDING TO BECOME MINISTRY</h2>
<p>In order for this brother to be constituted with a ministry, he must be subdued in the light of the breaking of the cross and accept the breaking of the cross. He needs to be broken until his very person speaks of the breaking of the cross because the breaking of the cross has been constituted into him. Then the breaking of the cross will not simply be a message, a doctrine, or a speaking in him; the cross will be his constitution, his life.</p>
<p>The church needs ministry as well as gifts. However, we should not expect ministry to be manifested in a church that has been raised up for only a few years. The producing of ministry takes five, ten, or even twenty years. If a brother cooperates with the Holy Spirit, and God&rsquo;s life is allowed to operate, the Holy Spirit will be able to constitute him with the breaking of the cross. Then when this brother speaks on the breaking of the cross, he will not need to read the Bible or reference books, for he himself will be a testimony of the breaking of the cross. After years of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s work and constitution, the matter of the breaking of the cross will become more than just a message in his mouth; it will become his very being.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians Paul deals with the matter of gifts, but in 2 Corinthians he speaks about the matter of ministry. The Corinthians emphasized gifts very much; Paul even says, &ldquo;You do not lack in any gift&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:7), and in chapters 12 and 14 he lists various gifts. Nevertheless, these gifted persons were quite childish, and the local church of these gifted ones was quite chaotic. The church in Corinth seemingly lacked nothing in the way of gifts, but it was a mess and full of divisions, factions, fornication, and chaos.</p>
<p>Thus, Paul deals with gifts in his first Epistle to the church. He shows the Corinthians that gifts alone could not meet the need nor solve the problems of the church. He says, &ldquo;I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified&rdquo; (2:2). He shows them that only the crucified Christ can solve the problems of the church. Gifts can meet some&mdash;but not all&mdash;the needs of the church. Gifts can help the church, but only the crucified Christ can solve the problems of the church.</p>
<p>Paul does not mention gifts in his second Epistle. Instead, he demonstrates the living of the crucified Christ. Chapter by chapter he shows that he had a ministry, not just gifts. Paul not only preached the cross but let the Lord&rsquo;s death operate in him so that the cross was manifested in him. As a result, he became the ministry. Paul&rsquo;s speaking concerning the crucified Christ was not a message but a living. Gifts are related to a message, but ministry is related to a living. Ministry involves more than giving a message; it involves a person living the message.</p>
<p>It is possible for a newly raised up church to have gifts but not ministry. Even if the seed of ministry has been sown, it will take time for this seed to take form and bear fruit. Eventually, the ministry will be constituted into those who have gifts. Gifts speak of a spiritual capacity given by the Spirit to enable one to function in unique and needed ways. Ministry speaks of living according to the Spirit and of letting the Holy Spirit constitute into us the light that we see and the message that we give to the point that we become the message, and we become the ministry of the message.</p>
<p>It is not easy to speak merely according to gift, because such speaking requires much reading of the Bible and reference books and extensive preparation. A speaker who is speaking merely according to his preparation is also in fear and trembling, because he is concerned that he will cover points at the beginning and the end but forget points in the middle. After speaking, he usually has some regret over failing to mention some inspiring words. This is common when one speaks merely by gift. However, when gift becomes ministry, the words that need to be spoken will be spoken because the message that he is will be the message that is spoken. This is not a speaking according to gift but a testifying through ministry.</p>
<p>It is not enough for the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones to have merely gifts; gifts must become ministry. In the past I encouraged the brothers and sisters to desire gifts because gifts are needed when we first start to serve the Lord. Now I would like to say that merely having gifts is not worth much; we must be stripped and broken in the Lord&rsquo;s hand so that the messages we give will be constituted into us and become our ministry.</p>
<p>I have seen some young brothers who are very gifted in preaching the gospel. When some of them preach, nearly everyone is moved or convicted. Nevertheless, when they leave the podium, they are indifferent toward those who are unsaved. Thus, they have a gift related to preaching the gospel but not to the ministry of the gospel. Their words related to the gospel are eloquent, but these brothers seem to have the spirit of the gospel only when they are preaching publicly, not when they contact unbelievers personally.</p>
<p>I know of a Western missionary who lived in Foochow for over a decade and then in Shanghai into her old age. At first glance, she did not seem to have any gift related to the gospel, yet after spending time with her, I had the feeling that she was the gospel. The gospel was constituted into her for over fifty to sixty years, and her living became the ministry of the gospel. She could preach the gospel without preaching the gospel. Everyone she touched was moved because the gospel had been constituted into her to such an extent that it became a ministry in her.</p>
<p>The difference between gift and constitution can be seen in relation to language. From an early age I have been learning English, but my English is still poor. In contrast, I have no difficulty speaking Chinese. According to this illustration, my speaking Chinese is a ministry, because I can speak Chinese without any effort. The Chinese language has been constituted into me and has become me. If I want to give a message in English, however, I need much preparation, including reading reference books. The words that come out of my speaking of English are related to gift, but the words that come out of my speaking of Chinese are related to ministry. We use gifts provisionally in our living, not normally. Ministry is what we are normally.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:9 says that there is glory with the ministry. In verse 18 Paul says, &ldquo;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; Paul beheld and reflected the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face, and he was transformed into the same image from glory to glory. There was glory with Paul&rsquo;s ministry.</p>
<p>In 4:7-8 Paul says, &ldquo;We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us. We are pressed on every side but not constricted.&rdquo; From the day that this treasure entered into us, we began to be pressed. There is a treasure within, but there is pressing without. This pressing is needed in order for the treasure to grow day by day. When death operates in us, the life of the Lord operates in us as well (v. 12). This life cannot be conveyed merely through the words of a message but through the living of a ministry.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH SUFFERING LOSS<br />
IF GIFTS ARE NOT TURNED INTO MINISTRY</h2>
<p>Although gifts are needed in the church, gifts can be a source of problems. The problems in the church in Corinth were related to gifts. For example, a church may truly be blessed when God raises up two brothers to speak. Initially, the two are quite fresh, and many saints are blessed, but soon the two can come to different views related to the truth. One may give a message on the need for a revelation to experience our co-crucifixion with the Lord, and his speaking may be clear and logical. The next week, however, the second brother may say that it is futile to merely see the matter of our co-crucifixion with the Lord but that we should instead follow the Holy Spirit daily and put to death the practices of our members. His speaking also seems clear and logical. In subsequent meetings the first brother may say that seeing our co-crucifixion with Christ is necessary because we cannot crucify ourselves, while the second brother says that it is possible to crucify ourselves because Colossians 3:5 says, &ldquo;Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth.&rdquo; Thus, the &ldquo;arguments&rdquo; of Job are repeated from the podium. After two years of such speaking, all the brothers and sisters will be hindered in their pursuit. Although the two brothers talked about our co-crucifixion with Christ, neither was willing to die, and although they talked about crucifixion, neither was crucified. There were messages about the cross but no crucifixion. They had the word of the cross in their mouths but not the life of the cross in their constitution.</p>
<p>It is exceedingly important for gift to become ministry. It is not a small thing when brothers and sisters love the Lord with their whole heart and desire to serve the Lord with their time and give up their future altogether. On the one hand, I treasure this and rejoice, but on the other hand, I am cautious. If we serve the Lord with gifts rather than ministry, it will not be long before the brothers and sisters all over Taiwan are quarrelling with one another. This is not a mere supposition; I know of many examples in our recent history and throughout church history. We have recently learned of a case in mainland China, and even the Brethren were divided over doctrinal disagreements among some of their gifted brothers.</p>
<p>Both George Whitefield and John Wesley received help from Count von Zinzendorf. According to the biography of George Whitefield, Wesley and Whitefield were co-workers, but eventually some problems developed. In regard to the matter of sanctification, Zinzendorf said that we have no holiness in ourselves and that we cannot be holy in ourselves; instead, our holiness is Christ. Whitefield agreed with this view. Wesley, however, said that holiness is a power within us that drives sins away so that we can be completely clean; therefore, holiness is sinless perfection. The two disagreed so much on this point that they could no longer work together.</p>
<p>If we do not see what it means for gifts to become ministry, our speaking eventually will produce only debates over doctrines. Doctrines produce debates, but a living stops all debate. The yes of a constituted living is yes, and the no of such a living is no. There is no need for debate. When the responsible brothers encounter those who want to debate like Job, there is no need for refutation. Instead, let them try to implement their suggestion. Their loss of the Lord&rsquo;s presence will eliminate all debate.</p>
<p>Gifts have a place in the beginning, but there is no benefit from relying upon them for a prolonged period of time. If gifts do not become ministry, they will damage the church. Gifts must result in ministry, or they will damage the church. If a man can only speak and work without constitution, the church may be helped initially, but eventually it will be damaged. If what we say and do are not a part of our living and constitution, our gifts will become a problem to the church.</p>
<p>I hope that all the gifted brothers and sisters will see that the church needs gifts, yet gifts cannot be relied upon for long. Gifts should be like silkworms that turn into pupas and then into moths. A gift needs to become a ministry quickly. If a gift does not turn into a ministry, it will help the church initially but later destroy the church.</p>
<p>I have had many co-workers from the day I started serving the Lord. Yet it is hard for anyone to find anything that I have spoken concerning the co-workers in a way of disapproval. When others have asked me if my view of the truth has been the same as all the other co-workers over the past twenty years, I must truthfully say that we have not always had the same view on many things. Nevertheless, I do not argue. Something within me stops me when I want to talk about a differing point. This can be called the cross, the dealing of the Lord, or the discipline of the Holy Spirit, but it kills the debate within me so that I can go on with the co-workers. It is quite dangerous to work merely according to gift. It is easy to be mistaken without realizing it. Gifts are useful, but we should not rely upon them. Gifts can be used to an certain extent, but they should issue in ministry.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us so that this word may shine in us and cause the co-workers to treasure gifts but not live in them, to learn to live under the shadow of the cross, and to be disciplined by the Holy Spirit so that the message of the cross may be constituted into us and that our gifts may become ministry. Then we will render help to the church and not become a problem to the church, and we will build the church, not destroy the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING LED CORPORATELY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:4-5, 8; 13:1-4</h1>
<p>The four points that we have spoken of in regard to our service&mdash;calling, vision, gifts, and ministry&mdash;are the &ldquo;capital&rdquo; of a Lord&rsquo;s worker. Just as a businessman needs capital to do business and a teacher needs education to teach, we need these four points as our &ldquo;capital&rdquo; in our work for the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING MINISTRY</h2>
<p>Ministry is the issue of the Spirit&rsquo;s constitution. Ministry can be manifested only in a person who has experienced the constituting work of the Spirit. Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis knew the Lord in a deep way, and she was raised up to minister concerning the cross of Christ. Before Mrs. Penn-Lewis was raised up, there was hardly any book on the cross, despite there being over a thousand years of church history. When Mrs. Penn-Lewis came, she preached for at least a decade on our co-crucifixion with Christ on the cross. She founded a magazine called <em>The Overcomer</em> that spoke only of our co-crucifixion on the cross. She spoke on how the cross of Christ ended the old creation and the old man and accomplished God&rsquo;s eternal will. The commission that she received before God was to preach the message of the cross. Her message, however, did not come merely from gifted utterance but from the deeper constitution of ministry in her being; she was the message of the cross. This shows that ministry comes out of the Spirit&rsquo;s constitution over time.</p>
<p>We have no basis for boasting merely because we may have a gift. Instead, we should focus on the manifestation of ministry in us for the church. Through the constituting work of the Spirit, the operation of the Lord&rsquo;s life in us over time will make us the message, and our message will become our ministry. Although I appreciate gifts in the church, I am more fearful of gifts without ministry. We must look to the Lord for His mercy so that we would experience His message-constituting life in order to manifest a ministry of life. We should not treasure the gift of giving a message more than ministry.</p>
<p>The example of Balaam&rsquo;s donkey speaking human language in the Old Testament is helpful in understanding the limitation of gifts (Num. 22:28-30). Balaam&rsquo;s donkey received the ability to speak a human language, but it was still a donkey. Even though it could speak a human language, the donkey did not become human. There was no change in its constitution.</p>
<p>Some people can speak concerning the cross in a clear and appealing way, but they lose control of their temper once they leave the podium. In contrast, Moses, as a genuine servant of God, not only spoke for God but also became a man of God, especially in his old age. Psalm 90 is entitled &ldquo;A Prayer of Moses, the man of God.&rdquo; Moses not only spoke God&rsquo;s words, but he also was a man of God. God&rsquo;s words were constituted into him over a period of several decades. He was a man, but God&rsquo;s words were constituted in him. Consequently, when he was a hundred twenty years old, his speaking to the children of Israel did not come from gift but from ministry. His words were God&rsquo;s words, and his blessings were God&rsquo;s blessings. He not only spoke the word of God with his mouth, but his words manifested the work of God in his being. This is ministry. There must be ministry in the church; the church is strong only when ministry is manifested.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LEADING OF THE WORK BEING CORPORATE</h2>
<p>In addition to calling, vision, gifts, and ministry, the fifth important item in working for the Lord relates to the matter of leading. We must learn to be led. Those who serve the Lord must be led by the Lord, not by their own views, desires, and choices. All our actions must be according to the leading of the Lord. The matter of being led is a very particular aspect of service, and we must look at it carefully.</p>
<p>The Acts of the Apostles present a clear picture of how to work for God. Although many say that Acts speaks of how to receive the Holy Spirit, it presents another matter that is just as important as receiving the Holy Spirit&mdash;the matter of being led. In fact, the apostles received the Holy Spirit through the Lord&rsquo;s leading. The Lord told the disciples not to depart from Jerusalem but to wait for the promise of the Father, the Holy Spirit (1:4-5, 8). If the one hundred and twenty had left Jerusalem and returned to Galilee, they would not have received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. They received the Holy Spirit by following the Lord&rsquo;s leading. Thus, the foremost matter in Acts is not related to receiving the Holy Spirit but to being led.</p>
<p>Acts also shows that the Lord&rsquo;s leading, especially His leading for the work, is rarely an individual matter; it is a corporate matter. The Lord did not tell only Peter to wait in Jerusalem for the Holy Spirit to descend. The Lord told the disciples to wait together in Jerusalem; this is corporate. His leading was not for Peter, John, or Mary individually but to the hundred and twenty corporately.</p>
<p>There is a principle in the Bible that relates to the first mention of a matter; that is, the first mention of a matter establishes the principle of that matter. In Acts the first mention related to the Lord&rsquo;s leading is corporate, not individual. Thus, in 2:14 we do not see individuals; instead, we see &ldquo;Peter, standing with the eleven.&rdquo; Furthermore, even though chapter 8 records Philip preaching the gospel by himself in Samaria, it also shows that part of the Spirit&rsquo;s work was withheld until Peter and John went to pray and lay hands on the Samaritan believers (vv. 14-17). Only then did the Samaritans, who had heard and believed through Philip&rsquo;s preaching, receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. This shows that the Holy Spirit did not confirm the move of an individual, Philip, but rather, the corporate move of the church. Although Philip apparently was being led individually, his leading was associated with the move of the church.</p>
<p>When the flow of God&rsquo;s work advances, people are not brought separately or individually into the flow. In Acts 13 God&rsquo;s work flowed from Jerusalem to Antioch. Verse 2 says, &ldquo;As they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&rdquo; Although many are working in Christianity today, everyone is doing his own work. However, the apostles were not led separately but corporately in the flow of the Lord&rsquo;s work. Peter was in this flow, John was in this flow, and Paul was in this flow. The move of those who were saved first as well as those who were saved later was in this flow. The flow that began in a corporate way in Acts 2 also flowed until it reached Antioch in chapter 13 in a corporate way. The flow seemed to turn and go westward. At that time, five prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch were led in a corporate way (v. 1). They were not independent prophets and teachers; they were in the church, and their leading was the leading of the church. This speaks of the principle of a corporate leading in the work.</p><h2 class="head1">INDIVIDUALISTIC LEADING<br />
PRODUCING AN INDIVIDUALISTIC MOVE</h2>
<p>We need to remember this principle, especially when we are tempted to say, &ldquo;I have a clear leading to work in a certain place.&rdquo; There is a danger in being so certain; it is the danger of acting individualistically. We must ask ourselves whether we have received our leading individualistically or with those whom we serve with in the church. When the five prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch were praying together and fasting, the Holy Spirit charged them, saying, &ldquo;Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them&rdquo; (v. 2). This was a corporate leading. We need to ask ourselves whether or not we have been led in this way. There is a great difference between an individual leading and a leading that comes from the Lord through those with whom we are serving. In the matter of serving the Lord, an individual leading will cause us to act individualistically and do an individualistic work. In contrast, a corporate leading before the Lord will enable us to move in Christ with the church. The two leadings are quite different.</p>
<p>Barnabas and Saul received the Lord&rsquo;s leading without any individual component. Five prophets and teachers were praying when the Holy Spirit said, &ldquo;Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul.&rdquo; These five were part of both the larger circle of the believers in the church in Antioch and the smaller circle of the Lord&rsquo;s work in the church. In both circles the five served together corporately.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING ONE AND NOT INDIVIDUALISTIC</h2>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may see this basic principle. Because Christianity has become degraded, there are many individual leadings, many individual works, and many individual actions. Christians who do not meet with us often misunderstand us and say that we are uncooperative, but the Lord knows that we desire to be one with other believers. When we consider various Christians, the most we can say is that they have a desire to be united. Our desire, however, is for more than just unity; we want oneness. The church is one; it is not united. There is a great difference.</p>
<p>When I was twenty-two years old, a pastor who was leading me talked about the federation of churches in Christianity. Although I was very young at the time, I received some light. I listened respectfully because I was the one being led. He said, &ldquo;We in Christianity have formed a federation; those who could not get along before are now united.&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;If the denominations need to be united, does this not prove that they are divided?&rdquo; His countenance changed upon hearing this. Indeed, division cannot be eliminated by unity but by being one.</p>
<p>The United Nations is an example of unity. Delegates from various countries meet and discuss matters; some countries are totalitarian, and others are democratic. The end result of this union is that Britain is still Britain, France is still France, and America is still America. In Christianity unity means that the Methodist denomination, the Presbyterian denomination, the Lutheran denomination, and other denominations do not criticize each other, but each denomination still keeps their own things. There are, however, no independent entities in the Lord&rsquo;s service; instead, everyone should be the same as their fellow serving ones in the Spirit. The church is one. The church is not an issue of unity but of oneness. If we need to be united, it proves that we have already formed independent entities.</p>
<p>We all know that the church is the Body of Christ and that the Body is one. If our physical body is not one, it means that some member has been &ldquo;dislocated.&rdquo; Likewise, the move, work, and service of the church must be one; anything less than this speaks of &ldquo;dislocation.&rdquo; Setting up a special group of our own is a matter to be accursed. We need to do only one thing&mdash;to set aside everything that is not of the Lord and not in accordance with the Bible. Even if others approve of such things, we should never approve. We want the way of the church, not our way; we want the ground of the church, not our ground. Anyone can stand on this ground if he so desires; the ground of the church is not something that we desire to monopolize.</p>
<p>In our service today, who follows whom? Our service is not a matter of you following me or of me following you; it is a matter of both of us desiring Christ with a pure heart and, consequently, of taking the way of loving the Lord together. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we can both be submissive within, accept help from others, and render help to others. This is our blessing; we are learning to be led together.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters are timid toward me and other responsible brothers, but we do not rule over the saints. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and leading, we decide on certain matters and occasionally rebuke some misconduct. Each of us needs to learn to live before the Lord and not be afraid of the responsible brothers; we need to fear the Lord. Anything that is acceptable or fitting to the brothers and sisters can be done. There is no human organization or human authority among us; human authority should be accursed.</p>
<p>Some say that we have a very tight organization, but I do not see such an &ldquo;organization.&rdquo; Instead, a brother among us loves the Lord and follows Him by His mercy, while yet other brothers and sisters love the Lord and follow Him by His mercy. When everyone takes this way, there is a spontaneous oneness, and there is no need for any organization.</p>
<p>The leading for serving the Lord comes from living in the Lord and following the Spirit. However, when we take an individualistic way according to our own greed, lust, and purpose, there is an individualistic move that is outside this oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE LEADING TOGETHER<br />
WITH FELLOW SERVING ONES</h2>
<p>Out of respect, brothers and sisters often ask me about the direction that they should take, but I only tell them to speak with the responsible brothers in their local church. We need to learn to live in the church. It is not possible for one person to truly know all things; this is a misconception. The true leading of the Lord is received together with our fellow serving ones in the church. Anything that is not received in this way is not accurate. Service is not an individual matter; it is carried out by brothers and sisters in the church. It may be hard for a brother to know how he should be led, but those who are serving together with him in the church will know. Next to the Lord, our fellow serving ones are the ones who are most clear about the direction that we should take in the service of the Lord. If they do not know about our situation, there must be a problem. However, if everyone is in one accord and serving the Lord in oneness, the brothers and sisters coordinating together will surely be clear concerning the Lord&rsquo;s will and leading for their fellow serving ones. Thus, the Lord&rsquo;s leading is received by those who are serving together in the Body, the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM THE SELF<br />
IN ORDER TO BE LED</h2>
<p><em>Question: A brother went to a certain place to work according to his personal leading, but only later was this confirmed by the church. Was his leading accurate?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This clearly shows that in the beginning there was some lack in his fellowship with the church because he only heeded his personal leading. However, once he heeded the church&rsquo;s fellowship, the leading became a matter in the church.</p>
<p><em>Question: What is a normal experience of leading?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The basic requirement for the normal experience of leading is to live in the fellowship of the church. If we do not live in the fellowship of the church, it will be difficult for us to receive the leading in the fellowship of the church. It may take some brothers and sisters five years to understand this requirement. This requires that we be delivered from our own views, our own choices, and our own preferences. It requires that we be delivered from individualism and live in the fellowship of the church.</p>
<p>At the end of a discussion related to service, we often hear brothers and sisters say, &ldquo;I will wait and see how the Lord leads.&rdquo; This speaks of something positive but also of something negative. On the one hand, it shows that such persons fear the Lord very much and are not loose. On the other hand, it shows that there is a desire in them that must be weighed against the fellowship of their fellow serving ones. Often such ones return and say, &ldquo;I do not think that it is the Lord&rsquo;s will for me to do this.&rdquo; Actually, the one who is unwilling is not the Lord but the brothers and sisters. There is hardly one saint out of ten who is truly being led by the Lord in this way, because the prerequisite to being led is to be willing to deal with oneself. Few fulfill this prerequisite.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING LED CORPORATELY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 15:36-41; 16:6-7</h1>
<p>The leading in the work is not individual but corporate; it is a leading in the Body. Concerning this point, we need to read Acts 13 and pay particular attention to how the apostles worked and were led. After the ascension of the Lord Jesus, an important aspect of the disciples&rsquo; work on the earth involved their corporate leading; it is hard to find an example of anyone who was led individually or acted individually in Acts. Although it may seem as though Philip acted and was led individualistically in the gospel, the account in Acts shows that his leading was a part of the Lord&rsquo;s corporate leading, which was confirmed by the Body (8:5-17).</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HAVING PERSONAL AFFECTION</h2>
<p>In the corporate leading in the work, we also must be careful not to bring personal affection into the work. In Acts 15 there was contention between Barnabas and Paul over the leading that they received. Although they both received the leading to visit the brothers, they differed on the matter of whether or not to take Mark. Barnabas insisted on taking Mark, but Paul did not consider it &ldquo;suitable to take with them this one who withdrew from them in Pamphylia and did not go with them to the work&rdquo; (v. 38).</p>
<p>Based on the account in Acts, the record of this contention between the two seems simple, but Colossians 4:10, which identifies Mark as being a cousin of Barnabas, reveals the further complication. Barnabas and Mark were relatives, and Barnabas&rsquo;s insistence that Mark be taken could easily have been influenced by family attachments and personal affection.</p>
<p>When Barnabas, Paul, and Mark had gone out to work, they encountered difficulty at Pamphylia, and Mark withdrew (Acts 13:13). Mark&rsquo;s withdrawal was unacceptable to Paul because it violated a principle related to spiritual warfare. Just as soldiers on the frontline of a battle should not withdraw, those who work for the Lord should not withdraw, because their withdrawal affects those who remain. It was good that Paul and Barnabas were not stumbled when Mark withdrew.</p>
<p>Mark&rsquo;s withdrawal, however, did affect Paul&rsquo;s consideration when they were preparing to go out a second time. Paul felt that Mark needed to be disciplined by being restricted from going with them the second time. Paul&rsquo;s willingness to restrict Mark from going was his execution of God&rsquo;s government in the work. The Lord&rsquo;s work cannot be carried out if a serving one acts according to his feeling, that is, if he works when he has a feeling to work and abandons the work when he has no feeling. Individuals cannot do as they please in the corporate move of the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Often the only way that a servant of the Lord can administer discipline is to first allow such ones to act according to their feelings but then to not allow them to later participate in the work according to their feeling. For example, Paul, Barnabas, and Mark were all led to participate in the work, but when Mark could not endure the suffering at Pamphylia, he withdrew. As a servant of the Lord, Paul could not force Mark to stay, but he could discipline Mark by not allowing him to go a second time. As a further example, if some brothers in a certain place do not want to receive my speaking, the only thing that I can do is to not go there to speak. In effect, my not going will be a discipline to them. In the Lord&rsquo;s work discipline primarily involves not being allowed to participate in the work. When Mark withdrew, Paul did not stop him from going, but he also did not take Mark with him the next time. This was his discipline of Mark.</p>
<p>Paul did not discipline Mark out of his flesh. Paul knew God well, and he upheld God&rsquo;s governmental principle. Love and affection cannot be allowed to overthrow God&rsquo;s government. God blesses what is according to His principle, and He does not bless what is not according to His principle. Paul&rsquo;s unwillingness to take Mark the second time was an execution of God&rsquo;s government according to the principle of God&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Barnabas, however, neglected God&rsquo;s government and God&rsquo;s principle in the work, and he allowed family affection to influence the work. Paul said that they should not take Mark, but Barnabas insisted on taking him. As a result, there was a sharp contention. As a serving one, Barnabas veered from the principle of God&rsquo;s work by holding on to his personal feelings in his human relationships. Paul kept God&rsquo;s principle, whereas Barnabas held on to his personal feelings. This was the source of their contention and separation.</p>
<p>After their contention, Barnabas took Mark and sailed away to Cyprus. There is, however, no mention of their being sent forth by the brothers (15:39). In contrast, verse 40 says, &ldquo;Paul chose Silas and went out, having been commended to the grace of the Lord by the brothers.&rdquo; When people contend, the wrong side always acts first, and the right side acts last. From reading this passage in the Bible, we know that the Holy Spirit judged Barnabas&rsquo;s actions to be wrong. Despite the word from Paul and the other brothers, Barnabas took Mark with him. Although the Bible records that the brothers sent Paul and Silas forward, commending them to the grace of the Lord, there is no record of Barnabas being sent in this way. After Barnabas left, he was on his own. Although he no doubt continued to work, the Bible contains no further record of his work. From that point forward, Barnabas did not have the leading of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s principle can never be overlooked, and God&rsquo;s government can never be compromised. We can only accommodate God; God does not accommodate us. We cannot lower God&rsquo;s governmental standard to accommodate ourselves. We should conform to God&rsquo;s principle; we should not expect God to conform to our feelings. Whenever our work is not according to God&rsquo;s principle but according to our feelings, God will set us aside. Personal feelings must never be brought into the work of God.</p>
<p>I have a heavy feeling within me based on years of serving the Lord with the brothers and sisters. In serving the Lord over the years, we have encountered the problem of personal feelings affecting the leading of many brothers and sisters. The source of personal feelings is personal affection. For example, there may be two brothers who have deep relations in the Lord. Nevertheless, whenever the co-workers seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading together, it almost always seems as if these two brothers have a sense to work in various places together. Even if the co-workers feel that it is the Lord&rsquo;s will for one brother to go but for the other to remain, the first brother will say that he cannot work if the other brother does not go as well. When the co-workers ask him to consider a different brother, he will say, &ldquo;I am afraid that Brother So-and-so&rsquo;s going may not be of the Lord.&rdquo; Instead of saying, &ldquo;His going may not be of the Lord,&rdquo; which is a lie, he should be truthful and say, &ldquo;His going does not suit me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This problem is even more serious among the sisters. According to my observation, if two co-workers cannot be separated, they will eventually lose the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. It is difficult for co-working sisters to acknowledge this; consequently, they argue, saying, &ldquo;If the Lord Jesus sent out His disciples in pairs, there should be no problem with us going out in pairs.&rdquo; Nevertheless, our history shows that if a pair of sisters cannot be separated, their work will be based only on human affection.</p>
<p>I hope that the brothers and sisters will learn not to interact with their co-workers based on human affection. This matter must be dealt with completely; personal affections kill the Lord&rsquo;s leading. It is not a simple thing for us to gather together and discuss the matter of our leading. If a co-worker says, &ldquo;The Lord is leading me to Keelung, and it is best for Brother So-and-so to go with me,&rdquo; he should have the full assurance that he is not acting out of personal affection. Personal feelings have no place in the work among the co-workers.</p>
<p>No personal affection should be involved in our leading in the work or even in the work itself. Although a certain brother and I may be close, I must be willing to speak a strong word to him if he makes a mistake in the work. Only in this way will we have a clear and accurate leading in the work.</p>
<p>We should never regard Barnabas&rsquo;s actions toward Mark as trivial; they were based entirely on human affection. One day we will face the situation of Barnabas, so we need to take precautions. It is possible to have weaknesses and to make mistakes in the Lord&rsquo;s work, but this does not mean that we have violated God&rsquo;s government. However, whenever we bring in personal affections, we violate a governmental principle in the work. We must fear human affections more than falling, sinning, or making mistakes. Related to the work, personal affections are more serious than falling, sinning, or making mistakes. Personal affections will cause us to veer from the line of the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT ANNULLING THE PERSONAL LEADING</h2>
<p>We also need to realize that the corporate leading in the work does not completely annul the Lord&rsquo;s personal leading. For example, when the serving ones seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading together, they may feel that a certain brother should go to Hualien, and, having the same feeling as the Body, he may go. If, after arriving in Hualien and praying, he feels to hold an eight-day gospel meeting, he does not need to check with us about this. This does not mean that he is acting individualistically; rather, he is being led personally, according to our corporate leading. Thus, the matter of personal leading is not annulled in the move of the work. As long as the brother is led by the Holy Spirit when he arrives in Hualien, he does not need to check with someone about every detail of the work. Sometimes it is not even possible to check with others. Can we even say that someone has the &ldquo;higher&rdquo; authority to answer his question? If a Christian mission work sent two missionaries to Hualien, their every action would first have to be reported to the mission board, but this would not make their actions to be according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<p>When Paul and Silas were led to go out, the brothers corporately sent them forward and commended them to the grace of the Lord (15:40). When they arrived in Asia, however, the Holy Spirit forbade them to stay (16:6). At this point, they did not say, &ldquo;The forbidding of the Holy Spirit is insufficient. We should write to the brothers in Antioch to see whether or not we should leave Asia.&rdquo; This would have been wrong. In the work&rsquo;s move, there should be the freedom for the personal leading of the Spirit. When Paul and Silas left Asia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but again the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them. As a result, they went west to Troas (vv. 7-8) in the direction of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s leading and in the direction that corresponded to the allowance of the Spirit of Jesus. At this point, &ldquo;a vision appeared to Paul during the night: A certain man, a Macedonian, was standing and entreating him and saying, &lsquo;Come over into Macedonia and help us&rsquo;&rdquo; (v. 9). Then they became clear, and the gospel was spread to Europe.</p>
<p>In the fellowship among the local churches today, all the local churches, large or small, have equal standing before God. Even though some large local churches may be more experienced and may have been blessed more, they can only take the position of supporting the smaller churches, not of governing them.</p>
<p>We need to be clear that our oneness is in fellowship, not in organizational hierarchy. The church has no headquarters or even branches. Some saints seem to feel that the church in Taipei is the &ldquo;headquarters.&rdquo; This is a delusion that, in part, is based on the fact that the co-workers often gather together in Taipei. For example, sometimes the co-working brothers and sisters come together for the sake of the work, which is not a matter related to the church in Taipei. Taipei is used only because it is convenient. However, when we call a co-workers&rsquo; meeting in Taipei, we often include the brothers from the church in Taipei in order to take care of them, but the saints should not think that this means that Taipei is our &ldquo;headquarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, this also does not mean that we can forsake the fellowship in the Body. If a small local church says, &ldquo;We do not need to consult with the brothers from other local churches because our standing is the same as theirs,&rdquo; we cannot say that this is wrong, but it is not sweet. The deeper the fellowship among us is, the better. Churches in various localities should stand before the Lord but also humbly consult with other churches to receive support and leading. If a co-worker who is led to a certain place can only tell others who his &ldquo;boss&rdquo; is, this is wrong. Nevertheless, it is good for him to learn to fellowship with other co-workers concerning his work so that he can receive a corporate confirmation.</p>
<p>In our going out to propagate the Lord&rsquo;s work, we need to be corporately led by the Lord in our service, yet we should learn to receive the Lord&rsquo;s personal leading. We must be like Paul and Silas, who accepted the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s forbidding and disallowing. Every worker of the Lord must learn this lesson as well as the lesson of fellowshipping with the local saints.</p>
<p>We have no organization; we only have the leading to serve the Lord together in the church. If we leave one local church, we still need to be led by the Lord in another locality. We do not have organizational relationships, but we should have fellowship in all things at all times and in all places. In Taipei the co-workers should have fellowship with the brothers in Taipei, and in Hualien the co-workers should have fellowship with the brothers in Hualien.</p>
<p>Forgive me for saying that the Western missionaries made a great mistake in their preaching of the gospel in China. They had the thought that the Chinese were too immature, and thus they did not fellowship with the Chinese saints. Instead, they checked with their mission boards in everything. According to the truth, after preaching the gospel in China and raising up native believers to serve the Lord, the missionaries should have sought the leading of the Lord with these brothers and sisters to determine how the work should be done. Similarly, we must fellowship with the saints in Taichung if we work in Taichung, and in fellowship we should look to the Lord concerning how to carry out His work in Taichung. We should not say, &ldquo;We have been sent by the brothers. You are immature, so we will not include you in our fellowship.&rdquo; This forsakes fellowship and upholds organization. There is no organization among us; there is only the fellowship that comes through serving the Lord together. We should fellowship at all times and in all places with the brothers and sisters who are with us according to the Lord&rsquo;s arrangement.</p><h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE BURDEN<br />
AT ANY TIME AND IN ANY PLACE</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s serving ones must learn to receive a burden at any time and in any place. In Acts Paul often received a burden. Verse 36 of chapter 15 says, &ldquo;Now after some days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brothers in every city in which we announced the word of the Lord, and see how they are doing.&rdquo; Then 17:16 says, &ldquo;While Paul was waiting...in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld that the city was full of idols.&rdquo; Therefore, he wanted to preach the gospel in Athens.</p>
<p>Many of the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones today do not know how to receive a leading or a burden. The Lord&rsquo;s leading may be present, but they do not have a clear sense of it. This is wrong. Every serving one of the Lord must endeavor to exercise to sense even the smallest burden.</p>
<p>Sometimes I see some saints who are in need of help, but the serving ones around them act as though they see nothing and as if the situation of the saints is none of their concern. As serving ones of the Lord, we need to practice heeding the feeling within us so that we can receive a burden when we see a need. If our sense is not keen in this way, we will not have much of a future in serving the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MOVEMENT IN THE WORK<br />
BEING DIRECTED BY SENIOR ONES</h2>
<p>There is a major principle involved in the movement of brothers together in the work: All our movement in the work should be directed by senior brothers. For example, when Paul went out to work, he did not go out by himself but with other co-workers, including Barnabas, Silas, and later Timothy and Titus. Paul had at least four or five co-workers. Nevertheless, Paul did not have a group discussion whenever there was a need to move. Paul&rsquo;s co-workers moved according to Paul&rsquo;s arrangement and determination. Paul took the lead among his co-workers in making various arrangements. When he wanted Luke to stay, Luke stayed (2 Tim. 4:11); when he sent Timothy, Timothy would go (Acts 17:15; 1 Cor. 4:17). This is a major principle in work: God desires that there be one head in the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>When a man and a woman marry, only one head is visible at the wedding; the other is covered. If there is more than one head in a marriage, it will be a dreadful marriage. Whether in the past or in the present, whether here or in other places, women cover their heads when they marry. In a Chinese wedding only the man&rsquo;s head is exposed. A person with one body and two heads would be a monster.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s government there should be only one head in the work&mdash;one head whether twenty co-workers are going out and one head whether two co-workers are going out. Peter took the lead among those working with him, and Paul took the lead among those working with him. God does not allow either a &ldquo;dictatorship&rdquo; or a &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; in the work. God only wants those who belong to Him to live in the Holy Spirit. In the worldly realm there is dictatorship, and there is also democracy, but in the church there is neither dictatorship nor democracy; there is only our learning to live in the Lord. When brothers and sisters are together, one or two must take the lead, but they should not dictate. Instead, they should make decisions based on the feelings that come from the brothers and sisters with them through fellowship.</p>
<p>It would be wrong if the brothers working in Hualien called meetings to vote on everything. The proper way to make a decision is to meet together, pray together, and discuss things together. However, a final decision should be made by the leading brothers based on the feelings of the saints. Once a decision has been made, the other brothers and sisters should learn to obey.</p>
<p>When Paul sent Timothy to Thessalonica (1 Thes. 3:2), Timothy did not say, &ldquo;I have to wait for the Lord&rsquo;s leading myself,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I will pray about it myself and see.&rdquo; Whenever Paul sent Timothy, Timothy would go; whenever Paul sent Luke, Luke would go. A co-worker&rsquo;s move in the work has to be based on submission to the leading ones in the work. God never lets anyone speak, move, or work freely in His work. When co-workers move freely, there is chaos.</p>
<p>If the Lord establishes someone as a leading one in the work, he should learn to know God&rsquo;s leading and God&rsquo;s intention in all the co-workers and then make an accurate judgment. This is a necessary qualification for being a leading one. However, if we are not a leading one according to the Lord&rsquo;s arrangement, we need to learn to obey the leading ones. Otherwise, the work will fall apart and be chaotic.</p>
<p>This requires us to be spiritual. If a co-worker is not spiritual, he cannot lead the work, and if a co-worker has not learned the lessons, accepted the dealings, been subdued or broken, it will be difficult for him to obey others. There is authority and order in God&rsquo;s government; He does not want chaos.</p><h2 class="head1">UNDERSTANDING THE LORD&rsquo;S DESIRE</h2>
<p>We need to understand the Lord&rsquo;s desire in relation to His command. We can see this in Paul&rsquo;s experience at the end of Acts when he was put in prison. We must ask whether Paul&rsquo;s imprisonment was according to the Lord&rsquo;s command or His desire. There is no record in Acts of the Lord commanding or leading Paul to be imprisoned; rather, there is a record of the Holy Spirit, through the brothers, trying to stop him from going to Jerusalem, which eventually led to his imprisonment (21:4, 10-14). Paul was not imprisoned by the Lord&rsquo;s leading. Rather, Paul&rsquo;s imprisonment was the result of his great love for the Lord.</p>
<p>The record of Acts shows that although the Lord wanted Paul to be in chains, He did not command him to be in chains. It is difficult to understand this seeming contradiction, but it can be likened to a father knowing that his desire for his son can be accomplished only through much suffering. Consequently, he will say, &ldquo;Do not go,&rdquo; even though his desire for his son remains. Paul loved the Lord so earnestly that if the Lord had commanded him not to go, he would have followed the Lord. Paul would have said, &ldquo;If I go, my actions will be rash and against the Lord&rsquo;s will.&rdquo; Paul, however, not only lived according to the Lord&rsquo;s command but also according to the Lord&rsquo;s desire. We must learn to understand the Lord&rsquo;s desire. At times the Lord&rsquo;s desire may be the opposite of His command. The son&rsquo;s accomplishment of a father&rsquo;s desire often must come from more than a response to a command; it must come from an understanding and acceptance of the father&rsquo;s desire. We must be willing to ask ourselves whether we are dutiful sons who act only according to a father&rsquo;s commands or whether we are loving sons who respond to a father&rsquo;s desires.</p>
<p>Many are confused when they read about Paul&rsquo;s final journey to Jerusalem. Through the brothers, Paul was told not to go (21:4, 11-12), yet he still went. In the night following the rioting of the Jews and Paul&rsquo;s arrest, however, &ldquo;the Lord stood by him and said, Take courage, for as you have solemnly testified to the things concerning Me in Jerusalem, so also you must testify in Rome&rdquo; (23:11). After Paul appealed to Caesar, he encountered a storm on his way to Rome. At this point, an angel of the Lord appeared to Paul and said, &ldquo;Do not fear, Paul; you must stand before Caesar&rdquo; (27:24). Whether Paul&rsquo;s final journey to Jerusalem and his subsequent encounters were according to God&rsquo;s will or against God&rsquo;s will is a great question in theology. Seemingly, it was God&rsquo;s command for him not to go, while at the same time, it was God&rsquo;s desire that he would go. Paul&rsquo;s move was apparently contrary to God&rsquo;s command, but actually it was according to God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>Hence, we should not treat the Lord&rsquo;s command as an excuse to avoid difficulties; satisfying the Lord&rsquo;s desire is equally as important. All those who love the Lord should love Him to the point of exceeding His commands. Only such a love truly satisfies the Lord&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>We often wish that the Lord&rsquo;s commands would not be so high in order that things would be easier, but requirements associated with the Lord&rsquo;s command often are much lower than those associated with His desire. We must learn to be able to say, &ldquo;Lord, I would not only keep Your commands but exceed the requirements of Your command.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s last journey exceeded the Lord&rsquo;s command. He lived in the Lord&rsquo;s desire, and this pleased the Lord. The Lord did not command Paul to be imprisoned for His sake, but it was His desire that such a lover of Him would be in chains for Him. Thus, the Lord encouraged him again and again. We must hold on to this fact: the love with which we love the Lord must exceed His command. Those who do not love the Lord in this way will avoid the weighty and choose the light. May we be willing to choose the difficult and avoid the easy and to choose the weighty and avoid the light in serving the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">SPECIFIC WORK</h1>
<p>A serving one of the Lord must learn to do a definite work, a specific work. In other words, a serving one of the Lord cannot do an ordinary work. If a work is ordinary, it becomes something of little consequence. The works of many so-called serving ones of the Lord are of little consequence. Although a serving one may be able to do some work, such as speaking concerning God, the Lord, sin, and the cross, it is difficult to find a focus in his work. His work is like a long-winded writing that obscures the crucial points because of its lack of focus. As serving ones of the Lord, we must learn to be delivered from such works.</p>
<p>Our work must be specific and definite. Those of us who are learning to serve the Lord must never regard this point lightly; rather, we must deal with the Lord concerning this matter, pursue it, and always be learning. We should not do an ordinary work, a common work before the Lord but always focus on the goal of our work and do a specific work. Learning this lesson requires that we be broken before the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BROKEN IN OUR NATURAL DISPOSITION</h2>
<p>The natural man has a natural disposition, and every natural disposition has particular traits. Although the natural man always bears these natural traits, we cannot bring our natural disposition into the Lord&rsquo;s work. Our work should be specific, but this specific work cannot come out of our natural disposition. If our natural disposition has not been broken, we will not be able to learn the lesson of being specific before God or be able to see what the Lord specifically wants us to do. Rejecting our natural views and natural disposition is a basic requirement for doing a specific work with a specific goal.</p>
<p>A brother has particular views and opinions before he is saved. After he is saved, he will continue to live according to his views and opinions if he does not experience the breaking of his natural disposition. Hence, it will be impossible for him to receive the Lord&rsquo;s commission to do a specific work. Since his natural views and opinions are part of his subjective constitution, he will not have God&rsquo;s view, receive God&rsquo;s commission, or be able to do a specific work for God. A specific work is possible only when one allows his opinions to be broken.</p>
<p>In order to do a specific work in serving the Lord, we must receive a vision and a commission from the Lord. However, in order to receive a vision and a commission from the Lord, our natural views and natural opinions must be broken. If we serve the Lord without being broken, there will be no response in the spirit of God&rsquo;s people and no speaking, confirmation, or echo of the Holy Spirit within God&rsquo;s people. As a result, there will be no benefit and little consequence in our work.</p>
<p>For example, a brother may have a desire to help orphans before he is saved. Such a thought is not bad; in fact, it is good in man&rsquo;s eyes. After his salvation, when he reads Psalm 68:5, which says that God is &ldquo;a Father to the orphans and a Judge for the widows,&rdquo; he assumes that he has received a revelation. Since this word corresponds with his natural concept, it is easy for him to say to himself, &ldquo;Now that I am a child of God, I should be considerate of God&rsquo;s heart by helping and caring for orphans.&rdquo; He may even stand up in a meeting and say, &ldquo;We should care for the orphans, because God is a Father to the orphans.&rdquo; If no one responds the first week, he may speak a week later, saying, &ldquo;We should care about orphans, not just for our own children.&rdquo; He may continue to speak about the need to care for orphans, but if there is no response from the saints, he will eventually say to himself, &ldquo;Since I cannot get through here, I will try somewhere else.&rdquo; But even if he goes elsewhere, he will continue to &ldquo;hit a wall.&rdquo; Eventually, he will regard others as being selfish and become frustrated and indifferent toward them because of his opinions. Thus, the natural opinions of this brother will hinder him from seeing God&rsquo;s light, from seeing a vision. Natural opinions always come out of our natural disposition. As serving ones of the Lord, we must set aside our opinions in order to take part in His work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A CENTRAL VIEW AND QUALITY CONTENT</h2>
<p>We also must know the steps related to God&rsquo;s work; God does not want man to work according to his own opinions but according to a central view of His work. In the foregoing example, the work of the brother who wanted to run an orphanage was not according to the central view of God&rsquo;s work, as revealed in the Scriptures. The Bible speaks of God and of man, of God&rsquo;s desire for man and of man&rsquo;s fall, of God&rsquo;s accomplishment of redemption and of man&rsquo;s being led by the Holy Spirit to repent, believe, and receive the Lord to have the Lord&rsquo;s life and to live in the Lord for His church and kingdom. These are the central points. While I dare not call a brother&rsquo;s thought of running an orphanage wrong, the quality of its content cannot be considered to be high. The content of quality in the Bible points to God, man, sin, redemption, Christ, life, the Holy Spirit, the church, and the kingdom. To serve the Lord, we must pay attention to this content.</p>
<p>When we consider these major points and then listen to the testimonies of the brothers and sisters, it is clear that many testimonies fall short of these points. For example, a brother may testify about praying to the Lord for the return of his misplaced fountain pen and of the pen being found by a janitor and returned to him the next day. Many testimonies of the brothers and sisters are like this; they are not according to the central view, and it is sad to hear them.</p>
<p>The testimonies of others, who have been following the Lord for a long time, also seem to focus on gains and losses in spiritual matters. Their words are not worldly, but they have a concern only for their own spiritual gains and losses. Such persons remain in their &ldquo;smallness&rdquo; even with all the spiritual lessons they have learned. They are unable to see that they have imprisoned the Lord within them.</p>
<p>If a person sees the central items, such as the cross of Christ and Christ being life in man, he does not have time for trivial matters. However, those who have not seen God&rsquo;s kingdom and God&rsquo;s righteousness pray every day for things related to food and clothing (Matt. 6:25-33) and testify of God&rsquo;s slightest blessing like excited children who have received some candy.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s serving ones must see the central items. We need to set aside our own views and opinions, enter into God&rsquo;s presence, and see the central items in His Word. We should search out the central items and avoid the trivial items.</p>
<p>Please do not misunderstand me; I am not opposed to God&rsquo;s leading in the little things of our human life. However, we need to see that we have been raised up by the Lord for His work to present to man the things related to God, man, sin, redemption, Christ, life, the Holy Spirit, the church, and the coming kingdom. The major items span from eternity to eternity. God&rsquo;s plan in eternity demonstrates His wisdom and expresses His Son, Christ. This explains every other matter, such as God&rsquo;s creation. God created man and redeemed man for His expression. Christ&rsquo;s redemption on the cross and the life of Christ entering into man are for His expression. The church, which brings in the eternal kingdom, is also for His expression. All those who consecrate themselves to serve the Lord must see these central items.</p>
<p>Once we see these central items, we must prepare ourselves before the Lord to receive a specific commission, to see what God wants us to focus on specifically. Perhaps God will commission someone to specifically speak on sin; if so, he needs to speak of it in a serious manner. Sin is not a minor point, so some need to receive a specific commission to speak on it. Sometimes the brothers in a certain place cannot convey this truth with a proper emphasis even though they know this truth. When a brother who is commissioned to speak on this matter goes to this locality, the matter will become living to the saints, and his speaking will even impact the preaching of the gospel and the edification of the saints. After he serves for three or four months, all the brothers and sisters will see the matter of sin clearly.</p>
<p>I feel that the gospel preaching of the brothers is too ordinary and not specific. They have a set pattern of preaching. It is always along the line of believing in Jesus to be saved, receiving the forgiveness of sins, escaping eternal perdition, and having eternal life. Sometimes they go further and speak of believers having the Lord Jesus in them. This is not specific enough. They should devote one or two hours to develop specific items such as sin or God&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>When D. L. Moody was preaching the gospel in England, a young man, Harry Moorehouse, spoke to Moody and asked if he could preach with Moody in America. Moody could not refuse him, but he would not tell him his sailing date. Nevertheless, Moorehouse followed Moody to America. When Moorehouse arrived, he sent a letter to Moody in the hope that he would be given an opportunity to preach. When Moody had to go out of town, he decided to let Moorehouse preach. The first day he preached on John 3:16, and everyone was quite touched. The second day he preached on John 3:16 again, and all were moved even more. When Moody returned, he asked his wife, &ldquo;What did the young man preach?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Something different from what you preach.&rdquo; Moody asked, &ldquo;Was it heresy?&rdquo; and she said, &ldquo;You will know when you hear him.&rdquo; When Moody listened, his tears flowed because he saw the matter of God&rsquo;s love. Before that day he had preached only on God&rsquo;s righteousness and judgment, but he did not know God&rsquo;s love until he heard Moorehouse&rsquo;s preaching. Later, when Moody&rsquo;s meeting place burned down in a fire and a new one was built, Moorehouse came to preach. When he got to the podium, he said, &ldquo;The old place of meeting has been burned, but the old topic cannot be burned. It is still John 3:16.&rdquo; Moorehouse knew God&rsquo;s love and God&rsquo;s specific commission.</p>
<p>As serving ones of the Lord, we should give our all to the Lord and be dealt with to such an extent that we do a specific work. There should be something in us that is God-commissioned and specific. Ordinary works are dispensable, and those who do ordinary works likewise are dispensable. The issue of an ordinary work is always limited. We must work to such an extent that we become indispensable. We should not say this out of pride but because it is a fact. If Moorehouse had not gone to Chicago, God&rsquo;s love would not have been known to such an extent. Without Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis&rsquo;s being raised up, the depths of the cross would not have been known to such an extent. In the New Testament John&rsquo;s writings have a focus, and Paul&rsquo;s Epistles have a focus. Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles have a specific focus. We must learn to do a specific work.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING STRICT PERSONS</h2>
<p>We also need to be strict persons. Those who do an ordinary work are not strict persons; only rigorous persons can do a specific work. I feel that many of us are not strict enough. From our way of living and working, I can tell that we are not strict. If we learn to be strict and genuine, we will focus on the central items. It is not enough to speak on prayer in one place, persuading and moving many, and then speak on prayer in another place. We need to be willing to ask the Lord, &ldquo;Do You want me to speak this?&rdquo; This is being strict. It is easy to speak the same thing everywhere and not be strict. The Lord&rsquo;s serving ones must be strict. Loose persons cannot do a strict work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING IN THE LIGHT WE HAVE SEEN</h2>
<p>We must learn to live in the light of the truth that we have seen. What we see and live in is our specific work. We do not need to make a special effort to be specific; the truth that we see will become our specific work. If we see the cross, we will live in the cross, and the message of the cross will be our center. If we see the matter of abiding in the Lord, we will have fellowship with the Lord, and it will become our specific work.</p>
<p>This touches the matter of ministry. Our ministry is something that God has constituted into us. If we have seen the matter of breaking and have even accepted the breaking in our experience, this matter will be constituted into us to become the content of our ministry and the center of our work. Then, wherever we go, we will be able to speak about it because we have lived in, passed through, and experienced the truth that we have seen. Thus, our living and our experience will become the center of our work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING NARROW</h2>
<p>Even though our work may be specific and according to the central view, it cannot be narrow. For example, a brother may focus on the matter of being broken, but he cannot speak on this to everyone indiscriminately; this is to be narrow. We must see that there is a line in the work. For example, we may have learned the lesson of being broken over the years, but if we are sent to Hualien, the saints may not have progressed even to the point of dealing with sins, consecrating themselves, or fellowshipping with the Lord. Consequently, we cannot say, &ldquo;I have learned the matter of being broken; this is my specific work, the focus of my work, the goal of my work, and hence, I will speak on the matter of being broken.&rdquo; If the brothers and sisters do not have any understanding concerning being broken, we cannot speak of this matter first. We must first bring them to deal with their sins, to consecrate themselves, and to fellowship with the Lord. When these matters have been worked into them, we can bring them to the matter of being broken by the cross.</p>
<p>Consider the construction of a house. After the foundation of the house has been laid, pillars need to be erected to support the roof. At the site there may be roof tiles and piles of stone and wood. When a person who has a specific job of installing doors and windows arrives at the work site, he cannot install them if the pillars have not yet been erected. He can only install doors and windows once the pillars have been erected. Even if some workers cut the wood and others make neat piles of stone, the house will not be built. A building work involves more than cut wood and stones. All these items must be built together into a house in order for doors and windows to be installed. This illustrates the difference between knowing how to work and not knowing how to work.</p>
<p>Likewise, it is not possible for sisters to make a shirt if one sister sews a few stitches in one place and another sews a few stitches in another place. A knowledgeable sister, however, will know what needs to be done and even the order in which it should be done. We must see the way of the work and the stages of the work; the work has stages.</p>
<p>We must have a blueprint for the work in order to serve the Lord. When we compare the church in which we serve with the blueprint, we will see the building material that is present and the building material that is lacking. I hope that all the brothers and sisters who are consecrated to serve the Lord will pursue this point seriously. Otherwise, we will only do a dispensable work that yields dispensable results.</p>
<p>The first time I went to Manila, a well-known pastor would come to talk with me. Later, someone advised me, saying, &ldquo;Brother Lee, it would be good if you go to see that pastor and repay his visit,&rdquo; but I refused. I did not feel that I had received help from him, and I did not feel that I could help him. This was not a matter of pride but of having no burden to merely be involved in the reciprocation of outward civility. The reciprocation of civility may be associated with good manners, but it is akin to touching leprosy in a garment (Lev. 13:47). I also felt that the Lord&rsquo;s burden in leading me to Manila had a specific goal according to a clear blueprint, which did not involve the mere reciprocation of outward civility. The Lord&rsquo;s requirement was that I be busy with His work every day. How could I spare the time for the mere reciprocation of civility?</p>
<p>Later, others asked, &ldquo;Brother Lee, if the denominations invited you to speak, would you go?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Whether I should go or not go is not the issue. I was not sent to do such things. If I were an idle person, I would speak wherever people wanted me to speak, but I must work according to the Lord&rsquo;s commission. At work we have specific responsibilities. If someone came to you and said, &lsquo;My toilet needs to be cleaned. Would you come to my house and clean it?&rsquo; you would certainly reply, &lsquo;In my work, I need to do many things. I do not have extra time.&rsquo; Hence, it is not a matter of going or not going. The Lord&rsquo;s commission to me keeps me busy from morning to evening. How can I do other things?&rdquo; I do not criticize others for doing these things, but this is not my commission, my burden. God has sent me, and I am clear concerning what He wants me to do. Since we are consecrated to serving the Lord, we must be delivered from doing a dispensable work; otherwise, our time will be wasted.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BLUEPRINT AND ITS EXECUTION</h2>
<p><em>Question: The great apostles have a blueprint; do small apostles have a blueprint as well?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Some people believe that great apostles have a blueprint, but small apostles do not. We cannot find such a thought in the Bible. The most we can say is that some apostles, such as Paul, received a blueprint directly from God, but other apostles, such as Timothy, received the same blueprint from Paul. Although Timothy was such an apostle, he did not work blindly. Paul told Timothy what kind of persons could be elders and what kind of persons could be deacons; this was a blueprint that Paul gave to Timothy. Timothy then perfected people in their function as elders and deacons; he did not work randomly.</p>
<p>In response to the situation in China thirty to forty years ago, a saying became common: &ldquo;Serving ones do not receive wages from people.&rdquo; Once this word was sounded out, many saw an opportunity to become freelance preachers, but they did dispensable works. It was easy for them to read magazines and books and preach a little here and a little there. If you asked them, &ldquo;What do you do from the beginning of the year to the end of the year?&rdquo; they would say, &ldquo;I am a preacher.&rdquo; If you asked, &ldquo;Where do you bring your saved ones?&rdquo; they would say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s business, not my business.&rdquo; The apostle Paul, however, was not so indifferent. He said, &ldquo;As a wise master builder I have laid a foundation&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:10). He knew how to build. He said also, &ldquo;I therefore run in this way, not as though without a clear aim; I box in this way, not as though beating the air&rdquo; (9:26).</p>
<p>We need to cast aside any &ldquo;freelance&rdquo; work and even trample it under our feet. We should not take such a way or do such a work. The Lord has opened our eyes to see the vision, the blueprint, and we need to do what God wants us to do according to the blueprint. We should work according to the blueprint, watchfully and with fear and trembling, so that God can fulfill His purpose in us.</p>
<p><em>Question: If a brother seems to have a blueprint yet cannot get through in his work because of his flesh, is there a problem with his blueprint or his experience?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Knowing the blueprint is not a simple matter. It is quite a problem if the blueprint is incorrect; hence, it is best for brothers and sisters not to establish a blueprint on their own but with other co-workers. Even if the blueprint is correct, however, the method to carry it out may not be correct. We must be willing to study the situation. Finally, if we bring in the flesh, we will not accomplish anything no matter what we do. We are finished if we work by the flesh because the Holy Spirit has no relationship with the flesh. We all must learn to reject the flesh once we touch the Lord&rsquo;s work; dealing with the flesh is a prerequisite to all work.</p></body></html>
