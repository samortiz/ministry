   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 58 Date:September 13, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER I. S.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a poor family, and at one time I was a street hawker.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While I was on the street one day someone invited me into a little chapel to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I heard that Jesus loves sinners, I became very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although the world does not love me, Jesus loves me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time I dared not accept the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One or two years later, when I was fifteen years old, I heard the gospel again and I raised my hand to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After I became a Christian, my life was greatly changed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I was delivered from the sins of foul language, gambling, and stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I went with others to preach the gospel and served as a janitor of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Later through the recommendation of an elderly Baptist pastor, I joined the Far East Christian and Missionary Alliance Seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A year later I graduated and became a leader and a trumpet player in an evangelistic band.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I became proud.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once, while preaching near an army school, I was taken into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I had been to prison before, but this was the first time I went into prison for the sake of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I was not afraid at all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The prison in the countryside, however, was a scandal; it was a taste of hell.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I went into prison with my Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Others thought that I was a spy, but I continued to preach the gospel in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Soon over ten people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I was released from prison, the inmates were sad to see me go and shed tears for me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Soon after, I became a lieutenant officer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I was even promoted three times within a year.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This stirred up my pride again, and I lapsed into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I knew that the Lord was disciplining me, and eventually I repented in tears and prayed for the Lord's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Later I read books published by the Shanghai Gospel Book Room and began to understand the truth of salvation and the truth concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the war broke out, I moved inland and took up a menial job.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During those few years I learned many lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Later I became greedy and went into business.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I fell into sin once again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was the Lord's disciplining hand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I confessed to the Lord with tears for a few hours and asked Him for mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first problem with our brother is that much of his outward life has been spent in falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the fruit of his inward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No outward change or cover-up in conduct will do him any good.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Your prayers have all been said before men, not before God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our life before men can never replace our life before God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The only kind of spiritual life that counts is what is conducted in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All spiritual things spring from within.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Figs cannot be attached to a vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Your problem is not over yet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Your speaking at the beginning of your testimony was very much under the control of your will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By the time you finished a third of your speaking, your real testimony finally came out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When a man first opens his mouth, he can somewhat control himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the more he speaks, the more his self is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You are making a spiritual performance in the presence of men.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am not condemning you alone; many people are like you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They live their Christian life before men.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should never try to be better before men than before God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I would rather be misunderstood by men than have any pretense before God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I should be spiritual before God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But many people pray and live their lives before men.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is something that we should deal with at the present moment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have to be a broken man before God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should never worry about how we look before men.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our condition before God should always be stronger than our condition before men.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The meal offering in Leviticus 2 is a type of the fineness of Christ's humanity on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every grain of wheat has to be finely ground before it can become flour.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When Christ was on earth, His inward and outward being, His character and feelings, were like fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The first problem with our brother is that he has, in a manner of speaking, been "plucked from the street."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His second problem relates to his character.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His emotion is not fine and tender; it is not like fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>His disposition is like that of Peter in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All the apostles, including Peter, however, grew out of their coarse feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we come to the book of Acts, we find that their feelings had all become tender.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we read Peter's Epistles, we find that his feelings were very tender.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The rawness and coarseness went away after the kneading and the grinding.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whatever has not been ground remains coarse and uneven and cannot be part of the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our brother will only become useful after he passes through God's fine grinding through the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If our brother truly sees himself, he will fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He said that he had wept and cried much in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But I have to say a seemingly cruel word to him according to the standing that I have been given here: Your tears are not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You have to shed many more tears than you have done.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You have to pass through two pieces of grinding stones.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I believe the Lord will be gracious and merciful to those who give themselves to the grindstones.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have to realize that only those who have fine feelings before God can serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>With regards to the spirit, our brother has to realize that his outer man must be broken before his spirit can gradually be released.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have witnessed something of a start in our brother, and this is a good sign.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, he needs more breaking with regard to the things he built up in the past his pretensions and his coarse feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Only then will he be able to run on the spiritual pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I hope that our brother will not seek man's approval in any spiritual things but only seek the Lord's approval.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When difficulties come, he should not circumvent them.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He should learn to yield to the difficulties and to be ground into powder.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Our brother needs many make-up lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Our work must be far from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We should never allow ourselves to be dragged into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It seems that the Lord has done some work in you in the most recent part of his journey.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You should not hinder the Lord in any way, but should humble yourself under His hand and allow Him to give you a fundamental breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you do, you will have a way to go on in the Lord's service.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>You will become useful as you learn to allow the Lord to tear you down completely through all the trials.</S>
