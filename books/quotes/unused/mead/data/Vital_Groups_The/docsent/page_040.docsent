   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this message we do not want to stress the Lord's cherishing us but our cherishing others.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The model of Jesus as the Son of Man cherishing people needs to be reproduced in us so that we also will cherish others in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I. THE HUMANITY OF JESUS IS HIS HUMAN LIFE IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we go out to contact people, we must be persons living a human life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In John 11:25 the Lord told Martha, "I am the resurrection."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Martha complained to the Lord that if He had come sooner, her brother would not have died.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the Lord revealed that resurrection is not a matter of time but a matter of His person, because He is the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The main vision of Jesus in the four Gospels, especially in the Synoptic Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, is that He lived a life that was human but in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jesus was not a man living a natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He always put His humanity aside.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was in His humanity, yet He did not live a life of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every day while He was on the earth, Jesus was in the flesh, but that flesh was in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Apparently, He was a Nazarene, a natural Galilean.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was in that flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But His living was in a humanity in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Nathanael came to Jesus, Jesus said something to him in resurrection: "Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you" John 1:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He saw Nathanael under that tree far away because of His divinity with the divine ability, but that divine ability was in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Divinity is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Resurrection is a divine person, God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only God is the resurrection that can stand against death, overcome death, enter into death, have a tour of death, and come out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The One who created Adam came to be a man and lived a human life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He denied His natural humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He never did anything out of Himself John 5:19, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did everything in Himself but not of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We also should not do anything in our natural life but in Christ's resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jesus was living and walking on this earth in His flesh, but He rejected this flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He rejected His natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Jesus was twelve years old, His parents took Him to Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When they were returning from Jerusalem, they did not find Him, so they went back to search for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When they found Him in the temple, His mother said to Him, "Child, why have You treated us like this?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Behold, Your father and I, being greatly distressed, have been seeking You."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He responded, "Why is it that you were seeking Me?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Did you not know that I must be in the things of My Father?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Luke 2:48-49 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In His humanity He was the son of His parents, but in His divinity He was the Son of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This shows that He rejected His natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was living as a young boy in His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In other words, He was not living by His natural man, born of Mary; He was living by His life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His cherishing others to charm and attract them was not in His natural humanity, but in His humanity in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some people are charming, attractive, and cherishing in their natural humanity by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When such a person walks into a room, the atmosphere changes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A charming person must be very warm, not cold.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those who are charming in their natural humanity, however, are not real.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, they are performers, like actors in a theater.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When you get close to a charming man, you will find out that he actually is not that charming.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was born with a mask.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the mask is taken away, he is different.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To cherish people in our natural humanity is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why we must cherish people in the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord's charming and cherishing are not natural but are by His resurrection life in humanity.</S>
