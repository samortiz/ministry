   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE TOWARDS MONEY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What should be the attitude of a Christian worker, a servant of God, towards money?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is quite a serious question, and unless a worker has a definite breakthrough in this matter, he cannot work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a worker has a problem towards money, he cannot go very far.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A worker finds frequent occasions to touch money.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is at stake, therefore, is a very fundamental question.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mammon stands in opposition to God, and we should reject its influence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the proper Christian view towards money.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must be on the alert lest we come under its power.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No worker who is bound by the power of mammon can persuade others to be freed from its power.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not possible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are bound and controlled by mammon, it will be impossible for us to help the brothers and sisters to be free of its control and bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A worker should hate laziness, and he should also loathe the power of mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, he will be useless in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Money is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us look at a few things related to money.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>ONE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the first place, let us note the relationship between money and a worker's pathway and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Old Testament there is the history of Balaam, and in the New Testament there is the way and teaching of Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Balaam is referred to in 2 Peter, Jude, and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This shows us the amount of attention God pays to Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Balaam was a prophet who worked for profit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In other words, he commercialized the prophetic ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was not ignorant of his position.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was fully aware of it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He also was not ignorant of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Balak, the king of Moab, was set to destroy the people of God, Balaam was fully aware that God's people should not be cursed; he knew that they were a people blessed by Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But because he coveted Balak's promise, a promise to satisfy all of his wants, he went to God again and again to ask for permission.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, God granted him the permission.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people erroneously think that this episode is an example of waiting on God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a matter of fact, Balaam would never have inquired of God at all had it not been for Balak's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He knew quite well that such a trip was not according to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's thought was of blessing and gracious care; His thought was not of cursing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But Balaam inquired of God again and again because he had received a promise from Balak.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later, God told him to go.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But it was not God's will for him to go; it was God's permission for him to go.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To God, if Balak's offer could generate so much prayer in Balaam, He would simply tell Balaam to go.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Balaam undoubtedly was a prophet, but he allowed money to affect his pathway and lead him far astray.</S>
