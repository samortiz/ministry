   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING A START OF FRUIT-BEARING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all must realize that we have been appointed to go forth and bear fruit, so we should all have a start.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We were appointed with a purpose and a command that we should go forth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To go forth is to have a start.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord has set us in the race, so we have to run.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we never have a start, nothing will change; we will remain in barrenness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must hate our barrenness and endeavor to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We were chosen for the start of fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all need a start.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then after being chosen and after starting, we need to be discipled.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to go out, but not in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Being natural even a little bit can kill our purpose and annul our effectiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all must have a spirit to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Anything that is old or natural must be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to be discipled.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition, we need a lot of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we pray, we touch the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This will change us, disciple us, and cross us out.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only the Lord Spirit can change us, so we must have adequate prayer for us to be discipled.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We also need to ask the Father in the Lord's name for the giving of life to produce the remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all need to take Paul as our pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1 Corinthians 9:16 Paul said, "For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There must be a necessity laid upon us to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not preach the gospel, we will suffer woe; if we preach the gospel, a reward is waiting for us v. 17 . If we love the Lord and His recovery, we must have a new beginning in fulfilling our New Testament priesthood of the gospel to go and visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then there is much possibility that we could bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After this, we must exercise further to be discipled so that our fruit will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you are faithful to the Lord and faithful to go out once a week for forty-eight weeks in a year, I believe you can baptize five to ten.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Out of these, probably four to six will remain, yet not all of the remaining fruit will be brought to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It may be that only two of them will be brought into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The others will simply be saved without coming into the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By this we can see that if we are faithful, we will be able to gain a good number for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I do not expect that all the saints meeting with us will go out to visit people, but I do expect that one-third of the saints in each locality will go out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the Lord stirs up one-third of the saints to preach the gospel, He will gain a good percentage of increase every year.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That will stir up all the saints' interest in the church life, and the church will have a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To accomplish this, we all have to endeavor to rise up to fight against our barrenness.</S>
