   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE CHURCH LIFE IS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE REAL COMMUNAL LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 12:10; John 13:34-35; 15:16-17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous chapters we saw three things: first, man is the meaning of the universe; second, Christ is the meaning of human life; third, the church is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now in this chapter our burden is to see the real communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE GOD-CREATED DESIRE TO HAVE A COMMUNAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today not only in the United States but also in many countries on this earth, the young people are desiring to have some kind of communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This desire comes out of our natural makeup.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In our natural makeup, in our natural life, there is a kind of desire to have a community where we may live together with others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Suppose you have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have education, money, the best house, and the best car.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You have obtained the best of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet if you were told to go up to the top of a high mountain and live there by yourself, would you do it?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>None of us would do it because, even though we may have the best things, we would be too lonely by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We human beings need to be in a community.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, this desire to have a communal life is something in our makeup.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God created man in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Genesis 1:26 God first said, "Let us make man," and then He said, "Let them have dominion."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man is singular, but them, the pronoun for man, is plural.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Did God make one man or many men?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>People think it is easy to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yes, on the one hand, the Bible is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But on the other hand, it is really hard for people to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why did God use the singular noun man and then the plural pronoun them?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Did He make one man or many men?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The answer is: God made many men in one man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Or you can say that God made one man with many men.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This simply means that in God's intention, man is corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God did not create an Adam, then an Abraham, then a David, etc. God created a corporate man one man with all men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In God's intention, what He did was a corporate thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So we all have to realize that the desire to have a communal life was something created in the human nature by God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every human being in his human nature has a desire to live with others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Consider the children in your neighborhood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you try to confine each one of them in their houses, you will bring a great suffering to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They like to go out to make friends.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They like to be in a community.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God created man with a nature and a desire to have a communal life as a preparation for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church life is a communal life, a corporate life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church life is a life of a proper community.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let me use a little illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many times you feel thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is thirst?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thirst is a feeling caused by a desire for a drink.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose you do not have a desire for any drink, yet I ask you to drink; that would be a punishment to you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You will suffer a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But since God created in you a desire to drink so that you have such a thirst, you will be happy to drink without anyone forcing you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Likewise, in God's creation God created us with a desire for a communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Due to the fall, however, this communal life was spoiled and damaged when the human race came to the time of Babel Gen 11:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Babel means confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At Babel many different languages came in and caused the human race to be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Consequently, there came in the hatred, the enmity, between different peoples with different languages.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the New Testament the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption to bring people back to God's original purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Acts 2 tells us that on the day of Pentecost all the different people of different languages became one vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>5-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They were brought back to the original state of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This was not just a recovery but a re-creation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Ephesians 2:15-16 tells us that Christ on the cross abolished all the ordinances and slew the enmity among people for the purpose of creating a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Bible tells us that first God created one man, and then Christ created a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the Bible there are two creations: the old creation of God and the new creation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In His old creation God created a man; in His new creation Christ created a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Brothers and sisters, we have to realize that in the new man created by Christ we have something in common.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>First, in the new man we have a common life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Christ we all have the same life, and with this common life we have a common nature and a common desire.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After we are saved, immediately within us there is a desire to contact some genuine Christians for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the desire for a community, a communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The church life is the real communal life.</S>
