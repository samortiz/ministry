   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 20:22 says, "He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the Spirit expected in John 7:39 and promised in John 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; 16:7-8, 13.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In John 7 the Spirit the disciples were to receive was not yet because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But on the day of His resurrection the Lord came to the disciples by night, breathed into them, and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John 7 the Spirit was not yet, but in John 20 the Spirit was present because Jesus had been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was glorified in His resurrection; hence, the compound Spirit had come into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord's breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This fulfillment differs from Acts 2:1-4, which was the fulfillment of the Father's promise in Luke 24:49.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There the Spirit as a rushing mighty wind came as power upon the disciples for their work Acts 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here, the Spirit as the breath was breathed as life into the disciples for their life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the Lord imparted Himself as life and everything into them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, all that He had spoken in chapters fourteen through sixteen could be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just as falling into the ground to die and growing out of the ground transforms a grain of wheat into another form, new and living, so the death and resurrection of the Lord transfigured Him from the flesh into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the last Adam in the flesh, He became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 through the process of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As He is the embodiment of the Father, so the Spirit is the realization, the reality, of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is as the Spirit that He was breathed into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is as the Spirit that He is received into His believers and flows out of them as rivers of living water John 7:38-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is as the Spirit that through His death and resurrection He came back to the disciples, entered into them as their Comforter, and began to abide in them John 14:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is as the Spirit that He can live in the disciples and they can live by Him and with Him John 14:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is as the Spirit that He can abide in the disciples and they can abide in Him John 14:20; 15:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is as the Spirit that He can come with the Father to His lover and make an abode with him John 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is as the Spirit that He can make all that He is and all He has to be fully realized by the disciples John 16:13-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is as the Spirit that He came to meet with His brothers as the church to declare the Father's name to them and to praise Him in their midst Heb 2:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is as the Spirit that He can send His disciples with His commission, with Himself as life and everything to them, in the same way the Father sent Him John 20:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, they are qualified to represent Him with His authority in the fellowship of His Body John 20:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is as the Spirit that Christ does everything today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the all-inclusive Spirit, He is doing everything with us and to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's economy is entirely involved with this all-inclusive Spirit, who is the compound ointment whose anointing we must experience today.</S>
