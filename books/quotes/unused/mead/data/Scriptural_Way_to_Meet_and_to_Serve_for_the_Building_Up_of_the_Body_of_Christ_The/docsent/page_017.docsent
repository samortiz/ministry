   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RELIGIOUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The natural way of meeting and serving is also religious.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I was in Jerusalem in 1958, and I saw the Muslims worshipping at the great mosque built on the site of the old temple.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They seemed so godly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They prostrated themselves on the ground and remained there for awhile.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They were very silent.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many were worshipping God in that way in orderly rows.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because that mosque was a holy place to them, they were required to take off their shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Their worship was absolutely natural.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as it is natural, it is also religious.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No Spirit, no life, no experience of Christ, no salvation, no redemption, and no blood are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such natural, religious worship is highly appraised by the Muslims.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many Christians today are still taking the natural way to worship God religiously.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I first came to minister in the United States in 1962, my messages were focused on the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some among us who had been missionaries and pastors and were theological school graduates thanked me for what I shared with them concerning the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They said that they never knew that they had a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No one had ever told them that they had a human spirit for the purpose of worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For worshipping God we have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Jesus said that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship in spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before coming into the Lord s recovery, many of us did not know that we had a human spirit, an organ created by God for His worship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do not know that we have a spirit, how can we worship God properly?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we want to walk, we must know that we have two feet with two legs with which to practice walking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the beginning of my ministry in the United States, I also stressed the worship of God in a proper way by the exercise of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many came to me and said that they did not know how to exercise their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I asked them how they exercised their legs, and they said by walking, running, and jumping.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then I told them that to exercise our spirit we need to pray and call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can exercise our spirit by calling, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Due to my age, I cannot run too fast or jump too high, but I can exercise by walking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I try to walk every day for an hour, and this exercise is very healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In like manner, it is not necessary for us to call O Lord Jesus in a thunderous way to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can say, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Lord, I love Your church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Lord, I love to contact You.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I love to dwell on Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I love to enjoy You, and I want to enjoy You right now.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After praying by calling on the Lord for twenty minutes, we will have a strong spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we would pray for a longer time every day, our spirit would be very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The unique way to exercise your spirit, to make your spirit so living and strong, is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nothing can replace your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you are weak in your spirit, it is because you are short of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some may feel that they do not know how to pray or what to pray for.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you do not know how to pray, just say, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you say O Lord Jesus twenty times, the Lord will have a way to set you on fire, to make you burning in spirit Rom 12:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>GRADUALLY PRACTICING THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>UNTIL IT IS FULLY ABLE TO REPLACE THE OLD WAY</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After reading the fellowship in this book, a brother should not tell the elders in his locality to immediately stop the kind of meeting where one speaks and the rest listen and establish a meeting in which everybody speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It would be correct for the elders to respond, Dear brother, if we stop that kind of meeting, we will not know how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You have to listen to your elders in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not go too fast.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You have to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Go along with the elders, but try to help the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The elders in the churches want to practice the new way, but they need some time to pick up the new way themselves and to learn how to help the saints practice the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I have been in Taipei for the last three years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was not until recently that we directed the church in Taipei into the full practice of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We realized that we had to help all the saints to practice the new way until they reached a certain level where the new way could fully replace the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When this level was reached, we dropped the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>While you are learning a new way of cooking, you will still not fully know how to cook in this new way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you stop your old way of cooking at this juncture, the people for whom you cook will go hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At this time the churches should keep the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The old way is still needed for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Use the old way to serve the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Meanwhile, the leading ones should do their best to teach, to train, and to help all the saints to practice the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Gradually they will learn the new way to the extent that they will have something to replace the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>That will be the time for the church to practice the new way in full.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One local church closed the meeting hall on the Lord s Day morning and sent the saints to meet in small groups in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Most of the saints sat in these small groups without knowing what to say or do.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I fellowshipped with the leading brothers to let the saints come back to the hall.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is not easy to change an old habit and to replace it with something new.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This takes time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A transitory period of three or more years may be needed for the churches to fully enter into the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We all have to exercise our wisdom and patience with the church in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Do not impose something on others who have not yet practiced the truth concerning the scriptural way to meet and to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need to pray for the full recovery of 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The leading ones need to do their best to help the church by teaching and training the saints so that they can be fully brought into the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The old way is the traditional way, the natural way, and the Gentile way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The new way is biblical, and this way is a way of life and a way in the spirit.</S>
