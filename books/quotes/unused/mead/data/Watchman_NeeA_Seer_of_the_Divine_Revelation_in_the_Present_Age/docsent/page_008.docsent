   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>His Personal Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Given at Kulangsu, Fukien, October 18, 1936</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1923 seven of us worked together as co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Two of us took the lead, a co-worker who was five years my senior and myself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We had a co-workers' meeting every Friday in which the other five were often forced to listen to the arguing between the leading two.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We were all young then, and each had his own way of thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I often charged the elder co-worker with being wrong, and vice versa.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since my temperament had not been dealt with, I frequently lost my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today in 1936 I do sometimes laugh, but I seldom laughed at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In our controversies I admit that many times I was wrong, but he was also at times in the wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was easy for me to forgive my own faults, but not easy to forgive others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After having a dispute on Friday, I would go to Sister Barber on Saturday and accuse the other co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I would say, "I told that co-worker that he should act in a certain way, but he would not listen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You should speak to him."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sister Barber replied, "He is five years older than you; you should listen to him and obey him."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I answered, "Am I to listen to him whether he is reasonable or not?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She said, "Yes!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Scriptures say that the younger should obey the elder."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I replied, "I cannot possibly do this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A Christian should act according to reason."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She answered, "Whether there is reason or not, you need not care.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Scriptures say that the younger should obey the elder."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I was angry at heart that the Bible would say such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I wanted to give vent to my indignation, but I could not.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Each time following the controversy on Friday, I would go to her to state my grievances, but she would again quote the Scriptures, demanding that I obey the elder.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes I wept Friday evening after the dispute on Friday afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then I would go to Sister Barber the next day to state my grievances, hoping that she would vindicate me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But I would weep again after coming home Saturday evening.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I wished I had been born a few years earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In one controversy I had very good arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I felt that when I pointed them out, she would see how my co-worker was wrong and would support me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But she said, "Whether that co-worker is wrong or not is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>While you are accusing your brother before me, are you like one who is bearing the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Are you like a lamb?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When she questioned me in this way, I felt very ashamed and I could never forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>My speech and my attitude that day revealed that I was indeed not like one bearing the cross, nor like a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In such circumstances I learned to obey an elder co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In that year and a half, I learned the most precious lesson in my life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My head was filled with ideas, but God wanted to see me enter into spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In that year and a half, I came to realize what it is to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today in 1936 we have some fifty co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Had it not been for the lesson of obedience which I learned in that year and a half, I fear that I could not work together with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God put me in those circumstances that I might learn to be under the restraint of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In those eighteen months I had no opportunity to put forward my proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I could only weep and painfully suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But had it not been for this, I would never have realized how difficult it was for me to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God wanted to polish me and to remove all my sharp, projecting edges.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This has been a difficult thing to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How I thank and praise God, whose grace has brought me through!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now I must speak a word to the young co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you cannot stand the trials of the cross, you cannot become a useful instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is only the spirit of a lamb that God takes delight in: the gentleness, the humility, and the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Your ambition, lofty purpose, and ability are all useless in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I have been down this path and must often confess my shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All that pertains to me is in the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not a question of right or wrong; it is a question of whether or not one is like the bearer of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the church, right and wrong have no place; all that counts is bearing the cross and accepting its breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This produces the overflowing of God's life and accomplishes His will.</S>
