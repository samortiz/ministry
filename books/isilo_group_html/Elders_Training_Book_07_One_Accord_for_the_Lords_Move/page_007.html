<p>By going out to the small villages, they baptized one thousand nine hundred seventy-five within three weeks. The main reason for this is that they preached the gospel with a higher, richer word. The Word works. If a farmer sows nothing or even if he sows some poor seed, what kind of harvest can he expect? We need to speak the higher gospel, the richer word, which is very logical and philosophical and which meets the need of the modern, young people in this age.</p>
<p>The young people today, generally speaking, are very philosophical and scientific. The more scientific and logical people become, the more they want to know the meaning of human life. The age has changed and is much different from one hundred years ago. When the missionaries went to China, the people there were very conservative. They did not have much knowledge and only were concerned with ethics and with doing something to make a living. But today people all over the globe have become very educated and are very philosophical and logical. If you were only to tell them that they are sinners who are going to hell, they would not like to hear this. They are bored of this. Within them there is a desire to know the deeper truths, the real meaning of this universe, the real meaning and reason of human life.</p>
<p>When our brothers went out to preach the gospel in this way, it convinced people. Even those people in the villages had heard the preaching of Christianity before. To their opinion after hearing this preaching, they only considered this as another religion like Buddhism. To many of them the philosophical teachings of Confucius are much better than the mere preaching of going to heaven or hell. When our young people went to them, the people in the villages were so impressed that they were college graduates. They would surely listen to someone coming to their home who had graduated from the top university in Taiwan. These full-timers going to the villages had an impact.</p>
<p>Today the United States is the top country on this earth. The young people today on the campuses are seeking more knowledge concerning human life and the reality of the universe, yet superficial knowledge will not fill up the void within them. They would like to know the truth of the universe, the real meaning, the real significance, of human life. We have what they need. We have a proper translation of the New Testament with notes that open up the text, many booklets for distribution and many truths to speak. These truths have to be our constitution. We have to be saturated and soaked with all these divine realities. Then we need to go out to speak with our Recovery Version and with our pockets or handbags full of the rainbow booklets, which contain a slightly edited version of the Life-study Messages. When you are speaking the high gospel to someone, after a certain point give them a booklet. This really means something. Thank the Lord that He has given us a rich deposit of His Word. The early believers went out not only with the Spirit, but even the more with the Word. The Spirit by Himself is too abstract. We can minister the Spirit to others, but we cannot present the Spirit. What we can present in a thorough way is the Word.</p>
<p>One particular brother told me that he recently met a group of Jewish young people who are seeking the truth. I told this brother that if he is going to convince these Jewish young people, he must know how to use the Old Testament because they treasure it to the uttermost. They boast of the Old Testament even though they may know very little about it. The best way to catch them is to use their treasure. First open to Genesis 12 and read to them God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham that in his seed all the nations of the earth would be blessed (v. 3; cf. Gen. 22:18). Ask them who this seed is in whom all the nations of the earth would be blessed. When you open up the Bible in this way they will be shocked. Then you need to give them an interpretation that this seed of Abraham is Christ. Read a portion of Matthew 1 to them showing them the ancestors of Jesus Christ: &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham. Abraham begot Isaac; and Isaac begot Jacob&rdquo; (vv. 1-2a). Then open to Galatians 3 and show them that this Christ is the very One in whom the entire world is blessed (vv. 14, 16). If this brother were to share the truth with these Jewish young people in this way week after week for a period of time, they would be convinced. We do not need to argue with anyone; just open up the holy Word to them. The most profitable way to convince people is to use the holy Word.</p>
<p>Nearly every nation on this earth today promotes their people being educated. All the educated people know that there is a unique and famous book called the Holy Bible. Every philosophical and logical person would like to know this book. They would even like to know this book as literature. If a person does not know something about the Bible, he may be considered as backward. I believe that once one gets educated there is a desire in his heart to know the Bible. If you go to a thoughtful, educated person and open up some crucial verses to them to show them what this book teaches, he would be happy to hear you. You should go to them with prayer and with the Spirit to present the Word. Then the Word will be living. Because we go with prayer, the Spirit, and the Word, something will surely happen.</p>
<p>Many thoughtful persons would like to know something about the book of Revelation because they are curious. If you cannot share with them from this book, you will lose their interest. After reading the first verse of the New Testament, a thoughtful person may ask you the significance of &ldquo;the book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham&rdquo; (Matt. 1:1). This question is a real testing. If you say that you do not know, you cannot capture this person. Many curious questions would be asked of you when you go to contact logical people, so you must be prepared by having a deposit of the rich Word in your being. Your preaching of the high gospel will be very convincing and will gain the respect, the regard, of the one to whom you are speaking. Our goal, though, is not merely to get regard from people. We want to sow the Word into people&rsquo;s minds and hearts and eventually this Word will be used by the Holy Spirit to get into their spirit to regenerate them. This is why it is altogether worthwhile for us to study the Word.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 07: One Accord for the Lord's Move &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
