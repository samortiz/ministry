<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THOUGHTS</h2><p>Brother Kaung, is there something that you want to say?</p><p>Brother Kaung: I do have something to say. But you do not have to be limited to my question. You can cover as wide a scope as possible in your answer. First, there are many contradictions in my personal life. On the one hand, I do not believe I am very active in my thoughts. On the other hand, I do think quite much. Now I am learning to read the Bible continuously without trying to think too much. Second, I feel that I am not that much on fire for the work.</p><p>Watchman Nee: There is a big difference between accepting and not accepting God's breaking. Human power is limited. A man does not have an unlimited capacity to think. Sometimes your thinking can bring you to a dead end; you hit the wall and do not know how to go on. The reason you feel this way is that you have exhausted your mental energy without realizing it. If a man spends too much time on one thing, he will not have time to think about other things. This is the reason we repeatedly emphasize the need for the outer man to be broken.</p><p>Often the problem with thoughts is not in the mind but in the heart. This is because the heart controls the mind. Proverbs 4:23 says, "Keep your heart with all vigilance,/For from it are the issues of life." We can say that our heart represents our very self. A man's thoughts are directed by his heart. When we say that a man has a problem with his thoughts, we are actually saying that he has a problem with his heart. A bad heart is the cause of sickness in the mind. It does not help to deal with the thoughts alone; this will only take care of the symptom. The basic solution is to deal with the root. Once the heart is right before God, the thoughts are right.</p><p>At the time of our regeneration, we were given a new heart and a new spirit by God. The new heart gives us a new life and new inclination to serve God. But through neglect, our heart sometimes becomes evil again; it loses its purity before the Lord. Our heart controls our mind. When the heart goes astray, the thoughts follow.</p><p>In Matthew 12:34 the Lord Jesus said, "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks." Rash words are unhealthy, but in reality it is not the words themselves that are unhealthy; rather, it is the heart that is sick. Some sisters realize that their words are not right; they try to deal with their words. But it is not enough for one to merely hate his or her own words. It is useless to try to deal with words per se. Such a sister must be willing to deal with her heart. Once her heart is dealt with, the problem with her speaking and her words will go away. The same can be said about our thoughts. A little leaf can block the ray of the sun. A little sin can cover up God's light and turn the heart astray. Once the sin of the heart is dealt with, everything will fall into place. The mind is controlled by the heart. It is impossible for the heart to be in one condition and the mind to be thinking about something different.</p><p>After one's heart has been dealt with, he has to learn to control his thoughts. A servant of God must have a high power of concentration. He cannot waste his thoughts carelessly. Miss M. E. Barber once said, "When Satan takes over our thought life, he takes over our whole life." There is a limit to the amount of mental energy we can expend. If we allow our thoughts to wander and roam unchecked, we will find that we cannot focus our mind when we are called to serve in prayer. Satan will seize the opportunity to inject fiery darts into our mind through the outward events. We will fall into Satan's hand and be defeated. If our outer man is not broken, we will always react to outward stimuli. We will feel that thoughts are always frustrating us and that we are always being drained away. When we try to serve as a minister of the word, we will find our thoughts failing us. We will fail not because we have too much to say and do not know how to say it. We will fail because our thoughts are too poor. We should not think that our problem is that we are not smart enough. The real reason is that our outer man is not broken and our mind is not under the control of the spirit.</p><p>After we bring our thoughts into focus, there is still a need to get into the thoughts of God's Word. The breaking of the outer man enables us not only to focus our thoughts but also to enter into the burden of the Spirit. If we have not touched the burden of the Spirit, all our thoughts summoned together will not qualify us to be used by the Spirit. Once the outer man is broken, there is no more self activity or subjective thoughts. Then we can touch the burden in the Spirit, and the life and power contained in God's Word will flow out through our speaking.</p>
